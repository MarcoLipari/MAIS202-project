I just find it moronic the 0 tolerance they teach people because it tells people that after drinking you have no responsibility for your actions which you very much do. It takes the blame from an individual being irresponsible and places the blame on an action. You can blame drinking and driving on everyone that does it or you can come back down to reality and realize the person driving at that point is who is to blame not what he ate or drank.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","100% of my personal shooting is film, ever since I got hooked into photography 5+ years ago.  For school, I made it through 95% of all my photo classes shooting entirely film, occasionally some digital was shot if the deadline was up and I botched my film shots.  I also do alternative processes

I prefer film because I love the workmanship involved.  From start to finish I'm involved in the entire process.  When I complete and frame a print, I admire it, akin to what I think a woodworker would do.    

I actually find digital much harder and I hate, no loathe, when a digital camera tells me I can't do something (e.g. autofocus doesn't work, the exposure isn't correct, etc).  Also it seems that because a vast majority of digital photographers overprocess their work, you have to spend a lot more time editing digital to make it appealing compared to another digital print.  Film gets the advantage of the inherit characteristics of the particular film you shot, the paper it was printed on, or the chemical process you used.    

I shoot with a 4x5 Speed Graphic, Zero Image 4x5 Pinhole, Pentax 6x7, Pentax Spotmatic (35mm), and just recently picked up a Agfa 5x7 Field Camera","1356998405"

Still maybe there is a way to do more fine scaled typing of what kind of IO function can do?

Lot (most?) of the programs do IO.
I would think that such feature (where IO exactly goes in/out) would be kind very usefull.

I really would like to know from function definition: this function writes only to log, this other function writes to result file, other-other function writes to stdout.
But, as I understand now, it is possible only to say if function at all writes to some file  or not. And all functions writing to files seem exatly the same in this respect (or do they not??)

As for advice, when you talk with him about his drinking, realize that bargains and ultimatums won't work.  They may for a short time but the resentments will come back.  I gave my wife many ultimatums and she'd stop for a while.  Then when she would start again (and she always would because she stopped for me, not her) it would be worse.  

I'd think, ""If she really loved me, she'd stop.""  I never recognized the disease for what it is.  A disease.  It's like saying, ""If you love me, you'll stop having cancer.""  This isn't to excuse it.  The alcoholic doesn't have a choice in the fact that they are an alcoholic.  They have **ALL** the choice in treating it.  When I finally talked to my wife, and kept the focus on me - *I feel, I worry, I'm scared.* I could tell her what I was experiencing without pointing any fingers, and I think she listened.  

In my case, I was extremely lucky, she entered recovery shortly after and has been in recovery ever since.  We both have.  But I have to realize thet her recovery is her own and may or may not last.  We measure recovery in time since the last drink, but it probably ought to be measured in time to the next one.  

We have to remember that we can find serenety whether the alcoholic is drinking or not by accepting that we can't control whether they do or not.  

I hope that youreach out to your higher power, work the serenety prayer, and find some peace.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I'll give it a shot.

Some people quite enjoy the brutality of death metal. I, myself, enjoy a very large variety of metal. There are several types of metal, Death metal is just one of the ''Main Branches''. Death is typically consisting of blast beat drumming,guttural growling for vocals (This is a term we metalheads use typically in describing our music, ''vocals'' instead of ''singer''.) people who dont listen to a great deal of metal usually focus solely on the vocals and say 'they are just yelling', this is mostly because most other forms put 'the singer' at the front and center of the mix as most pop acts dont use instruments (ill behave and not get sidetracked on a rant here about current music.) However Metal generally isnt simplistic as just vocals, more likely the vocals are just a layer on top of 'the band'. The usual set up for a metal band consist of Vocals,1 or 2 guitars (lead and rythym; Sometimes duo lead),Bass,Drummer, Some genres have keyboards. More exotic set-ups such as Folk Metal and Symphonic Metal contain Full orchestras or smaller set ups of violins,horns etc. Onto the subject of Death metal, It is called a 'Extreme Metal' genre along with Black Metal,Doom Metal, and Thrash Metal. They are 'Harder,heavier' brands of metal that are not for everyone. However i will say that i firmly believe that theres a genre of metal out there for everyone. Gateway bands include: Black Sabbath,Iron Maiden,Judas Priest,Metallica (early),Led Zeppelin (debatable, some would argue they have building blocks of early metal),Deep Purple (same as LZ). If the screaming bothers you theres several great genres with masterful instrument playing (which is why i enjoy metal and symphony music, vocals are never top priority for me). You might enjoy such genres as Power(Sonata Artica((edited for spelling)),Stratovarius,Helloween.)Progressive (think Rush but heavier). For more information on the extreme diversity found in the Metal family please take a look at this:http://mapofmetal.com/#/home (might be loud careful). I'm sure if you give it a chance you can find something even you will enjoy, not all metalheads enjoy the yelling and screaming.","1356998419"

She has an amazing voice, i mean gets standing ovations at karaoke kind of voice, real beauty, gets into it, sells the whole damn act. Which is what we were doing at a dive bar in ohio, karaoke. 

 This old rough looking guy, which is pretty standard fare for a blue collar town, buys us each a round of drinks after she kills a song.  Nothing out of the ordinary. He ends up buying another round for us after another song she did. 

Now me and her are both fairly heavy regular drinkers, we know our limits if we're driving eventually, we know where to draw the line. We know each others limits, and watch out for each other. We only planned to have 4ish drinks the whole night. 

Here were are, on round 3, 2 from the guy, 1 from us. I honestly felt fine, until i tried to walk to the bathroom. Got light headed, bit dizzy.  Kept falling to one side as i tried to piss.  I figured i had low blood sugar, since I had no eaten anything at all that day, and had recently had some low blood sugar issues.  Again did not think much of it, grabbed a bag of chips and a piece of pizza from behind the bar. Thinking all is well in life. 

She seems a bit more flirty and energetic than usual, I took it as nothing more than that she was really into me(should have been first clue something was terribly wrong, i have no confidence with women nor ever assume they are into me)

We get our selves round 4, half way through round 4 we both start acting drunk. I mean 14 drinks in 3 hours type of drunk. We did not realize it at the time, but the memories eventually came back.

Old guy starts asking some questions. ""Are you guys together? did you come together?  are you leaving together? where do you live? did you drive together?"" He says to her ""where did you park"" 

Finally a lite bulb goes off in my head that this dude is not safe at all.  I tell the old dude to go grab us some more drinks. I grab her hand and we leave out the back door. At this point we're still not self aware that we are horribly fucked up.  We hug, and etc etc. She gets into her car,i get into mine, and we take off on our separate 10 and 15 mile drives home. 

Next thing i remember is being on the side of the rode at 5am, several hours later, only 3 blocks from my house, puking and dizzy, getting a text from her telling me shes in parking lot, and has no idea where or how she got there. 

Sure the night could have ended with a deadly car accident, a rape and murder, or 100 other bad ways.  Luckily we are able to look back on it, tell the story, and laugh about it. 

**TLDR**  Do not take drinks from strangers. Ever.

The way they are trying to entice you with bonus and loan forgiveness is a scam. The recruiter will tell you anything to get you to sign. If you want to be an officer go to OCS, you will never get around to it if you enlist. You sound like you want to be sold on enlisting but it will be a mistake. Also they will not give you STA 21 for one class, and you are old so you are not what they want for that particular program. I was 24 when I enlisted with the same intentions you have. Wanted to move on with my life, figured I would easily get picked up for OCS ( already had degree) and I could use the money to pay off college. I did pay off college and cruise through nuke school, but now I'm paying the price. Talk to an officer recruiter. If you have more questions PM me. You will be in DEP for a while waiting to enlist, might as well just use that time to get that credit and go straight to OCS.","1356998422"

Why spend all that time/money on porting an old engine when you could pay for the use of a modern engine (like Unreal or Unity3D) instead?

Some of the same issues exist with ports of Doom or Wolfenstein or other older games, but I strongly suspect that the relative complexity of Doom's source is low when compared to UT's.

Basically, Epic would be the only company likely to bankroll / attempt a port of UT, and it doesn't really fit their plans. (I'd imagine that UT3 or UT4 is more likely to be ported, since they're actively working on those engines.)","1356998426"

I find the conjugation point odd because to me the Romantic version of conjugation is much more complicated. Instead of having various suffixes (which depend on which ending the root has!) we have separate words that are pretty much impossible to confuse (would, will, have, etc.) 

I would expect a native Hispanic to say something like 'the spelling is atrocious' which I think is fairly obvious. (Although to be fair, the ability to shamelessly steal/import any good word that comes along is also one of its great strengths, so it's a bit of a double edged sword.).

Fortunately my mother has money in her bank account too, just not nearly that amount.  I have never understood why she kept cash around rather than keep it in a bank.

It's not really a big issue about experience , especially for Engineering but from my friends who studied Commerce, being able to speak Mandarin is a huge plus since the Chinese is the economic driving force in this country while the majority Muslim Malays typically work in the government sectors. 

All my friends are entry level Engineers and they're doing just fine,especially if they're educated overseas as they are thought to have higher degrees of professionalism and work ethics. I guess you should start browsing around engineering multinational companies in either Malaysia ( or even Singapore and Indonesia). The culture is not much different and multinational companies tend to have a higher standard of work ethics. I sadly have no friends who are civil engineers though - the government stopped sponsoring Civil Engineering students to study overseas since 1998.

"canada","t5_2qh68","1)  I do not have proof that god, or proof that he gave us morals or a conscience.  I do however know that we are given morals and a conscience at birth by someone!

I am not arguing that there is a personal god, or that god 'cares' about us, or the individual(s).   There is a divine power that I choose (for simplicity's sake) to call GOD.

Speaking about GOD telling us slavery is bad, etc...  People are product of their environment, and MANY people back then didn't think blacks were sub-human or deserved slavery.  The majority did, I must admit, but this was solely due to a sick society, and a result of a power-struggle.  Obviously these ""smart"" higher-then-thou white people knew that what they were doing is wrong.  They just didn't care, because other people supported it, and it was the norm.  It became the norm because some people are truly heartless fucks.  They assumed that since other societies were not as developed, that they must be inferior.

Just because a society makes it normal, in no way makes it right!

2) I agree 100% that ""sovereigns"" should not share all the benefits we have.  I also agree that I am lucky that I live in a democracy.  

I do however disagree that we can work to change it.  We can try, but when literally, all the cards are stacked against us, and everyone is happy with the illusion, it makes it really REALLY hard.

Corporations control the government.  This is fact.

Now please shed some light on how one person or even a group of 10,000 can change anything when there are politicians with millions of dollars spent on their campaign and their advertising.  Not to mention that only ""official"" politicians are allowed to join in the televised debates.  Also, the TV stations are run by the very corporations that ""make"" the politicians.....

If you have some answer to this, I would really love to know.

3) Taxation on every single dollar you ever make/spend/receive IS SLAVERY.  Who gets the money and how is it spent?  I would agree with you that it is not slavery, ONLY if it is (let alone could be)  proven that none of the money went to international banks or lining the pockets of the already well off, or lining the pockets of the politicians, or lining the pockets of the politicians brother who owns the company that does this.   

I like to think of it as a fee for civilization, but when things have gone this far down the tubes, it's naive to think that we are not being scammed for every cent that they can get away with.

.....

I am proud to be Canadian, and believe we are the best country in the whole world.  I am incredibly lucky to have all the things that I do, and am very privileged.    

I do however, see that the end is very near (relatively speaking).
We cannot afford to ignore our social ills anymore, as it just snow-balls and becomes worse year after year.

If people wake up and stop being such selfish cunts, and love each other, then things will change.

You cannot fairly argue that the system is not designed to create poor to satisfy the rich, while keeping a grip on peoples minds through media, entertainment, billboards, ADS ADS ADS ADS everywhere.

As long as we pay interest to a world bank, for our own government spending, we are doomed.  Imagine if you could keep all of your income tax for your whole life... You would be immensely rich and prosperous.

The reason why they care so much about you being alive, is because you're just another cog in the tax machine, with a designed life-span of X amount of years, to pay X amount of taxes, so the powers that be can reap the rewards of millions of peoples hard work, ""scott free""  , only because were all too stoopid to realise the truth, and are more concerned with American Idol and NFL football.

IF THE NEWS WASNT PURPOSELY DESIGNED TO MAKE YOU THINK A CERTAIN THING, then things would change.  They have monopoly over EVERYTHING, while we sit there and eat their shit, and ""some of us"" ** wink wink** get so drawn into the system that we actually swear by it and even defend it ?  What a joke.","1356998440"
"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Straterra has some initial side effects that usually wear off. I tried taking it once and for the first month or so as I was titrating the dose up, I had the same kinds of side effects (especially lethargy.) Over the course of the week they'd get slowly better, and then when I increased the dose they'd come back. After a couple weeks on what ended up being my proper dose, they went away. I ended up switching back to Concerta, but it was because the drug wasn't working as well for me and not because of any side effects.

TBH, it takes some people a lot longer than a couple of months to figure out the right medication and dosage. I noticed in another comment that he's getting his meds from a GP, and if they don't know much about ADHD then this could be a problem. Some GPs assume that they should base a person's dose on their weight and height, but ADHD meds (and a lot of other psychiatric meds) don't always work like that. This is why you're supposed to titrate the dose up – start by taking the lowest dose for a week, then move up to the next one for a week, until you either are satisfied that the drug is working (in which case you stop raising the dose) or until you start having bothersome side effects (at which point you go back down to the last one.) If your boyfriend's doctor just started him out at 60mg based on his height and weight, then he might be taking too much.","1356998440"

"Aerials","t5_2tdwn","Being flexible as well as strong is important for aerialists. But you first must have the strength before all else. Yes, pull ups are going to be hard, and you may not see much growth at first, but they are a must, no getting around it. Every aerialist worth their salt can do pull ups.

Practice until you can get one full pull up. Then just work that one pull up for a while. Then challenge yourself to two, and then so on. Strength will come with time. You may not see immediate results, but it will come in increments, and you will see it in the long run.

Contortion classes will help your flexibility, but be aware that flexibility may take a bit longer to work on. With contortion, just being able to extend your stretch one or two inches more can be a major milestone, even if it doesn't visually look different.

Work on both. But the first hurdle is strength. Just know it will be hard work getting there, but it is worth it.","1356998441"

She had gotten booked for assault when apparently during the ""passing of the love"" someone touched her and she hit him. Her car had been towed and so we went to the impound lot. Once there she asked me how much to ""rent"" me for the day. I was actually about to get my gas shut off if i didnt pay by COB next day so I was glad for any large money. I owed $170 to keep it on. 
Well we settled on about $200 and she paid Half the cash and asked me to drive her in her new mercedes to a rib place to get a meal. During the drive she told me I was driving too slow and to ""kick this german bitch in the ass"". Before we went in to the rib joint she briefed me that I was to escort her properly and treat her like a lady on a date. We ate and she asked em to drive her home so she could call over her friends for a party. We got to her house and she asked me to watch her shower then asked me to do the same. After the shower she asked me to dress in a sheet toga style so I could be ""The king"" and judge her and her friends in a beauty pageant. When her friends came over it was apparent this was a regular event. her friends all undressed and redressed in several designer gowns then had me judge them as princesses of the realm.

I don't see how a group of abondoned mutants suddenly became a cohesive body called The Locust Horde. There doesn't seem to be any time frame given for this, which makes it confusing the next section beginning with the rise of the Lambent. Is Lambency a logical step that all Locust are heading towards as they continue mutating? What's the timeframe between initial New Hope people and Lambent?

2. I remembered the bit about leprechaun's gold being temporary, but had forgotten that they learned that in Hagrid's class during Goblet of Fire. He brought out nifflers, then buried some gold for them to dig up for a fun class competition. Ron's niffler got the most, so Ron won some chocolate.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","So your new wife, less than a week after being married, is already being passive aggressive?  Seems to me that you likely knew she was capable of this before entering into the relationship.  People don't suddenly become passive aggressive after marriage.

Personally, assuming the story is exactly as you have posted it, I think you have done nothing wrong and she's being a child.  You had a wonderful week together and she gave you permission.  That being said, if she gave obvious signs, like being frustrated or angry when telling you to go snowboarding, then you could've played it differently.

She's being passive aggressive and acting like a child, but you got yourself into that situation.  Your options are really either discuss how she's acting with her to try and reach a resolution and then either stay in the relationship or leave it.  That's about it.  

Hopefully she realizes she was being ridiculous, but from the experience of watching my father marry a passive agressive and immature woman, that might not be the most likely of things to happen.","1356998446"

Millions are homeless and have no food as well. Should we subsidize food and housing as well?


&gt;""Pharmaceutical and medical countries still make a ton of cash off of breakthroughs.""

Pharmaceutical companies make money from insurance companies. The pharmaceutical companies invest years and years of time, energy and money for the remote chance that their efforts will result in a viable, sellable product that works. Most often that investment does not pay off. When it does, it not only needs to pay for the failed attempts but also to make a profit for the company and its investors. Monetary incentive isn't a perfect system but it DOES create genuine breakthroughs that might not have otherwise been discovered without it.

The alternative is government subsidization of health care services where caps are placed on how much insurance will pay for certain pharmaceuticals experimental treatments or procedures. When this happens, the financial incentive for risk takers is gone which inevitably results in these people not funding research. This in turn causes breakthrough research to either dramatically decline (at best) or be entirely eliminated (at worst).

Obama care was crafted by design to take the financial benefit away from private industry and gives it to government to manage. This is the direct opposite of what the U.S. government was established to do. It was meant to create greater opportunity for its citizens. We are the richest country in the world because it has been the way we've done things.

With the government taking over more private industry and giving less or no incentive for private industry to invest you can bank on the fact that this title will go away soon. This is especially true when this strategy is adopted alongside runaway entitlement spending... something Obama has indicated he is unwilling to cut from budgets.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Persona 4 Arena led the pack for me this year. Great use of the Persona license, offering up a pretty good story to drive the action. More than just sheer fanservice, though, Arc System Works really seemed to pull off a somewhat unique feeling fighting game. Mechanically, I don't feel like P4A really achieves a lot of brand-new things for fighting games, but it does remix them in a way that feels fresh and new (in my opinion, the Personas are merely stand ins for heavy attacks, but the thing that makes them unique is that they are vulnerable to being hit and being disabled temporarily). For me, it was a mixture of being Persona-based *and* being distinct-feeling that really made P4A stand out.

Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was pretty brilliant as well. Not sure if its netcode was based on the stellar netcode of Soulcalibur V, but it really sings online, moving the status quo for online play forward for fighters. Absolutely huge and relatively balanced cast, though it's not perfect. Still, this is quite possibly the most robust fighting game ever produced.

Soulcalibur V had stellar online play, and for a Soulcalibur game, I thought it was superior to 3 and 4. I still got nostalgic for 2, though, and I still end up having a better time playing 2 at one of my local arcades than actually playing SCV at home. Still, it was fun and made for a good game, just not a great one.

Street Fighter X Tekken was a game I really wanted to like. I enjoy the aesthetic of the game -- it takes Street Fighter IV's aesthetic to a wilder, vibrant new place. Mix and matching Street Fighter and Tekken gameplay elements always seemed kind of interesting, too, but there's just too many underwhelming mechanics and game-breaking bugs in the game. There's a huge patch on the way, and I hope it does make SFxT more palatable, but I fully understand why this game seemed to completely fail with the community.","1356998452"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have trained in martial arts for about 25 years. On one occasion I was laying in bed with my girlfriend - we lived in a basement apartment. It was about 3am and I heard something at the window (that woke me up). I then heard the noise again, it was the sash window being raised. I went to the window naked, drew back the curtains and there was someone trying to lift the window so they could get in. At this point my extensive training kicked in - I started to scream with rage, punched the guy through the window and then slapped the walls while continuing to rage. My girlfriend, woken by my screaming, also started screaming. The would-be burglar ran away - I got some clothes on and ran outside but he was long gone. I then noticed that I had cut my arm open on the window, so I had to go to the hospital and get stitched up.

In all seriousness, my training has been invaluable in knowing how to not get into fights - situational awareness, things like The Fence and having the confidence not to need to fight. In the few actual fights I've had, anything that involved fine technique did not occur to me - the adrenaline makes it hard to do much else. However, lots of training of good striking technique helps with delivering power. The most surprising thing is how quickly a fight finishes - most people can't fight, but think they can. Just knowing how to punch in a straight line rather than a big arc is a major advantage.

Last point - I was once surrounded by 5 or 6 people. They would have kicked the shit out of me if the police hadn't arrived to help me. It's not until you're in that position that you realise how difficult it would be - we all think we could Jackie Chan it, but I just froze with fear/panic.","1356998453"

Let me add... I have some nice, high-tech, variable voltage wands, with dozens of tiny machined parts and some microelectronics and amazing colored plexi and state-of-the-art machining, and I was holding one in my hand the other day admiring it. I was admiring the chrome ring at the base of my clearo, and looking at a scuff on it, and thinking, damn, I scuffed the chrome. WHAT? Suddenly I remembered that the entire friggin' clearo, complete with plastic ""chrome"", cost me a whole $5. My mind was temporarily blown. It's very artful extreme-low-cost manufacturing, and for the cost of the hardware, it's insanely reliable. Even though I have some dead units lying around.

I will also be acquiring nice ""pieces"" for artful vaping, but also let us all appreciate that 2012 gave us some AMAZING and GORGEOUS tech, for pittance. Really, for the cost of a business lunch for two, you can be carrying a vv rubberized battery in designer colors, a matched kanger 2+ml clearo with rebuildable internals, and an anodized mouthpiece with a blisteringly perfect finish, full of a hand-mixed wonder juice with controllable nicotine content. And also, this industry has more standard fittings than most new gadget industries in the last many years. Huge interchangeability. Yes, briefly, mind was blown there.

Other hobbies, you can't get squat for $5. For instance, it's hard to find any kind of cheap plastic crap in a music store, for the cost of a Kanger, except for finger picks maybe. The pricing in this market, compared to the quality of product, continues to amaze me. It's a pretty inexpensive hobby, from my perspective.

Giving it a 5 minute cooldown (while making it's cooldown lower at the cost of something, such as mobility or survivabiltiy) makes it much more situational and thusly, as step in the right direction. It also makes it much less likely to counter *itself*.","1356998468"

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","Look for the first season of New Yankee Workshop and accompanying book.  Individual projects are available online.

The projects in that book may be beyond what you are interested in but in that first season the focus was on learning to build.  Some techniques require tools you may not have. Others will indicate how you might do certain tasks without a fully complete shop. Later seasons are harder to recommend as the projects become more involved and the tool requirements more serious.


Also see if you can find video of The Woodwright's Shop with Roy Underhill. This is a seriously more traditional approach to building things using only hand tools. Maybe not up your alley, especially project wise, but it does reinforce understanding that for years all of it was done by hand. So with a little practice, you don't need a million dollar shop.

"LucidDreaming","t5_2r0f4","**Beginning**

I started studying lucid dreaming a few years ago after hearing about it some where. I became a member on DreamViews and began reading more and more about lucid dreaming. I started my first dream journal around that time. After a few days, I had my first lucid dream. It was short and I didn't do much, but I wanted to get better.

Now that I had my first lucid dream, I began to study more and more. All of my internet time was dedicated to reading about lucid dream induction techniques, keywords/terms, reality checks, etc. I spent a lot of my time reading other dreamers' dream journals and their lucid dreaming experiences. They kept me interested in lucid dreaming so I wouldn't give up.

**Dream Journaling**

After my first month, I was able to have one, short lucid dream a week or even two if I was lucky. I kept up with my dream journal and did reality checks through out the day. My normal dreams weren't very detailed and they were short.

As I kept writing in it over the past year, my dreams were long and took up two pages sometimes. They were very clear, vivid, and movie-like. While I was dreaming, perception of dream time was noticeable. For example, if the plot of a dream lasted a dream day, my mind made it feel   it had been a day. It didn't actually feel like a day passed, it was more like when someone asks what you did today, you tell them from when you got up and what you did from that point until now. You're going through each event that leads up to present time, but you aren't experiencing it. My longer lucid dreams feel like this. It's kind of hard for me to explain.

**Lucid dream experiences**

After two years, I started having lucid dreams at least 5 times a week. They would last around 10 seconds to maybe 10 minutes. Now, after 5 years, my dreams can last up to 30+ minutes when I use DEILD to get back into a lucid dream after waking (I can only guess how long a lucid dream lasts). Vividness ranged from cloudy to extremely realistic, but control was always a problem for me. My first problems of control was over my dream body. I had trouble running fast and sometimes couldn't see. I found that when I ran on all fours, I would run much faster. I also took a liking to shapeshifting in dreams around this time. So whenever I wanted to run fast, I would transform into a wolf or a cheetah. I don't have problems running on just two anymore, but I still run on all fours every once in a while because it's fun.

I had trouble flying for the longest time too. At first, the best I could do was a huge jump and soar for a little bit before crash landing. Earlier this year, I realized the way I learned how to run faster was to transform into something that can run fast. In one lucid dream I had, I was stuck in a creepy lab where some crazy scientists were doing experiments on people and I wanted to get away. I didn't want to confront the scientists so I transformed into an Eastern dragon and flew through the ceiling. Now when I fly, I transform into an Eastern dragon. It became easier to fly (sometimes) and the feeling of having a long body feels really strange, but it's one of the reasons why I prefer transforming into an Eastern dragon other than the Western kind.


In one of the first lucid dreams I've had, I began looking for my dream guide. One of my first experiences with dream characters wasn't pleasant. I was calling for my dream guide and I hear a voice tell me to turn around. When I did, a man tackled me and put into a headlock. There were two other guys with him and they just laugh and leave me there. I was confused of what just happened, so I sat there for a while thinking about what to do next.

In another lucid dream, I met dream character that was dressed in a hooded, black robe and he said that he knew who my dream guide was. A few days later, I had a regular dream where he introduced himself and told me to call him PJ. He had short, red hair and was wearing some sort of uniform. He told me he was part of an organization and he took me to its headquarters once, but I don't remember what they do. PJ became a common part of my lucid and non-lucid dreams.

A few weeks later in a different lucid dream, I start calling for PJ, but a with black hair shows up. I tell him that he's not PJ and he says that his name is also PJ. When the PJ I knew showed up, he and the black haired PJ started hanging out. The black haired PJ became friends with red haired PJ and they would both show up when I called for either of them. After a while, I asked if they can change their names for me. Red haired PJ is now know as Jacob and black haired PJ is Michael. The last time I saw them, Michael had joined Jacob's organization and was wearing their uniform. I haven't seen them in a long time because of having less lucid dreams, but I'm sure that once I start having them regularly again, I will begin to see them more often.

I met my dream guide by summoning a door and saying I will meet my dream guide when I go through it. I entered a room that had three dogs in it, two were german shepherds and one looked like a bermese mountain dog. The shepherds were very friendly and the other dog began speaking to me. I asked it if it was my dream guide and it said yes. The dog transformed into a woman with long, curly, brown hair. I don't remember much about her other than that she told me her name was Ann and that she was very nice. The two german shepherds also transformed into humans, but I don't remember them. Then suddenly, the walls break apart and a large, flying machine zaps her with some sort of lightning transfer beam. A man's voice comes from the machine and tells me that he was taking her. Jacob was disappointed that I didn't do anything to help her. I think I had a non-lucid dream where Jacob, Michael, and I rescue her from the man inside the machine, but I don't remember much of it. One thing I remember from the dream though was that Jacob and Ann was in a relationship.

**Nightmares**

After about three years, I started getting lucid nightmares where I couldn't do anything. My lack of control along with in-dream sleep paralysis began to make lucid dreaming scary instead of fun. After a while, I wanted to quit lucid dreaming all together. I stopped writing in my dream journal and stopped encouraging myself to have lucid dreams. After about a year, my recall slowly dropped to where it was in the beginning and I rarely lucid dreamed at all.

I'm getting back into lucid dreaming now because I'm not afraid to take on the scary stuff anymore. I'm trying to get back into writing in my dream journal, but I'm being lazy about it. I'm starting to get lucid dreams again at about one every other day by DILDing and using DEILD when I can. My control has gotten better because I realized that imagination is extremely important when you want something to work in dreams. So when I imagine something to happen, it happens. Right now I'm working on achieving lucid dreams as often as I used to and get better control over my lucid dreams.

It's not hard, but its not reliable. Items in d3 are randomly generated, so for the same amount of effort you might get something worth $1000 or something worth $0.001.   If you get good, you can start killing more things more quickly and efficiently so you get more potential good drops per hour, and thus maximize your return.  I don't know if I'd call that hard to do though, really a lot of it is about having the right gear and just looking up good routes to take or builds to use.


Overall I do think the value now is lower than it was earlier on, but they're about to release a patch that adds player vs player combat, so I anticipate a spike in prices when that happens as people come back, get their ass handed to them, and want to spend $40 to get the gear they need to do well.","1356998479"

Now whether you will be hassled at your arrival airport depends on whether or not that state is a reciprocal state (although from what I hear from many who have flown, as long as you fly out safely you are probably fine since there is no search at the arrival port).  TSA's official policy for cannabis is to refer it to the local state enforcement.              

See [this article](http://blogs.seattleweekly.com/dailyweekly/2011/11/seatac_tsa_agents_you_are_free.php) from last year regarding flying with it at Seatac.

&gt; Seventeen year old slacker Anton Tobias wakes up one Halloween morning to discover that both of his parents have been turned into two headless Halloween decorations. After speaking to his equally irresponsible friends, Mick and Pnub, he discovers that his right hand has a blood-thirsty mind of its own and is hell-bent on wreaking havoc whether he likes it or not.

The first guy was nice about it and said he was unsure, but later on it turned out that he was just using me to get closer to my friend. The second guy just reacted negatively and that was a crash and burn failure.

You know, a lot of people do say that we have the power to change that and whatnot... but honestly it really doesn't happen to everyone :\. Not to suddenly sound all pessimistic or anything but it's just so tiring. I've tried wearing makeup, dressing better, etc... And yet it still feels like no matter where I go I just don't have any luck, and it's just so frustrating.

Being a man of violence he finds it hard to reconcile the the teachings of Jesus with the realities of living in a world where outlaws run free and terrorise innocent people. The following quote sums it up well: ""I am trapped, Batik, in a religion I can scarcely comprehend. In the Bible there are many passages I can follow, yet I am not a Christian. My Bible teaches me to smite the enemy hip and thigh, destroy him with fire and sword... it also teaches me to love my enemy and do good to him who hates me.""

"comics","t5_2qh0s","&gt;I'm not saying that people who tell girls to smile are Hitler - I'm saying that judging people just on their intentions makes everyone equally awesome and is consequently a pointless metric.

I'm not saying that it's a good metric either. All I am suggesting is you try and have a little perspective. I'm not even saying that some of the stuff that has been brought up isn't a good point, just that wishing someone was happy is a hell of a long way from genocide.

I don't think most of the guys are thinking ""Hey, it's hard for me to get a boner with this girls chronic bitch face, maybe if I tell her to smile she'll suck my dick."" 

When someone tells me to smile, I am not always in the mood. So I don't smile. I don't fucking rage about it. Life's too short for dumb shit.

&gt;Hilarious. I'm a male, not in any way personally affected by women being told to smile.

It is hilarious because when I said 'you people' I wasn't referring to women. If I had mean't women, I'd have typed that.

A) I don't believe all or even most women (or men) would react that negatively to such a harmless thing.

B) I had already seen your other posts of your sour puss, and I knew you were a guy.

C) It's fewer letters.

I can be independent. I lived on my own for many years after turning 18, without monetary support from anyone but myself. But when I am with someone in a committed relationship, I would rather be a part of a team. Lucky for me, I have that now. When my fiancé stands up for me, I don't see it as treating me like a child.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","Hospice nurse here, curious to hear from the crowd.  This article raises some big questions for me -- particularly with regard to the definition of addiction in the article.  I was taught that there is a difference between tolerance, dependence and addiction -- the last being an issue when someone is either hurting themselves or others in order to continue the addictive behavior.  I was also taught (and have witnessed) that you can't just stop opioids cold turkey.  So the premises of the article seem to be off.

Having said that, I have a gut feeling that there's some substance to the claim that a higher number of people get addicted than the standard 2 - 3% so often cited.  But no evidence!

On the flip side, it's sort of common hospice knowledge that many doctors do not prescribe pain medicine appropriately.  I can certainly attest to this from personal experience as a patient, when I was sent home after an ORIF of the clavicle with a boatload of Percocets, and plain ocycodone for breakthrough.  (Oh, and no bowel regimen!  A hospice nurse's anathema.)  This apparently was standard practice!!!  WTF??  I think I used 4 - 5 percocets, tops, and none of the oxycodone.  

With no buzz, by the way -- which brings up another issue -- ; the conventional wisdom has historically been that various substances were not initially considered addictive when they were first synthesized in the lab and the scientists took them, themselves.  But when they were released to the general public, much addiction ensued.  (Can't remember which drugs, now... would have to do some googling.)

ANYWAY, would love to hear any input / feedback / thoughts from the folks here.

I am not saying that a seller does not have any options available now but there is obviously still a market for private sales.  

The option you mention, that they do not chose to utilize, does not come without significant cost, hence my idea of providing the option free of charge.  
As I am sure you know, the gun community is very adverse to any and all fees or surcharges....hence dealers will charge you even for the tiny credit card fees they have to pay.

I became a fan, I think partly because I grew up in the 80's and everybody loved the Turtles. It was a fun cartoon that I watched every afternoon.
My favorite Turtle is of course Mikey. Although I didn't have a clear favorite in the first cartoon, reading the comic(the originals) I grew to really love Mikey and his cat Klunk and his writings. I was always introverted and shy and liked Donnie also.
My favorite movie has to be the first one, although I love the new CGI one and the 2nd is a guilty pleasure. The movie really brought the cartoon to life and I was only 9 or 10 at the time and watched it almost every day when I got my VHS copy.
My favorite item, although it's not available anymore is the pudding pie. I also ate the cereal but never really liked it(still had to eat it because it was turtles!) I have a new Mikey figure that I cherish also.

And on the other side that most pro-lifers, motivated by religion, believe that a soul gets magically inserted into a fetus at conception.  (I think this is fair to say generally, though I know some people have more varied opinions.)

First of all, a person who declares abortion ""murder"" is probably immovable on this point.  I think the best way to suss that out is to ask them what they believe should be the penalty for a woman who has an illegal abortion and for the doctor who performs it.

If they answer that the penalty should be the same as for murder, then the debate is probably pointless.  You can't prove they are wrong about a fetus having a soul.  The best you can do is try to convince them that they'll never win on abortion politically and maybe they should turn their attention to a fight they can actually win.  You can *try* to convince them that we can't legislate based on religious belief, but that argument is going to go down the ""CHRISTIAN NATION!"" shithole pretty fast.

If they answer anything less than whatever the penalty is for murder, then I assert that they do not genuinely believe that a fetus has the same value as a one month old baby.  Now you've got some ground to work with.  The question now becomes a matter of what is more valuable morally, and you can get into all those rape and health of the mother questions.

But what's happened here with all this rape/health-of-the-mother debate?  Pro-choicers are conceding ground just by arguing this point because they (generally) believe that abortion should be a choice no matter the circumstances.  What's the point of arguing this?  Even if you win this argument, all you've done is convinced the pro-life person that we should make some exceptions for abortions.  That's fine, I guess, but it's not the pro-choice position.

So what the fuck is my point anyway?  My point is don't argue with them because you can't prove them wrong.  Instead, try to find some common ground.  Acknowledge, for example, that nobody could morally stomach seeing an eight-month fetus terminated for no reason, pro-life OR pro-choice.  So pro-choicers also have a line they draw that says, ""This fetus is a person right here.""  Pro-lifers simply put that line all the way at the beginning.  The common ground you can find is ways to prevent abortions that don't include making them illegal.  These are arguments that can be won on reasonable merits, like better sex education and availability of contraception.  The ""abortion is murder"" argument cannot be won, most of the time.

As you so succinctly put it, ""licking ***it*** so ***it's*** mine"" wherein the it is not a toy, but a woman. But in this situation, it's both because the woman is not treated as a human, but an object for possession. Maturing doesn't solve this, unless you're talking on a social level.

The same white man that you thank and glorify for ""fixing"" things in India (and for some reason you are okay with for robbing us of our resources) was also responsible for hundreds of years of brutal colonialism, massacres like [Jallianwala Bagh] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre), robbed us of our wealth, and is pretty much the primary reason India is such a poor, corrupt, and divided nation today.

Every culture has it's good traits and its bad. Western culture is exemplary in women's rights and being proactive in administering justice to criminals, but Western culture is also rife with widespread drug use, disrespect towards the elderly in society (parents being considered a burden on children), no respect for teachers and education (you should see the attitudes of schoolchildren here in the US), and many other things Indian culture excels with.

I'm not denying that Indian culture is inherently wrong in many, MANY areas. But glorifying the white man and being an Uncle Tom isn't the step in the right direction. We should emulate the POSITIVE aspects of Western culture while still retaining the good and moral aspects of Indian culture such as respect for parents and the elderly, respect for education, etc. etc. Saying ""Fuck Indian Culture"" is a blanket statement and won't get us anywhere","1356998515"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Thank you so much for this post. It was very well thought out and brings up some very good questions. 

You're definitely right. People do change, and I understand that. Her and I have both changed a ton over the years. It used to be that we were growing and changing together. After I took this job though, it so much time and distance between us that she started to change seperately, I guess. 

The thought of her still potentially cheating on me has kind of crossed my mind. My trust is a little shaken still so it's hard to keep those kind of thoughts from creeping into my head. I think it's important that I explain that prior to all of this, she was the kind of person who would never cheat on anyone. I understand that holds little merit now, but when she made the mistake she was just as devestated as I was (or seemed to be I guess). Other than the things I've described here, there isn't any real evidence of cheating. Before, I had a pretty good hunch that she was cheating on me but now I don't feel that she's acting exactly the same way now as she was then while she was cheating. All I can say is, I hope she's not and if she is I would be extremely suprised, just as I was before. 

We've talked about couples counseling. The problem with this is that I'm normally away from home with work, and while I am home, she's working weekdays during normal business hours. She didn't seem to be against the idea of couples counseling, which shows a slight interest in fixing things. 

I can't really be too sure what she might say. Like I mentioned above, every time I try to talk about this, I have an extremely hard time getting her involved in the conversations. She's said that she doesn't like how things are either, and that she wishes things were how they used to be. She's also said that my job is really hard on her; that's what she's been saying since I've gotten the job though. 

She'd probably say that it's not all her fault, and she's right. I know that some of the blame is on me as well. I haven't been trying as much I used to. It's like I said though, I just feel so worn down and her actions are leaving me feeling bitter and resentful.

Other than that though, she hasn't explained to me anything she'd like from me, or what she'd like to happen between us. She hasn't really said or shown me anything to make me beleive she wants to put in an effort to help fix us. 

On the subject of her not moving in, I aggree, it is odd that she moved in her cats but hasn't moved in herself. While she was living at home, her dad didn't really like her cats there. He stressed to her a couple of times that he wanted the cats out, so I think that probably explains why she moved her cats in despite her not moving in herself. 

I've pressed her a bit about her not moving in. She explained to me that she doesn't feel right moving in with the current state our relationship is in. She doesn't want to move in when there is so much confrontation between us. I agree 100%. I don't think moving in together while we're in such bad shape is going to be the fixer for us. However, she's said she plans to move in once we work on things. But again, she hasn't really shown an interest of effort into working on things, and I'm an actions speak louder than words kind of guy. 

You may be right though, there may be something more worth reading into in regards to her moving her cats in, but not herself. I like that ""living between two worlds"" thought. It's almost as though she doesn't want to let go of all of her luxuries I provide for her. With me, she has options. I provide a house for her cats, and her if she needs it. I provide her with a vehicle to drive, and money when she needs it. I'm a friend she can call and count on to be there for her when she needs to vent. It's like she wants me to provide all of the responsobilities of a loving boyfriend and provider, but doesn't want to have to hold up her end of the deal. She's living her own life her own way, leaving me on the leash to give her what she wants. 

Thanks again for your reply. I really appreciate your help and sharing your thoughts. ","1356998517"

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","I've had experience with both Local and Distance. Local can be nice for convenience but it can definitely be harder to find someone who shares the same values. I've noticed with more distant relationships, there is definitely a higher level of compatibility, possibly because it's easier to just cherry pick from communities that you do share values with. 
Being able to close that gap eventually is an obstacle of no small task though, especially in regards to leaving family behind, or appropriate paperwork if you are crossing international borders. 
I guess it comes down to the weight of convenience and settling with all of those physical benefits, or time and delays, and the chance of not being able to tough it out. To me, anyways. ","1356998517"

Girls don't have immunity, as far as I'm concerned. That said, only time I've ever gotten in a fight was when one guy punched a family friend I've known my whole life (she was a girl).  
She wasn't bleeding, or bruised or anything, and she was pretty smashed, so I asked her to point the guy out. She wasn't sure, so I asked the guy calmly if he hit this girl, and he says ""Well she hit me first"".  
And at that point, everything was fine. He then went on to say she's a fucking slut, bitch, cunt, etc...  
You name a derogatory word, and he said it. Me being drunk/high, that got the testosterone flowing, and I grabbed his shirt, punched him once, he fell over, and waited for his friends to come at me.

**Optimization** - This is a true next-gen game that provides an experience that wasn't possible previously. Any PC older than 2 years isn't going to cut it.  

**Free-2-Play** - If you just want to check the game out or play a few hours a week when a friend is on then playing for free is completely viable. You'll just be limited in terms of variety. If this is going to be the main game you play then expect to pay at least $60 (regular price for new game) plus more for new content or if you want to speed up unlocks. It is typical in an MMO to require a lot of play time to unlock the things you want.  

**Glitches/Balance issues** - I've never played an online game didn't have both of these in spades upon release. The important things to look at are frequency of updates and community interaction. SOE have excelled at both (so far).  ","1356998522"

Results: People who lifted at 80% 1RM were stronger than for the people who lifter 30% 1RM. People who lifted at 80% 1RM had an increase in phosphorylation (signaling protein), but 30% 1RM people did not. All groups gained about the same mass.

[](/scratch)I didn't know about them till my friend told me about them. He'd look them up online since a lot of them were in pretty hidden places or just really out of the way. Like one of the loot things was on top of a mountain in the border between two zones, who checks up there?

It has some dungeons and stuff but nothing comparable to WoWs raids or anything. They tend to just add what they call comic issues, which are basically a dungeon spread over 5 parts that come out over about a month or two.

The newest update added vechials and seems pretty cool, I was probably gonna check it out soon. I mean look at this [thing](http://images-cdn.perfectworld.com/www/91/1e/911eb2b3e9bd18105cc1ea44cebe91421352431995.jpg), it looks awesome!

[](/sp)

[](/vscurious)That's pretty cool that it was heavily story based. I know I'll put up with kinda meh gameplay if the story is good enough to keep me interested.

That battelground sounds pretty cool. I'm guessing all the orc guys and such had their own abilities and stuff?

Also that kinda reminds me of the legends pvp mode from DC Universe Online. You could unlock DC characters to play as like Batman and Superman and use them instead of your character. 

[](/sp)

[](/pokerscratch)I liked being in the mafia during the second big game, it was a little similar in that you had people to work with and stuff. Having a group of people you know you can trust makes the game a bit more relaxing since you don't have to be quite as paranoid all the time.

"science","t5_mouw","Alright, so let's me explain what's going on in quantum teleportation. You've got two entangled photons, give one to party A and the other to party B. Then, party A can do some quantum hocus pocus with his entangled and another photon, which in a quantum state Q. A then sends some classical information, which stills can only be transfered at the speed of light, to B, who then does some hocus pocus on his end and his entangled photon is put into state Q.

This is very relevant for many things, but it does not allow for instant anything. It allows to transfer quantum state at a distance, at the speed of light, through classical channels. Since quantum state cannot be measured completely (by the uncertainty principle), it's very useful to be able to transfer it through classical channels, were error correction codes can be better applied.","1356998546"

"canada","t5_2qh68","&gt; I agree, but special status cannot be avoided completely.

In what way? As I said this is going to be a generational change, at least one, probably two. Not something you can fix quickly with a change in legislation or passing new laws etc.

&gt; Our problem isn't just a loss of land - it's a loss of political power, loss of culture and an on-going social crisis completely related to the systematic assimilation and sexual abuse (leading to the discovery of unmarked graves near residential schools) of First Nations peoples by the federal and provincial governments.

Yes, but that is a bad side effect of being ""special status"" and essentially being treated like a lesser human being. This has more to do with the relationship between First Nations and the Government than it has to do with anything else. Removing ""special status"" and instead bringing the people into society as full fledged members (instead of treating them like giving them handouts) will, in the mid to long term, improve people's chances.

This doesn't mean that there isn't still a lot of things from the past that needs to be cleaned / cleared up, but that's a different topic / subject altogether. The Indian Act etc. has a much higher impact on the future than the past.

&gt; deliver something to Natives that will guarantee their cultural, social and political sovereignty within Confederation,

Okay, I have to ask. Why should it be the Governments responsibility to make sure you can keep your culture? Shouldn't people be free to chose how they want to celebrate their heritage? I admit, I never understood certain people in Quebec either who like to drum the ""we are a different culture"" aspect and the attitude that you need to legislate it's continuous existence. Life is change and things change over time. If the Settler would have never shown up in the Americas odds are pretty good that some of the First Nations would have disappeared over time. What currently exist in Canada is a sort of odd ""Living Museum"" where some people are eager to try and preserve a past that really no longer applies to the day to day lives. 

I am not trying to diminish your cultural identity here, but having come from a country that had it's upheavals over the last 100 years and transformed itself (for better and worse) a few times my look at history is that you should't plan your future to be like your past. Traditions etc. can be observed without it being mandatory. People's identity is something they should decide for themselves, not something they are getting guilt tripped in because for some the past identity is the only one they can accept.

Which also goes to the Political and social sovereignty. If you would transform the reserves into ""modern"" communities (in as far as they are being Governed) then it does give the individuals living in these communities political self-determination. They will most likely end up with Federal and Provincial Ridings of their own so they can make their voices heard on these levels as well.

The only ones I see losing out on this are the currently leaders, but I am not sure that is necessarily a bad thing. 

&gt; If this were changed reserves would simply transition into municipalities where Aboriginals make up the majority population.

Yes, that's my idea as well.

&gt; But in order to better protect the culture and society, this will require something more, such as either the creation of a 'First Nations province' in which Aboriginals form the majority population and form a distinct society (such as Québec), or in which autonomous semi self-governing Aboriginal territories are created within each province proportional to the local Aboriginal population, such as the Nunavik region in Québec.

I need to look into Nunavik but in general I do not think ""special protection"" status should be part of the deal, nor do I think should it be the responsibility of the Government to create ""cultural reserves"", this should be up to the individuals if they want to preserve their culture as a living thing or in a museum.","1356998550"

Goes up to her and pinches her butt, I see this and the look on her face. 

Very shy girl, quiet, but beautiful. NOT the wild kind to be treated like that, she was a lady.

Without hesitating, I walked up, put my arm around his neck (sorta 'buddy buddy I love you man' style)

pull him over away from everybody, not overly forceful but not yielding.

Look him dead in the eyes, tell him quietly that he has two options, the first is to apologize to the lady, because she is a lady and he was out of line.

He tried arguing, I shook my head, and told him once more to walk right over there, right now, and apologize because he fucked up and if he knew her as well as he kept saying then he should know that she isn't that kind of girl.

He says fine, walks over and apologizes - nothing more came of it, I never brougth it up with him nor him with me.

You hit the nail on the head.  There was speculation, then proof that she had ""help"" in doing exactly that.  Just getting off the winstrol for a period of time would help her lose 5-10 lbs of LBM right off the bat.  As long as she didn't eat at a surplus, she wouldn't get fat, and would be able to make the weight.

Now, we're going to get to the crux of it.  Is she willing to give up her artificial strength advantage and drop the weight class, or ""try"" as in the past, miss weight, and then the other fighter is between the rock and hard place of not getting paid and dropping out, or fighting with essentially an arm tied behind her back?","1356998572"

To show my point, North Carolina has 13 districts. If you add up all the votes in those districts the Dems won 2,219,165 (50.87%) of the votes compared to the GOP 2,143,118 (49.13%).

I'll admit that 'generations' was in error in the sense of family, but not in the sense of turnover.

EDIT: I'm going to revise my own argument for it being imprecise.  The numbers don't show *capacity* directly - that info isn't explicitly represented here.  What *is* shown is a stable (roughly zero) growth rate.  Given that there are no new units being constructed, a zero growth (remember 'growth' can be negative) implies that for everyone who leaves, someone else comes in.  There is no net loss of residents.  Further positive growth is impossible, as there are no new units being constructed (which leads to the assumption that they're at capacity - if the growth rate was high initially then went to zero and has stayed there since, that's a strong indicator that capacity was reached).","1356998578"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Actually I started out some legacy projects on Sourceforge:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/factors/

Factors was a Visual BASIC 6.0 program that I wrote to help my son learn how to solve factors with his math class he was struggling in. I converted it to Jabaco which is a Visual BASIC type language that compiles to the Java Byte Code. It is very small and simple.

HStrip:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/hstrip/

HSTRIP is a DOS based Turbo/Borland C based command line utility to strip out non-Text control codes leaving text only. It was originally written in a computer lab at a college to salvage corrupted Word Perfect files into ASCII Text format. But it can strip out text from almost any binary file as long as it isn't compressed or encrypted. HStrip stands for HexStrip in that it filters out text by hexadecimal codes. 

GCONF:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/gconf/

GCONF, Get Configuration, it is a MS-DOS program written in Turbo C. I doubt it will work with Windows without modifications. It gets the configuration of a PC, the BIOS, the expansion cards, etc. I used a version of it called WHICHNET to load the correct Netware driver for a universal DOS Network boot disk for a computer lab I worked in around 1990 when we had Arcnet, Starnet, and Thomas Conrad cards in various IBM PC and PS/2 machines. Instead of having a network boot disk for each adapter, it could detect the correct network card and then load the correct driver for Netware.

The last two I had open sourced for 314 area code BBS systems and might even have posted to Usenet a long time ago.

I'm socially awkward, and have social anxiety, so it is hard for me to join a group like an open source development team. But I can still do some programming and can learn almost any language out there. Just that nobody accepts me or my works.","1356998590"

"politics","t5_2cneq","""This is a damning statistic all by itself and not something to invoke in defense of more government looting.""

It's a damning statistic, and I don't believe it.  

What I do know is that nearly half of all foodstamps in this country go to working households that happen to meet the criteria to be elligible and that you have to be in a very poor situation to meet that criteria.

Government looting is not making very profitable employers, like Walmart, pay their employees so little that the employees cannot live on their wages and actually qualify for foodstamps through goverment welfare.

Is paying your employees so little that you are contributing to the economy grinding to a halt as demand withers away, while sourcing ultra cheap crap that cannot be safely produced at the price you are willing to pay, forcing competitors who will pay the costs of safe production to either go out of business or copy your conduct, all while avoiding paying your fair share of taxes, and then having the nerve to force the taxpayer to subsidize your wage bill as you reap the profits of your bludging, also not breeching the social contract?  In fact isn't that a much more egregious and harmful violation of the social contract?  

Not that it matters I suppose since Walmart doesn't appear to be too fussed about it whether it follows the actual law.","1356998592"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Remembrance day this year i was at a bar with buddies from my regiment and i start getting texts from a guy i met a few times, didnt have his number, he wants me to come to a bar to see him and some people... weird. I declined told him i was at a bar with my buddies, he says ok ill come see you, again weird this guy and i arent friends. He shows up and hes hammered and wants to fight. I didnt know why so we talk. Turns out he liked the girl i had been seeing and had been trying to hit on her all night at the bar only to be told by someone that she was seeing me. This sent him off the deep end hard and he cabbed halfway across the town to find me. Now this guy had only met her 3 times, never really talked to her, never asked her out, only had commented on her fb pics to a point that it was seriously creepy. So I told him look im sorry if you feel like i took your girl but she came onto me, i like her, were just hanging out and i had no idea you were into her. Well this isnt good enough for him, he tells me he came here to fight me and thats what he wants. Sorry bud but im not fighting over a girl, well he came here to hit me and wont leave. I said fine you need it that badly then hit me but know im not hitting you back. About this point the girl shows up i tell her go inside ill see you in a second. Moment shes inside he clocks me in the jaw, i turned away and went inside. My buddies now lose their minds because they just saw me get decked by a guy in full dress uniform  (officer cadet non the less) and they want to get revenge. I told them no its not worth it (13 guys in uniform shit stomping another guy in uniform doesn't look good) and calm them down and the guy that hits me leaves. So recap, he comes halfway across town to fight a guy over a girl, he hits a guy that wont hit him back, then the guy he hits stops him getting his ass kicked. In the end i got the girl and i looked like the bigger man, she agreed and paid for my drinks all night, jaw hurt the next morning bud i would do it again. 

TD:LR guy wanted to fight me, said no, hits me, I get the girl. ","1356998593"

Most people are only posting the nicest moments of their lives. Vacations and delicious meals, weddings, parties, limo rides, snowboarding and boating and their pets. And those are all GREAT things, but in truth, 98% of our lives are significantly more mundane than that. So I cancelled it all at least a year ago with the feeling that ""this is all bullshit"". Losing those services has made me see who my friends really are because I am closer to most of my REAL friends now than I have ever been. That being said, I'm going to go ahead and get downvoted into oblivion but I would have to ask myself, why is this friend of the ex peeping my Instagram. You posted a picture of a moment in time that was precious to you.  That moment happened in YOUR life and if choose to document it, that's your choice. Her father has a say in these things as well, and if he doesn't mind, then I don't see the harm in it. I'm not a stepmother but I imagine its a thankless job.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I would argue that if your team is 5 random people, you should try to follow the meta so that everyone else on your team knows your plan and knows what to expect.  If you have a ""troll strategy"" like going all top to rush an inhib, and can get everyone to agree to it, it can work.  However, those strategies tend to work best with a premade who are all on skype so they can communicate better.  It also works better when the other team isn't a premade and so they all run around confused instead of talking over skype and deciding who does what.  A team that rushes the top lane inhib could theoretically win easily that way, but if the other team just goes 4v5 top and defends the turret while the other person farms and gets way more experience and farm, that other person can easily shut down the other team once it gets to even just ten minutes in.  I was playing a game, and the other team went all mid.  All of our team immediately went mid except for ezreal who just farmed and pushed bot.  The other team pushed down two of our towers, and then ezreal comes back.  He's now way ahead in cs, and is level 9 compared to the enemy's levels 3 and 4.  He can completely shut all of them down and we completely dominate the rest of the game.","1356998597"

I was also probably helped out by being accidentally forewarned of the end game stuff that makes a lot of other people mad, so I was able to avoid a lot of the problems.

It's not as good as the others in the series, but it still felt like a Fable game and was a fun enough experience. If $12.49 feels like a lot of money to you and you're on the fence, maybe skip it.

We have expanded our friends to include the parents of our children's classmates.  Earlier in life I had a college fraternity living group to be that community; before that a high school... All those are other examples besides sports teams for folks who would offer grief and comfort.

All humans instinctively like to be part of a group, and facing tragedy most would want to turn to a group for support.  It makes sense that in the wake of such a tragedy people would turn to their local support groups, and in many cases for many people that is a church, plain and simple.

"LongDistance","t5_2s6ky","Some of the expectations you listed are important to good communication, in my opinion -- letting the person know when you won't be available and asking how the other person's day was. Those are reasonable expectations to have, regardless of your past relationship. Especially for the latter -- if one of you had a long absence without telling the other about it, that could cause problems, especially if either of you gets worried easily. However, this is just my opinion, and others may see things differently.

The others would depend on the person, since some may not like texting as often or might have a bad memory, etc. 

You shouldn't base future relationships on past relationships -- but if there are some things that you learned from your past relationship will make you more comfortable with the distance, you could probably talk to your current LDB about that. Don't bring up your ex, of course, but if you think it will make you feel better, you could say that. Or (like for texting before you sleep) you could just bring it up as a suggestion, and see what he thinks of the idea. 

Just remember that he is a different person and things can't be exactly the same as in your past relationship.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My school would always let the graduating class camp out in the front yard the night before the last day of school. My class got a bunch of jungle themed props and costumes and when people arrived they would be greeted by this whole scene of jungle-related nonsense. We had people in big animal suits roaming around, ""explorers"" mapping out the area, warning people to turn back, a bunch of ""savages"" in facepaint and shirtless mobbing cars. We even had one guy in a Indiana Jones suit with a whip defending the cars. And there were a bunch of oversized house plants right at the entrance to the school. It looked kinda shitty but everyone had a good time.

The year before us did a similar thing but they went with zombie apocalypse. Lots of people done up as zombies, some as FBI agents quickly ushering kids through the front door. Right inside the lobby they set up a ""decontamination area"" and I think they would randomly pull kids aside to flash lights in their eyes and stuff, it was pretty great. 

The year after ours did a Jurassic Park themed thing, but I don't remember as much of it. This weird trend of like, the mass performance art only really started a couple years ago.","1356998605"

Some of the cheapest are to have individual, traceable logins at each POS, and make the person logged in responsible for the cash drawer at the end of each shift. Missing $20? $20 comes out of your paycheck. Missing $20 several times? Write up or fired.

Similarly, you make each zone of the store or warehouse the responsibility of one person. That person checks stock weekly, and is responsible for any mismatches. You also have people spot check a zone that is not theirs weekly, and this helps eliminate stock theft.

Security cameras could be used in addition to this, as well as many other things. Is there a specific type of theft you are afraid of? Can you give us more details so we can offer better suggestions?","1356998607"

You can't produce anything if you don't first build factories and mining equipment and railroads, etc. As we move into an increasingly automated world some things can be accomplished with only a few workers but will still require massive investment of resources. And it has to be long term to. It can take many years before some investment ever produces anything of value, and even longer before it pays itself off. Also there is a large element of predicting what the supply of future resources will be and what the demand for them will be, so you can prepare for the future accordingly.

Your system accomplishes none of this. No worker want to work for years and years on something that isn't even guaranteed to ever turn a profit. Even if they are willing, they alone probably won't own all the resources required to start such a project. No investment markets means there will be pretty much no investment other than the small amount from new workers, and commodity prices will be a lot more volatile.","1356998608"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I think if you're genuinely interested in being successful with the SRS crowd you're going to have to be patient, have a lot of humility, and be really open-minded.  You are going to be corrected when you say something.

And that's a GOOD thing.  Part of speaking is being responsible to your audience and being responsible for what you say.  Part of it is to detatch your ego from it and let people dissect it.  It's OK.  But you're going to have to be open.  I honestly don't think that women (or anyone) has the strength to be as hateful as some people imagine SRS to be so constantly.  They know that everyone is at a different stage of being unwound from the mess of patriarchy.  They know it's gonna take a fuckton of a lot of time to fix.  I think they're just trying to put one foot in front of the other and put in daily effort to make some differences where they can.

But you have to be OK with being wrong.  It's not about you, or your goodness or your worthwhileness as a person.  It's about the assumptions you have about how the world operates and how they need a tune up so that other people can have some freedom.  Quit feeling attacked.  It's not about you.  It's about ideas that have been HURTING PEOPLE for a long, long time.

&gt;Do you think religion is the core cause of all wars, though? 

All wars? No. Greed is probably the biggest cause for modern (past 400 years) wars, but historically, yeah, religion's pretty much the culprit behind every major conflict. When the church is also the government, every war is a religious war. 

&gt;Also, what do you think non-religious people grasp onto during times of stress, crisis, and despair? 

Family. Friends. Spouses. Loved ones. Human nature doesn't change just because you're not religious. 

&gt;Personally, I am against religious and culturally restrictive environments that prevent anyone regardless of sexual orientation, from living life to its fullest.

I'm against indoctrination and willful ignorance. I hate that children are forced to attend religious services. They don't have the critical thinking skills to make sense of what they're being told, so like everything at that age, they rely on their parents to let them know they're not being lied to. It creates a tragic cycle of kids indoctrinated by parents that were indoctrinated as kids. 

Even worse, because the basic nature of religion is to control people, when you get charismatic leaders that want to reinforce their positions, the first thing they do is create an opposition to rally against, an us-vs-them scenario that discredits and dehumanizes the opposition so there's no way for the indoctrinated to rationally analyze the situation. In the US, it's gotten especially bad since the charismatic leaders have had to resort to anti-intellectualism to keep their adherents so irrationally ignorant as to be immune to reason.

You have one, don't you?

Why would you assume that those who died long ago would understand the afterlife completely? They didn't even understand their own lives. For all you know, the God of the Old Testament is Satan in pleasing shape. The serpent is subtle, after all, and the desire for revenge is one of the most basic of instincts. 

Then there's the New Testament, which brought us Hell to begin with. Did you know that Jesus went to Hell after he died? 

Some people swear he led the damned good out of the fires. 

This much is true - eternal torture isn't an act of love, unless your definition of love is twisted poison...

So Christians have a choice. Accept that God is love and mercy, or continue to try to scare people into obedience. One is divine. The other, the legacy of an all too familiar hate, inspired by the quest for power.

To which will they give their loyalty? 

It'll be fascinating to watch.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","TL;DR: location/timing, give her an easy exit (car), focus on yourself and your feelings and how they've changed, stress the fact that it's not about her, give her the option of friendship (if you want to) and stick to it.

Sorry to hear about the impending breakup.

* Find a private place at a good time to have the talk, preferably one where she is in control (e.g. she brought her own car)

* Tell her how you feel. Make sure to place a lot of emphasis on yourself (e.g. ""I've been doing a lot of thinking over the last few months and I think it's time for us to break up. This has next to nothing to do with you -- you are a great person and I know your next boyfriend will be lucky to have you. I don't know how it happened, but I slowly realized that I do not love you the same way you love me anymore. So it's better for both of us if we break up. Again, you didn't do anything ""wrong"", this isn't about you so much as it is about me realizing that our time is over. I'm sorry. This was a great relationship and I'm happy for the time we got to spend together."")

* Of course, change the above as you see fit. Just an example.

* If she responds well, tell her you still want to be friends (if you do), if she wants to.

* If she responds poorly, tell her that you will not be contacting her because you do not want to prolong any heartache or difficulty for her.

* You can also be open to being friends later, once the heartache has passed.

* Whether you two decide to remain friends or not, stick to what you said. Either contact her as friends or don't.

Good luck!","1356998616"

"electronics","t5_2qhue","The [wikipedia article for op-amps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier) and [op-amp applications](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier_applications) is a great resource.  I'm not going to go into a terrible amount of detail here, but to get you started you need to know your ideal op-amp rules.  In this circuit, there are three relevant rules (they are not the only ones, though):

* No current flows into the op-amp's input terminals (i.e., infinite input impedance)
* The voltage difference between the input terminals is always zero (i.e., V+ = V-)
* The op-amp has infinite current sourcing ability (i.e., zero output impedance)

Using these properties will allow you to analyze most op-amp circuits.  Real op-amps will not have this ideal performance, but they will be pretty damn close.

For the circuit you posted, the op-amp is acting as a [voltage follower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_amplifier_applications#Voltage_follower_.28Unity_Buffer_Amplifier.29).  The op-amp power rails are Vcc and GND.  The output of the op-amp is tied to the inverting input.  I assume SIG is a digital signal, so it is either at Vcc or GND.  It doesn't have to be, as the circuit would work with any voltage in between, but for the sake of argument let's assume it is a digital signal.  Let's say SIG is at Vcc.  This will put the non-inverting input at Vcc also.  According to the second rule, this would also put the inverting input at Vcc, and since it is tied to the output, the output must also be at Vcc.  On the other hand, if the non-inverting input is at GND, the same rules apply and the output will be at ground.  The output will ""follow"" whatever voltage you put in the non-inverting input, hence the name ""follower"".

In this circuit the op-amp is being used to buffer the SIG line.  This is useful if the SIG line is something like an IC output that cannot source much current.  If you try to light the LED directly from the SIG line and it is not capable of sourcing the required current, its output voltage would drop and the LED might not light up.  However, we can connect the op-amp in the follower configuration to solve this problem.  According to the first rule, the op-amp inputs will draw no current from the SIG line, so we don't have to worry about SIG's current sourcing ability.  From our previous analysis, we know the output of the op-amp will ""follow"" the voltage at the non-inverting input - great!  Now, according to the third rule, the op-amp can supply whatever amount of current needed on the output, so we are guaranteed the LED will light up fully when connected to the output of the op-amp.

In the real world things are not perfect but are pretty close.  The input impedance of a real op-amp is high, but not infinite; in other words, the inputs will draw *some* current, but typically a very tiny amount.  The output impedance is not zero either - the op-amp can only supply a finite amount of current.  These figures can be found in the op-amp's datasheet.  For the LV321 used in this circuit, the inputs draw no more than 250 nanoamps - which is essentially zero compared to the other currents in the circuit. The datasheet specifies the op-amp can typically source up to 160 milliamps - more than enough to drive the LED.

There are more non-ideal characteristics than can be dealt with, but for this circuit, this should put you on the right track.","1356998618"

by having to cook one dinner a week while son #2 doesn't cook for reasons beyond everyone's control, there is a much bigger issue there. I almost never tell people that their feelings are wrong, but feeling that way for that reason is wrong. It is just once/week. Tough love would be to tell him that he'll feel even more heaped on when he has to cook every dinner every night for himself at a 700% increase over the current cooking schedule.

In other words: Take the focus off of the comparison and put it on the lesson that son #1 is supposed to be learning. The easy way out, for him, ('cause at our base all humans are lazy) is to point out how much more work he's got. Don't let him manipulate the focus of the conversation.

Do you think that any country will be able to attack the USA and win? Even without winning, do you think any country will risk the damage to their own country? Yes, there are terrorists but other countries deal with those too without spending as much money.

You can't of course just cut the military spending by half but you can slowly reducing the spending. You just hire less, buy less and people that leave the military will go to school and study something that will be useful to grow the economy.","1356998625"

I think that the harsh truth here is that they already don't give a damn about you, if they make no effort in staying in touch with you and you have to do all the work (essentially ""caretaking"" in No More Mr. Nice Guy words).

The logic goes something like this:

* I won't be able to make new friends.

* Therefore, I must make sure I don't lose my current ones.

* Therefore I'll be nice to them.

And this doesn't work, because social relationships don't work by people being ""nice"" all the time.

The problem is that for us FAs the first premise seems true, because we have put ourselves in a situation where we have poor social skills and few social opportunities. That's what we're trying to fix here in a nutshell. Of course, that's easier said than done.","1356998631"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","See everyone is taking the moral highground in this conversation but I don't think he's talking about that.

Imagine you're in a bar and some dick head might be calling you out for whatever stupid reason.  The logical thing is to walk away.  But let's say this asshole is saying just the right things that sound humiliating and belittling.  Let's say you might even be a little scared and not want to fight, but you might feel pressure if your friends are present, but that pressure is double so if your girlfriend is there.  I'm talking more when you are young though.

My little story on this there was a time I walked into a house party (way back when I was young punk) and some guy started with me the second I walked in.  I mean as soon as I was coming in, he was just being an asshole and punking people off.  So I stood there a bit trying to figure out what was going on and it turned out some of his friends knew my friends and this situation got defused.  But enough words were said that at the time I felt embarrassed.   

What made it 10 times worse is my girlfriend was there.  I felt I should have fought but didn't and the moment was gone.  It's so long ago I can't remember exactly what she said but I talked about it with my girlfriend that night and even telling her how I felt that it bothered me in front of her.  Anyway, she said something along the lines of being embarrassed for me and I could just see the look in her eyes, it made me feel shame.   And this wasn't some chick who was like, 'kick his ass!' kind of girl.  She was a caring intelligent girl, but I could tell she wanted me to 'be the man' and give him what he deserved.  

On an intellectual level  asking her she would say I did the right thing, but on that 'cavewoman' level I did not.  

So to OP asking this question is almost useless because you are not going to get a truthful answer even if the women try to be truthful.

Look, if you can build something with tools and wood you'll get the majority of women in the mood.  I don't mean that to insult women, but for the most part it's true.

Shared ownership turns this into a mess. Parking spots in some areas are scarce, and it's hard to justify denying someone the right to park in a good space just because somebody else cleared it first. Maybe the 2nd guy would have been equally willing to put in the work. And how many spaces should one person be able to claim? What if he clears the whole street? Obviously a person deserves some compensation for the work involved in removing snow from a parking space, but since the other owners never consented to anything, denying them access to their shared property isn't right either.

Park on your own property and avoid these types of issues.","1356998642"

"aquaponics","t5_2rioe","Great question. It's one I took a serious look at, and formed a side project/startup around ([AutoMicroFarm](http://automicrofarm.com)).

It's a lot easier to get all your food needs from aquaponics if you and your family is vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian. However, if you're not, you can still get the majority of your food from aquaponics if you also keep chickens similar to what the family behind [Garden Pool](http://gardenpool.org) does.

We used a somewhat stricter calculation method than the Portable Farm page (mentioned in another comment in this thread) did to arrive at our answer, and came up with 50 ft^3 (50 ft^2 with a standard 1-foot depth) per adult person if you can achieve harvest yields of **20 lbs per ft^3 annually**.

We wrote up a blog post about our experimental results [here](http://blog.automicrofarm.com/post/33607287873/the-ending-of-the-barrel-ponics-chapter); the short answer is that we were able to achieve 10 lb per ft^3 without any sort of optimization, and without harvesting the fish.

This is where we come up with the claim that you can grow most of the food your family might need in an area the size of a two-car garage (~400 ft^2 or more).

Our vision at AutoMicroFarm is to offer everything from parts to a kit to eventually a full system + assembly for anyone with at least that big of yard or space (which should include most rural and suburban houses and even some urban ones).

Before Gan-Jing the Explorer reached the eastern edge of the world and the great waters there, he first encountered the Bay of Peaches. When he first set sight upon the cold waters there, it is said that the sight of thousands of peaches floating in the water were at first mistaken for spirits. A scout was dispatched to investigate, and returned with armfuls of the now-famed bay peaches.

The bay peaches themselves are only distantly related to the peaches which normally grow on the mainland, and the misnaming of them can be attributed to the fact that Gan-Jing's expedition did not have a botanist in its ranks. Bay peaches are nearly white and perfectly spherical, with a firm white skin that scratches easily but not deeply. The hills that surround the southern side of the Bay of Peaches are smooth and rolling, covered with a soft moss beneath the peach trees that goes slick with the rain. The bay peach trees sit over this moss and drop their fruit twice a year, once in the early summer and once again in the late fall. The bay peaches drop onto the moss, and when the rains come the bay peaches are swept down the hills and into the Bay itself, whose cold waters preserve them for months after they fall.

The waters of the Bay of Peaches never rise much above forty degrees, which makes the land surrounding it cool throughout the year. In the center of the bay are two small islands, White Island, named for the highly acidic white stone that leaves it devoid of plant life, and Shell Rock, named for its distinctive spiral shape that many believe was carved into it by a lost civilization.

In the modern day, the Bay of Peaches is beset on all sides by civilization. The bay peaches themselves are confined to numerous tightly packed orchards, while the great city of Lang-Tao, capital of the Golden Empire, takes up much of the western shore of the Bay. The relatively narrow outflow from the Bay to the Eastern Ocean is dominated on either side by large forts with ballista set atop them. The bay peaches for which the area is named no longer float upon the water.","1356998648"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yep. I've used my martial arts skills a few times and they've helped me out in the few situations I've had to use it. 

I took up martial arts as a kid, primarily since I used to be picked on a lot as a kid and wanted to defend myself in a self defense situation. Even though I'm pretty tall, I was also chubby, wore glasses, lacked any athletic ability and was pretty shy, so I was an easy target to bully.

My martial arts background: 

-1st Degree Black Belt in Matsubayshi Ryu Karate

-Brown Belt in Kung Fu San Soo (though I had start again due to being away for a long time and am currently a white belt again) 

and have had some basic training in Tae Kwon Do, Hapkido, Doce Pares Escrima and Tai Chi.

So here's two example of how I used my martial arts training 

**Situation 1:** This was back when I was starting out in karate in jr. high (so about late 1998-1999). This Filipino kid liked to pick on me through ought 7th and 8th grade and one day, when we were leaving P.E. Class, I ended up throwing a quick backfist to his head after he was trying to poke and slap me, while insulting me about something. Though my plastic Timex watch actually made contact his face more than my actually fist and it was more of a tap than a full on powerful strike, he was taken back and gave me this pissed off look and got the message not to mess with me anymore. He and pretty much anyone who had been messing with me at school at that point, completely stopped after that incident.

**Situation 2:** Its a pretty long story, but I'll try to condense it down.

So I was at an anime convention a few years back and at some point, i went to the nearby Denny's with a couple of my hotel roommates, Randy and Jim, for dinner. 

As we waited for our order in the waiting area at Denny's, Jim suddenly tells me I made his female friend (who had been rooming with us, until she suddenly moved out, claiming her other friends invited her to stay with with them) cry and extremely depressed and that was the real reason she left. As I'm about to say ""Eh? What are you talking about?"", he decides to sucker punch me with a one knuckle punch to my thigh, giving me a deep bruise and left me in pain for a bit. 

(Keep in mind, neither me, Randy or anyone else heard about this crying/depression thing Jim apparently made up and in fact, when I called her to ask why she left, she told me that she just wanted to move into a bigger hotel room with her other friends that invited her and there was no animosity between her and I. She also would pay me for the couple of nights she stayed with us and didn't know what Jim was talking about in the first place)

As I'm grabbing my thigh and screaming ""You son of a bitch! What the hell was that for?!"", Randy confronts Jim and tells him that it was totally messed up and uncalled for, while Jim just acts like he doesn't care and makes it seem like I deserved it and was ready to hit me again.  

As Randy continues confronting Jim, I positioned my body at an angle and wound up my upper body, and the second Jim stopped talking to him and turned towards me, I unwound my upper body and while stepping forward, performed a long arm throat strike/choke, slamming Jim's head into the wall with a very loud thud. (It basically was one of the moves from the hand form I was learning at Kung Fu class)

I kid you not, the whole restaurant literally went dead silent for almost 30 seconds, since there's now a 6'1 guy who just slammed a scrawny Taiwanese guy's head into the wall by and is holding him there by his throat. Eventually I let go and  people resumed eating like nothing happened. 

We get our food and walk back to our room, with Jim being totally disoriented and screaming that what I did was totally uncalled for, to which my friend and I point out that he started it by punching me and that I had defended myself as he threw the first punch and I wasn't in the mood to see if he wanted to hit me again. 

Randy took me aside later and told me he almost pissed in his pants because he didn't even see me grab his throat, but instead saw what he called ""An Asian blur"", because it happened so fast, seeing Jim just standing there and in a split second hearing a loud thud and seeing Jim's head already slammed into the wall, with no transition inbetween.

**TL;DR** - Got sucker punched by my roommate at a Denny's after falsely accusing me of making his friend cry and become depressed, I ended up grabbing his throat and slamming his head into the wall, with a technique I learned in a kung fu hand form. He then tried to act like I was in the wrong for defending myself.

Similarly, everyone pays for schools, whether or not they have school-age children.

Government is charged with spending money on things like infrastructure and schools, and it's also charged with raising the revenue to do it. When it comes to taxation, simple economics tells us that taxes have the effect of influencing behavior as well as the effect of raising revenue.

Gasoline consumption, just like cigarette consumption, has many deleterious side effects. Therefore we tax each. That we then have money to spend on things like roads and lung cancer research is a side effect of these taxes, but what the money is spent on is irrelevant. If the gas tax money were spent on lung cancer research and the cigarette tax money were spent on roads, would anyone then care about EVs not paying gas tax?

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt; The Militia Acts were created and passed AFTER the passage of the Bill of Rights (and with it the Second Amendment)

1 year after. I hardly believe that the meaning of the words 'regulated' and 'militia' changed so substantially within 1 year. Also, does that mean that you don't consider the Militia Acts to be Constitutional? The Supreme Court insofar hasn't declared the National Guard unconstitutional.

&gt; In spite of coming afterward, for some ""inexplicable"" reason, there is no text within saying anything about the Militia Acts clarifying, amending, or superseding the Second Amendment

No, because Federal Law cannot alter the Constitution, but I am using it to clarify the meanings of those words in that period.

&gt; As you even noted yourself, the passage of the acts was as a precursor to the creation of the National Guard -- a.k.a. ""The Organized Militia""

Which was what was implied by ""well-regulated"".

&gt; The ""militia"" as mentioned in the 2A, which predates the Organized Militia (of ""Militia Acts"" fame), and has been very clearly recorded, via many writings of the time, as referring to ""the unorganized militia"" as we now call it -- the ""all the qualified citizens"" that you and I have both defined.

The Continental Army organized the local militias (""Minutemen"") in a similar fashion to the Militia Acts, and Congress authorized themselves during the Revolutionary War to give orders to the militia. The Continental Congress considered the Minutemen to be regulated in the sense that they could be organized by the military and conscripted into it as well.

&gt; You can deny that the 2A's militia is a separate entity from the later-defined National Guard / Organized Militia, but your denial doesn't change the chronology, the historical record, or any of the other facts.

Except that you're misinterpreting all three.","1356998661"

Holes go critical at 10% of total hole mass, which would be about a battleship or less of difference in mass (even at -20%). We use a carrier and 4 battleships.

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","&gt;While there are pressing matters of life and death going on on earth, while men every day everywhere on the surface of the planet choose to rip our mother’s body apart, drill iron rods into her, and rip out her intestines, because they think it is their right, as men, as kings of the world, to just take whatever they need or want, from her.

Or, you know, we have an industrial society whose industrial products go to both men and women (actually, women control most household spending), and the gender role of men has historically been and continues to be to work in the extractive industries, because 1) these require more physical strength, 2) they're more dangerous and men dominate nearly all of the most-deadly industries, and 3) these industries have become associated culturally with men, encouraging male participation and discouraging female participation. That could have something to do with why most miners, lumberjacks, etc. are men. Not because men hate Mother Earth- because our current socio-economic system, which relates to the Earth in a shortsighted way, also relegates these very strenuous, low-paid, dangerous jobs to men. 

&gt;So instead of figuring out ever more elegant ways of communicating with our sister species and life forms, humans have shut ourselves out from the conversation and have resorted to commands.

Actually, under the 'phallogocentric' scientific method, we are finding more and more ways to understand how communication among animal species works, to the point where we probably understand the communication of animals outside of our species better than any other species understand communication of animals outside of their own species.

&gt;men talk to the earth in demands: give me your oil! give me your meat! give me your vagina! give me your uterus! give me your children! give me your wood! give me your energy! give me your water! give me your power! And for what?

Men also say:

""We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect.""- Aldo Leopold

and:

""Individuals do not exist in isolation, but in relationship and that individual existents are unique (and irreplaceable in the future) by virtue of the special set of relationships in which only they are (and can remain) embedded. The world is therefore seen in organismic terms rather than mechanical ones, in terms of interacting processes and fields rather than isolated things, and socially, in terms of an extended ecological community rather than in terms of essentially separate, competing individuals.""- Alan Drengson

&gt;I don’t think we would have been interested in developing any technologies that are dependent on the reckless exploitation of our earth, of which we are a part. Because for some reason, women as a group know that we are not independent from our surroundings.

Wait, for it! Here comes the unsupported self-flattering gender essentialism!

&gt;If we’re open enough, we can feel the voice of the whole inside of us, leading us, telling us what to do to grow and make more life, more energy. If we have not forgotten, we know that the forces outside of us and the forces inside of us are connected. The moon swells and ebbs, and so do our wombs, our breasts. So does all of nature.

There it is! Glorious essentialist-ecofem non-argument of the day! Women would be able to design and maintain a global system of civilization that is sustainable, because women have periods and the moon sometimes looks different because the Earth gets between it and the sun! Checkmate, men!

Yeeeeah, I think we're done here.  If anyone needs me, my beardy, penis-having self will be busy studying the roots of environmental degradation in economic systems, unrestrained industrialism and consumer society, collective action problems and market failures, ignorance, and ideology. You know, the stuff that's actually causing it. ","1356998679"
"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Beware, fellow traveler, because you ask a question that puzzled mathematicians for centuries, and would typically be covered in an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in mathematics.

Strictly speaking, 1 + 2 + 4 + ... is a divergent series, because the individual terms get larger and larger. However mathematicians have devised ""summability"" methods for dealing with divergent series which can allow us to evaluate divergent series to arrive at specific values. For example, summability methods allow us to show that

1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1/2

1 + 1 + 1 + ... = -1/2

1 - 2 + 3 - 4 + ... = 1/4

1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... = -1

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series) for a discussion on summation methods for divergent series. 
tl;dr: There are certain ""tricks"" we can use when summing divergent series (regularity, linearity, and stability) that guarantee consistency (we will always end up with the same sum). Here is how these tricks are used in the summation of ∑ 2^n:

s = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... 

= 1 + (2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + ...)  &lt;--- stability: we can ""suck out"" the first term

= 1 + 2 (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ...) &lt;--- linearity: we can multiply/divide an infinite series by a constant

= 1 + 2s 

Solving for s, 

s = -1.

We have to be careful about how we sum a divergent series. If we just try to use elementary tricks like ""telescoping,"" it can lead to inconsistency. For example, you could try to show

1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ... = 0 + 0 + ... = 0

but

1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ... = 1 - (1 - 1) - (1 - 1) - ... = 1 - 0 - 0 - ... = 1.

This is why we have to be careful about how we sum divergent series.

And, I meant that it doesn't mean that it has more, obviously. But different types of liquors are in the same vicinity alcohol content wise. That's kind of what makes them a specific type of liquor -- the way that they are produced. OP was saying that his ""2 expensive drinks"" got him more drunk than 2 not-so-expensive drinks. Which isn't true. Higher quality liquor may taste better, it may go down smoother, that's about it.

Cabs don't exist where you're from? Cool, but that doesn't mean jack shit about drinking and driving. Oh, and you do have a taxi service where you are from, just FYI.

I attack people? Hahaha, it's funny because your only comment was attacking me for saying that people shouldn't drink and drive. 

As for being irresponsible, I wasn't talking about just drinking and driving, I was talking about your post history. But yes, having a drink and then driving is pretty irresponsible in the sense that it shows that you did not really have a plan. One drink can easily turn into one more, and one more, and then you are fucked.Literally having 1 beer and driving isn't necessarily irresponsible, obviously. It's the fact that you failed to plan ahead.

Having said that, not everyone is the same, and not every state is the same. Some states you can get a ticket for impaired driving, even if you are not at .08 BAC, and if you don't metabolize alcohol fast enough, one beer could put you over that limit...

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Although there may be some who post things that sound negative towards children, ""child-hating subreddit"" is a ridiculous exaggeration. I seriously doubt that there are very many people in the group who actually ""hate"" children. If they do, I mean, who cares? I hate skiing, but you don't see the world of Reddit being that concerned.

{I'm sure this is the point where you'll pull up an example post that looks like hate language to you, as evidence that every single person and post on the subreddit = child hate.}

I'm actually pretty hurt that we're all being blasted as child-haters. Most of us like children or love children. Some are apathetic but certainly not hateful. We need a place where we can talk to each other about important topics to us. But like most places on the internet, the more people know about it, the more out-of-hand it gets, and then negative posts start showing up instead of informative ones. 

Bottom-line, there's still posts on it that are relevant to me. I ignore the stuff that essentially belongs on r/shittyparenting (unless I actually want to read about it). If it truly gets too bad, I'll leave the group. But I think you are exaggerating by calling it a ""child-hating subreddit"".","1356998682"

As the great thing about relationships and social dynamics is that they act like market forces and are self-regulating in that regard. You 'price' your expectations and demands to high and act too entitled and you've effectively priced yourself out of the market and misjudged the worth of your commodity and nobody will buy.

It's kind of what has happened here a bit. These men have looked at the [Salaryman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaryman) lifestyle their fathers led and just don't want any part of it. They'd rather just live on a lower income and pursue the things they like. Japanese women seem to complain about how the herbivore men aren't outgoing and engaging enough. It's them and the media that seems to have the problem with the Herbavoire men. They feel the herbivore men should conform to their expectations because they are men and not acting like men. If they are the ones with the problem and the Herbavoire men are content with their lifestyle, why should the Herbavoire men change? 

I do think the Herbavoire men have gone a bit form one extreme to the other, where they've rejected the Salaryman life their fathers led and have perhaps gotten a bit extreme in their lifestyle but once again it's market forces where they are going against the structures and expectations of society and it's not going to change overnight to a more moderate middle ground. They've gone to a bit of an extreme because they've been forced to a bit of an extreme where it's either meet the high inflexible expectations of society or don't. It's hard to avoid going to an extreme if there is no middle ground. ","1356998687"

I usually use a leveling up analogy. ""Best friend"" isn't a one slot position that only one person can occupy at any time. It's more like a level of closeness in a relationship and there isn't necessarily a max number of people that can occupy it but there *is* a intimacy requirement to get on that level. Since there's a million different ways that you can grow close to someone there's also a million different reasons you can be someone's ""best friend"" whether it's growing up together and sharing all your childhood memories, going through a rough patch in life together, sharing an interest or hobby that no one else has.

I think that's why you tend to see women listing their best friends as all having had come from a different sphere of their lives. You're young, you become close, you get older, you move on to different things..but it doesn't negate the bond that you have with the other girl.

He's not saying he gets to not play anytime he wants. He can't fake a doctor's recommendation not to play. He just wants to be able to follow that advice without penalty.

Imagine if your boss is skeptical of the advice of medical professionals. You get sick and your doctor says you shouldn't work. But your boss disagrees and forces you to work, saying that ""it's a business"" and he ""has to make money"". This wouldn't be allowed in the physical illness case. Are you really saying that the Rockets should have the right to go against medical advice or just *mental* medical advice? If the latter, what's your basis for taking mental health less seriously?

Your particular situation is pretty shit, and in another post I explained that most of the piracy for stuff out in theaters comes from people in situations like yours.

We have people at our dealership that come and waste time all year and buy everything online or buy a bike 1000 miles away without even seeing if we have something comparable. Some people even have the nerve to have things like tires or accessories (that we have in stock) shipped to us, and then want a discount putting them on. This probably isn't you, but it's a slippery slope, and of course we won't treat people that do that crap as well as those that consistently purchase things from us. Most regular customers also get discounts on pretty much everything we sell (including service) so the price thing doesn't even come into play.

The first thing I try to do is see which lanes are pushing the hardest and would be the easiest to gank. Then I see if the jungler I'm facing likes to counter jungle or however they play. Finally I see which teammates of mine are then best and who can help carry the game. Lets say mid and top are pushing, but mid seems to be a weak player, and top is a fairly decent player. If both lanes are pushing, when I gank mid I wanna take the kills, I know this seems selfish but it's just how you play solo, when ganking top I want to let him get most of the kills so he can help me carry. Sorry if this doesn't help, but this is what I've been doing and I go positive every game and win most of them. Also check out rumiah on YouTube.

Your story isn't the type of thing I've had to deal with. I've been DJing for several years around Las Vegas both in clubs and the occasional parties (like ""raves"" but usually in legit venues). I play house music mostly but know my way around most EDM genres and will definitely go where the crowd takes me. However, nothing is more infuriating than some asshole coming up to me and asking me to ""play hiphop so he can dance with some hoes"" and telling me ""nobody likes this shit. play some fucking lil wayne"" even though the club is packed and people are having a good time. 

I have NO issue playing stuff for people that fits into what I'm booked to play. I'll play pretty much anything EDM and will even work my way towards requests to make it fit with the set (sometimes it takes a few tracks to get to the song they want to hear without it sounding out of place). But I'm not gonna spin ""all I want for my birthday is a big booty hoe"" into an otherwise 130BPM 4-to-the-floor set because some guys asks for it. Lots of clubs in Vegas cater to that type of music and people have came to this club to hear EDM/House.

Lesson one: Fact check partisan bullshit, like here:  

""On average, the wealthiest people in America pay a lot more taxes than the middle class or the poor, according to private and government data. They pay at a higher rate, and as a group, they contribute a much larger share of the overall taxes collected by the federal government.""

http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/perfi/taxes/story/2011-09-20/buffett-tax-millionaires/50480226/1

Then, find actual facts, like from the CBO, for example:

""The top 1 percent, who President Obama has made a target during the presidential campaign, earns 13.4 percent of all pre-tax income, but paid 22.3 percent of taxes""

""Wealthy Americans earn about 50 percent of all income but pay nearly 70 percent of the federal tax burden, according to the latest analysis Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office.""

""the bottom 20 percent of American earners paid just three-tenths of a percent of the total tax burden, while the richest 20 percent paid 67.9 percent of taxes.""

""The big losers over the last few years were the rest of the well-off, especially those in the top fifth, who saw their tax burdens go up.""

""On average, the lowest 40 percent of earners actually get money back through the income-tax code because of refundable tax credits.""

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","What you skip or not is going to be dependant on the class you play, wether you play HC or not and if it's your first char/you're trying to race. This last part is especially important imo as for example you can run a few different classes through medecine chest/glyph to get certain spells ready so you can skip medecine on your main, it'll reduce your /played but overall it takes longer. It's still useful to get more than one spell in a particular list(for example getting summon zombie, phase run and firestorm/icespear/EK as a summoner)

Generally I skip the beach besides Hillock obviously, skip the first area besides a couple of packs to hit lvl 2, skip Medecine chest if I don't need the spell(Hailrake is annoying to kill and can even be dangerous on HC at lvl 2), skip mud flats entirely just doing the glyphs and skip fetid pool until I need respec points(like at lvl 30-40) and only start leveling in underground. I do the crab there for the skill point quest, it's easy enough and it helps reaching early important passives. Then I run the ledge 3-4times to catch up on levels and then skip everything up to brutus. Maybe kill a few packs here and there. Then skip everything up to the coves, clear it like twice and go kill merveil by skipping the dungeons again. Sometimes do the Allflame, sometimes do it later, depends on the class, if I have summons I'll do it cause zombies are good at reducing the potential dmg from flicker mobs but if I'm like a on melee I'm not doing it until I'm like 18-20.

For act2 I don't care that much about skipping zones entirely and often stop to kill large group of mobs. However I start by going left first to the west forest, get the skill point quest there, kill Alira, then go back and do Weaver in the zone before, then I go to the other side, do the bandit and sins while skipping white beast and the church(sometimes clear fellshrine ruins up to the waypoint in church though for xp) and then go finish the game without skipping too much to have a comfortable level for Vaal.

Unless you're racing though it doesn't really make that much of a difference, you might take twice as long to level up but all in all leveling is still fairly fast(I mean when doing the on lvl content, after you start doing maps it slows down quite a lot due to the lvl difference).","1356998739"

Long story, but XXXXX by the way, was one of four classmates I had that set off a dry ice bomb in front of an administrators house one night. 2 of the 4 included our valedvictorian and our saludatorian. So they weren't your typical ""bad kids,"" (I did far far worse things in highschool) they were just doing a stupid highschool prank.

Unfortunately the administrator was a minor version of professor Umbridge, and not only hired people to find video of who had purchased dry ice, but wanted to prosecute them as fully as possible. I shit-you-not, there was talk about bringing them up on ""terrorism"" &amp; ""creating an explosive device"" charges or some such. The two minors of the group eventually got 30 days in juvie, the ""adults"" got probation.

All top students, and they all got fucked over on college stuff - delayed applications to their colleges, etc, not to mention records, because they were stupid one night and an administrator couldn't fathom a large noise outside her house in a very rich, safe, suburban neighborhood.

1 year after. I hardly believe that the meaning of the words 'regulated' and 'militia' changed so substantially within 1 year. Also, does that mean that you don't consider the Militia Acts to be Constitutional? The Supreme Court insofar hasn't declared the National Guard unconstitutional.

&gt; In spite of coming afterward, for some ""inexplicable"" reason, there is no text within saying anything about the Militia Acts clarifying, amending, or superseding the Second Amendment

No, because Federal Law cannot alter the Constitution, but I am using it to clarify the meanings of those words in that period.

&gt; As you even noted yourself, the passage of the acts was as a precursor to the creation of the National Guard -- a.k.a. ""The Organized Militia""

Which was what was implied by ""well-regulated"".

&gt; The ""militia"" as mentioned in the 2A, which predates the Organized Militia (of ""Militia Acts"" fame), and has been very clearly recorded, via many writings of the time, as referring to ""the unorganized militia"" as we now call it -- the ""all the qualified citizens"" that you and I have both defined.

The Continental Army organized the local militias (""Minutemen"") in a similar fashion to the Militia Acts, and Congress authorized themselves during the Revolutionary War to give orders to the militia. The Continental Congress considered the Minutemen to be regulated in the sense that they could be organized by the military and conscripted into it as well.

&gt; You can deny that the 2A's militia is a separate entity from the later-defined National Guard / Organized Militia, but your denial doesn't change the chronology, the historical record, or any of the other facts.

[Jojo OP 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHUi90ouqmU): I think this gets the edge for me over the first.  I just get this James Bond sort of vibe from both the visuals and art, and I'm totally digging it.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","99.9% of us haven't played in the NFL, but I'll do my best to explain. 

Getting hit hurts, so it's all about learning how to take a hit (or avoid them). Running backs get hit the most, since they can have anywhere from 15-30 touches per game, getting tackled probably ~25 times (some teams have plays that intentionally lead the back to run out of bounds so they avoid taking unnecessary hits). The guys in the NFL are some of the fastest and strongest athletes in the world, so it's unimaginable how hard they hit the first time you watch a game live.

You won't hurt as badly immediately after the game as you will the next morning. Waking up is painful, rolling over is a strain and moving can be unbearable, but you learn how to take care of your body, using ice from the trainers to relieve the muscles. Days after games are used for recovery and watching game film. 

Training for taking hits just comes from years of playing. You will never really get ""used"" to being hit, you just learn how to ignore the soreness and you learn how to take care of yourself to prevent injury. ","1356998747"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I gave you a link, but here's more raw data.

The top 1% is shrinking in both threshold, and the number of people there due to the participation rate declining to 60% by 2018 (Throughout the 90s and 2000s, labor participation was 67%, 60% is the lowest of any first world nation... Canada is around 66% presently)

While the top 50% have seen a decline of AGI in the 4% range, the top 1% have seen a decline of almost 20%.

Furthermore their ranks are shrinking, offshoring is increasing (1.5 trillion in 2012 just with the F500 companies, up from 300 billion in 2004) and people are moving abroad at a record pace.

http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?DocID=533&amp;Topic2id=30&amp;Topic3id=39

In the UK, for instance, the top 1% pay 27% of HMRC tax revenue, in the US these numbers are 36.73%.  It's been declining more and more, and will continue to do so, as they leave.

Here's the BLS' numbers on workforce participation:
http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS11300000

60% has never happened, but the BLS says it will by 2018.  How you pay for a social welfare state with only 60% of people working, and most of the rich and businesses offshoring their cash is beyond me.

Closing 'loopholes' won't work either, they will just *permanently* move.  The Treasury only keeps track of expatriating citizens with &gt;2 million in capital gains (thus part of the tax to leave), but the real numbers are much much higher.  Last time I was in Switzerland (last year) they had a 1.5 year wait to do it at their embassy, which equates to at least 1300 people going through a single embassy already *booked*

Nose: Rich, sweet and inviting, vanilla/toffee, green jolly ranchers, slight leather…I could smell this all night

Taste: Heavy spiced orange peel. There are other fruits here as well that play a backup role, I’m getting smooth pears and barely unripe sweet cherries. Mild to medium rich chocolate and toffee with slight old leather and oak. This is fantastic…

Finish: Spice, oak, and fresh citrus with dried dark fruit that sits on the tongue for a bit. The majority of the party leaves well before I would like, but 2 minutes after a sip and I still get a nice raisin/smoke when I breathe out of my nose.  90% medium-medium long/ 10% very long

Conclusion:  I love this…complexity, inviting, provocative, and a somewhat mysterious with a little kick that’ll numb the tongue. I sat down for a while with this one and there are still more discoveries to be made here…too bad it was just a sample size.

Not taking a phone to school? Really? I'm not saying that he has every right to use it in class, but come on. Let's say me misses the bus, and he has to call his mom/dad's work phone number. Chances are, he doesn't know it, but would be in his contacts.

And if the contract is *that* long, it seems to point out that they have decreased trust in their son. If they don't fully trust him, why get him a phone in the first place?

EDIT: and who the hell watches porn on a screen *that* small? Yes, it has a bigger screen, but really...","1356998762"
"ideasfortheadmins","t5_2qqhi","There's nothing wrong with being an etymology fan at all!  You know, I always wondered if the under-the-bridge idea preceded the fisherman's take on it.  I've been online since 1995 and that was never clear to me.

Described that way, you raise a good point.  That in turn brings to mind two things:

1. There are custom Reddit clients already, which demonstrates that the Reddit API can be accessed externally.  Reditr comes to mind as a fairly new one.

2. Though number 1 implies that sites could develop an applet for their page to do this on their own, this would make for an outstanding product if there were an official toolkit for doing it.  That could also allow for features and support that independent applets may lack.

Overall, that could be a great way for Reddit to become more profitable.  I'd expect a number of advancements in layout and style options to become more easily accessible first though.  CSS is a nightmare to experiment with, in my experience, unless the experimenter wishes to become an expert about a particular site.

The only downside to implementing the platform on a commercial media owned site is that users could just go to Reddit for the same conversation.  There would have to be a way for them to make sure the sub is only viewed through their site or they'd lose traffic.  That, in turn, I'd imagine could carry a lot of risk and techncial difficulty with load management on the servers.  Reddit would have to be able to serve up as many hits as its pages get, plus every hit in an embedded page from viewers who might not normally browse to this site.

You cut something (maybe it's just dairy, or maybe it's gluten) out for XX month(s). You record your moods, your energy levels, abdomen discomfort and overall happiness everyday. 
Then you add the cut substance back in and continue to record everything. Does the cut food change anything? Are you recording data that's similar to before? Have things changed dramatically?

To me that's a proper approach because it allows you to analyse why  you do or do not prefer a diet with no X. 
Is it because X is affecting you negatively?
Or is it because when you eat X you eat less healthly?
Or could it be that you ate almost only X, and had a shitty diet to begin with.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The book of Romans begins by explaining why the whole world is guilty before God. It bases this claim on the fact that, even without specific revelation (the Bible or evangelists), all people have rejected God (because they have rejected general revelation). They have rejected the evidence for God that is apparent to all people in 1) nature and 2) their own hearts (conscience). 

The whole section is Romans 1-3:20 discusses this, but 1:18-25 was especially helpful for me:

&gt;  18 The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, 19 since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. 20 For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.
21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools 23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.
24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another. 25 They exchanged the truth about God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.

For those who respond to general revelation (have faith in God based on nature and conscience), God will send a messenger. God will not allow anyone to die in unbelief who has exercised faith in what revelation they have been exposed to. The support for this is found in Romans 10.

&gt;  Romans 10:13
 “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”[f]
14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? 15 And how can anyone preach unless they are sent? As it is written: “How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!”[g]
17 Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word about Christ. 18 But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did:
“Their voice has gone out into all the earth,
    their words to the ends of the world.

The point is, INFJ is just a description of your cognitive function and how you think. The enneagram is about what drive you. So I'm an INFJ 9 sp/sx, so I use my Ni, Fe, Ti, and Se to make sure I have a peaceful, comfortable future with a low stress job by planning things out (Ni), critically analyzing every option (Ti), and by connecting with important connections (Fe). As a 5, you probably use all your functions to analyze the world and other 5 stuff.

I once read this article about people who steal dogs so that their dog fighting dogs can practice with them and kill them.. I kind of saw this as the same thing.

One day I was joking around about how my friend probably has aids (we joke about this type of thing all the time because he has unprotected sex with the most disgusting people you can imagine) and he's normally part of it... But on this occasion he wasn't there and she told him that I wanted to fight him..

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Yes, if the majority of the public wanted air horns, then you would have to go somewhere else. But if the majority did not like the air horns, then they could ban them. Ultimately, the government that we have created, consented to, and run, is majority-ruled, with certain minority protections.

Because about 60% of the country finds smoking annoying enough to ban, it can and has been banned without elected officials losing their jobs. The only way the majority could not have their way is if smokers or smoking had special constitutional protections similar to race, religion, or national origin.

I can tell you do not support this philosophy of governance, which is fine. I do think about these things a lot, and I realize we have to give up some of our 'freedom' to operate a government in this fashion, but overall I think it is the best way we have yet found to do things. Eliminating government or its regulations completely, for example, is such a radical change and I do not think it is very likely to work well, mainly because of the people that we live with.","1356998775"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Karate is mostly useless due to their sparring system of using points instead of rounds. They tell you to fight your opponent, there's a flurry of action until one of three judges sees a clean hit. Then they tell you to stop, reset, and go the best out of three. At least that's how it was when I did tournaments.

If you find a dojo that encourages fighting in rounds instead of points, you're in luck. I did Shaolin kempo for three years and thought I was a badass until I tried a MMA gym a few years down the road to see how little I truly knew. I've done krav maga as well. Its incredibly effective to the point that you cant really spar without risking serious injury, which comes to be a paradox because you're back to synchronized training. If you train sparring with rules and do krav practice on the side to teach that real fights don't have rules, I think its a great combination to defend yourself and the people you care about.

tl;dr Practice real fighting if you want to win a fight and stay away from point sparring!","1356998783"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","As he says- the message is loud and clear: Men are unnecessary in the home, not wanted or needed by women and nothing more than a burden in a family. So therefore the new nobility for men is to simply avoid marriage and family altogether. He is 100% correct.

And from all indications, this is exactly what women want and are very happy with being alone themselves, or raising children on their own (or with a string of guys on the coach for occasional sex some women laughingly call stepfathers). Because women have done *nothing* at all collectively culturally to try to entice men back into marriage.

Nothing.

Not even lifted a finger to change this female perception of men or even make men feel even half way wanted or even necessary or even the vaguest half promise of something, anything, that will make marriage look even halfway appealing to men or make them feel like they are even wanted at all. In fact women have even become more vicious in their display of hatred for men collectively. 

Women haven't lifted one finger or even seem to care at all about the extremely punitive laws and risks for men involving marriage or attempted to bring about a change in the divorce laws that would make marriage not so nightmarish. In fact, you can't even CONVINCE most of them that there's even a problem! That's how fucking clueless they have become. In fact the divorce and child support laws, VAWA and the rest continue to become even *worse* every day and even *more* insane, punishing men for doing nothing but making the huge mistake of expressing their love for a women. Even more push from women to make it even easier to falsely accuse a man of rape or DV.

All one can assume from women's complete lack of concern is that they simply hate men. Or, there is also the aspect of female nature, particularly now after 2 decades of complete unaccountability and a haughty condescension towards men, and complete laziness, that perhaps American women simply aren't even humanly capable of making any effort at all in reaching out to men anymore, because for so long now, men and women's relationship have been a complete and total lop sided one way street, wherein if the man wants to be with the woman, he has to grovel and do absolutely all the work in the relationship and the woman does absolutely nothing to actually make the relationship work besides minor financial contributions, but that has nothing to do with human contributions, such as respect or a spirit of love or empathy. Women have become cold, dead and empty in this country. 

So quite frankly, they can just stay away- they aren't going to change any time soon because they simply have become too stupid to even comprehend basic human concepts such as 'you get what you give.' Pretty fucking creepy when you think about it. Yea, American women have become the ultimate creeps.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","My experience with these people, having spent 2 years (total) deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq:

These people are opportunistic.  I can't tell if its cultural, but I do know that when bargaining, its socially acceptable to cheat others if you can get away with it.  Its almost like its encouraged.  Those that benefit from our presence: Yeah, they are our buddies - up until someone offers them a better deal for helping whatever might be asked for.  As soon as we aren't around, it becomes all about whatever influence or offer is on the table, and which makes more sense to commit to at that given moment.  Loyalty is almost frowned upon, because the norm is to be cut throat about as much as possible; I blame this on much of the leadership and hierarchy being stylized heavily after the Russians.  

The media gets allot of shit wrong, guys.  They like to portray these people as pious, dangerously religious folks who treat Islam like its the end all be all.. but in reality, they are just like us.  They gamble, play pool, commit crimes, have consensual adultery, drink, etc - all of which is against Islam.  

My experience is that the Quran allows them to justify some of the nastier shit we soldiers have seen in our deployments, but when its not as applicable, it takes the backseat and they go back to being, idunno.. 'normal' (Meaning just like everyone else). 

This is part of the reason I believe we are seeing the Taliban becoming popular again - because we are creeping out the door, and no one's there to check them.  This is also why Karzai is now trying his damndest to boot us out the door, imo.  Either way.. I don't believe these folks in ANY of the photos are someone I'd turn my back on in a dark alley.

The other guy was totally convinced that he (and all of us) were dead set toward eternity in hell.

Anyway, old Johnny Johnson used to want to talk eschatology with me, and I, a firm premillennial dispensationalist, thought he was just nuttier than squirrel crap. He was always ranting about how Mt. 24 and the Revelation were about the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70 and *not* prophecies about our own time. I just blew him off - thought he was off his rocker.

Then, years later, after I moved off to another state, as I studied it all in detail, I became firmly convinced that he was right. I always wanted to find him and acknowledge his insights, but by the time I could, he'd passed away. So, Johnny Johnson, CoC minister and good man, you were right and I was wrong.","1356998800"

Then Zoro proceeded to head to Sabaody. 

I don't think anything like Mihawk being covered in injuries would ever happen since Zoro's dream is to become the greatest swordsman and that title belongs to Mihawk right now. It would take a whole lot more than that and it would be pretty anti-climatic to say the least. ","1356998802"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Some tips to avoid the ""dead fish"" syndrome:

- Touch him: Run your hands through his hair, along the shoulders, down his back (lightly scratch with your nails if he's into that sort of thing), squeeze his ass, along his chest, etc.

- Kiss him: Pull him down for a kiss, kiss/suck on his neck.

- Touch yourself so he can see: Touch your breasts, run your hands down/along your stomach, play with your clit.

- Be vocal: Moan, dirty talk, beg for him to fuck you harder/let you cum.

- Move with him: Try to meet his thrusts and create a good rhythm. Wrap your legs around him and pull him in deeper.

- Play with him: Gently play with his balls, finger his ass (ONLY if he's into that).

Edit: Alright, alright guys, I relent...so apparently the finger up the butt is NOT OKAY (in my defense, I didn't mean SURPRISE finger up the bum). I thought I'd include it for those who like to experiment, but I'll concede!

"BMW","t5_2qn3a","The good is that it has 111k miles and complete records including the sticker.  Currently owned by older atty and he needs garage space.  He was asking 7k but after I walked him around the car and pointed out some rust he indicated he would work with me on the price.

Good: Records, new headers, new Borla exhaust eliminating cat, new SS brake lines, new suspension parts all except structs/shocks, good leather, 5 speed, smooth tranny and great sounding engine.  Good repaint about 4 years ago.  Pinstriping was removed.

Also good, many of the tough things have been sorted, PCB behind instrument cluster, driveline shudder, seats recovered, AC convereted to 134, TRX wheels upgraded to 16"" baskets from a 7 series.

BAD: headliner a bit droopy in front and showing age, small rust spot on bottom of driver's door in three places, Oily mess from AC replacement, struts and shocks need to be replaced as well as surrounding hardware, storage behind passenger heads needs to be refinished.  Passenger seat not secured properly after recovering so it doesn't move well.  Headrests move some but not fully, not all seat controls work.  Cruise control doesn't function.  Engine seal was recommended to be replaced but he deferred.  I can see oil dripping from ahead of tranny? and some small oil on ground beneath car.  He claims it burns no oil.  

He drives it less than 1,000 miles per year and so did the owners before him.  I checked it out pretty good before the test drive and it runs pretty well and pulls hard in all gears.  No wobbles at cruise or braking.  The main seal issue scares me but most of the other stuff is doable in my own garage with my own tools.

He was firm on the 7k but I'm thinking I would offer him $4000 in light of the work that needs to be done.  Your thoughts Reddit?","1356998807"

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","I have completed this task, although I got rather lucky. My strategy involved pitting Norway and Normandy against each other and then crushing their weakened armies.

I waited with my armies in Kent as Harald Hardrada rampaged across Northern England. Eventually, when the Bastard's ships were sited in the Channel I moved my forces away from the coast. 

I managed to kite the Norman army into the English interior as Harald Hardrada's army beseiged York. When the Norman army reached the North of England my forces made a break for Scotland and the two pretenders to my throne did battle. 

In the aftermath of their titanic struggle I swooped back into England and crushed their weakened forces. Then I managed to assassinate Harald Hardrada and garrisoned my remaining troops in Kent and the surrounding counties.

It took a few years but eventually I had 100% war score and William of Normandy capitulated. I forced him to relinquish his claim to my Kingdom. Life was sweet. Then I'm pretty sure I died of syphillis, damn camp followers.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Why does the government get a second shot?

Because the government gets a shot *every time* money changes hands.  The fact that it's changing hands due to it being an inheritance shouldn't somehow make it exempt from being taxed like any other wealth transfer.

There's no argument for calling an estate tax a ""second shot"" that doesn't also equally apply to every other tax.

Also, you're mistaken in saying that 40% of American households have a negative income tax rate.  The actual fact is that 40% of American households have no higher than a *0%* income tax rate; and only a small percentage of *that* group actually has a negative rate.  It's incredibly difficult to end up with a negative tax rate, since only *refundable tax credits* can reduce your tax burden below zero.  Non-refundable tax credits and tax deductions can not do so.   The biggest source of refundable tax credits providing a negative tax rate is from the EIC credit, and that credit is only available to people who are literally living below or near the poverty line.   If you really want to maintain that people living below the poverty line are somehow getting one over on Uncle Sam and beating the system, then I don't know what to tell you.

Additionally, while that 40% has a 0% income tax burden, income tax is *not* the only tax assessed on their income. They pay a non-zero payroll and FICA tax burden; both of which are basically flat percentage.  Oh, and they pay a flat rate sales tax with nearly all of their income, too; since all of their income necessarily goes to purchases (versus the option of investments that aren't subject to sales taxes in households with 'disposable' income).

The problem with 40% of American households not paying income tax is not to tax them more -- it's to address the wealth and income equality problem that led to 40% of American households not being able to earn enough to be taxed in the first place.","1356998814"

Then... it came out in alpha. Of course it was shitty then--it was an alpha game. Then beta came out. A bit better, still shitty. And as updates came out the game was promising so much and giving nothing. The game turned into a game full of lies and Team Deathmatch with zombies.

My friends tell me stories of clans ruling over servers (not their own), which is pretty cool in my opinion, but just not fun for a lot of players. It's easy to stockpile. People are dicks. It's just a shitty game altogether because of the false promises and people. It's mostly the developers fault. The beta version is awesome for a beta game, but it's just the developers fault. So some places, like Steam, are refunding the game entirely and I believe WarZ is about to be off the market completely because the poor Russian dude is being eaten alive by players.","1356998815"

They do significantly better than roaches especially if there are immortals in the attack. If they bring a warp prism, they can also be shot down.


Make sure the big engagement happens in your base next to the spines. Sacrificing a few lings to delay him will be helpful but make sure you don't lose too much. +1 carapace will help a lot in defending in case they're pushing with +1 zealots as well. Be patient and let them engage you instead of the other way around because the spines serves as both a source of damage and a wall the zealots and hydras.

Although, the primary villains are fascists, and the Soviet warriors that defeated them in WWII are the heroes, and the secondary villains are capitalists and the proletariats, the working class, are the heroes.

There is also some quality animation work, and some good story-telling.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Apologizing isn't always to correct a mistake. Regardless of how you feel about her getting upset, her emotions are legitimate. I feel most people don't realize that you don't necessarily apologize for doing wrong; rather, you apologize for upsetting them, whether intentional or not. 

OP, this is marriage 101. Heed these words. 

Here is her thought process: You asked if you could do something. She doesn't want to tell you what you can or cannot do because you're an adult. Are honestly trying to tell me that you had absolutely no idea she would be upset if you went? Every time I made this mistake, my wife made it pretty clear beforehand that she'd be upset even if she didn't outright say it. 

It seems passive aggressive. It seems unfair. Guess what? This is how many women are. You asked, she gave you a choice and you chose wrong. Plain and simple. Now you have to deal with the consequences. 

This is what marriage is. She will not always feel that you treated her fairly. You will feel the same from time to time. You're different people with different feelings. Coming to a subreddit full of men to validate your feelings as a man was a bad idea, especially since not all of these guys are married. 

You made a mistake. Own up to it and apologize, even if you feel like you didn't necessarily do anything wrong. At the same time express to her that when you ask her to do something you will not see it as controlling if she tells you shed rather the two of you spend time alone. Listen carefully now: if she follows this advice you shouldn't get mad at her for telling you the truth, as it's what you asked for. 

Marriage is a partnership. There is rarely me: right, you: wrong here. More often than not you will both apologize for the whole thing. Get used to it and smarten up. ","1356998834"

While some parts of them are definitely arbitrarily created by a historically patriarchal society, there are some that at least to my mind seem to be preordained by our underlying biology.

We did a lot of the work ourselves like setting up and taking down tables/chairs, picked up the food, and got help decorating but we saved a ton of money. It obviously wasn't extremely fancy or anything but it was very nice and people still talk about how much fun they had and how good the food was.

I've had a couple of long term relationships, and two years into the second I found out that my boyfriend had spent the first two months of what I considered our relationship, still seeing his ex (who had turned into a FWB). He had never told me, but I accidentally found out when his ex randomly started angrily messaging him while I was using his computer (with his permission - working on a school project that I didn't have the software for). I had never suspected anything prior to that and I was very heartbroken that all my fondest memories happened between his hook ups with this girl.

Nowadays I've done so much casual dating and FWB, I think it'd be different as long as I knew what was going on. When I first started seeing the guy I'm with now, I told him at the start that I had many FWB, and he told me he had one as well. He was really forthcoming about what happened between him and her, so I did the same until eventually we were both telling our FWB that we'd found someone. So... just be honest.","1356998844"

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","I say you should break it off with him, especially if you're becoming emotionally unavailable. You need to go take care of yourself and be happy, being unhappy is unfair to both of you.

But, here's some tough love for you for the future:

You are making yourself emotionally unavailable and that's unfair to both of you. You seem to blame him for a lot of things, this is probably why you feel unattracted to him. There are plenty of things that bother you that you haven't been completely up-front about. You can't hide your emotions like it seems you are, if it's becoming a bigger issue NOW it's because you didn't let it be known it was already an issue BEFORE. 

Don't do this to him or yourself, you've been stringing the guy along for a while and it hurts someone's self-esteem to have that happen to them. He can feel your disdain and emotional baggage you're carrying around with his name on it. I've been in this guy's shoes before, stick to your guns before either of you do something you'll regret.

The only difference in my case: I was always motivated and had initiative, my ex pretended I didn't in order to bolster her own self esteem and make me feel like crap. 

Don't fault the guy for spending money to try to maintain some happiness, as long as the bills are getting paid. Don't get back together and take some time to do what you want. I won't make any other suggestions past that, the rest will be for for you to discover. 

I hope I wasn't out-of-line with anything I said, I'm trying to be as helpful as possible. Again, I've been in the guys shoes before. Did you let the guy hang out with you and your friends? If you offered, did you really want him there?

It just is going to get worse if you keep him around. Go out, do something new, start doing ""together"" things alone, spend days alone without friends, spend days with friends, rediscover yourself and I assure you your ex will be doing the same.

Yeah, up here our shows are done by end of November and off season is December to early March. We start conditioning/running again in mid February to get show prepped. Any horses that compete in those months are usually in the Florida circuits. 

Sounds like your show season is pretty fun though! I was never really part of a team, it would have been cool. I had one tour of shows with a team and that was it, it was just a bunch of sale shows though, getting a man's warmbloods show records up and performing at WB sales. 

Sounds like your barn has all of its stuff pretty well in-hand! It sounds impressive and thorough, and the goal cards are a good idea, gives them something to look forward to.

My old jumper coach used to give me all sorts of hell for not using the 20 pre-round seconds properly. I had a habit of examining the course on foot then studying the map to be sure I knew the turns, but once in the ring I used to just trust my riding to get the horse around soundly. He really drilled the importance of walking up to problem jumps and taking a loop around so they can get the look and feel of everything, and cutting through the middle if there was time left so I could see before hand if there was anything that grabbed the horse's attention. 

I used to just ride them in, circle at the end to loosen up, ride past the first jump then loop around and start. Usually only took around 10 seconds. Really, if you watch the pros, most of them start the courses with only 2 or 3 seconds left in the count down. There's a reason! 

So I totally get the not paying attention right before the round haha. I used to be so bad for it! Kids are just so impatient. As I got further into the sport I smartened up and voila, my horses ran better having seen everything before they jumped it. ","1356998850"

Best (our main manager) can be abit zealous on any matter concerning the team or individual players, and considering that we are still a small team, we want to avoid any negative thoughts, opinions, or anything else that might effect our growth and possible sponsorships / fan base.

of course Maximus Black can say whatever he feels like, it is his stream, and his job &amp; source of income; but it hurts everyone when his ""sour"" spouts of accusation can truly damage others in the community. Please for eSports be abit more considerate as a player. Thank you.","1356998853"

There are people who own and fly F-16's.  Yes, they're rich.  F-16's are expensive planes, and they're not made by Piper or Cessna.  There are even other consumer aircraft that rival a lot of military capabilities.  Stealth technology isn't exactly a secret -- especially when making your own aircraft, the FAA basically requires you to cover it in radar-reflective tape so they can see it.

Likewise, those teams you mentioned are held to high expectations because they have resources Vanderbilt lacks. USC should not have lost today - no offense to GT, but with as many 4 and 5 star athletes as USC brings in every year, there's no excuse for such a pathetic performance.

The opposite is true for Vandy - most of these players were recruited to a 2 or 3 win team and are being coached to 6 and 9 wins. That, to me, is a sign that this staff is doing the right things to get kids motivated and playing well, and hopefully it will continue.","1356998856"

Don't get a Nulls on her, it's wasting gold since it upgrades into nothing. If you're behind, build Tranquils + Bracer to catch up.

Use those gg branches to get a Wand, since you'll be fighting during the early/mid game the charges will save your life/let you get a kill two or three times at least.

I'm not fond of Basi on her too, the armor and aura are nice but past level 6-8 the mana regen is wasted since a single Sage's Mask will give you more mana/s than a RoB. It's more of a personal choice I guess.

I live in Koreatown which is annoyingly car oriented in some ways (lots of strip malls, high traffic streets like Wilshire and Western), but in other ways, extremely pedestrian friendly.

That's the whole point. Heavy alcohol consumption impairs rational thought. 1 drink won't kill you, but 4 or 5 might. A buzz is much different than being drunk. 

&gt;You can blame drinking and driving on everyone that does it or you can come back down to reality and realize the person driving at that point is who is to blame not what he ate or drank.

I've been at reality the whole time. Of course it's the persons fault. If they can't make the rational decision to not drive drunk while they're still sober then they sure as hell can't be trusted after 5 drinks.

I haven't been talking about buzzed driving, I've been talking about full-on drunk driving. The kind of drunk where you can't pass a field sobriety test. Because one little fuck up can kill many.","1356998857"

If you pull up to a lot, and a salesman opens your door, he is too eager. Be cautious of word play. I always write down everything and I sign it to prevent confusion. If a salesman talks too fast, slow them down. If you don't have the right customer service, or if you feel that your salesman is too pushy, walk away. I like to ensure I treat my customers like they are family. 

If the first words they say are "" I got the car for you "" or "" wow, looks like you need a new car"" walk away. I don't know what type of vehicle you want, until you tell me what you are looking for. I refuse to knock someone's car that they just pulled up in.

*Inexpensive?* You are joking, right?

Steve Jobs left Apple to form Next in 1985. Version 1 of their flagship OS was complete in 1989 - four years later. Apple then bought Next and their OS in 1996 and started converting it into MacOS X. It took them until 2001 - five years later. Their competition, Microsoft, has an average of 3 years between operating system versions. 

Updating an OS - let alone making one - takes many years by a large team of talented programmers who are (presumably) well paid.

I would love to see some of your evidence that making operating systems is ""inexpensive"".","1356998869"

They've upgraded at shortstop while maintaining the core of their lineup. Catcher is a weakness but it wasn't a strong suit last year either. If weeks can come back to the lineup and perform well, they'll have a solid lineup. 

On top of that, the team is extremely young and love to play together which is always a plus. 

I can definitely see another wild card year, especially with the AL east looking to have a down year outside the jays. And depending on what the angels look like possibly a division.

Honestly, I think you're trying to play party-politics on this. If Nazi's are ""left-wing"" then they can be grouped with liberals, and therefore liberals can be demonized, or the other way around if Nazi's are ""right-wing."" It's stupid.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; Which would be precisely the application we might apply to some holy books. A talking snake seems to belong more ot aesop's fables than to a literal history and I'd wager even early Jews would know this.

I am simply asking you to provide a criteria that we can use to determine whether something is a metaphor or not.  If you're only criteria is based on credibility (obviously early Jews wouldn't believe a snake really spoke), then I have to admit that I find a talking snake just as believable as a man walking on water, curing leprosy by touch, and resurrecting three days after being crucified.  Why is one of them a metaphor and the other literal, and where is that justification found in the bible?

&gt; The same criteria by which you might attack the whole religion would be good example of why some examples might be best read as literal. Jesus not actually existing and not literally dying for sins would invalidate Christianity, hence there's good reason to suspect it is meant to be literal.

I think you have it backwards.  The doctrines of Christianity are based off of the understanding of the bible, and not the other way around.  Obviously Christians believe that Jesus literally died for their sins as this is a core tenant of their belief.  I'm asking, ""How do you look at the bible and come to this conclusion?  How do you differentiate between the story of Moses splitting the read sea (I hope you don't believe he actually did that) and Jesus resurrecting after death?  They both seem as absurd to me as the story of Muhammad flying to heaven on a horse might seem to you.  What is the method that we are to use to determine what is metaphor and what is literal?  By what criteria do we determine the appropriate understanding or interpretation?""","1356998877"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'd like to expand on some thoughts I shared with u/winfred that I hope will place Churches of Christ in context for those of you with little or no experience of our tradition.

I said that if it weren't for the instrumental worship issue, most people would find it hard to distinguish a conservative Church of Christ congregation from a Southern Baptist one. Probing a little deeper, one will find a disturbing and unorthodox emphasis on works-righteousness in the fundamentalist churches. This wing is represented by the schools of preaching (or as some of us call them, pools of screeching) and the most conservative universities, like Freed-Hardeman in Tennessee.

The mainstream of Churches of Christ are in most respects indistinguishable from mainstream evangelicals, albeit less politicized and less commercialized. They are distinct in the way that every evangelical denomination is distinct. Some scholars question whether or not Churches of Christ can rightly be labeled as evangelical, but for the most part their skepticism stems from a lack of understanding regarding mainstream Church of Christ theology, which emphasizes salvation by grace and does not at all reject other forms of Christianity as invalid. People in these churches read books by authors from all denominations and listen to contemporary Christian music. This wing is best represented by Harding University, which has set itself as a middle ground between the fundamentalists and the progressives.

The progressive wing includes influences from progressive evangelicalism (including the emergent movement), mainline Protestantism, and historical Catholic and Orthodox spirituality. Mainstream evangelicals would find many people in these churches to be disturbingly liberal, and scholars from places like Abilene Christian and Pepperdine move freely among those from mainline Protestant churches.

Except for the fundamentalist wing of the church, which I admit is large, Churches of Christ represent a fairly mainstream wing of Protestantism.","1356998877"

Not a Harper fan, but the costs of closing it aren't from broken contracts or anything, they're the costs of cleaning up all the stuff that they've dumped into the lakes. Unless we decide to leave them as a horrible mess, there will never be a ""no cost to close"" point.

"farcry","t5_2st42","It really is bad, they need to patch that out or provide an option.  Seriously couldn't play for more than a short while for that reason.  Whether it is annoying probably depends on how people have their stereos setup.

Couple days ago I modified the FC3.dll to remove the loading screen, menu and map background audio.  It has been absolutely glorious since then.

**NOTE: This is the 1.04 version of the DirectX 9 version of the DLL and it's from the Steam release, though I suspect this file is the same for non-Steam releases.**

* Go into your Far Cry 3 install directory, then go into the bin directory.
* Backup your FC3.dll somewhere.
* Download http://wikisend.com/download/449876/FC3.zip
* Extract FC3.zip into your bin directory, so that the FC3.dll gets overwritten.
* If you're using Steam, you might want to disable automatic updating just in case it overwrites your modified DLL.
* Run Far Cry 3 and make sure in the video settings you have it set to DX9.  If it's not set to DX9, set it and then restart Far Cry 3.
* **Enjoy the sounds of silence.  I would avoid playing multiplayer while using one of these modified DLLs just in case.**

Using DX9, because I wanted to use SweetFX for LumaSharpen and to do a very slight desaturation, so that's the only DLL I bothered to modify.

If you want to modify other versions of FC3.dll or FC3_DX11.dll when new updates get released, it's pretty simple to do in a hex editor.

* Make a backup copy of your FC3.dll or FC3_DX11.dll
* Open the original (the one still in the bin directory) in a hex editor.
* Do string searches for each of the following and overwrite the hex values of the strings with zeros.
* sndPauseMenuStopId
* sndPauseMenuStartId
* sndLoadingScreenStopId
* sndLoadingScreenStartId
* Then save it.","1356998888"

&gt;such as getting someone drunk for the explicit purpose of making them more receptive to sex

This is probably the single most time honored college traditions of the past 40 years. Glorified *constantly* in all forms of media, and becoming absolutely ingrained in American tradition (excuse the assumption, I haven't read anything yet to indicate anything different) it is both normal and expected. Alcohols loosening of inhibitions in relation to sex is a major subject in every single high school across the country in form or another. 

In short, the act of getting a girl drunk makes her more willing is not some secret to women everywhere, who can very easily end the practice if they didn't themselves enjoy it by simply saying no to drinks?

Also, it is also heavily stressed in the culture that the man himself should drink too, and that the entire idea isn't some devious plan to raping en masse, but simply to use the great social lubricant to get the ball rolling on something that vastly more often than not is mutually beneficial.

In short, consenting to the act of drinking with a guy doesn't somehow magically make everything that happens after rape regardless of circumstances (which it certainly could, but the devil is in the details, and in OP's case those details do not say rape).

To remove the stain, you have two options. 
Firstly, you can buy an expensive product designed to do exactly that. (not recommended)

Secondly, you use Oxiclean. It shouldn't run you more than $5 at your local grocery store or chemist.
When you dry your shirts, especially oxford cloth, button ups or dress shirts, do NOT use a dryer. Heat will lock discolouration within the fabric.


To prevent the stains from occurring in the first place.

Avoid any antiperspirant. Their only real effective ingredient is aluminium, which is the culprit in yellowing. Contrary to popular belief, it is not your sweat. Your sweat is all water soluble anyways. 

If you sweat frequently, purchase an over the counter liquid antiperspirant, such as Certain Dry, Perspirex or Drysol. You apply at night before bed, will change your life if you're a heavy sweater.

If you do not sweat frequently, purchase a deodorant, and try to cut down on the amount of shampoo you use. Many people advocate going on the no shampoo diet. Shampoos leeches your body of natural oils which causes your skin to go into overdrive to produce more. Many people believe this helps reduce acne too. 

Lastly, instead of ending your shower with the water blisteringly hot, (especially in winter) try turning it down to a lukewarm. Your core will be less likely to sweat immediately out of the shower and should make you more armpit friendly throughout the day, ","1356998894"

I just say ""WHAT?! I had no idea thanks for telling me!"" and then look at them like they're stupid.  They need to realize pointing something out like that is just stupid and obviously you know.  Only advice really is to just try not to let it bother you. Remember it's not he end of the world. People will stop mentioning it after a little while (but they shouldn't in the first place.) Think about it this way, you can deal with a few people mentioning that you waxed and go on with your day. Or you can deal with people mentioning that you are hairy until you get over being scared and just wax it.","1356998896"

So, why not rebuild a new APK with a slightly higher API (2.1) to remove those permissions? I guess there isn't much point if there aren't any new features, but I bet you'd get more downloads. As you know, there are less and less truly **free** apps out there, most find ""other ways"" to monetize so when I read those reviews saying you don't have ads, coupled with the extra permissions, I automatically think you're doing something sneaky (Obviously not in THIS case because of this post, but you know what I mean)

That brings up another question: do you still get email about the app now that you've put those things in the description? do you bother answering? 

My first app was a live wallpaper that I put up for free and I can't say I get much email about it.

"Watches","t5_2qls5","Well, upwards of $100 is NOT an expensive watch. But if you want to know the difference between a cheap watch and an expensive watch, a $20 watch is a mass produced Chinese timekeeper that is made of the cheapest materials and slapped together hastily by machines and laborers. A really nice, expensive watch is usually hand made in Switzerland, Japan, Germany, etc by skilled craftsmen that take painstaking measures and time to make sure everything is just right. They're usually much more limited than something you'd buy at K-Mart and run off hundreds of little tiny inanimate objects that a watchmaker must  fit together with extremely tight tolerances and when wound will be able to keep pretty accurate time. The cheap watch is running off of a mass produced Chinese quartz movement probably made of stamped sheet metal and held in place with a plastic movement ring.

If it becomes such a problem that it begins to affect your life in a serious fashion then a legal avenue may be necessary. You could likely sue for defamation I'm civil court. A prima facie case requires; 1.) a false statement regarding another which is purported as a fact, 2.) publication  or communication of said falsity to a third party, 3.) fault on part of perpetrator, 4.) damages (to you-- emotional damage, damage to reputation aka impact on hire ability, etc., and so on)

While this is a last resort option, it may be helpful to be aware of your legal standing on this-- many times bloggers assume that the First Amendment protects anything they say, and that's just not the case.","1356998908"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Really, homogeneity is about more than just race.  It also can count in terms of development.  The US has greater heterogeneity than Europe in many respects.  Most of Western Europe is well-developed and has a relatively high population density; however, the US midwest/mountain areas--nearly 2/3's of the country, are not.  They do not have the populations necessary to support certain kinds of industries that are found in eastern states or california.  If anything, we're closer in comparison to Russia in many comparisons, except with ethnic diversity, although there are a lot of ethnic subgroups within Russia.

Also, your drug trial example is a horrible example, for the exact reason we're discussing: homogeneity, or lack thereof.  In drug trials, clinicians divide and subdivide groups of people into small groups to improve subgroup homogeneity: men and women, age, weight, general health, pregnant women, medical history, smokers and nonsmokers, diabetics and non-diabetics, those taking certain medications, by symptom severity--anything that could be a factor is examined or blocked in the experimental design.  That's why stage III trials take so long: you generally have to recruit thousands to make sure each subgroup test has proper statistical power.  The realistic comparison would be to block countries into individual counties or cities, demographics, and economic sectors, and testing each factor to see if it had any contribution to the effect or any factor interaction.","1356998909"

If you are so far in denial that you prefer the opinion of a washed-up stage magician who calls himself ""The Amazing Randi"" over the professionial opinion of a 35 year member of the NSA then you're seriously deluded. 

As I said, we're talking about the surveillance state, not pulling rabbits out of hats, card tricks or sawing women in half. I'm sure ""The Amazing Randi"" is quite well-versed in those things but as far as intelligence community practices, not so much. You apparently are a dunderhead who wishes to remain in a comforting cocoon of denial, hiding from the facts. And your coordinated downvoting/ burying of the facts proves it. You're a head-in-the-sand clown.

&gt;In July 2007, the FBI conducted coordinated raids of each of the complainants of the DoD IG report. FBI officers held a gun to Binney’s head as he stepped naked from the shower. He watched with his wife and youngest son as the FBI ransacked their home. Later Binney was separated from the rest of his family, and FBI officials pressured him to implicate one of the other complainants in criminal activity. During the raid, Binney attempted to report to FBI officials the crimes he had witnessed at NSA, in particular the NSA’s violation of the constitutional rights of all Americans. However, the FBI wasn’t interested in these disclosures. Instead, FBI officials seized Binney’s private computer, which to this day has not been returned despite the fact that he has not been charged with a crime.

When I was doing ss I would usually do 5 warm up sets (what ss recommends) which were like 2x5 empty bar, 1x5, 1x3, 1x2 then work weight.

You can do short rests when you want.  When you start hitting big numbers, you'll see why people can take 30min on just one exercise in ss (although like someone else said its arguable arty that point whether you should deload or not).

Point 3 is mostly a myth, and as a beginner you shouldn't worry about it.  Whether or not its true, it just adds complexity that you don't need right now.  rippetoe talks somewhere about going to failure being bad for beginners (as well as why do 3x5 instead of 2x1 or 4x12).  I remember I agreed with it and I think the basis was just that beginners going to failure without really knowing if their form is good is just asking to tear something.

Sure adding the trx will slow down your gains in the ss department","1356998921"

The original comment made the point that Aldon would have had more sacks if Justin Smith never got hurt. The response by a patriot fan was that Aldon got 0 sacks in the first half of the SF-NE game even with Justin still in the game.

My comment was that the fact that Aldon had 0 sacks doesn't tell the whole story. If not for two emergency throws by Brady, Aldon would have had at least two sacks in the first half, **signifying that he was getting good pressure**, whereas in the second half after Justin went out with his injury Aldon never even laid a finger on Brady.

The point of the ""2 almost sacks"" is to point out that the sack statistic from that game wasn't completely telling, not that Aldon had theoretical stats or something stupid like that.","1356998925"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Look, I don't like debating with atheists because they do not think for themselves.

Ha ha, that's hilarious. How do you think we became atheists? Not by following what we were taught as small children. What religion did you say you were raised? Maybe you don't like debating atheists because you always lose. You know, no one is forcing you to participate. If you don't want to debate, feel free to not visit this forum.

&gt;So you have a college degree, does that make you smarter than the rest of the world? No, if you are a lawyer you are simply specialized in law and NOT religion.

Once again you missed my point. I am of above average intelligence and education, and to me the q'uran reads as unintelligible gibberish. I submit that the problem is not with me, but the fact that it's simply a bad book.

&gt; Especially when you have not read anything about that particular religion and are basing your theories on what you hear on mainstream news.

You have no idea where I get my information from. If you think I have made a claim that is not factual, then contest it and we'll see who's right. You are committing the *ad hominem* fallacy, trashing me instead of grappling with my assertions.

&gt;The Quran is a well of knowledge which needs to be understood

Like that there. It's an assertion. Back it up! Show that it's true! What is this ""great knowledge"" in the q'uran that is not found elsewhere? What does it take to understand it? How can you tell when someone does? And why would God give us a book that's so hard to understand?

&gt;Even after 1400 years it is still relevant to this day.

In what way? Those important instructions on how to treat your slaves? How long to wait before divorcing a child bride? How to treat Jews? What?

&gt; Religion is not science and comparing the two is not possible.

That's hilarious, because if you go back to the beginning of the thread, it's all about you claiming the exact opposite. You have now managed to go full circle and contradict yourself. Here's a hint: whenever you contradict yourself, at least one of your assertions is false. Which one do you think it is?

"stencils","t5_2rz4w","This is actually not that bad. Most people will use an image and just use the cutout filter on Photoshop or adjust the levels, etc. to get their layers. Then you would erase some areas to connect islands. If you want to keep drawing them by hand, then you must be accurate.

As for your questions, the best kind of material to use for stenciling (in my experience) is acetate. You need a sharp xacto knife, but the acetate is somewhat more durable and makes the job easier since it's clear. Some people like to use mailing envelopes (you can get them for free at USPS.com), but the use is pretty limited as it will get soaked and coated with paint. With the acetate, the smaller pieces are hard to cutout, but it will last in the long run and you could wipe the stencil clean right after spraying. The problem with acetate sheet is that they are pretty expensive. I think it's around $50 for a pack of 100 sheets.

The best paint to use is all about preference, but you want something with low pressure or you will tend to underspray a lot. I use Molotov and Montana, but there are other brands out there.

For intricate shapes, you must have a very sharp xacto knife. I keep a sharpening stone near me whenever I'm cutting.

When spraying, you want to keep the stencil as flat as you can (tape or weights help) or else you will get underspray unless that is what you want to achieve. I like to underspray a minimal amount, it gives a nice fade to the stencil, but some people like it to be as clean as possible.

I hope this helps, but you just have to keep at it and see what you like. The Fight Club stencil is really not that bad, especially since you drew it by hand, but you could achieve more detail going with the Photoshop method and draw (or print) your stencil from that.

**TL;DR** Acetate or mailing envelopes, Montana or Molotov, always use a sharp knife and keep your stencil flat.","1356998939"

I find myself meeting a new person almost every day.  I'm a pretty outgoing person but even if you're not there are opportunities left and right to get to know people.  There are literally hundreds of clubs that you could find your niche in http://www.iub.edu/student/activities/clubs.shtml.  Intramural sports are a great way of meeting people.  See a cute girl or cool guy in class?  Ask if he/she wants to study together.  Simply hanging out on campus or in the downtown area you can make friends.  Not to mention the kids you live with in your dorm often become your best friends for life.

Simply put though, I've visited Purdue and yeah I am a little biased but I feel it is justifiably so; Indiana is a far more enjoyable school than Purdue.

Then there's the whole women pee more than men, typically, therefore the downward position is more often used.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Since the early 20th century, or a little earlier, it has more or less been true that ""what can be seen can be hit"", leading to what is known as the empty battlefield, with the enemy rarely being seen at any range.

Pre-ww1 units would still practice firing volleys, by platoon or company, creating a large beaten zone that would have been very effective against massed infantry targets at ranges up to 1000 meters or more, much longer than the effective range of individual riflemen or smaller units (The Battle of the Frontiers: Ardennes 1914 by Terence Zuber; yes, I know some of his conclusions are not quite universally accepted). Opportunities for using such fire turned out to be rare even in 1914, and is useless against an enemy using anything remotely like modern tactics. Units going over the top to attack later in ww1 did so usually over quite short distances, maybe around 150-250 meters or so on average (just a guess, not based on actual statistics). Much of the actual fighting was down in trenches fighting from traverse to traverse at close range, so the enemy would probably show up no more than 5-10 meters away. Only well-sited machineguns would have much opportunity to engage targets at longer ranges, like the ones effectively destroying many British units on the first day of the Somme before they even could reach their own first line (The Somme, Prior and Wilson, 2006).

Artillery was the big killer in ww1 in any event, and probably a large part of casualties in ww2 eastern front as well? Again it could reach out to kill anything that could be seen, resulting in concealment being more important than cover, and the end of trying to hold fronts by long connected trenches, and also reverse-slope positions becoming popular.","1356998948"

"ftlgame","t5_2tnu1","1. The game is very random. Sometimes you'll die on the first jump. Sometimes you'll make ten jumps in a row, with a slowly depleting HP pool, 500 scrap, and no shop in sight to repair your ship. Over time however, you will develop skills that will mitigate the randomness and overall let you live longer.
2. Pause the game right away during an encounter and assess the situation. Do you need to focus their weapons or shields first? Do you just need to stick it out and jump as fast as possible? Will they be boarding you?
3. Have crew members in the mannable systems at all times if possible.
4. Make sure you get a second layer of shields as soon as possible, and if you are running the starter ship in easy mode, before even jumping, upgrade one power bar so you can power both your weapons and both engine bars. Then slowly upgrade the things you need, if you got nothing better to spend on, upgrading engines for more passive dodge is always a good call. Make sure you get more power bars to power all your systems.
5. Always pick blue options if you can, and if a surrender option gives you something you need (fuel, missiles etc), take it. Unless the scrap is over 20, just kill them, it will net you overall more scrap but some surrender options are good, you'll get a feel for this.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hi Spitfire,

The requirements to become a recruiter vary greatly from one company to another and from one type of recruitment to another.  The skills and experience required for success as a recruiter are just as diverse as the fields in which recruiters are employed.  What you’ll need when you’re hiring at a staffing agency is different than a day labor agency.  College intern recruitment is much different than full-time recruitment.  In-house recruiting is very different from a head hunting firm.

What I’d advocate you consider is looking at the current openings for recruiters in the field in which you’re interested or at the companies for which you’d like to work.  See what the current job postings indicate are the desired and required qualifications.

Certainly a related degree can only help you.  As a recruiter it is important for us to understand lots about human resources including hiring practices, organized labor questions, health benefits, tax implications and more.   See what else the postings call for.  

My experience as a Fortune 100 recruiter included conducting interviews every day.  On an average day I did 11 half-hour interviews.  However when I moved from a generalist recruiter to a specialist in one area of the company, my focus shifted from daily interviews to building a recruitment strategy, reviewing résumés, creating online job postings and reducing time-to-fill ratios.  Each of these roles required different skill sets and each was rewarding for me in a different way.

I love recruiting.  Think back to how it felt when you got your first great job… I got to GIVE that feeling to people every day.  That was an awesome feeling.  Recruiting is a great field.  It’s competitive and demanding but really fun and quite rewarding!  Best wishes!","1356998961"

If pedophilic abuse and rape is the lesson that they really teach.

And they continue to preach, but my sermon is much more clear and simple...You are the scum of the earth.

Hypocrites and robbers, what more can they do to wrong the world?

Next time smash his brains out.

Psychologically fucked and there is never going to be a way out.

Take the family's money, and their child's virginity.

So I say fuck that bastard Nazi pope, there's been a dick down Benedict's holy throat.

Right under his nose, thousands are violated.

It is for you twisted creeps that I wish Hell actually existed so that by any and every means possible punishment for your ghastly abuse intrusion and the desecration will be shot right up your righteous assholes.

Maybe he was more often the focus of the attack on that team, whereas in this Barca lineup there are several options (any midfielder, Messi, etc). It just seems like he's too quick to make the easy pass rather than attack.

When he got signed one of the things I was excited to see was him being deployed centrally, so that Barca didn't seem so dependent on Messi as the false 9. Check out his performance [versus Palermo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TsuM6OqLIM) from the 10/11 season -- he's everywhere. Positioned in the center but he'll take the ball out wide, he'll move it upfield, etc. Look how much he has the ball! It feels like it's more than I've seen him possess it all season.

Apologizing isn't always to correct a mistake. Regardless of how you feel about her getting upset, her emotions are legitimate. I feel most people don't realize that you don't necessarily apologize for doing wrong; rather, you apologize for upsetting them, whether intentional or not. 

OP, this is marriage 101. Heed these words. 

Here is her thought process: You asked if you could do something. She doesn't want to tell you what you can or cannot do because you're an adult. Are honestly trying to tell me that you had absolutely no idea she would be upset if you went? Every time I made this mistake, my wife made it pretty clear beforehand that she'd be upset even if she didn't outright say it. 

It seems passive aggressive. It seems unfair. Guess what? This is how many women are. You asked, she gave you a choice and you chose wrong. Plain and simple. Now you have to deal with the consequences. 

This is what marriage is. She will not always feel that you treated her fairly. You will feel the same from time to time. You're different people with different feelings. Coming to a subreddit full of men to validate your feelings as a man was a bad idea, especially since not all of these guys are married. 

Own up to it and apologize, even if you feel like you didn't necessarily do anything wrong. At the same time express to her that when you ask her to do something you will not see it as controlling if she tells you shed rather the two of you spend time alone. Listen carefully now: if she follows this advice you shouldn't get mad at her for telling you the truth, as it's what you asked for. 

Marriage is a partnership. There is rarely me: right, you: wrong here. More often than not you will both apologize for the whole thing. Get used to it and smarten up. ","1356998978"

(Only new recordings I needed to do were a few voice recordings.) There was only 70 sfx for the whole game at the moment anyway, and I didn't quite finish them within 8 hours, it was probably closer to 10-15 (spread over a couple days). I agree with everything you're saying, and being a AAA level worker, it would be stupid not to :P But unfortunately in Australia $50 per minute is all the rights to music for a mobile game is worth, which seems to be much less than it is in America (and I would therefore assume same goes for sound effects) So forgive me for thinking its better than it is :) ","1356998979"

The Sins AI isn't bad and is probably pretty good as far as AI goes, but it's never going to compare to playing against a real opponent, so it will need buffs as the difficulty level increases.  One of the problems the AI has is that it doesn't do a real good job of dealing with things like starbases and titans--things that make the strategy and tactics a little more complex.  I've seen the AI attempt to build a starbase in a well where a large enemy fleet is present--total waste of money and free experience for enemy capital ships.  (In those regards, arguably the AI was more competent back in the original Sins before the introduction of starbases.)

"Art","t5_2qh7a","Very nice work, especially for prisma color.  I would recommend that you develop your skills in mediums other than prisma color, mainly because prisma colors take a really long time to blend/ make opaque, and it isn't a very respected medium outside of school (I assume you are in high school?).  You can get a much wider range of colors by mixing paint, and also cover large areas much faster.  I nice in-between are paint markers- you get a nice, bold opaque line in many different bright colors, yet it can fill a space much quicker than with prisma color.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","So very true. Whenever Diablo 3 is brought up and how it was over hyped there always seems to be a decent portion of people who blame the reviewers. I'm sorry but when I sat down and powered out a day in Diablo 3 I loved it. I played both the Wizard and the Witch Doctor and they were tons of fun. At the time my biggest complaint was that some of the runes were pretty bland but the rune system had so much potential (and still does) AND Blizzard had stated that it was something they were aware of and were working on but Blizzard never fully carried through with it. I ended up sinking hundreds of hours into the game and got a lot of entertainment out of it.

That being said, if I could go back I would say that there were 2 main things that could have easily been remedied. The first is that if they gave the game a more rigorous beta testing then they could have caught the issues with difficulty in Inferno and brought the items up to a better standard (more specifically legendary items). Obviously these are things that are tweaked overtime post release as well (see Blizzard's constant patching in any game they release) but 6 months would have made a world of difference. The second is that they spent too much time in each act building up to the act boss (well except act 1 but in act 1 we had Magdha). Had they cut down on the interaction between the player and the act bosses I feel a lot of complaints with the plot would be dealt with.

Also, fuck everyone who thinks that Diablo II's storyline was something super deep that Diablo III shit all over. 

Sorry for the rant but I get annoyed seeing people constantly claim that reviewers were bought off when it came to Diablo III. 

Thank you for your time. ","1356998984"

&gt;Avoid slopes that are more than one or two tiles long. **Minecarts were never meant to travel at these speeds and they sometimes catch the tile edges on slopes, causing the minecart to come to a halt (explode).** The longer the slope, the more often this tends to happen. The issue is more apparent heading down slope because there is intentionally no slow down code for going down hill like there is uphill. If possible, avoid slopes all together.

Obviously, it's not an issue of a slope - but maybe a change in acceleration that happens too fast, or an obstruction.","1356998985"

Read this [basic wardrobe 3.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/mu2zu/the_basic_wardrobe_30/). This should tell you what to purchase. BTW, buy stuff from uniqlo. They have all the basics and are pretty cheap too. The materials are decent for the price you pay for.

Shave your neck beard and groom your hair better, and you will look more confident this way. Lose body fat too (count calories, eat below maintenance) and you should be good to go. (I spend quite a lot of time in /r/fitness so i just threw that in as an extra, but do read up on stuff if you plan to lose body fat.)

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I got a Billingham Hadley Pro for Christmas, and so far it's close to being perfect for me. Since you want to make your own, here's a short list of what makes it perfect for me. It's pretty much replacing my [LowePro Pro Messenger AW](http://www.lowepro.com/promessenger), so this will be a bit of a comparison to that bag. Just a quick note that I like both bags and that the stuff I'm listing as problems may just be minor issues. However, if you really want to make the best bag, I think you need to look at the minor and the major!

The list is also mostly for messenger style bags, although I guess you could apply most of this to backpacks as well.

* **Waterproof:** The LowePro has a rain cover, but it's hard to wrap around the bag. The Billingham is waterproof by default.
* **Lightweight:** The LowePro is heavy, whereas the Billingham is close to weightless without gear in it.
* **Style:** I wanted a camera bag that can double as a daily bag. Both bags fulfilled this. However, while the LowePro doesn't really look like a camera bag, it isn't the most stylish bag around. The Billingham, in my opinion, has a timeless style. Other bags I looked at were Timbuk2 and Crumpler but I do not like the material they use. Again, that's just my opinion.
* **Depth:** I expected the Billingham to be able to carry less than the LowePro, since it's not as wide. However, I'm actually able to carry more because it's deeper. I have a GorillaPod and was only able to fit it horizontally into the LowePro, laying it above all my other gear. Very inconvenient! It fits vertically in the Billingham.
* **Silence:** When I'm not doing street photography, I'm in the River Valley shooting nature and animals and stuff. The LowePro bag had a velcro cover that lets out a loud ""SHRIIIIIIRP"" whenever you open it. The Billingham had simple button release things. Now, you can silence the LowePro by folding up the velcro part and using the magnets. However, this makes it easier for a thief to snatch something out of the bag. The magnets also put my iPad into sleep mode when I rested it on the bag on my lap on the bus, which is slightly annoying.
* **Theft Protection:** What always annoyed me about the LowePro was that it was easy to get into the sides. Some wily bandit could easily slip a hand in there and loot your TI-84. The Hadley Pro's cover wraps around the sides.
* **Handmade:** I've been led to believe that Billingham bags are hand made by [British Grannies](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=260870917304046&amp;set=a.247275345330270.60654.171988459525626&amp;type=1&amp;theater) in workshops in the UK somewhere. It's not super important, but it does help justify the price when you know it doesn't come from some slave camp in China.
* **Easily Removable Gear Thing:** The gear pouch can easily be removed from the Billingham. They even sell them separately for some ridiculous price. The LowePro, on the other hand, requires you to remove every velcro separator by hand. Putting those things back in is extremely infuriating. That does go for both bags; if you can solve the velcro separator issue, then that's a big plus for your bags!

Now, the Hadley isn't perfect. Here's some things I would change:

* **Pockets:** The pocket of the LowePro had separators. This is extremely useful to organize them. The Billingham just has two big ones where I throw everything in. The LowePro also has a big pocket behind the gear part, inside the bag. This would be a useful place to stow passports and money if you make sure no one steals your entire bag.
* **Price:** I guess I have to mention price. The Billingham was almost twice as much as the LowePro, especially when I added in the shoulder pad. The shoulder pad was $65! That's crazy. Even if it does cost that much, just add it with the bag to begin with and raise the price of the whole package.
* **Availability:** It's hard for me to get a Billingham in stores in Canada, and they also never go on sale. I'm not sure how easy this will be for you, but it does help to be able to see the bag in person.

Other considerations:

* **Size Options:** You should probably sell your bag in a variety of size options. Lay out the dimensions on your site, preferably with a diagram that says exactly what depth and width is. ""11.3x11.1x10.8"" doesn't tell me much.
* **Exclusive Club:** Consider having an online, exclusive club for owners of your bag if you're going the luxury route. I know Hasselblad does this, and Leica seems to. Then people that buy your bag can be featured online. Actually, having an online presence in general probably wouldn't hurt.
* **A Good Website:** Billingham's site looks like something out of the early 00's, and the LowePro site is too big. Consider something like [Ona Bags](http://www.onabags.com/). Their bags actually look really nice, too, but then again, I haven't seen one in person.
* **Customer Service:** Have a plan ready for when someone's bag breaks and they come screaming to you. People posting on Reddit that ""writer85bag's customer service is great!"" will probably boost your sales.
* **Specific Style:** Consider marketing to a specific type of photographer. Maybe you want to target nature photographers, or make a bag for wedding photogs to carry around on gigs. Or go for street photographers.

Anyways, I hope this helps. I tend to go needlessly all out in posts. Heck, I could write more on this, but I'm supposed to be helping with New Year's dinner. Good luck to you!

Quick edit: Also in regards to style, I would try to make your bags unique. People who know what Billingham bags are can tell when they see one. Same goes for Crumplers. The Ona bags listed look nice, but they could be made by Fossil or someone else.","1356998996"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Except that SB's ''decent"" stuns have cooldowns of 35 and 75 respectively.

In addition you block charge with any stun/hex/ministun....  Sniper shooting at you can break your charge... 

In addition his damage is reliant on bashing (even more so since last patch).

This is what makes him unreliable. In addition, SB is super strong 1v1. Pros don't play 1v1, they play 5 man dota. 

Also how the fuck do you lane an SB?

And finally if you do kill one person, how do you continue to fight with charge/netherstrike on CD? killing without charge/netherstrike is difficult... are you just going to wait till they are off cd to fight again? 

NS can just keep going. NS has a long range nuke which gives him harass for laning. You can lane an NS mid with bottle and he can do ok. NS has a nuke/slow with 8 second cd and a 8(3) second silence with 12 second CD. 
At level 16 NS can have night 80+% of time (natural night plus up to 2/3 of day is night at level 16).

So NS is fast 50-83% of the time (depending on ultimate optimisation). SB can charge 1 target and is then commited... then has to wait 35 seconds to continue.

And i don't know what school of mathematics you went to, but 17% chance to bash is never a 'sure thing' (your words). 17% is 1 in 6 no matter how farmed you are. SBs base attack time is 1.7. SB with treads, hyperstone and mask of madness switched ON(OFF) BAT = ~ .6 (.85)seconds. With all these items it will take ~6(8.5) seconds to land 10 attacks. Mathematically, there is a 15% chance you still haven't bashed yet. I know dota is implementing old school psuedo random, however the point remains. How bashing is a 'sure thing' is beyond me.

Also once you charge, you are commited. NS can fake dive, juke, escape change targets... none of which SB can do with speed. Without charge/netherstrike (again CDS are huge and they are single target) it is way too easy to kite sb.

And if you don't believe me, a pro team (can't remember who) picked SB as a troll against a low ranked opponent and almost lost as a result.

Dont get me wrong, in low-&gt;mid level public games SB can be a pub stomper, however in his current form he is not used because there are other heros that fill his role and do it better.

Actually its mainly because it is impossible to lane SB without dedicated supports and you don't want to waste dedicated supports on a 2-3 position.

Now to think that Waiting for Guffman could simply had censored that one scene and then brought it back in when it was out of the theater and still gotten a PG-13 rating is really frustrating.","1356999008"

"Rottweiler","t5_2qrmj","I am so sorry about your puppy, That must have been difficult for you. 

Please read the links on the right of this page especially the ""Rottweiler Ownership Manual"" which has guidelines on buying a Rottweiler, questions to ask the breeder, how to choose a reputable breeder, etc and so forth. It's a really good read and will help you find a good companion!

Also read ""Genetic Diseases/conditions that all Rottweilers should be tested for before breeding"". In this day and age, not testing for documented breed-related hereditary diseases is irresponsible and unethical breeding.

Since you are in Texas there is a rottweiler club in your state. I would email the person in charge of the club which I found to be Pat Crawford. She will most likely be able to get you in contact with a reputable breeder.

first of all dont compare my gear in general with yours since you have a very limited budget but so you can see what you should aim for later on defensive wise for succesfull key/übers farming. 

you can infinite temepst rush with a SoJ that has 2+ spirit regen this depends on how much attack speed you have and since you have no attack speed on your gear you should be fine with the 2+ spirit regen, this gives you free space to get rid of your helm and get one with all res and i'm pretty sure that these are cheap on the US servers.

start using chant of resonance and exalted soul with guardians path passives,use mantra of healing with the circular breathing rune.
use the templar with the increased regen skil and you are good to go for infinite tempest rushing.

if you stick with the 4p innas you could get 3 pieces with all res if having enough gold  helm,chest,belt or helm,belt pants just to get enough all res
to play higher mp's for über bosses and survive when having a skorn with life steal

"mbti","t5_2s90r","That seems like a much weaker statement than what you said earlier, which was ""Those people are full of shit. Ignore them. There is no link between body language and personality type, just as there is no link between what a person looks like and personality type.""

What is the evidence for myers briggs? It's usually equally as subjective, at least so far. For example, one of the major reasons I believe in myers briggs is that I've learned to tell if a person is Ti or Te, Fi or Fe, etc, in addition to telling if a person is N or S, T or F, etc. In my experience, these observations always align consistently with the mbti model. I can judge for myself whether or not this evidence or conclusive, but it's difficult to share with you. Similarly, it's difficult for me to share with you the fact that I very reliably see the connection between body language and personality type. I feel that you are placing unrealistic demands; most things that are true are very difficult to prove in these kinds of noisy environments (not only in psychology, also in economics and most fields of physics). You seem to be equating difficulty to prove with unlikelihood to be true, which is quite simply a fallacy.

It's also very easy to know for certain that you are putting people down in the first 3 bullets you fire, or the time between pressing a particular action and your character carrying it out (reloading for example). These are a reflection of the quality of your connection. I'm aware of confirmation bias, it's not something YOU can empirically verify in this case because you don't have access to my games first hand (although I suppose you could go watch theater). Just know that the majority of people who complain about lag compensation are not aware of the different biases are brain makes. 

I threw my degree out there because my expertise in the area we are discussing is extremely relevant. I know how lag compensation works and I know the myths that are being passed around right now as well.

I don't have time to sit here and play this out on the battlefield of logic, I find than fun sometimes, but it honestly is not worth it. Just know that I and pretty much the majority of the best/most competitive players in the game are not complaining about it. The likeliness that we are just lucky (that this model you're proposing doesn't apply to me or these people) game after game or from one CoD to the next is highly unlikely and it makes much more sense that these people complaining are bad at the game (which is typically what I see in the majority of the rant videos about lag compensation in the game). Yea sometimes lag happens in the game and there's a really strange moment. Everyone get's that. The simple explanation is that the majority of the bad players are unable to tell why they are bad and are blaming a lot of their inabilities on lag compensation. I get called a hacker all the time in FFA because I destroy people (on and off my host) and it's because they are so bad at the game and don't understand how it works that they assume witchcraft must be had. The game is not as broken as everyone is making it out to be.

I don't have time to sit here and play this out on the battlefield of logic, I find than fun sometimes, but it honestly is not worth it on this topic. All you need to know is that the best players recognize the intricacies of the game and the bad players don't understand them and when the bad players get tore up, the scape goat is lag. CoD is certainly a connection based game, but you're unfounded to believe the people with the worse connections are excelling or have and advantage over the people with the better connections or host on average.","1356999024"

I was born into and raised in the field of construction and design, and I've had no doubts about it since I was a kid and got to experience the whole process of thinking up and creating a building from scratch, and it has always amazed me.

Or just self motivate.  You don't need the game to force you to play well and conserve.  I try getting fewest day runs in both Pikmin games all the time.

&gt;There is a reason old games 2D platformers had a time for each stage

Yeah, so they could influence your score, thus extending the length of a game by giving you and your friends something to compete over.  

Also, Majora's Mask is a stupid comparison, because it doesn't have an absolute time limit.  It has the **exact** same type of time limit that Pikmin 2 has: A recurring, resettable time limit.  The analog to Pikmin 1's time limit would be if they only allowed you to play the Song of Time 10 times in MM and then the Ocarina ran out of power.

&gt;Gotta love casualization!

So are you going to tell me something like Rayman Origins is ""casual"" because there is no timer or lives?  'Cause that game is one of the downright most enjoyable platformers I've played in years.  The difficulty is great, and not for contrived reasons like arbitrary timers.  How about Super Meat Boy?  That game has a timer for score (kind of like Pikmin 2's day count), but there is no running out of time or any sort of lives system and that game is extremely difficult.

edit: also as I mentioned, outfits like that are highlighted in the sidebar. Posting outfits like that will demonstrate that you *truly do not give a shit about anything the forum has to offer* because you didn't bother to read the very introduction to the subject matter.

Not to mention the reputation of people who dress poorly has been ruined historically by people who comment on MFA topics when they reach /r/all.

I feel like the two of you are talking past eachother. Manipulating a girl to get her drunk in order to take advantage of her? That's rape, no doubt about it. But when two people meet drunkenly at a party or whatever and have sex they later end up regretting? That's a different situation.

If I'm interpreting this correctly, MTMlogistics seems to be talking about the latter -- but you seem to be focusing on the former.

The details of this situation seem unclear, but my guess is that they lean more towards the drunken mistake category than that of rape. But it would probably be worth clarifying eachother's interpretation of the circumstances at play here before accusing people of taking something like rape lightly.","1356999043"

so a couple of months later, im in the break room, havin a pretty in depth conversation on religion especially on baptists with another co-worker, bosspreacherguy walks in hears the conversation, acts weird and leaves, from there on the guy who had moderate mood swings, just went full dick mode with me. making me do shit that wasn't my job, talkin shit, whatever. one day im on break, i don't have any change, so i shake the snack machine a little bit, no big deal. bosspreacherguy comes in flips out, saying i'm stealing company property, i get butt hurt, but forget about it, and then couple days later, he fires me for vandalizing company property.

the guy apparently got butthurt about my opinion on his religion, and knowing he couldn't fire me for that, he uses the fuckin snack machine as an excuse.

but its kind of cool because i picked up a really good full time job when i left. just sucks he had to be such a fucking hypocrite. i hear he's still there and still preaching on the side :D","1356999043"

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","* I feel that most people enjoy the music they listen to because they can connect with it more than others. Perhaps they also approve of the message being sent through it or maybe they simply enjoy the sound.

I tend to like loud and fast music with brass because I'm able to sink right into the tempo and just ponder everything. I also like punk and ska because I'm an angry and pessimistic person who likes the tone and mood of the genres. 

* As was said previously, it's probably because they connect with it better than others. Another idea which just occured to me is that they were around it a lot as a child or were conditioned to believe it is 'good music'. I was around a lot of celtic music as a child and I've realized few sounds are better than a good bagpipe. I also solo(percussion) in almost all triplets and walk in a 6/8 tempo because of it(it could also just be that it's a more natural flow than stiff 4/4 stuff). 

* A possibility for music's drasticly different individual experience could be because it is a very deep and emotional art form. Sometimes there is no better way to convey your sorrow or your joy than by playing a certain tune as words can sometimes lose the meaning. There seems to be a more empathetic interaction with music(makes one cry, happy, angry, energetic).

I think that our interactions(on a nuerological scale) with music is it's own branch of psychology(nuerology?). 



All of these ideas are from pure intuition and speculation. I have no academic idea as to why these things are other than the observations we've all made. 

Also, I totally understand what you mean. I never feel I can adequately convey just how powerfully a certain song moves me.","1356999044"

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","I actually think many of the arcade games from the 80s are more hardcore than casual. Checkpoints, save/reload, objective markers, tooltips, tutorials, etc. were all pretty much non-existent in the 80s. Failure and being forced to start from the beginning is pretty much the norm. Not knowing how to play was the norm.

Contrast with casual games today, where failure is rare and in some cases impossible (e.g. see Tiny Tower, where it is literally impossible to lose), and where there's lots of hand holding.

Pacman, Donkey Kong, Galaga, etc. are all pretty hardcore by today's standard. 3 lives, and that's it, if you die, it's back to the start of the game? Only the craziest gamers could tolerate such punishment.

I also suspect there was this concept of ""hardcore"" vs ""casual"" gamer already, though of course we didn't use those particular labels. It's quite obvious to see the difference between the person who spends $20 to $50 per day on Pacman, and the person who wants to just try out Pacman once. Even in their body language, and how they react to various events: When they mess up, do they shrug, because they're not sure if they did well or not relative to the average pacman player, and then move on to another game? Or do they sort of sigh, exasperated that they made such an easily-avoidable mistake, take a deep breath, insert another coin, and try to get it right this time?

**Edit**: coincidentally, I just saw this picture which sort of illustrates what I mean by body language in reaction to dying pretty well: http://imgur.com/zft7C","1356999045"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","When the pilot does something heroic to save lives or prevent a plane crash, they make national news and become national heroes. Like Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, everyone knows who he is and what he did to save 100s of lives. But when a law abiding gun owner uses a gun to stop a mass shooting before it happens, you're lucky if it's reported by local media. I read an article that I wanted to link, but I can't find it. It basically goes like this: Mentally disturbed guy goes into a restaurant and shoots his ex-girlfriend, everyone in the restaurant runs out and takes shelter in a theater next door, shooter goes into the theater with the intention of killing as many people as he can, off duty cop sees him, draws her weapon, and kills him before he can take another life. As I understand from reading the article, the only lives lost were those of the shooter and his ex-girlfriend, but he had enough firepower to rival any of the worst mass shootings we've had. The article was in the local news but was not picked up by any national media. The off duty cop potentially saved dozens of lives and should have received the same national recognition as Sully did for landing his crippled plane in the Hudson. ","1356999051"

Well... They price their games here on a flat rate.

WII + PS3 + XBOX 360 = 12.50
PS2 and Xbox = $3
Gamecube and earlier $2

Loving it.

Got the Advent Children complete DVD there ($4), TY 2 ($2), and F ZERO GX player's choice sealed ($2)

Went next door, got Guilty Gear Accent Core XX plus, $7.50

Then went to my local game store owner and talked to him, (we are decently good friends) and he shows me this lot of CIB NES games, some nice ones like Shinobi, and Zelda 1, but some others, but Gaiden 3 CIB caught my Eye, talked to the owner, he said $60 for that and another game he got in that lot, chose CIB Street FIghter 2 on Genesis, so im happy.","1356999052"

"vita","t5_2sjmv","I also considered the potential danger. The solution would be simple: first educate the potential soldiers and tell them to accept whatever inside them. Then filter out those have high risks of rejecting the shadows by extensive psychological surveys. They can also consider using methods like fMRI to have a look at the unconscious level. Then send them into the world one by one with the investigation team. The investigation team can beat the shadow should he/she reject it. With more and more soldiers have their personas, it would be easier and easier to have more such soldiers. Then they can level up in that world... I believe doing this is far less risky than letting a few kids fight those monsters.
As for the unscientific part. [Spoiler](#s ""I feel that Teddie should not exist in our world. Because he can live in our world and do all kinds of things normal people do, we should assume that he has similar physiology to other people. Otherwise, how could he eat food and digest? It's hard to imagine such a complex organism can be made from nothing. What would we find if we conduct an autopsy after his death? I am especially interested in his brain. How are his emotions, memories, and personalities etc. translated into neuron connections?"")
I didn't consider the danger of devastating the whole world, though. But if that is true, leaving them alone also has this danger.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","On the other hand, my experiences with NCIX US have been horrible.  I tried to purchase a case through them and it was a nightmare.  First they advertised it as shipping free, then tried charging me for shipping.  It took a ton of work on my part to finally get them to honor the free shipping.  

After that they denied a legitimate price match and didn't try to give me a better offer like their policy states they will.  I was okay with that, but a little annoyed.

Following that, I got the order in and the page said it was in stock.  I got an order confirmation and my credit card was charged, but no shipping information.  It took about a week of calling and e-mailing them (with calls and e-mails often ignored) to finally get them to admit that they were out of stock and that they wouldn't be able to ship it to me for another month.  Under consumer protection laws, they're not actually allowed to charge you in advance without giving you any timeline on shipping or delivery.  When your card is charged, they should have the product on hand or send you a shipping date.  Any date outside of a month requires them to inform you and ask what you want to do.  They didn't do that.

Pissed off at how they handled everything to that point, I called them up and e-mailed them to try and get a refund.  Originally they wanted to charge me a restocking fee (which is bullshit considering the item wasn't even on hand).  It took about another week and me getting the chargeback option on file with my credit card before they finally got the refund started.  I will never again buy or try to buy from NCIX US.

Maybe they're getting better, but I have seen other people with similar stories from them.  That said, NCIX Canada seems to be awesome.","1356999061"

"truetf2","t5_2stfn","Trickstabs are tricky business.  I've got more than 1k hours on spy so let me tell you how I land most of mine (in a pub)

First you must be aware of your targets skill level.  You can look at their hat or just decide how good they are as you play with them.  I can size up a pub players skill level in maybe 5 seconds of watching them navigate the map rather reliably.  Do they jump around like an idiot? They're probably competent.  Do they needlessly shout voice commands? That's another indicator of skill.  As illogical as these things may seem, they're true.  Bad players won't put in extra commands to get something done.  Some indicators of incompetence: do they randomly stop?  Do they mess up jumps? Are they lost? Do they have a shotgun as heavy or smg as sniper?  Good players may put in extra commands, but they won't spend time dawdling in the backfield or forget to crouch jump.

Now plan your trickstab according to their skill level.  If they are bad, then just blatantly walk up an incline, turn around, and jump onto their head.  Easy.  Executing this will be a bit harder than walkway, because your under pressure, but not my much.  After a couple hours you'll be trickstabbing baddies like no one's business.

If they are good, you need to throw some confusion, acting, deception, and all your nonsense spy mind games into the mix.  I won't say trickstabs don't work on good players- they do- but they are incredibly hard to pull off.  I consider myself a decent player, and I cannot remember the last time I was trickstabbed in a pub, if that gives you any indication as to how infrequently trickstabs work.  In any case, the maneuvers that works well for me is blind stairstabs, cornerstabs, and really unorthodox stabs.  Let me give an example of each.

Blind stair stabs often occur in curved staircases, like the one leading up to the roof on badwater from blu spawn.  You walk up the stairs, bait them to follow, break line of sight by going up the stairs further, and then you perform the stairstab before you even see them.  This works because they cannot see you jump so they have no time to react to getting stabbed.  The stairstab method I indicated for bad players, if you tried that on a good player, he would simply walk back, or jump to prevent you from going over his head.

You know how to do cornerstabs... It'll just take some more practice to execute.  Cornerstabs happen so fast, so they can work on both good and bad players.

Now lets get to the fun ones.  These work frequently, but are hard to set up, hard to think of in the moment, and there is no general rule to performing them: unorthodox stabs.  Let's say someone's chasing you, and you walk through a doorway.  Perhaps he's a good player and will hesitate, expecting a cornerstab.  Instead you walk up some stairs and use the elevation to stairstab him as he goes through the doorway - a blind stairstab using the door to break line of sight.  Or maybe you use a slight slope to perform a stairstab wide in the open.  It's so unexpected that even though good players could see it coming, they won't react.  Assuming that they haven't seen through your disguise, of course.  Or maybe you use a railing, small stack of logs, or even an enemy teleporter to gain enough leverage to jump over your targets head.  There are so many intricacies to each map and to spy gameplay that you can use to pull unexpected stunts.

I've just recently started using under stabs, and they're effective against both good and bad players.  Against good players, you will need to throw some acting in.  Maybe switch to your amby and pretend to be fighting for your life as you backpedal off a ledge, only to quickly maneuver under/beside them, pulling your knife out for an easy kill.  The way that helped me practice this on walkway was to turn on the launcher, and try to understab the bots as they fall.  In my experience the best ledges to do understabs are slightly higher than your character model's height.  Too short and dropping down doesn't break line of sight.  Too high, and the enemy will look straight down and start frantically spinning.  At this perfect height, you drop down, break line of sight, they keep facing forward, and you nail them just as they fall off the ledge.

With all that said about trickstabs, you must understand that they are hugely unreliable.  ""Oh I can't do trickstabs I must be bad at spy...""  False.  Trickstabs are your absolute last resort.  A pyro burning you to death?  Why not go for a cornerstab you'll die anyways.  BUT if you have a dead ringer in that situation, use it and try to survive.  Always be aware of your options.  I cannot stress this enough.  What will happen if I miss this stairstab? If the answer is death, don't do it.  Because you will probably miss it.  I would probably miss it.  Hell, stabbystabby would probably miss it, if your playing equally skilled players.  So what options do you have? I would opt to hide behind a prop, wait for them to be distracted, and go for the guaranteed kill.  The chance you will fuck up your stairstab is much higher than the chance they will decide to turn around in the middle of combat.  In short, if you have the option to trickstab and the option to either run away or set up a safer way to attack, don't fucking try the trickstab.  Nothing is more irritating to me, as a spy main, than seeing a spy try to stairstab me, when I clearly see it coming, then start flailing at me because he doesn't have any idea what he's doing.

tl;dr do blind stairstabs.","1356999067"

I like our chances this year slightly better than I did last year, but we have to beat out the Nats for the East title. I won't be easy, but it certainly can be done. I'm looking for it to go down to the last 3 days of the season and hopefully we'll come out on top.

Here are my entire playoff predictions:

American Leauge

Wildcard: Athletics over Yankees

ALDS: Athletics over Blue Jays in 5

ALDS: Tigers over Angels in 5

ALCS: Tigers over Athletics in 6

National Leauge

Wildcard: Nationals over Giants

NLDS: Braves over Nationals in 5 (I think this will be the best, most evenly matched series of the playoffs)

NLDS: Reds over Dodgers in 4

NLCS: Braves over Reds in 7

------------------------------------------------------

World Series: Braves over Tigers in 6

World Series MVP: Kris Medlen

-------------------------------------------

Awards Predictions

AL MVP: The Mike Trout

NL MVP: Matt Kemp

AL Cy young: Justin Verlander

NL Cy young: Kris Medlen

I've never seen a taxi in my town, and from my towns chamber of commerce website ""Gunnison is a small, easy to navigate community.

The point you are making is, anyone who drives to a destination, then drinks at the destination is irresponsible, regardless of whether they plan to drive home or not.

You attacked someone for having a PlanB, by saying anyone who needs a planB is irresponsible. Your cognitive dissonance is making me dizzy. 

Your ignorance shines through on so many different levels though. All alcohol of the same type is the same? Wild turkey 101 is 25% more alcoholic then ""normal"" whiskey.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","In Japanese society, the idea of ""marriage"" as it came be, where a woman entered a man's home, and his child by her inherited his property (primogeniture) developed around the 14th century and was a result of, basically, a land crisis.  The norm prior to this crisis was for male and female children to inherit pretty well evenly, but the land-holding families stretched themselves and their land out too far.  So women, particularly in warrior families, whose land may end up going to her children by whomever she lived with (her ""husband"" or male consort), gradually lost their inheritance rights.    No religion involved.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","I agree that my patients are a small and unrepresentative sample. Although it is no more wide and unscientific a claim than ""They don't work.""

I know that, unfortunately, bipolar medications aren't efficacious for everyone. Many more also have uncomfortable side effects that often require additional medication to reduce or alleviate. Some work for a period of time and then stop. It is a frustrating process. That being said, I have also seen them work wonders for many patients. 

Of course it is impossible for me to know what my patients don't tell me. That being said, I encourage patients to report all side effects &amp; coordinate with the psychiatrist (I am their therapist) to achieve both medication compliance and finding the most beneficial medication. Many, though not all, still have some symptoms of their disorder although they are much more manageable and less than their usual symptoms. I have a patient that is, at baseline, hypomanic. My role with him is to help him manage and work around his hypomania via therapy and monitor him for any change in symptoms or side effects. 

As far as keeping in contact- I have an advantage in that the system I work in includes an inpatient hospital, partial hospitalization program, intensive outpatient program (where I work), and an outpatient clinic for medication management &amp; individual psychotherapy. Essentially, many of my clients stay in the medication management phase of the system for years. 

I'm not arguing that they work for everyone. I'm simply disagreeing with your conclusion that they are ""complete shit."" ","1356999086"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I think that if both people in the relationship have ""negative"" traits it can equal a positive. For example, I can be quite the talkative and often clingy boyfriend, but when paired with a woman who is equally talkative and clingy great things happen. Obviously, a person who is clingy themselves wont dislike another person if they are clingy, and a person who might talk too much will like a person who talks just as much as they do. I think this can apply to other ""negative"" traits as well.

TL;DR: Lots of seemingly negative traits can become positive if your partner exhibits them as well.","1356999101"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Although I am in the states, I have a pretty strong understanding of what the feeling is in Italy from reading blogs and official statements in Italian. The Ultras were not happy with the new American owners last year at all. They hated Luis Enrique and the arrogance of the Americans (surprise surprise). They were even more furious with the benching of Totti by the know-nothing Spanish coach. These were all changes by the American ownership to create a new Roma that could be an international brand by copying a similar style to Barca and other clubs.

However, Pallotta got a clue this year and decided to have the team go back to it's roots. He brought in the beloved Zeman, the man who molded Totti into the champion that he is today and also tried to remain true to the past of Roma. The building of the new stadium is a good movement forward and people close to the club are optimistic. As far as Bradley is concerned, people like him well enough. He is good for Serie A, but not great. They are happy that he bleeds to win and has great passion for the game, his skills are a bit behind the level of play but he will get there. His performances for the Yanks show that he has potential to be a very good Serie A player.

AS Roma is in one of the most important cities in the world and certainly the most historic in the West, it is a brand that should sell itself. The problem was always the money up north (AC, Inter and Juve). Now that the money has moved down to Roma via Pallotta and co., Roma has a chance to market itself internationally with it's Disney/ABC/ESPN partnership. Let's hope for smooth sailing.","1356999104"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I dunno I see some good ideas but a bunch of random nerfs to solo Q superstars.

Amumu is already vulnerable early game. Hitting his mana costs is kind of a silly early game nerf.

Darius nerf unwarranted. His kit is stupid and goes against the teamwork feel of his game, but changing his ult to physical damage doesn't change that.

Maybe I'm crazy but I don't think Lee is OP. He's strong until mid game but I don't think he's all that OP.

TF is very strong as well, but his whole kit is based on his map pressure. While his damage is decent, you're forgoing the damage a normal AP does for map presence. Nerfing his ult by such a large margin seems a bit much.

Xerath DOES NOT need buffs, especially on damage. Look at the math. With the changes to penetration this preseason Xerath is one of the strongest APs in the game, as long as you build early Mpen and get a Void. The only thing ""wrong"" with the champion and the reason he's not consistently picked is because he's extremely ultimate dependent, but honestly the pen changes make his regular spells hit pretty hard now.


You have to be very careful with nerfs. There's a reason Riot takes a lot of time with these and starts small nowadays. The only time a champ gets a big nerf is when their pick status, and win rate are too high in tournament play. Eventually the happenings of tournament play trickle down to the regular users, but you can clearly tell what's strong when pro players worldwide are exploiting it concurrently.


Don't hit so hard with the nerfs.

If you are normally smart, sensitive, socially adept, and you back down (de-escalate) the situation with your talents, the woman may appreciate it and respect it. But if you were to surprise her and be the aggressive macho protector type once, it would gain so much more respect and intrigue from her. If she knows you *can* go to that place when needed, she will appreciate you all the more.

However, if you are typically the aggro alpha male who can't wait to throw down, if you were to use humor and social skills to defuse the situation, she will love you all the more for it. Showing you are capable of not having to resort to violence is much more impressive than always winning fights.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I don't presume to speak for /u/astronaut5000, but here are some helpful quotes and articles on the distinction between libertarians, left-libertarians, and liberals (US):

[John Kindley](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/11/what-is-left-libertarianism/#comment-720287261) as a response to [What is Left-Libertarianism?](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/11/what-is-left-libertarianism/)

&gt;*""... recognition that the primary purpose of the State is to steal from the poor to give to the rich, and that much of the poverty and unjust economic inequality that exists is caused by the State. The corollary of this recognition is that in opposing the State our priority should be on the ways in which the State burdens the poorer rather than the richer.""*

[The Distinctiveness of Left-Libertarianism](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/11/the-distinctiveness-of-left-libertarianism/)

&gt;*""Left-libertarianism embraces and transforms leftist and libertarian ideals.*

&gt;*Many leftists and libertarians already share some commitments: opposition to war, empire, and corporate privilege; support for civil liberties and grass-roots empowerment. However, many leftists and libertarians also embrace, and often share, various mistaken assumptions.*

&gt;*Left-libertarians challenge these assumptions while embracing the commitments leftists and libertarians share. They seek to demonstrate that it’s reasonable both to oppose structural poverty and to favor freed markets, to seek both workplace dignity and robust protections for just possessory claims, to embrace freedom of association while opposing arbitrary discrimination, to foster both peace and economic liberty, to link rejection of war and imperialism with support for peaceful, voluntary cooperation at all levels.*

&gt;*By endorsing leftist and libertarian concerns and challenging assumptions that make it difficult for leftists to embrace libertarianism and for libertarians to become leftists, left-libertarianism offers a provocative vision of an appealing politics and a world marked by greater freedom and fairness.""*

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I must respectfully disagree. Truly great music cuts through boundaries and has a degree of universal appeal. That's why people still listen to Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Rush, AC/DC, Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Metallica, etc. These bands were not popular because there were limited choices back then - they were popular because they were *really good*. If a band that good came along today they would dominate the airwaves. It wouldn't matter that there are 8 million youtube sensations and bedroom artists. You can see this with the popularity of Muse, for example. Now in my opinion Muse is pretty awesome, although they don't quite compare the above mentioned artists. And you can see how universally popular they are. They don't have to worry about competing with your friend's indie rock band. 

If anything, technology would make it *even easier* for an awesome band to get exposure and become super popular. The reason why we don't see any big new rock bands is simply because none of them are good enough to have the universal appeal. Put on some classic AC/DC or Zeppelin, and then try to find a present day band that equals that raw emotion and power and talent. Can't do it. Everyone can make music now, but extraordinary talent isn't any more common. 

I think the best music comes from being completely original, without any regard to established rules and traditions. A lot of these great rock bands came along when hard rock was a new thing, in the 60's and 70's. There were no established rules, so musicians were free to create things that were truly original and inspiring. That was the first wave of rock music. What you saw in the 80's and early 90's were smaller ripples from that original wave. Now it's kind of died down, because the novelty of rock is gone. And everyone now just wants to copy from their heroes and play by the established rules. There is no pure, unbridled originality, where true greatness comes from. 

A similar pattern is played out in other genres as well: jazz, classical, hip-hop. All the greatest stuff comes out when the style is new, and then its overrun by waves of imitators. There may be several ""revolutions"" in the life cycle of the genre, during which more awesome music comes out. Then the imitators come in again. ","1356999120"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; Maybe you call it something different 

What you have in mind when you say ""investment"" is probably just basic investing in any start up.

What I'm saying does not exist is outside investment, venture capitalism. Make sense?

&gt; It can take many years before some investment ever produces anything of value, and even longer before it pays itself off. Also there is a large element of predicting what the supply of future resources will be and what the demand for them will be, so you can prepare for the future accordingly.

Yes, that is how free markets work. Why are you arguing this?

I support free markets. I do not support capitalism. I am anarchist.

&gt;No worker want to work for years and years on something that isn't even guaranteed to ever turn a profit

Why wouldn't they get paid? It's profit sharing.

&gt;No investment markets means there will be pretty much no investment other than the small amount from new workers

Correct, this is a good thing. This keeps economies local, small, and intertwined. There is far less capability for monopolies (no matter what you consider monopolies), corporations, or any company big enough to gain a significant share of the market.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","I'm curious about your standards. I had to ""lower"" mine in some regards, but raise them in others so I could finally find someone who would date me.

I am really attracted to men who have strong personalities, and are gung ho about chasing after the woman. But I found they rarely stayed with me. They just stuck around for a bit, then found a new conquest.

My boyfriend now is a sweet person. Not very confident with women. Did not even have enough courage to kiss me the first date. I had to wait till the second, and a few shots of jack before he was brave enough. But we've been together a year and everything is moving toward marriage.

I should also say I'm 35, divorced, with three kids. My boyfriend is 23, which I never would have tried before. But he's more mature then most men I've dated.

Two books that helped me since I was clueless about dating:  
""He's just not that into you""  
""Why men marry some women and not others"".

Get them, read them, then see where you are going wrong with your approach. I learned some great lessons from these books, mainly about standing up for what I want in a relationship and not letting guys play me.","1356999127"

If you know him, you may know the episode, discussing the origin of the word faggot around a poker game. Now this simply struck up some empathy in my kind soul and I kind of made it my personal endeavor to stop saying that word. I still let it slip in friendly, comedic situations from time to time, in which I normally feel slight regret. I am simply more conscious of it now and wanted to pass that wisdom onto you. Now it is your life, and you may honestly say what you please. It is however a completely unnecessary remark you could simply leave to yourself. You're practically saying, ""Hey world, here is my spite for this person for what they have done, I want you all to see this and what I have to say about them."" To me, YOU are the attention whore, not this person looking for laughs for something in which they have actually accomplished. 

I love how when they are not one thing, they are the next. If they aren't a re-posting faggot, then they are an attention needing whore. Seems like you are a person who just wants to bitch about something, be mad about something, or just in general hate something.

"eldertrees","t5_2tclf","I've smoked nearly every day for the past ~year. I have experimented with tolerance breaks, and have netted the same results as pretty much everyone else commenting here. 

What I HAVE found, that noone has mentioned, is that alternating between different strains **DOES** circumvent some of the effects of tolerance. For the past three months or so, I've smoked a different strain every second session, rotating between three or four strains, and my tolerance has not increased past a certain point. 

My hypothesis is that, since the THC/cannibinoid profile for each strain is different, the brain is taken unawares whenever you switch strains every second session or so. See below for a (grossly simplified) explanation.  

Also, as a side tip, try smoking in a different spot than usual, or with someone you haven't smoked with in a while. Changing up the setting affects your tolerance profoundly. This is because the brain sees THC as a toxin, and whenever you are in a setting that it associates with the future influx of a toxin, it will down-regulate the respective neuroreceptors.   

This is why you hear stories about long-time heroin junkies overdosing, when they only took their usual dose; usually they were in a different setting, or shooting up with someone new, and their brain didn't recognize that setting as one that preceded the influx of a toxin, meaning that the neuroreceptors were not down-regulated appropriately, leading to overdose.

The real answer is to make sure you are getting adequate carbs and protein to keep your body properly fueled throughout your exercise regiment. That's partly why diet phases 2 and 3 shifts more and more towards carbs.

However, I prefer to use myfitnesspal.com to better target my macros. With it, you can also set your target calories, which should also take your physical activity into consideration, and still have it result in a net calorie deficit.

"firefly","t5_2qs24","I disagree, although I see where your theory lies, and here's why (also loving Community as much as the next guy)

Mal, although having shared the similarity of a troubled task, was a war hero, or war veteran.. What have you. He's past history (as revealed in Serenity) was that of a farmer, War made him into what he was in Firefly. He never changed from then, and he sticks to his morals. 

Jeff, on the other hand, changes (and I guess the argument can be made he's had 'time' to change, haha) throughout the season, but never really loses his egotistical behavior. He's not exactly the most self-centered guy, but he'll only sort out problems if it directly benefits him. Some examples of this are: When Annie loses her pen, Jeff (and the entire group) look to help her find it so they can get out, which, may I add, is a direct contrast to the Firefly gang, as to when they lose something, it all affects them directly, instead of singularly. I hope you catch my drift on this one. 

But I digress, other examples are: When Jeff first tries to get with Britta, he deliberately gets the group to argue. Or when Jeff loses his spot on the study group to Pierce, he tries to get his spot back.. This never happens to Mal, and his place in the group can never be tested as.. well, his the Captain of the ship. Jeff's place is much more flexible, as the group is proven to be able to function without him (see: Abed's Chicken episode, The mentioned episode featuring 'the table', some of the Christmas episode..) my point is, their two personalities, demeanor, morals and backstories clash too much, even if they share some similarities. 

Now onto Britta and Zoe. Now, I realize where the 'mother' thing comes on, seeing how as Zoe and Mal are basically the leaders of the ship, but Zoe has been proven to be quite vulnerable when it comes to her husband, (see: the episode where Mal and Wash are captured and tortured) while Britta is nowhere near as vulnerable, she does go out of her way to assist Jeff, but when he offers her to be her psychology student, she declines. While in Firefly Zoe and the gang go back to help Mal, while in Community the only person which tries to help Jeff is Britta. This shows a clear emphasis on singular character development, rather than group development, which Firefly encompasses. 

But, I must also stress, Britta, personality wise, is nothing like Zoe. Britta is a try-hard non-conformist with a pension to 'ruin' other men (as touched on by Troy and Abed in the episode about the Russian) and never truly falls for Jeff (although she does admit she loves him in the last episode of Season 1), I guess the correlation of how they met and their reaction to it can be identical, (Jeff met Britta at the School and offered her to do Spanish Class, her reaction to him was one of disgust. Wash met Zoe onboard Firefly, her reaction to him was disgust) but other than that their individual story lines do not correlate well. 

I can touch on a few more things but if there's more interest I'd be happy to discuss it.. for now..

I'll touch on a few points 

- You mention how the Community Crew are completely loyal to one another, like the Serenity crew. They're not, even though they're friends. Jeff is the first to leave in the Season 2 Christmas episode, whereas Mal does not leave his group so easily. When their is new-comers, (Christina Hendricks, Simon, River, The Alliance Man...) they're not quick to exclude them from the group in Firefly, whereas in Community, they exclude Chang and Jack Black's cameo almost exclusively. 

- The characters in Firefly are quite sound, mentally (excluding River of course, lol) and loyal to one another. The characters in Community are all completely eccentric and this plays to one another's strength. 

- The table in Community represents the group as a whole, the entire ship of Firefly represents the Firefly crew as a whole, their is a larger encompassing area and their isn't really any strong rivals for Firefly or 'direct' rivals. Their are indirect rivals (the Alliance Crew and the Reavers) but there is many direct rivals for the community gang (city college, the bullies...) Serenity is more of a crew you want to be in while the Community gang are a group that others in the show want to be in, in real life, you do not want to be involved in that group. 

And that's all I can say for now.","1356999151"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","***DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT***  
I think it's important to realize that niceness is not always what people are looking for in a relationship, even if they don't know it.  

Let me give an example: My family can be pretty dysfunctional at times. When I was a kid, my mom was undiagnosed with bi-polar disorder, and would often ""explode"" on me and my brothers.  

In my case, this created a pretty strong tendency to avoid conflict. Consequently, I place a lot of value in finding a similar sense in potential mates.  
In other words, I really like nice girls.  

However, in the case of my older brother, who is far more energetic and extroverted than me, this created a sense of numbness towards conflict. Sometimes it seems like his primary method of communication is via conflict. This isn't really a bad thing; He is very honest and straight-forward in his communication. But he is a person who places much less value on niceness in a relationship.  

Luckily, my brother is very self-aware, and *knows* that he doesn't value niceness very much. This allows him to surround himself with like-minded individuals and be content in his relationships which, to an outsider, would appear dysfunctional and/or confrontational.   
  
  
Unfortunately, your guy friend sounds like he is part of the unlucky group of people who don't really know what they want.  
Clearly, there is a part of the ""mistreatment"" he revives at the hands of his current SO that is actually something he subconsciously desires in a relationship, otherwise he would've moved on long ago.  
This is *especially* true because of the opportunity to move on that you represent to him. From what you've said, it sounds like you are everything this girl isn't. If he really wanted what he says he wanted, moving on to you would be a no-brainer.

He subconsciously knows that he won't receive that ""mistreatment"" at your hands. As a result, he doesn't want a relationship with you, even though he keeps indicating that he does.  
The worst part about this situation is that he probably won't realize what he really wants any time soon.  
He'll continue to be unhappy with his current relationship, because part of it is toxic, and he wants out.  
But part of it isn't, and if he moves on to you, he'll be missing that part, even if he won't admit to it.  
  
Basically what I'm saying is this guy has emotional issues, and you should only continue pursuing him if you are ready to deal with the shit that will surface as you get to know him better.  

I'm really sorry for both of you. It's a crappy situation, one that I've been in. I wish you the best of luck.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No, I don't think anyone here insists on a landline. Even most jobs I have applied for have separate spaces for cell and home phone.

Also, the difference in cell phone and home phone numbers is much more subtle, and often indistinguishable anymore.

For instance, my home phone 15 years ago was (these numbers are made up to avoid pranksters to whoever lives there now, but the principle remains) 706-594-4235, while my cell was 706-590-1122.

Often, that 2nd set of numbers just had the last number changed to 0 for cell phones. As cell numbers became more common, the difference between home and cell numbers is indistinguishable (as they don't implement the 2nd group 0 thing anymore) unless you are familiar with the numbers in the area.","1356999159"

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","It's always tough fitting into school when you are the new kid in town. But somehow I managed to meet some pretty cool friends on the first day of the new school semester. It was a slow day, I lost interest in school work, I barely made it passed first block because I was exhausted from helping my parents move into my new house which was far away from school. I wondered why my parents had placed me in that school when It was so far away from my home. But I didn't care.

 I had more important things on my mind. Where was I going to find my next buzz area. In my old town somewhere in rural New Jersey I had always gone to a bridge that was out of service, so no one really snooped around there accept for me and my friends. But this is not important, If you really want to get into this story I have to tell you about my friends that I met that day. The first person that I met in the zoo of a school was Zachery. He was a tall, blonde headed skinny guy that I met first block in my World History freshman class. He always talked to me about how he and his friends would get a little something from some pill that I never even knew that existed. He invited me to join them, but I told him that I couldn't do that because I never really found interest in pills. He was a bit of a slob anyway. In my 3rd block, advanced civics class I met Logan and Jake. 

 They were best friends, I liked to have conversations with them about fishing, hunting, four wheeling, you know your basic south of the Mason Dixon line redneck stereotypical people. Then there was a real city kid named Kenny. He liked to go by Kenny because he wanted to sound more country so he could fit in with Jake and Logan. But truth is, he is the citiest kid you will ever meet. His real name was Kenneth. He was wasn't that tall but wasn't really short either. As far as I know He, Jake, and Logan have always been buddies.

  I think they wanted me to join their group. Zachery hung out with them but, not as much as I did. Logan's birthday was coming up and he had invited me to go to it. I was really happy when I was told about where he lived. He lived right down the street from where I moved to. At least that was what I thought. He had told me that I should have met him at around four at his house. So being the self driven young man I was at the time I got ready at around 3:30 and I drove myself down the long dirt road that led to Logan's house. For nearly 20 minutes I was driving before I got out my cell and called Logan. He told me that I should only have had to go down that road for nearly 5 minutes before seeing his house. So I figured I was just losing my mind.

  It turns out I was. I had turned around to get back inside my car from earlier getting out of it so I could speak on the phone more comfortably. I turned to find my car 20 feet away from me on the road, but I was in the middle of the forest. I thought nothing of it. I merely thought that I had just wandered into the woods while I was on the phone. But I didn't remember moving at all. I got back into my car to drive for nearly half an hour longer to find his house. I ended up behind it. I thought nothing of it until he had told me that the dirt road was one way and there was no way to get behind his house from it. That was the first thing that started to make me a little uneasy that night. All of my friends that I had met at school was there. Zachery, Logan, Jake and even Kenny. 

 Logan had told me that he had some awesome things planned for that night. He told me that all we were going to do was camp outside the whole night and go do some probably immature things with fire and gasoline. First thing we all did was go inside and did the fun thing. Eat cake! So we did, I had also met Logan's parents which seemed like pretty cool people, his dad showed me how to shoot a shotgun since I had never done it before. As dusk started to approach we gathered our things and headed on down to a field that Logan's parents owned. We were going to camp out there for the night and put up a huge bonfire a couple ten feet from out camp. We stayed out there trying to get the fire started for nearly 40 minutes before Jake came by and poured about a gallon of gasoline on it before he through a match onto it and it burst into flames. He had thought that it was hysterical , but I on the other hand was way to close to it and my eyebrows were burned off. It was a fun night, but we decided to head to bed and climb into our sleeping bags.

   Little did I know that this was when things were seriously about to go wrong. I'd say it was around 3:00 in the morning when I woke up to hear moans, coming from the woods. Nearly 300 feet away from the tree line. These moans weren't the type of moans that you hear in movies. These moans were actually painful to listen to, they were so excruciatingly painful that I swear my ears bled. Everyone jumped up out of their sleeping bags and began to cover there ears. It sounded like they were getting louder, and closer. They were! They were getting louder...louder... and even louder...LOUDER!! 

 They were now in sync. Getting more painful to listen to, I finally just screamed as loud as I could “ENOUGH!!!” and they soon died out. We quickly became aware of our surroundings once again and I had noticed that everyone including myself was bleeding from their ears and nose. It had dropped at least 20 degrees during this moaning period. It became uncomfortable to be outside. We started to run to the safety of the house which was nearly a mile away. We all just stopped, and stared at this bright light that was deep in the forest from where the moaning sounds were coming from.

   It was so bright it was as if someone had turned on the sun in the middle of the night. But this wasn't just any light, it was a bright white light with a sort of ambient tone to it. It was drawing us in, as if we were flying bugs and it was a lamp. We said nothing. We couldn't speak. I was so scared that I could have just died right there. We all got closer, and closer, till we reached the edge of the forest. The light was so close now that I couldn't even see. I was blind. We all go so close that we could feel heat from it. But once we got close enough, I could tell that the bright light was a barrier. We passed into it. There was where we saw what caused the moaning sounds. They were tall and white. Had no ears, no hair, nothing accept deathly scary black eyes and a deep mouth that seemed to go on forever. There were about 12 of them, in a circle all around us. I could feel them touching me. I could feel them trying to figure out what I was, touching my face. With there hands. Which were so cold. So cold... 

 Finally I became free of the lights grip. I could move! I had tried to run away but I couldn't get out from the inside of the barrier. That was when I noticed my friends. They were stuck. They couldn't move. The more I looked at them, then to those creatures. The more they started to turn into them. I stopped in my tracks, so afraid of what was going to happen to me that I blacked out. I woke and saw all of them around me. I can only remember one thing that they said. We have you. You can not escape. You are ours. 

 I woke up in my bed room that morning with nothing to remind me about that night accept for the pile of bones that was in my room. The bones of my friends.

"genderqueer","t5_2r1c3","Omg! my first reddit gold ._. Thank You!
I guess I should say something more. I didn't start being more fluid until a couple years ago, and had a really hard time expressing it. My outward day to day appearance is very masculine, and that is partly because in may ways i am very masculine. its just that, in many way, I am *very* feminine. My friends/lovers and I have pretty much agreed that i'm a somewhat butch lesbian trapped in a strapping lads body.

Its been very confusing for me. One of the ironic issues is that, although it took me a very (past few years) long time to realize it, I am quite the sexy male. Making the transition was very difficult, even wearing a manly kilt for the first time garnered many uncomfortable comments. (Anyone who is considering expressing in public, think of Eddie Izzard, its 95% confidence) 

I've also wrestled a lot with my look in general. During my dramatic swings of gender identity, I will go from wanting to hit the gym and put on 15lb of muscle, and diet to become a slender/sexy trap. Fortunately after some outward expression, i calmed down and with some experimentation i found my happy medium (#1)

I suppose the sad thing is I'm getting older so its harder to pull off. Partly because I just don't go out much, nor have the energy. Plus i do look striking in a suit and have been wearing that more. Usually i just wish I had been a woman so i can go day to day in comfortable clothes (granted skirts are amazingly comfortable) and then dress up for evenings out. These days its usually too much hassle cross which i Go out, since the main reason i go out is to relax. I was reminiscing some when i found the photos and decided to post them

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","One thing I'd like to mention is that slaves, for the most part, couldn't or didn't just up and leave the south immediately after the war. It wasn't really until nearly twenty years later in what became known as the Black/Kansas Exodus that vast amounts of African-Americans began fleeing for greener pastures. This was almost exclusively thanks to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan and the passage of Jim Crow Laws. 

Immediately after the war many freed slaves stayed on their ex-owners properties working through share-cropping and tenant farming. While these workers acted as borderline slaves or serfs, they were paid usually in a percentage of what they produced in exchange for property and/or tools from the owner. So, for many years, until the Panic of 1873 in particular, the South was busy dealing with reconstruction and rebuilding rather than attempting to grow.

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","At 5'10"" and 150, you're doing good not to do the typical body part split.  You're not at the point where you need a week to recover.  However, 32 sets is a lot of volume and you could probably use the time more effectively.

You need to concentrate on compound lifts.  Bench, press, Pendlay rows, deadlifts, squats, and possibly power cleans.  Do those first, then do the isolation stuff (if you decide you have to do isolation stuff - you really don't have to at this point).

You also need to be increasing something every workout at this point.  You're new and have the chance to get linear progression every workout.  If you eat enough and sleep enough, you should be able to add 5lbs 3 times every 2 weeks to everything except press.  If you can't, you didn't recover completely.  Which means either you didn't eat enough, you didn't sleep enough, or your workouts are too close together.

Take a look at Greyskull LP.  It's a bodybuilding program for beginners.  Starting Strength and Strong Lifts are two more programs for beginners, but they're more aimed at strength.

You also need to actually keep track of how much protein you're getting, rather than ""protein shakes with ON Whey protein powder twice every day i workout.""  Your body is building muscle on days you don't work out as well.  Get 1g of protein for every pound you weigh every day.  Some people say more, some people say less, but the well done studies show that around .82g/lb is about the most you can use.

Also, head over to /r/fitness.  It sounds like it would be aimed at mostly fitness, but it's really more a subreddit for strength training.

My gut feeling, however, is that what you're turned on by in drawn cartoons doesn't translate 100% into what you're into in real life.  I would (personally) not see interest in hentai involving children as a definite indicator of pedophilia.

Do you think your husband would tell you if he was sexually interested in real children?  It seems like there's a rough scientific consensus that pedophilia doesn't ""develop,"" although it can be recognized later in life.  Here's a [WebMD article] (http://www.webmd.com/mental-health/features/explaining-pedophilia) which addresses that.  If your husband is legitimately not attracted to children now, I doubt that he will eventually be attracted to them.

All that said, you shouldn't be with someone whose sexual preferences make you uncomfortable.  You're the only one who can decide whether or not to remain in the marriage.","1356999173"

At levels of ""heat"" that you can play with without using specialized equipment, the effect is mostly to make the atoms move faster (e.g. melting / boiling) and weaken molecular bonds (which could then result in creation of new bonds with other atoms that is more thermodynamically favorable).

Obviously there are other effects, especially if you get into relativistic effects, but it's hard to quantify something like ""heat"" at that scale -- at that level you're better off discussing the energy of a particle or the wavelength of a photon.","1356999175"

"tea","t5_2qq5e","If you're just starting out and interested in experimenting with different kinds of tea, porcelain will probably be both cheaper and more versatile than cast iron, which in my opinion can actually hold too much heat for more delicate teas. The tea pot that you linked is certainly very cute though it's hard for me to get a good sense of the actual size of it from the picture, but it does look like the infuser is removable which is good since that lets you pull it out and stop steeping your tea when it's to your taste. With all teapots, you'll want to heat only water in a kettle and pour the water into the teapot with the tea. 

I think I'm going to sound like a broken record in this sub, but Adagio is great for trying out a bunch of different tea for fairly cheap since they have cheap samples. I've never tried their mate but they do sell it as well as rooibos and many other varieties of non-tea ""tea"". Personally no matter how much fancy tea I experiment with, I still buy all my peppermint and jasmine teas from Adagio because I go through a lot of both and theirs are very good and very cheap in bulk.","1356999180"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Intermediate but a little rusty in regards to Krav Maga. Was coming out of a hole-in-the-wall Thai place in shitty part of North Hollywood with my girlfriend at the time. We parked about a good block away. As we passed a slummy apartment complex, this black guy in a hoodie starts to follow us. Once we turned down the residential street, off the main drag where my car was, the guy yells ""EY TURN YOSELF AROUND!"" So we do. He's got a good sized (6"" or so) folding knife unfolded in his hand. 

Now my first thought was to just give him our wallets/purses but then I thought about how angry I would be at myself. I felt my adrenaline and anger building at the same time. As soon as he got within arms reach I instinctively grabbed the wrist of the hand that held the knife. I was able to somewhat effortlessly maneuver his wrist and hand into an ""uncomfortable"" position for this gentleman. Once he dropped the knife I followed with a stiff jab to the sternum and then one to the throat. He fell to his knees and I was able to submit him. 

I held him there for about 8 minutes until the LAPD arrived. The whole time he was begging me to let him go. I was loving every minute of it. 

The cherry on top was arguing with my girlfriend the entire ride home about how I was supposedly ""overly agressive"" and could have probably ""talked myself out of the situation if I had just used my brain instead of my fists."" More recently it was one of the issues she brought up when we were breaking up. ","1356999182"

Wanting sex from a woman is completely fine. Only wanting sex from a woman is completely fine.

Finally, and what matters most: Congress elections are separate from Presidential ones.

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","Warrior is a well-balanced melee class to start; Knight is a little bulkier and thief is a little less bulky. You mentioned the Black Knight Halberd, any black knight weapon is great though they can't be 'found' and will drop from non-respawning enemies until the very end of the game and are therefore unreliable to get. [Zweihander](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/zweihander) is a good weapon that you can get early, near the 'unkillable' skeletons by firelink, if you're into massive swords. 


[Scimitar](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/scimitar) is a good weapon for a dexterity build if you want to build that way. Purchased from the merchant in Undead Burg. Alternatively the [Uchigatana](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/uchigatana) which is better, but requires you kill the merchant (I personally don't reccomend doing so).

[Straight Sword of Astora](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/astora-s-straight-sword) can be accessed early via Master Key, should you choose it, and is very effective at low levels though it will fade off.


[Drake Sword](http://darksouls.wikidot.com/drake-sword) I would not reccomend the Drake Sword as it will make the first part of the game incredibly easy and will become next to useless later as it does not scale. Can be gotten by shooting ~30 arrows into the tail of the Drake on the Bridge.


With a STR/DEX build though you can really take any weapon you like the moveset of and upgrade it to be useful; it all comes down to preference. Same answer to your armor question below; it's all about preference: if you prefer mobility over durability go with light, and vice versa. I would reccomend staying below 50% of your  maximum equip load though as the 'fat roll' is pretty weak.

Hope this helps.","1356999193"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","The thing that people seem to overlook with Bynum is that the reason he's not playing is from the side affects of the procedure he had done in Germany to help prevent him from being so injury-prone going forward.  Hopefully (fingers crossed), once he makes his return back and his cartilage is back to it's regular thickness, he won't have anywhere near the issues with his knees he's fought his entire career.  

It's funny how people jump all over Bynum, but get pissy if I were to mention the same thing about Derrick Rose.  I am a HUGE Derrick Rose fan, but there's a good chance he'll never be the same player and he'll face injury issues for the rest of his career.  We're talking about a player who missed 1/3 of last season and will likely miss this entire year.   For some reason, Bynum is ""damaged goods"" though and Rose is the golden boy.  Again, I have a ton of respect for  Derrick Rose and I hope he makes a full recovery.  Unfortunately, the sad fact of the matter is that the injury he suffered might cause him to lose a half step and Derrick Rose losing a half step will take away a big part of what was so special about him.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","It varies slightly, but I think that's an accurate general description of the trend. In my state, it's very common for social services to *threaten* to go after the custodial parent for child support if she doesn't give up her rights, and then negotiate a deal where she signs the kid over in exchange for not being pursued for support. This probably saves the state money in the long run, since terminating parental rights for custodial parents is so expensive and time-consuming. 

If this same offer were made with the same frequency and enthusiasm to noncustodial parents whose kids end up in the system, I'd have no problem with it. But parents who have been out of contact with the child for an extended period are much easier to TPR - and that is almost always the father. And if there was a child support order in place prior to the adoption, it's not likely to be waived unless the father actually gets involved with the case and offers to sign an adoption consent in exchange for having the support obligation go away. 

If it's any consolation, this guy has never paid a dime of support and he's about to go to prison on an unrelated matter. I don't think the state will get their pound of flesh in this case. ","1356999197"

Also, look into the equipment for open water- goggles, wet suit, cap- they are going to be constricting so understand you'll want to look into finding the best fit. Again, check out a local program to determine the best way to go about this, check out the /r/triathlon too. Good Luck.","1356999203"

Video games are probably how I got started with computers, I wanted to know how they worked.  Which got me into taking apart consoles, and marveling over the circuitry.  When I was in 9th grade I got my first PC.  An 8088.  I worked that thing over as much as I could.  Then a 386/sx16, a 486 dx2/66, 486 dx4/100, etc.  I used to set up all of my friends computers with 10-base-2 network cards, so we could play ROTT, DOOM, C&amp;C, and DUKE3D together.  By the time I graduated high school I was running a small network in my parents house with a Pentium 66 Server running Windows NT 3.5, to support my BBS.  

I was kind of a nerd.

The one thing I would say you have to make sure of is that your tech actually makes sense, because if it doesn't, you might get people upset. For an example from our world, if you propose a global communication network, then you also have to account for e-commerce and rapid spread of information, along with all the social and cultural consequences of that. I've done slush pile reading (the manuscripts that people submit to publishing houses unsolicited) and seen worlds where there's strong AI but this somehow doesn't have any impact on the world. That's fine for certain genres, but the more concrete your world is the more you need to think your technologies through, so that you can make sure that there aren't obvious applications that the brightest scientists and businessmen of your world missed.","1356999206"

From there, I recommend coating them in elmer's glue and tissues or very thin paper towels to build up a structure. Once you've got that, use a couple of layers of liquid latex in flesh tone to cover the whole thing making sure to paint further than where the balloons end to give you a good edge for attaching later. 

Once you've gotten enough latex built up it should be safe to pop the balloons. 

Paint them to blend/match with the rest of the makeup and then reattach with spirit gum or pros aide and blend the edges down with tissues and latex.

He spent very little of his time bringing in federal funding to a major metropolitan district. Instead he focused on running for President &amp; cultivating his own personal power. Or getting married to a very beautiful redhead. Did you know he doesn't even have top secret clearance for foreign policy? So he never got top secret briefings?

Look. I agree with a lot of what Kucinich says. But the problem with him is that he had been a terrible congressional rep for a major area. Very little Federal Funding. No serious committee assignments. Voted down in a primary.

"technology","t5_2qh16","You seem to have misunderstood me. I don't have to buy anything to become interested in any kind of genre, I'm already interested in it. The difference between seeking out reviews, going through newsfeeds etc and just downloading everything that looks halfway interesting is one of convenience. It's a lot easier and quicker to just download whatever catches my fancy and then decide whether I like it or not if I haven't already made up my mind from a 3 minutes youtube video of it. Demos for games, btw, are either nonexistant today or they are extremely misleading as developers like to cram every single feature and game mechanic into the demo and make the first level or two as impressive as possible before allowing the rest of the game to be a repetitive grind. Demos are walled gardens prettied up as much as possible to lure in buyers and imho not nearly as useful as just torrenting the whole game instead.

As for not spending a single dime, I don't refuse to pay for certain content out of a belief or opinion that it shouldn't be paid for. I pay for content where I feel it is worth the price compared to the quality of the product. Whether or not you choose to consider that a form of donation isn't really relevant and the suggestion that the business models are then based on donations which would reduce revenue and profits is both flawed and presumptuous. Your last paragraph simply extrapolates from this flawed presumption while ignoring the part where my donations are likely a factor of 10 or higher than what the average consumer spends in a given period of time.

All statistics I've seen on spending for games have shown the exact opposite trend of what you're saying, namely that pirates spend *more* money on average on games and movies than non-pirates because the people who are driven to large amounts of piracy don't necessarily do it because they don't have the money to pay, but because they are avid consumers and so need to be selective about who they choose to pay. This, by the way, also means pirates exert a stronger selective pressure on developers to create good products with value than nonpirates.

Whether you buy 10 games and pirate a 1000 or just buy 10 games and don't pirate anything doesn't change the amount of money the gaming industry receives and can put towards future development. If everybody on the planet right this moment pirated every single game ever made in history after they made their normal purchases it would make exactly 0 difference on the gaming industry's profits and it would make 0 difference on the number of games we would see made in the future.","1356999211"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The reason for the current fiscal cliff problem is a combination of two things.

One is that you have divided congress that is scared to compromise because of the rise in partisanship. That's not to say in the past both sides didn't want to stick to their principles. The difference today is the 24 hour news cycle and social media. If you do anything bipartisan in today's climate, you will be blasted by media channels (Republicans who compromised would be blasted on Fox, Democrats on MSNBC for example) and by social media. You can't escape your base anymore as they are usually the loudest, most vocal group that can cut you down the most.

The second problem being there are benefits for politicians to NOT reach a deal right away. This sounds counterproductive but it will be politically beneficial for both Republicans and Democrats to wait. After the first of the year, both sides can say, no matter the deal, they helped CUT taxes because taxes as of midnight will be up. While this takes a lot of stretching and suspension of belief, some nice sound bites  in the coming weeks will show this to be true.

I feel the most sympathy with House Redoran; they are Dunmer driven by creeds and deeds, like I am. House Indoril is closer to the compassion and sympathy of Almalexia, a comfortable and secure serenity. House Telvanni matches the disposition of my brother Sotha Sil -- iconoclastic, profane, unconventional.

House Hlaalu represents the future of the Dunmer, integrated into the sophisticated mainstream of the traditionless, raceless, godless culture of the Empire. House Dres represents the past of pre-Tribunal Great House culture, a persistent tradition of Daedra- and ancestor-worshipping civilized Dunmer clans. And I even love the Ashlanders for their preservation of the most ancient barbarian tribal traditions of the Dunmer who first settled Morrowind.""","1356999217"

"Art","t5_2qh7a","Thanks! I was definitely going for an epic feel, as the title would also suggest, I'm glad it came through. Used Photoshop.  If you're looking to soften your line and brushwork I'd suggest getting to know how to make your own brushes (Ctrl-B is the hotkey, I believe).  Mess around with the presets that photoshop has, shape dynamics, hardness and transfer among others. Make brushes that excite you and make you want to draw with them, and then do exactly that. Doodle, mess around and make sure to use multiple layers. Don't be restrained by brush size - experiment with a brush at 3 pixels wide just as much as 150 wide. Think about how each brush can accomplish a task better than others, and when it's most appropriate. 

Another thing I'd mention is that most people try to use photoshop for specifically replicating a medium in real life. This to me seems as odd and pointless as trying to make watercolor feel like colored pencil. I don't think the photoshop or digital 'look' is something to be afraid of, but instead something to be embraced. If you want an oil painting feel, use oils. I guess my point here is to not feel trapped by a particular style, in fact, I'd recommend trying out various styles you see others have online. Most of all, though, have fun, and keep at it!","1356999227"

Kindle &gt; Book &gt; iPad

The iPad is too bright and the touch screen is annoying because I am always changing pages or looking up words or whatever when I'm just trying to handle the thing like an ordinary object.

The book is better, but it doesn't hold its page until I've been reading it for several days so as to properly subjugate the spine, and it's bulkier than the Kindle, and it's annoying to bring a lot of them on trips.

The Kindle seems to be the best of the bunch. Really the only drawbacks are that (1) I worry more about getting grapefruit squirt on it than I do with a book, and (2) it's a pain when I want to flip back through the past 20 pages to refresh my memory about what Mr X said to Mrs Y in the conservatory — with a book you just flip until you recognize the page, but with the Kindle you have to go one page at a time and wait for each one to draw before you can scan it.","1356999233"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Here's my reasoning for it:

Stats: Take the number of visits to the bathroom per household &amp; divide it by type. So for women, you have 100% in the seat down category and 0% in the seat up category. For men, you have...IDK..for me it's 70 down, 30 up...if that. I usually handle both at once. Given that the toilet seat is down much more of the time, wouldn't you say that it's more efficient?

Consequences: Men probably look at the toilet more (due to lack of muscle memory of sitting each time). As such, they probably will not bear the consequence of pissy seat or open seat. Therefore, the consequences probably ride with the women.

Assuming Seat Up: If a woman makes a mistake and sits, it's toilet bath (men probably won't make this mistake).
Assuming Seat Down: If a man makes a mistake and pisses, it's either R Kelly on the butt for the woman or a wipe of the toilet seat for the man.

In these scenarios, keeping the seat down and men wiping in the event of a mistake minimizes the work and the consequences of the household IMO.

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","Propaganda is a powerful tool. Currently, the Democrats are doing it better, but it could swing back in favor of the Republicans.

Let me give you an example. During the election, a friend and I were discussing the Presidential debates. He's a dyed in the wool Democrat. The topic of ""self-deportation"" for illegal immigrants came up, and he immediately denounced it as racist. I asked him why, and he told me it was anti-hispanic. I said, well, disincentivizing illegal immigration is better than rounding everyone up, right? And he agreed. I followed up by saying that we can't adopt a full open borders policy, which he agreed to as well. I sealed the deal by pointing out that disincentivization is a good medium between the two. At this point, he didn't really know what to say except ""I still think it's racist."" He didn't know why. It just was.

The media machine hammered it into his head that such a policy is absolutely racist. Even though he ultimately agreed with the underlying logic for it, he still came to the conclusion that it was racist because he's had it drilled into his head so much during the election cycle that he'll come back to it no matter what.

So, I think that if the Republicans could push harder on the propaganda, it could swing around. The Democrats were effective in demonizing Romney, and Romney made the mistake of trying to keep his hands clean in the beginning. This let the Democrats set the tone of the election.","1356999238"

I think we need different words, because adjectives sometimes make it confusing as to what we are talking about.

When I was 17, I was seduced by a 35 year old woman.  Now, depending upon the jurisdiction, this would be statutory rape, but I'd never in a million years call it any type of rape.  I wasn't raped.  

But switch the genders and lots of people would have no problem saying ""yes, that's rape"" and they don't bother to qualify that it's not of the ""violent, I have a gun"" type of rape.

Words, so fucking difficult sometimes.

No offense intended.

I recall one time, before I quit watching any type of news, Sean Hannity berating Woopi Goldberg for saying that what happened with, what's his face, the dude in France,,,,Oh, Roman Polanski, wasn't ""rape-rape"",,,,,

That was her word, Woopi's phrase, not ""rape-rape""

And personality-wise... I guess that's difficult too. People always perceive themselves differently, but as far as I know I don't make enemies and people don't shy away from me so I don't think I'm very mean or intimidating at all.

I'm not looking for comments regarding aesthetics-- I'm really curious as to whether I look *unhealthy,* as in ""Yes, you look overweight and you should reconsider some life choices to stay healthy.""

I really do love my body and while I would like to lose some weight to fit into my own personal opinion of ""you look great, self,"" I'm also at peace with my reflection.  I've just felt like so many people have made comments that maybe I need to take a closer look.  As for the people from whom I get validation, I completely agree with your point.  I spend the majority of my time with positive people who don't make rude comments and who love me for who I am, not the number of inches around my waist.  But as I said in my post, family will be family.

I'm not trying to fish for compliments or post pictures of sunken ribcages while whining ""I'm soo fatttt.""  I used to weigh 200 lbs and feel like a new person after losing those 20 lbs.  I think /r/loseit can understand that frame of mind when you get so wrapped up in the day-to-day details that you forget how your body has changed in the long run.

Thank you for your honesty and for the motivation.  My school offers free counseling and I think I'll look into that when the offices open back up.  There's obviously more going on here than what's in my control and I do agree that I need some new perspective and possibly coping skills.

1. Congress shall be apportioned differently. Senate remains the same, but each state has double the number of congressmen, and they are not bound by county, but to the state as a whole and are apportioned parliamentary style; if you win 40% of the vote, you get roughly 40% of the representatives

2. No second amendment. It's outdated and dangerous with a standing army, national guard, federal, state, and local law enforcement.

3. The Department of Justice is a separate branch, separate from the political branches so that prosecutions can be carried out impartially without regard for political circumstances. 

4. Right to privacy made explicit.

5. Definition of ""War"" expanded to include pretty much any hostilities; Senate and House are required to consent.

6. Reform the nomination process for judges and cabinet officials so that it cannot be held up by individual members or even whole committees. Each nominee goes straight to the floor for a vote. 

I'm sure there are others but that's what I can think of off the top of my head. ","1356999258"

Something I feel hurt the series in the long run was the introduction of voiced dialogue.  Text based dialogue allowed the modding community to throw together thousands of hours worth of content which could be integrated into the existing game completely seamlessly.  There were only a few mods that I ever found for Oblivion that used decent voice actors, and even those sounded out of place.  Voice acting kinda killed modding (at least on the scale which was allowed in Morrowind).  Text also allowed for non-human entities to speak to the player.  Can you imagine how much different finding the mudcrab merchant would have been if it had had voiced lines?  What about the Ash slaves?  Those dudes had some bizarre things to say, and voiced lines would have killed the impact.

As for your #5, I would say *don't* make it known, keep that shit to yourself for as long as possible. Look for menu options like steak or chicken salads, burgers without a bun, steaks, etc, and just quietly order something you can eat without making a big deal about it. You're making a major diet and lifestyle change that can be daunting in its own right without having to hear everyone's bullshit about it. E.g. ""Oh, well, I read this article on CNN that said that caveman diet will kill you!"" etc. Ideally you want your first conversations with coworkers to come in about February or March or so when you're maybe already down 20 lbs and co-workers say ""Damn, naery, you're lookin' good, what have you been up to!?"" Then, you can talk about it if you want to.

Best case scenario, even if you coworkers are super-awesome people who won't be assholes as described in some other posters' answers here, you still don't want to tell them because of the [interesting principle that you are more likely to be successful if you don't.](http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/14/health/lose-weight-mouth-shut-secret/index.html) ","1356999261"

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","A film degree doesn't really mean anything all by itself, so don't make your decision based on what a diploma from Emerson will get you.  It's all about gaining experience and honing your craft.  No one in the industry cares if some 22 year old has a diploma from NYU, USC, or Ohio University.  If they're looking for a PA they'll likely either take the person who has a connection or the person who has more experience.

So the question is, do you think you'll be able to gain at least the same amount or more experience and connections on your own as you could in film school?  If the answer is yes, then maybe going your own way is the right choice.  On the other hand, if things don't work out in the world of filmmaking, having a BA in anything will be very helpful.  Once you step outside of film, you'll be applying to unrelated jobs and your highest level of education will be high school.  Not ideal, to say the least.

If you think you might want to do it on your own and money is a concern, I would consider going to a less expensive university and studying anything else alongside your film pursuits.  This is what I did.  I got a BA in philosophy because I loved it, all while working as an editor and doing a couple major internships in the film/television world.

So if the day comes where I have to change career paths, I'll at least still be a college educated job hunter.

My last piece of advise is that you please realize that jumping straight to full time Director is a very rare feat.  It's a bit like saying you're studying business to become a CEO.  Be ambitious and aim high, but understand it's going to take time and you will likely be getting dirty in the trenches for quite a while first.  Rooney Mara's first credit was an extra in some classroom scene on a tv show, not Lisbeth Salander in Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

And don't spend a bunch of money making your first film.  You may think you know what you're doing but as a college freshman I guarantee you that you do not.  You need to get to work making some rough stuff before you know enough to make something worth watching.  ","1356999274"

Check out my response to moodwrench regarding the length of your résumé.

A cover letter should be one page only.  The cover letter essentially says “Dear Hiring Manager,  I know you’re looking for ___.  I’ve done ___ successfully.  Please read more on my résumé and hey, let’s chat about it an interview.”  (My book includes a more formal template you can customize for each job.)

As for your references sheet, bland is fine.  You should only hand over references if you’re asked for them.  At that point, if the recruiter is asking for references you’ve already caught his or her eye with your résumé and cover letter.  I’ve never heard of someone not being asked to interview because their reference sheet was boring looking.

I have, however, heard of folks who have not been hired because of bad references.  Pre-qualify your references, get their consent and educate them about how to sing your praises using !@#$%, the Signs of a Great Résumé.

I mean, I've gotten her aroused and orgasmed on oral stimulation.  I've been trying to figure out how to do what you've just described above to little effect.

Honestly I'm starting to get a little disheartened,  I imagined sex to be a lot different, as in her reacting a bit more. (Kinda feels like I'm failing somewhere.)   We're pretty quiet during actual sex,  sometimes we talk during the foreplay stage.  

Also my libido is high as hell, as I would suppose any guy's would be, while her's is rather low.   She's been my only partner so I'm not basing my experience off of any past involvements.  But it still feels off.

She grew up in a very sarcastic household and I feel like that attitude has translated into a certain reservedness during sex instead of letting loose and having some fun.

She also complains about it hurting afterwords,  making her sore...etc.

Weh.  I don't know what to do.

I did try switching between 60/120hz a few times to see what difference I could notice, and 120Hz was noticeably smoother just running normally (nearing max fps). I didn't do a comparison in a forced low-fps situation.

Theoretically it should be noticeable. My monitor has a mode that lowers the input latency from 8-9ms to basically 0ms, and games feel noticeably more responsive from that. 60Hz means the monitor will refresh every 16.67ms while 120Hz means it will refresh every 8.3ms, so 120Hz should have the same impact on responsiveness as the low-latency mode has.

If you've got a 60Hz monitor you're happy with I wouldn't spend the cash on a new 120Hz, but if you're looking to upgrade anyway or are interested in 3D then it's a nice upgrade to have.","1356999284"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","No, this actually is a useful comment. If she is willing to make exceptions to some traditionally Catholic things, this is a big difference than if she is not because it indicates that there is greater room for compromise. 

What you need to do is talk this to death, maybe with a priest or maybe in relationship counseling. Maybe both. You need to find your sticking points on the following subjects: Pregnancy, raising children in/out of the church, religious education of offspring, weddings, funerals, divorce, holidays, and what happens is one of you changes your beliefs (Catholocism/atheism becoming more important in one of your lives). Unless you can agree on what happens with regards to each of these subjects, you should not continue the relationship for a great length of time. And I mean agree permanently, not temporary 'maybe I can stand it because I love you even though it's killing me inside' kind of agreement.

If your girlfriend is a Catholic who doesn't really see the need in obeying the pope, but just does the god thing (ie: Catholocism in name only), this is a different circumstance. It means you might not have to worry about stuff like men and women being treated differently in the church, your children being taught homophobia, kids having to go to religious schools which might have bad sex ed programs, etc. 

There are people who have done this, so it is accomplishable. But you need to find out now, not just assume that love is enough to make the relationship work. Talk it to death. In secular environments and religious ones. And don't assume that just because she isn't homophobic and thinks women should be priests too, or whatever, that if your kids attend church/Catholic school they won't pick this stuff up. 

Think carefully about what you can handle. ","1356999285"

"NYGiants","t5_2ruqw","I think Diehl's spot is the spot the Giants look to replace in the draft, which is why I want to cut him. The problem is, I don't know enough about college football and the prospects to comment on how likely it is that they will get someone at that position. However, we do have O-line players already that can play multiple spots, so I don't see how saving Diehl does anyone good at this point. He has done us good before, but he is washed up (way worsed then O'Hara was when the Giants cut ties with him, so that should say something on how likely it is Diehl will be gone). Though, just like Webster, if there is a way to keep him on for back-up salary, I am all for that.

True, Locklear did blow out his knee, but I don't see any reason to not believe he would be able to play, at the very least as a back-up. Plus based off previous years in similar situations (T2 I'm looking at you), the Giants are willing to risk it assuming the doctors say the recovery should be fine. My plan is under the assumption the doctors say there is no reason to believe Locklear's knee will be a problem next season.

I should be clear, I don't think Webster should be cut at all, however the Giants can not afford to keep paying him the money he has right now for the level of play he is giving in return. He is grossly overpaid for his level of performance this year, and not one point during this year did he show that he would return to his previous level of play - which gives little reason to keep paying him for a higher level of play that he is most likely not going to deliver on. Restructure the contract to put some of that money into incentives and I'll be more then happy to keep him.

The problem is the bigger picture though, at future contracts. You can't grossly overpay one player after he performs like that for a full year when you have 2 star WRs who need new contracts (either right now or in the future) and JPP. They need money to keep these guys and that means cutting the fat - which means Corey Webster either gets a reasonable pay reduction or he has to walk.","1356999289"

'Vous', maybe ""you""? ' compléter' I'll just assume is ""complete"" so maybe ""you complete me"". 

'Merci' is ""Thank you"". I think that a persons ""Raison d'etre"" is their ""reason for being"" or something like that, not sure what d'etre is by itself.
'jamais me quitter'. Jamais is ""never"" I believe, me quitter is leave, so maybe ""Never leave me""?   
I'd take a guess at that sentence being ""Thank you for being you, never leave me?"" I know it's wrong but hopefully the correct message is along the same lines. 

 'Vous êtes ma lumière', lumiére is ""light"" so I guess ""You are my light"". 'Saviez-vous que?' No Idea, I only know ""que"" in Spanish.

**You, you complete me... Thank you for being you, never leave me? You are my light... *something*-you something?**

"politics","t5_2cneq","The current crisis always makes me think of the Roman Republic during the centuries leading up to its fall. 

Basically a roman soldier had to be a landowner and pay for his own equipment. When Rome began to expand rapidly the rich patricians began buying up the new land and cheating small landowners of their land through legal holes. This meant the land owning class shrank and Rome no longer had enough men to fuel its expanding Empire.This became a major crisis that had to be solved. 

The moral here is that the Roman ariostocracy did little about it because the solution (not buying up small landowners land or even - *gasp* - distributing the land to the disenfranchised) required them to limit their own wealth. 

While the politics and the economics are totally different today the problem is basically the same: The powerful can only solve our problems by limiting their own power and they refuse to do that. 

In Rome's case this lead to proto-communist revolutionaries like the Gracchi brothers fueling dissent by promising to re-distribute the land (the senate butchered them) and later down the line the Repbulic fell and became and Empire. 

It makes me wonder how our modern problem will, ultimately, play out. ","1356999293"

Then you need to find a good shooter. Also an Assistant Director, who has experience in shoots for keeping things on schedule.

Now set a date to shoot, keep revising the script, and doing rehearsals until you have every detail planned.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","TL;DR: I was snowmobiling, hit a pressure ridge at about 75-80 MPH and wrecked.  Everything went better than expected.

To elaborate, I was on a frozen lake cruising along at about 75-80 MPH (yes I am aware this is over the limit for where I was, and likely reckless - I was young) and had a group of friends following me.

If you don't live in a cold climate, there is a phenomenon called [pressure ridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_ridge_(ice\)) that pushes up large chunks of ice.  On an overcast day, you can't see them very well.

I encountered a fairly large ridge while going on this trip, and was launched in to the air.  Contrary to what you see on snowcross races, it's not so easy to come out of something like that, especially when you aren't expecting it.  I remember thinking ""this isn't good"" before hitting the ice again on the other side of the ridge.

Newton says that ""every action has an equal and opposite reaction"", and because of that I was bucked off my snowmobile due to the rear suspension compressing to attempt absorbing the load of the hit.  I managed to tumble down the ice for a bit and began to get really worried about being seriously messed up from this incident.

Somehow, I managed to actually get up on my feet again and actually managed to ""walk it off"" running over to my snowmobile like a boss.  Unfortunately, the impact had been so great as to actually tear the metal top contacts off my spark plugs, so the snowmobile was dead and wouldn't start.  I replaced the plugs with spares I carried with me after pulling the metal part out of the wire caps with a Leatherman I always carry with me.  Fired right back up and drove away.

We made it to our destination after that, but it was the most adrenaline that I'd ever experienced in my life.  I was certain that I wouldn't be able to come out of that one without severe injury, but I was only sore for a few days.  I was lucky.","1356999299"

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","My nominations:

* Borderlands 2 for best game. Some of the best comedy writing in any game in years, but some real feels in there too. Not to mention an absolute cartoony gunzerking blast to play alone or with friends. The loot never ends! Gearbox is continually putting out great new DLC, and the community is very alive.

* Assassin's Creed 3 for worst/biggest disappointment. Assassin's Creed 2 was and still is one of my favorite games of all time, and I feel that they just took out everything that made it good. The new controls are clunky and awful. Freerunning is now completely clumsy. The story was boring, and the character acted like a petulant child. The world was uninteresting. So many complaints with this game.

* Something that more people should play: Lego Lord of the Rings. The best Lego game since the original Star Wars one. A hilarious good time, a fantastically detailed open world, all the characters you ever heard of and many more. The fully voiced option actually works out great, and all scenes are fantastically rendered. People should really check this one out!","1356999300"

"Adelaide","t5_2r1ca","I moved to Adelaide as an adult from overseas. Adelaide is really nice... *really* nice. People, especially young people, complain that it's not exciting, but I've found more than enough excitement here. I'm not sure what they're looking for that they're not finding, but for me, this city is perfect. You just have to give it a chance in good faith and make an effort to really explore the Adelaide region. 

Some of the best things here are outside the city and not conveniently accessible by public transport corridors, so I recommend trying to have a car. Even if you just buy a cheap bomb that you re-sell for scrap when you leave. If you like wine (and pretty scenery), you won't find anything nicer than our several superlative wine regions. The Adelaide Hills are lovely and green and cool and will remind you of England somewhat. Kangaroo Island is *spectacular* and extraordinary. Australian native animals are really fascinating and we have some great wildlife conservation parks like Cleland. Our beaches are very good, particular highlights being Port Noarlunga (for the caves) and the stretch between Henley and Grange (for good swimming and turquoise water).

My advice is to make friends with some of your university cohort who have grown up here. They will know how to show you a good time.","1356999301"

"aww","t5_2qh1o","I am also relatively new into DSLR's, so I can't comment that much on a macro lens sadly. For my D5100, the kit lens, which is 18-55, is enough for macro for me. If I need pictures of small things, or things up close, I just fetch one of my old SLR lens's and use them in reverse. I also have a microscope which I can use with my DSLR for super macro, but the images don't come out amazing or anything, not to mention it isn't portable.

How much of a budget do you have? Do have only a 50 mm lens, or do you have anything else?

I am not sure if you know of digitalrev, but it is a very good youtube channel for photography related stuff, and has some good information on a 35mm and 50 mm lens.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X17Tba_azxQ &lt;-- 35mm

I would suggest get yourself a nice lens for macro, assuming you have only a 50 mm lens. You already have a fixed lens which is very good for low light. I am envious with my kit lens! Though, I would reccomend a variable zoom lens, which can be called a zoom lens. You can also get an extender tube for your camera to play around with a ""fake"" macro ability by changing your 50mm lense to a 100mm with the extender tube, but I am not sure if that is how it works.

Ask around in the photography subreddit, I am sure you will get much better responses there than from me.

The police came and arrested me, took (flew AirVAC Helicopter) the guy to the hospital. I was in jail for 4 days with a large amount of money to bail me out. 
Friends gathered the money and bailed me out. That moment in the patrol car and getting processed was not a great feeling, actually it was a disgusting and awful feeling.   4 days spending time with people that had no desire for life or no advancement of personal growth really made me think. Fast forward 7 weeks, time to go to trial. I was sued by the guy starting the fight, and was sentenced to 4 years in a county jail. Now, know this about me. I am a easy going guy, finishing a college degree, always happy and participated in life. Not a mean bone in my body. The court ruled I was just at the wrong place at the wrong time self defense. The charges were dropped, but had a sit down talk with the judge.
 The judge said this. This one action could ruin your life, it's up to me and the courtroom to teach you a very valuable lesson.  Go and turn stupid actions into productive ones. Keep your whits about yourself.  Be the bigger person, lead with love.   I did get expelled from college, had to enroll in another nearby college.  Finished my degree, and ever sense I have lived love, walked out of harms way and served others for good. 

It's a costly price to pay, financially, friends, and self respect. I have not been in any situation from that point on. I am aware of my surroundings at all times. I will politely exit with money in my pocket, and waking up the next day in my home. ","1356999307"

"gue","t5_2sgcn","As I said in my previous comment, I'm not talking about making the playing field *completely* level (at least not overnight). You are interpreting fairness as implying nothing else but sudden and total equality for everyone, but I agree that, starting from a position of extreme inequality, instantly switching to complete equality would be *unfair* on the very wealthy, since they would lose *too much* for the process to be fair. The point of fairness is that it takes everyone into account, including, on this occasion, the very wealthy. It would be unfair to ignore their views. That is the whole point of fairness, and why it is good, because it should take everybody into consideration.

&gt; Is it fair to just help the people you can help the easiest? No, but it is efficient, and can let you save thousands more lives.

I disagree, I think it *is* fair just to help the people you can help the easiest, if helping everyone places an *unfair* burden on those doing the helping. Of course it is unfair to expect people in the developed world to take on responsibility for helping *every single person* everywhere in the world who needs help. What you are arguing against is not the notion of fairness, you are arguing against a very extreme and impossible scenario which nobody is suggesting.

&gt;Companies move operations over seas to avoid taxes. Our GDP lowers and we as a whole have less than we did before the redistribution, although the end state is more fair.

The end state is not necessarily ""more fair"", because the companies have behaved in what could be described as an unfair way, by monopolising profits. Fairness would dictate that they pay the taxes they can reasonably afford, rather than attempting to enrich their executives and shareholders far beyond the level required for them to live comfortably. Fairness as an ideal is not invalidated simply because some people prefer to be unfair.

Regarding your last question, perhaps there is some kind of tax which will not stifle innovation, such as a land tax or tax on luxuries or property purchases.","1356999314"

The theory was that building more modules interconnected (so the lava can flow everywhere) should make a generator, that creates lava at the same speed as it consmes lava in all the engines and GeoGens, making them run full speed (20EU/t).  In my experiments, the lava math works - 5 modules (MK1, MK2, MK5, MK5, MK5) really create enough lava to run 5 generators.

However, sadly, the lava distribution using BC pipes is uneven and therefore some GeoGens stockpile the lava and some do not have enough lava to run. Being this a lava isochoric design, that is not good (it stays uneven for a looong time). My best design currently produces only 93EU/t, not 100EU/t as expeced, still working on that. I'm convinced that in a very long time, the generator should generate 100EU/t, but it would take insane amout of time and netherrack to stabilise it -- the (MK1, MK2, MK5, MK5, MK5) design consumes a full barrel of netherrack (4096 items) in about 6 hours running, and that is apparently not enough to achieve the even lava distribution :\ (I left it run overnight)...

I agree, CS 1.6 and (in my opinion) Quake are really the only good, truly competitive fps esports, but FPS is *very* unfriendly to casual audiences (people who don't play the game, just watch it), so the only way they have gained traction is from having a very large playerbase.

I don't think CS:GO will have more fans then Halo or CoD, unfortunately, as much as I want it to be the bastion of FPS esports.","1356999324"

Probably why I won't commit to a one-man project. If I was making music with others I would be willing to have the drive and focus on the details.

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","&gt;Again, you keep conflating two ideas here. I never said anything about people's taste. It's strictly about platforms people use to be told what to listen to and what to buy. The same people who rejected radio and mtv and whatever else for being too mainstream have all now just adapted to being told what to buy by pitchfork. Same shit, different cup. This has nothing to do with the actual music you listen to.. I'm not sure how many times I have to type that or whether you're just trolling me at this point.

Unfortunately, this is probably the end of the discussion. You have to keep typing this not because I am trolling but because I wholeheartedly disagree with the notion that people are told what to buy by media like Pitchfork. Their impact is rather small in the grand scheme of music. If you compare bands that they helped popularize such as Animal Collective with people that are popular anyway like Kanye in quantifiable terms like sales of albums/concert tickets, I think it shows p4ks actual ability to make people buy music is not particularly overwhelming, especially considering whatever they love inevitably also gets love from Rolling Stone, Spin, NPR, and other popular media that people go to. 

I don't think you can fault me for thinking you are insulting people's taste in music when you call them lazy for liking music they hear on the radio. You tell me I am conflating two ideas, I just don't think they are so easily separated. Yeah, maybe their are people that think it makes you cool to like Beach House. Regardless, basically everyone that reviewed the CD liked it. That doesn't mean it's objectively one of the best records of the year (I didn't really like it), but it does show that their might be a wide appeal there. I think that the musical appeal of a record plays far more into whether or not it becomes part of some alternative mainstream than it's marketability. Beach House has virtually no image. They make a similar sounding record every time (so it's never this brand new sound to check out). Their continued popularity is more a function of people's connection to the music than the way it is sold to them. Either you completely disagree, or I just have been doing a terrible job of expressing this. Sorry if it's the latter. I just think quality of music is a much more important factor in popularity than you are giving it credit for.","1356999334"

"minimalism","t5_2r0z9","I've been deactivated for a good 6 months now, and I'll share my experiences if anyone is interested;

- Completely lost touch with some people. That is a given. I had 330 ""friends"", half being old school friends and half are people in the new city I currently live in and I would only now speak to a very small fraction of them. I know how to find them if I need them, though. So far I definitely haven't thought of contacting them for anything, just like it was when I had them on Facebook.

- You really find out who actually gives a shit about you. You might think you know, but I was surprised. I expected to be completely shunned and become a bit of an outcast or whatever for not succumbing to the bullshit that is Facebook. But it's just not true. If you've got your friends phone numbers, email addresses, you'll be fine. Text them when you feel like it. Email them when you can be bothered. Pick up the phone to organise things or just see where they are at. For this reason, communication feels a lot more genuine again. You're not saying things so you can get a ""Like"", or a few comments from people even if it's not normally someone you'd want to speak to. It's a liberating experience.

- Expect to miss out on a few events here and there, however, if you already have some true friends (I can count mine on my hands), you won't be left out of too much and they are only a phone call or a text away. It's really not a big deal and all your close friends will accept that they need to find another way to contact you.

- You'll find yourself obsessing a lot less over stupid situations and social obligations Facebook fosters. Freer life, less clutter, more meaning.

Overall, it's a liberating experience. My account is only deactivated, not deleted. I won't delete it ""just in case"", but as I said, I haven't logged in in 6 months now and I really couldn't care less.

Oh, and don't worry. People are starting to catch on and get rid of theirs too. Be bold. Stick to your guns. Soon you won't miss it.

EDIT: Didn't expect this post to receive this much attention. I'm going to reply to some of the responses here and just leave it at that:

- Yes I'm well aware there are other distractions in the 21st century other than Facebook that eat up our precious time, such as GMail, phones, TV, whatever. To the people saying ""oh how brave go delete everything and sit in a white room for the rest of your life"": no. Minimalism is about focusing on what is important to you by cutting out clutter that you don't need in your life. Facebook falls under that for me, whereas I'm quite content to use Reddit, use my phone to call and text, whatever. I'm not sure why you think I ought to get rid of absolutely everything and just sit in a white room all day. Seems a bit silly to me!

- I do find it interesting that a few people like to jump in with negative comments aimed at me personally when I was simply leaving my thoughts/experiences on the matter for those who were thinking of making the transition in the New Year.

"Spanish","t5_2qtt1","bueno - well; alright; nice

entonces - so; then

buen día - standard spanish ""buenos días"", used the same way.

che! - hey!; yo!

boludo - bro; idiot(literally)

claro - okay, of course

grosso - great; awesome(¡qué grosso!)

trucho - fake

posta - truth; real; not fake(""esto es la posta, no es trucho"")

dale - okay

chabón - bro, dude

tipo - dude. Basically used when you don't know someone's name(or like english ""dude"", but not like ""bro"").

¿cómo te va? - how are you; how goes it. Informally I use this much more often than ¿cómo estás?, and I even use it formally as ¿cómo le va?

¿cómo andás? - same as ¿cómo te va?

eso - yes; exactly; I agree

tal cual - basically the same as 'eso'

mirá vos - whoa; look at you; wow; really?!?!

¿todo bien? - informal way to say ""¿cómo estás?""

o sea - filler, means ""I mean...""

qué sé yo - filler, means ""I don't know""

viste - filler, you know

ya fue - it's done; nothing you can do about it; don't worry about it

dejate de joder - stop messing with me; stop playing around

nos vemos - see you later!

chau - bye!

&gt;Firearms give the human in a wheelchair a chance to live a life free from assault and abuse.

Where the fuck did that come from?

&gt;It gives the human a means to protect their offspring, their home, their possessions and their body.

That's nice, except for the simple fact that guns don't make people safer. People with guns are more likely to be the victims of gun violence. People with guns are present at quite a lot of these shootings (like the one in the Clackamas Mall in Oregon), but are almost never useful. The most someone could do in such a situation is create crossfire and make the police think there are even more attackers than there are.

"minecraftsuggestions","t5_2s3oo","Too similar to the Silverfish; to the point it cheapens the original mob. Silverfish added a brand new mob that could hide completely in a block with no standard way of knowing. It's original purpose was to make the Stronghold even more unique and dangerous and it achieved that goal in spades. Termites at best are just a slight alteration of the Silverfish. It's dangerously close to those unforgivably unoriginal and careless Golem suggestions that were all the rage a while back. Stone Golem, Wood Golem, Bone Golem, Dumb Golem, Dead Golem. It was ridiculous because none really took any new thoughts or concepts besides changing a few minor behaviors and obviously what substance they were made out of.

Even though Silverfish have now been extended to appear in solid rock as well, it is so ubiquitous that you really don't know when they are going to pop out and it is always a shock and surprise when they do. If you just have these termites by contrast spawn in wood planks, a material that only occurs in a few very defined per-generated structures, there is no surprise or danger.

Take your concept and radically alter it to be new without violating Minecraft conventions. Also give it a purpose, a goal, something Minecraft needs. A standard tactic is to make certain biomes more unique. Jungles, Mushroom Biomes, Swamps, and Deserts all have unique resources or mobs that give players an incentive to seek them out. Other older biomes have less incentive to visit right now because they either have redundant resources that can be found elsewhere or other minor features.

So for example, lets give Beaches a reason to be sought out or a unique feature. Lets make a clam mob that can spawn in certain sand blocks on the beach. You dig them up and they try to burrow into the next adjacent sand block if you don't smack them first. You now have the ""in-a-block"" mechanic the Silverfish poses but now it's a different animal, it exists in a specific area that really doesn't have many interesting features, and all you need from there is some practical uses and to flesh out some of the other aspects in greater detail.","1356999355"

It went better than expected, but I was determined to get him back, legally if possible. So after talking with another lawyer friend I called the California State Bar and talked to them, they opened an investigation. I also put in a claim with the Client Security Fund which is a fund most lawyers put money into for stuff like this. 

The State Bar found him guilty and suspended his license to practice law in California. I heard he had moved to Arizona or something. I asked the investigator if there were any other claims against him, she said she couldn't divulge that information but that was basically the same as ""yes"" to me.

So fast forward to December 2012 I finally get a letter from the Client Security Fund saying that their investigation is complete and that I should be getting reimbursed the full $3k in a couple months. Took them 3 years but in the end, justice was served.","1356999363"

"electronics","t5_2qhue","Using a car battery as an example: if you connect a two watt bulb (like a speedometer backlight) to the battery, it will light up merrily, but you are connecting it to the same battery that can supply hundreds of amps to the starter motor.

A device hooked up to a power supply will draw only as much as it needs. The current capacity of the supply is what it can safely handle, and not how much it will constantly pump into the rest of your circuit.

Now, the LM805 is pretty bullet proof, but it's not the most efficient. If you're looking to leave this running somewhere for months without intervention, you may need something a bit better. This also means more complicated, and may be a bit much to chew off just yet. It should work just fine to get you started while you learn more about this stuff.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","This was what I sent to my Congress people. Feel free to use it if you like it. Just note that I have some references to being a military officer, so be mindful of that if you copy/paste:

The purpose of this email is to ensure that my voice as one of your constituents is heard in regard to opposing the ""assault weapons"" ban proposal that will be going in front of the Senate next week. After reading through what Senator Feinstein has published that outlines the heart of the proposal, I am fearful that the inalienable right to bear arms in defense of one's self is being attacked under the guise of ""promoting safety"".

Effectively, Senator Feinstein has created a litmus test for what she deems permissible for law-abiding Americans to possess based on intentionally pejorative terms that she concocted to define a wide range of firearms that she finds frightening. While proposing legislation because you find it frightening is laughably inept, this ineptitude has translated into a direct assault on the Second Amendment; the nature of the bill outlaws firearms with exceptions being made for what she deems acceptable.

First off, ""assault weapons"" is a term that Senator Feinstein concocted in 1994 in order to support the legislation; this term holds no meaning in terms of a firearms class or function. She determined that a collapsible buttstock, flashhider, pistol grip, barrel shroud, and other cosmetic features are simply too dangerous for a free citizenry to possess. Given that these are cosmetic features and in no way contribute to the operation of the firearms striking the primer, igniting the powder, and firing the projectile down the barrel, what is the purpose of denying law-abiding citizens the ability to outfit their legally-purchased firearms to their preference? It is purely legislation out of fear, not fact or function.

Secondly, while these mass shootings are particularly horrific given the loss of life, they remain statistical anomalies; moreover, violent crimes committed by ""assault weapons"" are statistically negligible. In 2011, according to the FBI, ""assault weapons"" accounted for approximately 1.5% of the &gt;12,000 homicides in the US. Is this where our priorities should be focused when this purported ""problem"" has been and continues to remain statistically irrelevant? I can cite further statistics, but in the interest of trying to maintain some brevity, I've provided a link to numerous studies analyzed by the CDC that conclude that gun control in general is ineffective. Simply put, applying resources and energy to this issue that statistically is not an issue reveals the true nature of this push: it's an assault on the 2nd Amendment.

Third, and perhaps most concerning, Senator Feinstein is proposing in effect to create a national database of the exact locations of any firearm with a detachable magazine. What does this do to promote the safety and welfare of the American people? Furthermore, she wants to accomplish this by expanding the scope of the NFA of 1934. As the owner of several NFA items, this is further concerning as I have an understanding of the law and its process via experience. The BATFE cannot issue tax stamps from the time of submission at a rate of greater than 6 months; if I am in possession of the weapons that frighten her without a tax stamp due to BATFE backlog, am I a felon that will face 10 years in prison? If the sheriff refuses to sign my Form 4 even after I've surrendered my fingerprints and photograph, am I not permitted to possess what I have already legally owned? 

Clearly, this is an issue that I am passionate about, and I implore you to consider my concern when and if you cast your vote. I consider myself a responsible citizen, and law-abiding at the very least. I have and continue to serve this country as a commissioned officer in the Army; furthermore, I take the oath to defend the Constitution very seriously. I will not stand here with bravado and declare ""MOLON LABE"", but I will draw my line in the sand with this legislation. Let's protect the Second Amendment, one of the most important items in the Bill of Rights to guarantee a government by, of, and for the people.

But like some other redditors said, it can also help you keep fit (not always by choice either). Some diabetics are healthier than their non-diabetic peers... but many of them (usually the ones that don't care) are in bad shape, and the complications are horrible. I'm already starting to suffer from minor neuropathy (even with excellent control) in my extremeties... not cool at all I must say.

Whoever our killers are, they are clearly aware of the history behind vytah and Sea_Hatake. Since this past was mentioned in the Classic Mafia game, I find it likely that among our killers is not only a player in that game but also one who may know vytah and/or Sea_Hatake. As such, it may not even be a stretch to conclude that they may be one of the seasoned players who have been in many games, given that they could very well know of vytah and/or Sea_Hatake and their past that way, instead of just learning of it through what was said in Classic Mafia.

20_percent_cooler is probably playing Classic Mafia using a novelty. And I know that rcxdude is (or was) playing in that game as well. And they've both been in several games of mafia around here.

4.  Stop encouraging companies to go overseas--make them pay an import tariff on the goods they would manufacture overseas and import to this country = to what they would be saving anyway.  No incentive to leave the country then.

5.  Decrease defense spending to what we would need to protect our country, attack one aggressor, and pay for R&amp;D.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I genuinely see the so-called ""PC answer"" as the most sensible. My frame of mind is this: 

~

In my opinion the point of any physical fight is to defend yourself. This essentially means I see absolutely no reason to actually start a physical fight, but if you meet someone who is dumb enough to start one for any reason other than reasonable defense, then your mission is to end it as quickly as possible with as little injury as possible. This also means I think the idea of a ""fair fight"" is ridiculous outside of sports. In the real world, if someone attacks you for reasons other than self defense, why the hell should they deserve a ""fair fight"", since they came at you with the intention of causing you harm for no good reason, you damn well make them back off before their stupidity causes both of you to end up with purposeless injuries.

~

This results in me placing the most value on ending a fight as quickly as possible/before it even starts. The only reason it should have escalated to a physical confrontation was if the drunk wouldn't back off or let him walk away without getting physical. Then his aim is to defend himself. I wouldn't put anyone's health at risk by starting an avoidable fist to defend his ego, I don't expect him to do that for me. The way I see it, that kind of ego-fighting doesn't in anyway translate to a sign of a successful, reliable, sensible person. A ""good mate"" in my opinion would be someone intelligent enough to distinguish the difference between standing up for one's self and one's loved ones, and caving in to pointless social graces (if acting macho to impress your date in public could be seen as a ""social grace""). The only thing winning a fist fight proves is who is physically stronger/more skilled at fighting, a trait that women looking for athletic guys might find attractive, but a trait that is not essential or impressive in my opinion, and pointless outside of sports or self defense. People don't go around beating up scientists or musicians to gain their position in life, so physical strength beyond basic fitness or the ability to defend oneself is nonessential.

~

Perhaps as a woman I have the privilege of being able to view trying to impress a potential mate with physical strength as pointless, but that's also kind of the point. To give in and needlessly endanger yourself by fighting the idiot *is* submissive because you're being a follower of a social expectation that does not result in anything of value. I find guys who try to live up to those social standards for the sake of seeming more ""like a guy"" to be annoying. I know you're male, you have a penis and a Y chromosome, thinking you need to go above and beyond to prove that just makes you seem insecure. In fact, this applies to just about everybody, from my perspective. Live up to meaningful social standards because they're right, not because you think it'll make you look good. 

~

If you're living up to an expectation because it's right, you won't make the mistake of confusing going above and beyond to defend your lover, with endangering yourself because some drunken idiot doesn't understand why it's stupid and pointless to start a fight in this situation. Is it seen as more ""manly"" or impressive to fight the person in this situation? Then the idea of ""acting manly"" doesn't indicate a desirable mate because ""manly"" supposes an archetype that doesn't justify itself. Why should someone who is dumb enough to drink themselves into a stupor then call someone's girlfriend ugly, offend you? Why is it worth going out of your way to cause yourself injury to defend your partner, if their safety is not in danger in the first place?

~

There are indeed plenty women who would prefer a guy who starts fights for her (starting a fight because an idiot attempted to insult you or your partner's pride =/= defending your partner), but the women who don't, view the ones who do as just as ridiculous as the guys who think they're obligated to get into those sorts of fights. My opinion may not be typical, as my taste in men and women may not be typical, for example I think a guy who could wear a dress and laugh at the idea that it makes him less of a dignified male is more attractive than the one who would fear that doing so would forever call into question his value as a human being. But I think it can safely be said that most women worth a damn view anything similar to the situation you described as dumb and pointless, because it just no longer translates to ""successful mate"", unless she's looking for someone narrow-minded and unstable. 

~

It's not submissiveness, it's level-headedness; the drunken idiot is certainly not the alpha male in this situation, and the guy who realizes that, certainly is. Someone's who is able to maintain his senses in such situations and realize that there's no value in instigating or dragging on such fights, is much more attractive. It signals that he's not likely to put himself or his lover at unnecessary risks to achieve goals that add nothing of value to anyone's life.

~

[Edit] Readability, and holy crap, that's a lot of text. 

TLDR: A lot of women view it as pointless and a sign of insecurity, since fighting in that situation proves nothing other than that you cave into social pressures that add nothing of value to life.","1356999399"

""Yes, you're human. At the same time, you go by the moniker ""thefeministcookbook"". My guess would be that this a play on the Anarchist Cook Book and your unabashed support of Feminism. While Feminism is becoming mainstream with more tolerant views, you chose to blend it with a radical element because I believe you are a radical feminist. I truly understand that you don't like being talked condescendingly too, at the same time...

You also post in SRS, a haven for all of those who didn't fit into the PC'ness of yesteryear and instead demand equality for every obscure adage in life, regardless of actual merit. It's an interesting place but make no mistake, your progressive ideals drown out any sense of tradition and cultural heritage that some people rightfully hold dear. SRS's inability to recognize such little things makes you ignorant in my eyes. Talking in condescending tones towards others is probably what makes you tick. You think to yourself, ""No one has had it as hard as me, and I've formed my own thoughts and opinions so I'm entitled to them."" If I want to call someone a killjoy (a condescending term) then I can as long I am pure in my belief structure.""

You have no belief structure. You're a modern marvel in that you hold on only to your gender's power or mistaken inequalities in order to define your personal identity. It's sad... but I suppose when uneducated, untalented and non-philosophical people join together to form sub's like SRS, it's only a natural phenomenon that you would eventually start to speak out. I pity your plight. I'm sure it's a difficult existence. I'm not being condescending when I say that.""

Kids here can balk all they want but a 13 year old is not yet an adult.  Teenage brains, especially early teens, have not yet fully developed, do not easily process consequences (especially long term) of actions.

I'm not putting them down, just being realistic about developmental capabilities.   I think teenagers are great but they are not yet adults.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sort of. Not the way you would expect.

I ~~used to~~ work in a shitty area. At my old job, fights and muggings weren't terribly uncommon.

Not long after I began working there, a good friend of mine got into Jeet Kune Do, and needed a sparring partner. I've been boxing and wrestling for years, but until then I had never really gotten more into things than that. I really enjoyed it though, and learned a lot. Later I explored Muy Thai, BJJ, and some of the less crazy Krav Maga. 

I also used to smoke. 

One day I was out on the patio smoking a cigarette and a group of teenage thugs come around a corner and surround me in a semi-circle. I sit in corners with my back to a wall out of habit, so I was well closed-in, and I'd had my iPod in so I didn't hear what the ""leader"" said initially. 

Turned off the iPod and asked him ""What?"" and he said, ""Give me all your money,"" while his little posse looked around excited and nervous.

Adrenaline took over and I basically said, ""I don't have anything worth taking other than these cigarettes, and if you want one I'll give you one, but if you want anything else you're going to have to take it from me.""

We stood in silence staring at one another for a good thirty seconds before finally saying, ""Can I have a cigarette?""

I gave him one and he took it, then tried to offer me a drink from a huge jug of rum that they had shoplifted, but dropped it in the process, which attracted the attention of the security guards, so they all took off running. 

The other time it happened was a few months later, and I was walking across the parking lot to a little gas station to buy a new pack.

I knew I was about to be fucked because people pretty much only ever speed through the parking lot, and as I'm walking near the end closest to the street, there's a big lowered Escalade with huge rims going the exact same speed I'm walking at the other end of the parking lot, matching my speed exactly. Probably 200 feet away. 

Then abruptly the car speeds up and turns down the aisle in front of me. Pulls in front of me and stops. Four large black dudes are inside, which stood out because the area here is largely Mexican, and the Mexican gangs keep most of the turf around here on lockdown. They aren't especially fond of black groups. 

The front passenger rolls down his window and tells me to give him some money. I told him I didn't have any, and he says something to the driver before leaning out the window again and saying that he knows I have at least 20 bucks and I better give it to him.

I decide, fuck it, I'm not going to win this fight so I may as well go for whatever. 

I take out my wallet, which had no money in it, and open it up so the car can see. I say, ""Well, let's see, I have some old business cards, some scraps of paper, oh shit, look, I have some receipts for pizza, you want some of my pizza receipts? That's probably the most valuable thing I have in here. I'd give you my driver's license, but it doesn't really look like you."" (I'm white)

The driver and the guys in the back seat start laughing their asses off and the passenger starts blushing and looks pissed. He yells, half at me, and half at his friends, ""Man, fuck this shit, lets get out of here.""

If I hadn't been training in fighting for a few years before that, I would have been scared shitless and I probably would have ended up getting pretty badly hurt. I didn't fight, but I definitely learned how to keep my head on my shoulders and that saved my ass in both cases. 

tl;dr: Martial Arts taught me how to keep my head in the face of danger, and it saved me through two attempted muggings/robberies.","1356999408"

One time I was walking to lunch by myself, and I wasn't in a very good mood, so when this one  kid who had been picking on me saunters down the hall like one of the biggest pricks(not like gay, think douche but worse)ever I stick out my foot and trip him. Guy gets mad, punches me a couple times in the stomach, I grab his arms and hold him to the wall until he calms down. He doesn't, so  I use a couple holds to make him realize he was basically fighting a brick wall. He calms down, we shake hands, and him and his friends never picked on me again.","1356999409"

Because it's a game that is so heavily predicated on forced interaction (many of the schemes you want to play require the support of one or more of your opponents) that is a HUGE variable which can't be understated.

Our games usually go between 2 and 3 hours depending on the experience of the table. If you have an experienced group it plays decently quickly. 

I haven't played Cosmic Encounters or Rex

Pretty soon there will be an expansion which bumps it to 5-6 players and adds 2 v 2 gladiator duels...

You had me at 2 v 2 duels...lol

If you like games where negotiation/diplomacy/treachery is an absolute must, this is the game for you.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm an asian playing in SGMY &amp; Tw server when it was established.been keen with the Asian LoL competitive scene all the while.I do not have solid prove but it's based on my common sense &amp; logic.

1. Disagreements would surely happen among all team including TPA members after Season 2 world championships,which is maybe after their great lost in IPL5? Which also lead to their withdrawal from playing in IEM : Cologne, not wanting to swallow another defeat from Fnatic there. The health issue or jetlag was just a cover up for not going. from the way i see them play at IPL5,it was not at their best not even average play during their live streams. Toyz at mid kept getting gank,Lillballz unable to make plays for his lanes,btm lane bebe &amp; mistake struggling so hard.

2. When disagreements happen,team captain will mostly take the blame not being able to lead the team well &amp; it will always be 4 vs 1.Mistake would probably be fed up or felt mistreated or etc so he might as well take this opportunity to join TPS,i mean no harm trying out with new members when your bored with old ones.

3.Mistake,Colalin &amp; GodJJ has been helping Garena TW in their other game ""MStar"" a music based korean game in marketing purpose. So there is a possibility that Garena was the one making decisions.As fame &amp; popularity gain from Mistake,Colalin &amp; GodJJ,it should not be hard for TPS to gain all that as well altho they are a new team,in other sense to cut cost on marketing as well as helping out Garena to promote their other games in the future for the long run.Imagine a how much cost can they save on marketing and boosting new games efficiently

4. Info about new members :

dinter or Derek丁特 is the cameraman for GPL at the same time he had his own team playing competitively in Tw,team ranking was top 10 in the premade 5 ladder. He main's AD carry,mainly Graves &amp; Corki. Usually tries hard to carry his whole team to victory.

喔是喔真的假的 no info about his english nickname yet. Currently no.1 ranking in Solo/Duo Que Ladder in Tw LoL Server.He main's jungle.

ZONDA to me he's not really an outstanding player compared to other TPA members. Platinium elo player in season 2. He streams a lot &amp; gets defeated most of the time from what i see.Got recruited into TPA mainly because of his fame &amp; popularity from live streaming.

GODJJ gain fame &amp; reputation during his days in playing WoW in TW during his schooling days. He's been playing a lot of different computer games that time. No.1 streamer in Tw as in the stream that has most viewers viewed daily. Reason to his success,he's is like a Mr.Bean that can cheer or make audience laugh just by the way he speaks. He speaks with a heavy tone like an old person but in a joyful funny manner.Got recruited into TPA and yes he main's AD Carry. His skills was by far 1 of the best in the Tw &amp; Asian scene.","1356999436"

Their daughter was my best friend and I saw her go to Summer camps that were geared towards ""bible teachings."" and one year I remember them completely refusing to read papers, books, television, phone, internet and they wouldn't go out very much because the ""Family"" was doing a study on how we(people) could survive without the influence of papers, books, etc, because they believed deeply that those things we're used to every day wouldn't be around much longer. I was a bit taken aback at this point because, I mean seriously, books? How are books suddenly going t be removed from your life if you're still living a free life. They pretty much didn't accept that their youngest daughter was also gravitating away from the religion, their youngest son and second youngest daughter had already moved away from the religion. They kept sending her away, sending her to the master house where she could be around *""Good christian values and children, and see how our missionary lifestyle is so important.""* she would stay there for 6 months at a time sometimes and who lets their children live at someone's house for 6 months when they are completely ""stable"" at home, I.E: No personal problems, family stable, no money problems. They sent her there to influence her to stay in the family, it was pretty bad and I hated it because she was my best friend and I didn't want to see her go through that kind of programming, yes at that age I already considered these little things programming. All the children in this group, by the way, are raised homeschooled and are only allowed to interact with ""Non-worldly"" (the term I heard used a lot) children, they weren't allowed video games or many games at all. Their life consisted of bible, bible, witnessing, bible. Witnessing was described to me as going out and trying to convert people to Christianity. 

We would go over to their house for movie nights sometimes and they would have these conspiracy theory videos, such as things about the Illuminati taking over the world and being the ""anti-christ"". I was so very uncomfortable with these videos being played but I figured any protest on my part would cost me my best friend. I'd listen to conversations about these conspiracy theories, I later found out that the ""Family"" has some cult-like things about them, and have heard of things that the ""family"" has done but for the most part they really were good people, they just believe much too strongly in their way of life and the odd things they do. 

Christians are extremely generous most of the time, they try their best to give to others when they can give. They try to bring a peace to the lives of everyone they encounter by giving them faith and something to hope and live for by showing them their faith. They fall into their beliefs and take them to an extreme and sometimes try to take others with them because they feel that it's right. 

So in some cases yes, Christian children are very brainwashed and it doesn't just mean sheltered from the outside. ","1356999446"

There are simply too many people thinking that they know what they are talking about, but alas, can anyone really have more knowledge than die hard Barca fans that have grown up watching the club? These fans are not saying that Guardiola is great without reason. Trust their words, they know more about the club than most.

For god's sakes, if the fans cannot convince you, listen to the Barca players.

Forgive me if my tone is too strong. I'm frustrated by this topic.

We used this salt to salt the entire football field, using a basic push/pull seed spreader.  There was a decent half inch thick layer of salt over the entire field, it almost looked like snow.

The salt killed all the grass in the field and dried the dirt up, and no grass can grow back. Luckily its a public school, so they can't afford to put turf down or replace the dirt. So after almost a full 2 years, the field is a barren wastland. Class of 2011 will not be forgotten!","1356999457"

There's no socket, or form factor, or uniformity. Each board is designed specifically for the chip. You can get custom coolers, though. Some water block ones run for like $200.

TL;DR: For GPUs to be built like a mini CPU, you'd have to create multiple international standards that are completely impractical and would make the GPU so large that it would make no sense to put it in a PCI-E slot, creating more complications.","1356999461"

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","The point of your post seems to be telling people that ""slipping up"" and having a drink isn't a big deal. It is a big deal.  I'm glad you were able to stop drinking after one, but that ain't usually how it goes.  For many people, one drink would lead to weeks or months of continual drinking. It happens here time &amp; time again.  

""Slip ups"" aren't ""oopsie I dropped my keys"" type mistakes.  There's a whole thought process here.  A chain of events. You thought about drinking, you procured alcohol, you poured it into a glass, you willfully raised that glass to your lips, and you willingly drank from it. Every one of those steps should have set of alarm bells in your head. Doesn't it bother you that it got that far?

How would you feel if someone read your post and decided that, since you were able to do it, it wouldn't be a big deal if they ""slipped up"" tonight and had a glass of champagne at midnight? Just one glass, right, and wake up not hungover. No big deal?

As a bench-work biologist, I encourage every undergrad I train to take as diverse a set of courses as possible. Being a ""generalist"" is not a weakness as long as you have a focused question that you can bang out papers with.

That will provide a basis of experience from which you can determine your preferences---wider or narrower blade, type of grind (from wedge to full-hollow), and so forth.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have always wondered this, so my apologies for asking while discussing a different topic. I've never really been that big into shooters, but the camping thing has always confused me. 

Can you (or anyone else) explain why it is widely viewed as bad? In actual warfare, isn't a sniper supposed to pick a spot where he can't be seen, and basically pick off enemy soldiers until he is spotted? In guerilla warfare, isn't it acceptable for a guy with a gun to hide behind a doorway and shoot anyone who walks in? He's supposed to be at the advantage over a guy who is walking into a room to clear it out, is he not?

I know it's annoying to be constantly killed by the same guy sitting in the same spot for the entire game, but doesn't that just mean he found a really good spot?

By the way, my question doesn't apply to spawn point/corpse camping. That is taking advantage of a game mechanic, and understand why that's generally frowned upon. I'm referring to the campers who find a legit, advantageous spot on the map, and pick off people without moving. I'd just like someone to shed light on why that's a bad thing to do.","1356999470"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Look at the stats of the two Seattle games for the QUARTERBACKS, not the entire team, and tell me Kaep played a much worse game with a straight face.  Their stats are virtually identical.  Using their Seattle games as an argument is a joke.

Then people will take Kaep's worst game (against the Rams or Seattle, tough call) and use that as an argument, but Smith's worst game (vs the Giants) was far worse; in fact, I'd argue Smith cost the 49ers that game whereas Kaep's worst game (vs StL or Seattle) wasn't really his fault.

Kaepernick is much more of a big play threat.  I haven't seen the more recent stats but I saw something where in his first 2 games, Kaep had 11 20+ yard plays where Smith had 22 20+ yard plays in 9 games.  Kaep adds a deep threat where Smith never did.","1356999471"

In fact I believe that state level interventions are ""less bad"" than national for many reasons, here I might be focused most on cost and the ability to experiment with different structures. So I have to come to the conclusion that any national level intervention in this case would be ""more bad"".  ","1356999472"

Of course, being an android box, I'm sure someone will figure out how to get the Play Store on there in less than 10 minutes, and there are also projects such as Ubuntu for Ouya in the works. With Steam for Linux now available, you could theoretically run some of the less hardware-intense Linux games on Ubuntu with Ouya.

See, the Elcor are a monotonous race of creatures incapable of expressing emotion to other organics. They state the conveyed emotional tone of what they're saying to convey it to others. This is what made the *Elcor Hamlet* bit in ME2 a clever joke.

HK-47, on the other hand, is a sociopathic-by-design robot killer. What he does is more like classify his statements before he says them, and it really can only be attributed to a protocol directive he's programmed to follow. It makes the fact that the expressive statements he follows these classifications with are about rejoicing at the opportunities he has to indulge in the systematic extermination of assigned targets in the most demonstrably skillful or gruesome way possible all the more hilariously bizzare.","1356999474"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think it has everything to do with the individual (as in the man); if your girlfriend/female companion doubts your ability to handle yourself in a physical altercation, then walking away makes you look like a pussy- however if she knows what you are capable of and you decide to walk away, she will respect your maturity. I am somewhat of an aggressive ""type""- most certainly have a temper; boxed as a kid- Wrestled in HS- played Rugby in college- so i feel confident in confrontation. 

My girlfriend of two years and I were at a bar with two friends of mine, when some random guy, fairly built comes up to me and says, ""Your gf is gorgeous id love to fuck her""--well....I lost it, sucker punched him. Best sex of my life that night. 

Another occasion, we were walking around a shopping center when these younger guys maybe 17? maybe 18 or 19? Come up to me and ask why I was giving them ""dirty looks""- mind you, I had no idea who they were or where they came from. I told them to relax and go back home before they got hurt- they hurled insults, I walked away. My girlfriend later on told me how proud of me she was and I got a blowjob. 

Moral of the story- a woman should know that her man, can handle himself. If she doesnt, then a man (in the necessary situation) should prove it. ","1356999489"

That's art. Spraying your first name in weird semi-cursive characters in neon blue spray paint isn't art, and the only sense of ""community"" you get from it is when people do ""community service"" to clean it up.

I also only think it's anti-capitalist when it's done on capitalist backgrounds, like billboards. As soon as the capitalists are gone, this graffiti will just be old-world gobbledygook that used to mean something, however little it may have been.

"keto","t5_2rske","Sure. So I think next time we might try a bacon weave, or a more seasoned meat crust, but for our first time it was really simple.

1. So the crust was actually a 1/2 and 1/2 mix of ground beef and ground sirloin. I'd recommend mixing in some chopped garlic and onions, maybe some seasonings.
2. Spread a layer of it over the pie pans. (ours was probably about 1cm thick)
3. Pop it in the oven at 350 degrees for around 15 minutes, but really just keep an eye on it until it's fully cooked, because the time will vary with the thickness of your crust. 
4. Once it's done (brown all the way through), pull it out. 
5. There's gonna be a fair amount of juices that you'll want to pour out to use with something else, otherwise your meatza will be all soupy.
6. There you go, you have a delicious meatza crust! Just add your toppings and put it back in the oven till the cheese is melted","1356999491"

"excel","t5_2qur2","I'm not familiar with the code to edit the text on hyperlinks, but I think I can help with some other aspects of the code. I could probably do a few minutes of research and help you with they hyperlinks, too, but I don't have time right now. If nobody else helps later I can see what I can do.

First of all, coding best practices: delete all those weird tabs and make your tabs hierarchical so you can see what lines of code pertain to which loops, and so forth.

Next, learn to debug and add watches. This is easy and will save you TONS of time. A quick youtube video search pulls up [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19JTjCtFPeI) - I haven't viewed the whole thing, but that should help. It lets you take single steps through the code and see what is working and what's not, and where variables are going.

Now, onto the code, itself. I'm not sure exactly what isn't working about the code, but a few things stand out at me as odd that I would probably have done differently, so it could be that those are the source of the problem.

The first macro appears to work correctly, though you don't need to do the ""activate"" command.

The second macro works insofar as it converts display text into URLs, apparently, but perhaps change it to the following:

    ActiveSheet.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=xCell, Address:=xCell.Formula, _
         TextToDisplay:=""View Listing""

That should kill two birds with one stone.

I'll be back in a bit to give you some advice on how to choose ranges without using ""selection"" unless someone gets there first. That should also help if you need to do the ""View Listing"" text in a separate macro for some reason.","1356999496"

I suffer from insomnia and for that exact reason and just lately I found out the real cause of this. You should look up anxiety and the specifics of what is happening in your body.

"Astronomy","t5_2qhor","I'm 17 and I'm just getting into astronomy too. I know this isn't what you want to hear, but astrophotography isn't something your going to be able to do for a while. Even when you start astrophotography sometime down the road, don't expect anything near Hubble quality images, unless you've got millions of dollars and a team of scientists lying around. Amateur astrophotographers are typically happy with a fuzzy image of Saturn. 

If you really want to take photos, the best you can do is take some long exposer shots of the sky with a DSLR camera. 

Astrophotography will be very expensive because you will need a tracking system with the binoculars, which will probably set you back at least $1500. Even then, you need to be very good and very experienced to get any photographs. Also, if you live near a city, your job may be impossible because of light pollution (there's a reason the best telescopes are on top of mountains or in space).  It's just not realistic for someone who has just started. 


You said you wanted to take your first step. Start small. I got a pair of binoculars from Amazon, and I'm very happy with them as a starter tool. Look up the Celestron Skymaster 15x70 Binoculars. They're about $50 and do a very good job for the price. Yesterday. I looked at Jupiter and saw an orange tint and a couple Galilean moons too. Some double stars were visible too and I live near a suburb that has a good deal of light pollution.  You can go for the 20x80 binoculars as well if you're willing to pay more, but you will have a very hard time holding them, and I personally don't think it's worth it. 

I wanted to do astrophotography, but after a lot of research, I realized that I needed to start small, and binoculars were the best choice. I would strongly suggest that you don't get a telescope now, even a cheap one. Get some binoculars to start out, they will show you things in the sky you could never image were there. You may think that a slightly orange Jupiter with 4 tiny moons around it may not be impressive, but it will wow you. I have been able to look at the Orion Nebula and Andromeda, but not much more because I didn't have time, but I plan on mapping the visible Messier objects soon. Also, you'll spend hours looking at the moon. It's really breathtaking, even through binoculars. 

When you're ready for a telescope, you'll know it, and then you'll be able to dive into it and spend some good money on a good scope. After your first scope and some photography experience, you can expect to start out photographing the heavens above. 

Also, if you have an iPhone, get the GoSkyWatch app. It's $4, but it's really worth it. You can point it up at the sky and it will identify any object, and it can easily guide you to anything you're looking for. I've ready spent hours just learning what I'm looking at and searching objects I want to see. 

Good luck, and feel free to PM me with any question, because I'm just starting out like you.

&gt;I contacted Garret, who was still seated in the drivers' seat of the vehicle and was the sole occupant. Garret was asked how many beverages he had consumed and he replied that he had consumed ""about five (5) beers"". Garret had bloodshot eyes with a strong odour of unknown alcoholic beverage on his breath. Garret was asked to perform voluntary roadside maneuvers.

The voluntary roadside maneuvers were explained and demonstrated to Garret, prior to beginning the roadside maneuvers, showing a lack of balance and coordination as well as the inability to follow a standard procedure, the walk and turn. Garret took twenty-one (21) steps and had to be told to stop walking. Garret stumbled as he ... another twenty-one (21) steps before I once again told him to stop walking.

However, stopping the use of oil immediately would result in huge numbers of deaths. It would also be likely to start wars and create many other problems. It makes more sense to plan a way free of dependence on oil by developing replacements for it's use.

The end goal of no dependence on oil is noble, but an off switch approach would likely cause more harm than good. so in that sense, it may be similar to the slavery question above.

Think about it this way, if call order &gt; pick order, they would have no reason to single out the last pick to tell him to fill in what hasn't been already filled. So why did they single him out? Because there is some precedence with pick order. I did see what Pendragon wrote regarding the Summoners code but I do think at the time of writing the SC, the mentality was pick order &gt; call. Pick order &gt;call order is the most fair way of picking. Lets say my computer loads faster than yours or everyone's for that matter, I am going to be able to get my role every time. Is that fair? Lets say your computer loads you the slowest in to champion select, you will most likely not play the role you want. Imagine the people who would have to deal with this every single time, I bet if you were in their shoes you would be pissed. But of course, you probably don't have this problem and have never even considered the people who play on potatoes.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","About 10 years ago, I had my wisdom teeth removed.

They tell you not to smoke cigarettes or eat certain things for a while after the procedure is performed, due to the danger of ripping the stiches and/or causing dry sockets.

Being a 16 year old know-it-all, I started smoking cigarettes again the very next day.Dry sockets *pshhh*, I'm tryin' to get me some of that sweet sweet nicotene.

Anyway, since I can only eat certain foods, I'm eating soft-scrambled eggs and yogurt and other mushy shit that requires very little effort to chew. I tried to eat a piece of steak one night and half-choked on it because it hurt so much to chew. Thanks, mom and dad, for cooking a steak dinner, forcing your son to enviously watch the family eat steak while he sits there like a dog in front of a bowl of Gravy Train.

Back to the story. So 3 of my 4 wisdom teeth sockets went dry socket. It took more than twice as long as it should have to heal. I have to start digging food particles out of the dry sockets with those little toothpicks with the fuzzy whisker-things on the ends of them. 

My breath smells terrible all the damn time, Listerine works for about an hour and my mouth smells and tastes like a dumpster again. 16 year old me says ""Fuck this, I am deep-cleaning these things.""

So there I am, stupidly staring down the bridge of my nose into a mirror with a flashlight in one hand and a fuzzy toothpick in the other. As I'm digging I catch a chunk of something in my lower left socket. My gums were bleeding a little because I had been digging so hard.

So I pull this chunk o' shit out of my dry socket, but it falls off the toothpick as it leaves the dry socket. I instinctively close my mouth to avoid swallowing it, which had the unfortunate side-effect of smashing the gob of shit between my hard palate and my tongue.

I don't know what it was; some unholy combination of dead tissue, blood, scrambled eggs, saliva, yogurt, cottage cheese, cigarette smoke, maybe a little bread or meat in there. All I know is that I have never gagged or thrown up so much in my entire life.

TL;DR So, yeah, worst taste ever.","1356999531"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I see more rage quitting at Magic the Gathering than any other game.  I don't know why that is, but MtG must attract unstable people.  I still play it every Friday night but two weeks ago I saw the funniest rage quit ever.

I was playing this kid in the final round of FNM for the #1 position since we were both undefeated all night.  He was talking shit as we were shuffling cards and getting ready to cut each other's decks, but I just laughed and went along with it because that's not very uncommon anyway at FNM.  He steamrolls me the first game which gets his confidence rolling real high and he keeps going with the shit talking and trying to ""give me tips"" on how to build my deck, etc.  So after the sideboard in the second game I knew about mid-way through that I'd have the game locked up as long as I played smart, which I did and finally dropped a bomb and he lost his shit.  He threw his dice and started talking about how some of my cards should be banned, etc.  At this point most of the other folks who were finished with their match wandered over to see what the fuss was about.

So we start the third match, and I knew after the first couple of hands that I would again have it locked down as long as I played smart.  I can tell he is starting to get a little unstable when he realizes the direction that things are going, so I try to calm him down by complimenting his deck and his playing.  I didn't realize it at the time but some observers said that I actually sounded like a prick because it sounded sort of patronizing, even though that was not at all my intention.  I finally re-animate the same bomb as the second game and he flips the fuck out hard.  Started screaming and his hands were shaking.  I thought he was on the border of breaking down in tears.  To make things worse, a couple other people started laughing when he lost it. 

Part of me felt really bad for him, the other part just wanted him to go the hell away.  Very strange.","1356999531"

"self","t5_2qh96","This is one of those scenarios where it could go either way.

Best bet - ship it back to the seller, and document it with Paypal and keep the shipment receipts/tracking number etc.

Scenario 1 - The guy is legit, and he is overloaded for the holiday season and it was just a flat out mistake - we all make them. He contacted you immediately to let you know about the mistake and asked you to send it to the correct owner and he sends you the ring you were supposed to receive since it would save time in shipping since it came from Sri Lanka (which is common since a lot of gems/jewelry are manufactured/fitted there due to it being cheaper to produce) and both of you shipping them back would cause delays on both orders.

Scenario 2 - As someone else mentioned it's a scam. You sign for the item marking it as received in regards to a legal sense, and mail the ring you receive to the guys partner who then keeps some of the money, and ships the ring back to the scammer who then repeats the process.

So you have a 50% chance of helping out someone with an innocent mistake, and 50% chance of being screwed out of a few thousand bucks.

If he has already contacted you saying it's the wrong ring, refuse delivery of the package and contact the seller telling him you can't accept the package due to playing it safe, and update your Paypal ticket and wait to hear back from the seller. Also, don't wait too long as there is a window of time when refunds via Paypal are quick and efficient. Past that it turns into a debate-fest.

"bostonceltics","t5_2qmkf","I have been chiming this same melody for some time. If he is the team leader and the future, then he has to pick up his game. First, he is turning the ball over too much, especially frustrating when he makes foolish passes and alley oops that are not there. Second, he is passing up wide open shots for worse shots for his teammates. He has gotten better at improving this aspect, but it is still there regardless. Also, this whole walking up the court, dribbling the ball down to 10 seconds on the clock, and then setting up an ISO is bad offense. There is a huge difference in the flow of the game when either Pierce is playing point or someone like Barbosa is in. Even Rondo affirmed the offense was flowing better with him out with injury. He just needs to be agressive and start averaging 15 PPG a night. That is not a hard achievement for him. Next, his defense is dreadful. He can't stay in front of his man when he is one of the fastest man in the league. This causes KG or someone else to step up to get his man, which leads to an open man and a basket. Rubbish! He is preaching defense, but he is one of the blatant culprits that causes the defense to breakdown. Why do we have to wait until the playoffs to see breakout performances from him? Look at someone like Kobe (gulp, I know) who at this age is pulling a Benjamin Button performance. If you are the leader of the team, then you need to step up, significantly. The Celtics need it seriously, and right now I only see that solid consistency from KG night in and night out. This is why, people can call him a punk, etc...but all of them at the end of the day will never question his work ethic, love for the game, and effort that he brings every game.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","What I wrote, Gonzales v. Raich. Scalia's logic is far too tortured to read. It's even worse when you read his logic in light of his majority decision in US v. Lopez. 

Basically, in Raich, he said that growing your own pot on your own land for your own consumption affects interstate commerce enough for the federal government to be able to ban it. Apparently, had you not grown it, you would have had to buy it on the interstate market, and that affects interstate commerce. Huh? But in Lopez he agreed that buying a gun, even one made in another state, and carrying it near a school has no effect on interstate commerce so the federal government could not ban it.

So whenever Scalia talks about ""states' rights"" you know he's lying his ass off. He only cares about results he likes, not constitutional principle.

OTOH, in the Lopez decision, you can pretty much thank the FDR government for screwing us there. That case was Wickard v. Fulburn, and said that you can't grow your own grain for your own livestock if the federal government says you can't because that grown grain otherwise would have been purchased on the market. So next time you think it might be okay to violate a constitutional principle or right because you like the specific results right now, it will eventually backfire on you and violate your rights in a way you don't like. I'll bet you a huge percentage of pro-pot people also don't mind other federal intrusions into our lives.","1356999536"

"RWF","t5_2uz8j","A new video has been uploaded on Christopher Steele's official YouTube channel.

You press play.

*As the video begins you see Christopher sitting in a lounge chair with a big wall of windows behind him looking over New York city.*

*The camera seems to be a bit shaky, the person filming is obviously trying to place it down correctly, yet he's desperately failing at doing so.* 

CS: Goddammit Larry, I know setting up camera's isn't part of your actual job but come on man, it isn't hard. *Ugh*, move out of the way you idiot.

*Christopher gets out of his chair and walks towards the camera. His lower body now takes up the entire screen as he's trying to place it down correctly himself. A few irritated mumbles are heard until the camera is finally still.*

CS: There we go, was that so hard? If you weren't married to my sister I would've fired you ages ago. I hope you understand that. 

L: What an aggressive attitude, sir. I guess it's in the family... Anyways, I'm off to buy myself some soda. Should I bring you something?

CS: What's that you said about my family?

L: Guess not. Be right back sir.

*Larry walks diagonally across the room in front of the camera, and leaves through the door in the corner of the room.*

CS: Frickin' bell-end. He better cut this part out. (He didn't.)

*Christopher sighs, sits up straight and tries to get a somewhat sarcastic look on his face despite his boiling anger towards his incredibly rude assistant.*

CS: For the love of god, Mercer. I've faced enough goody-two-shoes babyfaces in my career to have heard every type of inspirational, wise and life-brightening promos, but yours was probably the very worst I've heard so far. Mainly because I didn't expect it from you at all. Out of all the flawlessly anti-judgmental clowns we have running around here (I'm looking at you, Hardcore) *you* are the one to talk about equality and respect? You're the 'Brooklyn Beast' right? Right. When I hear that name I don't think of someone who claims to be an underdog. I don't think of someone that wouldn't take their opponents down a notch in a promo. I think of someone who would be unstoppable in their quest to beat the ever loving shit out of everything that comes in his path. To be fair, it sure looked like you were going in that direction a few weeks back... but then you lost. And you lost again. And then again. And yet again. And you lost your fire. You know what that means? ""Losing the fire within you?"" Let's clarify it with a metaphor, shall we? When-

*Christopher gets cut off by the door in the corner of the room opening. Larry's back and he's brought a groceries bag with him.*

L: I know you said you didn't want anything, but I got you some Coke Cherry anyways. You know you want it, it's your favorite.

CS: For the love of God. Didn't your mom teach you to knock before you enter a room?

L: Well that's a funny story, my mother actually-

CS: ENOUGH. Just get out and let me finish my promo. 

*larry shrugs and turns around.*

CS: Wait! Leave the Coke here.

*Larry puts down the Coke and walks away. Christopher stands up and grabs the can. While walking back to his chair he continues speaking.*

CS: Where was I... oh yeah. Metaphor. Something about a blaze and a campfire being distinguished with piss. I don't know. Point is...

*Christopher sits down and opens the can.*

CS: ...You've lost your fire, and defeating you at Rumble in the Jungle will be a cakewalk. 

CS: And before I go, Armondo... I look forward to our match. Much like the way your friend Ricardio handled his conflict with Chris Hardcore, I'm gonna let you decide the stipulation of our match. Just because I'm a nice guy. 

*Christopher chugs the can of soda down his throat and while he's doing that Larry enters the room again.*

L: What about Alex Amazing, sir?

CS: *Burping loudly* Finished business. We're in different companies now. I've got nothing to do with him anymore. My future is the FWF.

(...)

CS: [Speaking to Larry] Now, that was that. How do you turn this damn thing off? Where'd you get this piece of crap? Here's 700 dollars. Go buy a new one for in the future. Because this shit is unaccept-

Which line of your code specifically does the exception trigger on?

It's important to learn how to use debuggers, it will save you so much time solving issues like this!

I don't know the cause of your specific error, but this looks worrying:

    marks[gradeCount] = inputGrade;

marks only has one element. You also do this with the studentArray. If you index anything other than the first element of these  arrays you are going to get undefined behavior.

And generally I'm worried about how many pointers there are in this code - why not use vectors/lists etc? They are actually easier to use and safer than pointers once you get the hang of them.

Also this probably isn't doing what you think it is (*it's not actually doing anything*):

    CourseMarks(int *g, int num) {
        g = grades;
        num = numOfGrades;
    }

This sets the parameters g and num to the value of the class member variables (which haven't been initialized and could have any value!). The value of g and num is lost after the function call, because they are copies and don't refer to the original variables.","1356999544"

I don't think having an effect should be enough to qualify as aggression; after all, there are many things which can have an effect but most would not consider them an act of aggression. Breaking off a relationship can have an effect and even affect you physically, but that doesn't make it aggressive.

A verbal threat alone without a physical act is not an aggressive act.","1356999550"

The grades were based on random assignments that didn't pertain to what they would be doing.

I *really* love Ohio State, but I strongly advise against going into their FLE program for Spanish. I'm sorry to sound negative, but you should know about this before going into it. If your heart is set on education (Spanish), then look more into it and get several other opinions. ","1356999557"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am of the mind that socially constructed gender roles play just as big a role in 'mate selection' as instincts do.  If you look all around the world, each culture has it's own expectation of what it means to be masculine and what it means to be feminine.  I also think upbringing has a lot to do with shaping how you view the world and how you react to certain situations.  If a man is in a bar, is challenged to a fight, and decides to proceed in the fight because he thinks that women find that attractive in a mate, then he is making a decision based on his belief about traditional gender roles, a belief that is shaped by the society he lives in and how he was raised.

For example, I was raised by a father who was not only anti-violence, but cried openly on many occasions.  Because of this, I do not have see physical aggression as a desired trait in men, but I think mainstream society in the U.S. would say that John McClane-type masculinity of kicking ass is the desired type of masculinity.  My experience with women, however, tell me that most women do not desire men who are physically aggressive, particularly in a needless since such as the situation OP is talking about.","1356999559"

"AlAnon","t5_2sj6l","Hi - It sounds like you have had a very rough year.  I hope the new one brings you some peace and serenity.

I would suggest that if you were uncomfortable at one meeting, you try another.  Meetings have their own personality.  Some quite structured, others not, some quite ""churchy"" others not, some quite welcoming, others not.  The meetings are made up of people and like anything, get a group of people together and you'll have some groups you like and some you won't.

In the meantime, realize that even if you leave him, you have been living with it for a while and it may be helpful to go to some meetings to get your peace back.

On to your question, is this normal? On a scale of 1 to 10 it's an apple.  There is no normal and everything is normal.  Everyone is unique but common themes run throughout alcoholism and the details may be different but the themes stay the same.

More directly,  alcoholism doesn't ""Change"" people.  It can alter their inhibitions and allows them to act in ways they wouldn't dream of otherwise.  It also amplifys existing traits that come out normally.  So, the real question is, is he being mean because he's a jerk, or is he being mean because he's so drunk he's acting out of character?  

In either case, the answer in my opinion is irrelevant.  What's relevant is to ask, do you want to continue doing things the same way or to change.  If it's change, try Al-Anon, therapy, water yoga or anything that works for you.  I know for me, it's the Al-Anon program.  

In all that you wrote, you wrote one thing that's absolutely true, ""The bottom line is that when he drinks he is mean, rude and critical and I don't like it. I don't deserve it.""

I feel like the brain recognizes the technical prowess in metal music, but if a person isn't used to it, they'll reject it. Same with other forms of music. It's okay, don't take it personal. Some people just aren't meant to like metal, just like some of you aren't meant to like techno or bluegrass, for example. All a matter of taste, and if someone is closed to the idea, so be it.

Just look at America's history; we are almost always in debt. That's just how things work. When controlled and managed properly, the debt is nothing to fear, and is in fact quite natural.

I was sort of in a similar situation. I was the nerdy, awkward type in high school. Late bloomer, puberty hit, started lifting weights, and in college girls suddenly started liking me. I don't have any dating game, I just look above average and am very athletic, hence girls would use me. At the time I didn't care because it was novel, but it started irking me at one point. I believe my problem was that I was equating sex with commitment. After a while, I accepted being used and opened myself sexually. I stopped caring if a girl cheats on me (well, almost don't care) or uses me as an object. If a girl is worth it committing to, she will stick around, and we'll define the relationship. If not, DM;HS.

What I'm saying is that you have to brave through it. I know it sucks, but that's life. Sometimes I start looking around me and I see all my close friends are settling down with really amazing people and it depresses me that I'm still looking around and being thrown around. But then again, the grass is always greener on the other side - I can bet you a lot of people in committing relationships wish they could do shit they can't because they're with someone.

If things go the way they should, and it looks like Chavez is going to die very, very soon, then Cabello, speaker of the National Assembly, should take over and there should be elections. Maduro the VP should take over if Chavez dies after the tenth and there should be elections soon. In either of those cases, in my opinion, the opposition will probably win given that there's no Chavism without Chavez. Chavez is the charismatic leader that no one can replace; His beliefs won't survive without him. However keep in mind these are IDEAL conditions i.e. everyone follows the constitution and law. What I am afraid of is a coup from either Maduro or Cabello or maybe even the military. I wouldn't like PSUV (Chavez's party) to win if it comes to elections again, but if I had my choice I'd rather Maduro win over Cabello. Cabello is more astute and machiavellian. In short, everyone is tense over what might happen and the opposition is happy to see PSUV divided but at the same time are afraid of a power grab. The military is sort of refereeing. ","1356999586"

fourth has a lot of potential, but the length and drapey-ness makes it look a tad too ""high up"" and thus limits its versatility. For example, you can't wear that shit to clubs. 

sixth is too ordinary, pass

seventh is cute, good for everyday wear(in the warmer months), but it suffers the problem opposite of the fourth one, in the sense that this is too ""low end"", so no going to clubs with this either. (also the color clashes with your heels)

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Like Panda said, build AP, here's what I normally do.

Start Machette + 5 pots.

On your first back get Spirit Stone (Machette upgrade) and a couple pots.

Your two core items are Sorc Shoes and the Spirit of the Spectral Wraith (Machette Upgrade)
These items give you Spell Pen, MS, SpellVamp, and faster clearing times.

After that you want to look at your opponents team, who is doing well, and what you need to do, and select from the following.

Liandry's Torment (Spell pen, health, burn), Zhonya's (Armor, AP, active), Abyssal (AP, MR, Mpen), Rabadons (AP, AP, AP), Deathfire (Ap, Burst) and Rylai's (Health, AP, Slow). I usually do Zhon, Abyssal, Rylais, and Liandrys as it gives a lot of everything and you can be tanky enough to survive past your ult to pick people off.

Rabadons + Deathfire are if your team is mostly tanks and they need more damage, and you are fed enough where you sacrifice tanky stats for pure burst and damage. I don't usually recommend this.

Notes:
Pots are SUPER important early game. Until you get your hextech revolver (Part of Spectral Wraith) you have NO (Zero, 0, none, nada) sustain at all. You will clear 3 small camps before needing to back again if you don't have pots, let alone gank.
Also, ward everything. Running into bushes thinking you are stealthed when they actually see you will get you killed a bunch.
Catch people out, but don't initiate fights. Wait till your tank or bruisers have started fighting, then target the carries and squishies.  You want to dart in and out of the fight, abusing your cooldowns, but not standing in the fight while you die with no abilities up.
Gank more than you farm. You are the equivalent of Shaco, except you scale better and are scarier past lv 11. Gank a lot, kill a lot. Sometimes trading your life for one of their laners will give you the gold you need for items, and your laner free roam of their lane. As eve you want blood, and lots of it.

Hope this helps. If you have any questions let me know.","1356999608"

The 7950 has much more headroom to overclock than the 670, however, so overclocked, the 7950 should win (the Catalyst drivers have tossed in some nice performance boosts). The extra GB of VRAM (3 for 7950 vs only 2 GB for 670) also means that at higher resolutions like 2560x1440 or any multiple-monitor gaming, the 7950 will beat out the 670 if they're not tied for performance. A 7950 is also cheaper, and this particular 7950 can achieve a pretty high overclock for a GPU because of it's amazing cooler, in addition to coming with 3 free games. Taking all that into consideration, a 7950 is the better buy unless you're doing lots of photo/video editing with software that supports CUDA acceleration (such as Sony Vegas or the Adobe software suite).

""Most of the Brahmas and Devas simply enjoy reaping the fruits of their past actions and think that they are immortal and forever to be happy and so they don't try to practice the Dharma. When their past karmas have all had their result, these devas will fall into lower worlds and suffer again.""

""The likelihood of a blind turtle, rising from the depths of the ocean to the surface once in a hundred years, putting its head through the hole in the yoke is considered greater than that of a being in the animal realm, hungry ghost realm or hell realm achieving rebirth as a human. This is because, according to the sutta, in these realms there is no Dharma""

Staff of nin is great, but in a meta where you could easily be dead before you have enough mana to cast this too.

I don't know how you would fit this in, but for a control deck you are very weak on card advantage. Normally you would want augurs as basically cantrips with toughness or snapcasters to make your bin an extention of your hand, but those don't really work. You might as well pull some pages out of omnidoor's book and look into some fog. I also see no reason not to play thragtusk.

"startrek","t5_2qixm","1. I was 5 or so.  All I remember is enjoying Star Trek at that age.  Though I also remember BoBW being my favorite episode.  I thought the tension between Picard and Sisko was interesting but I didn't understand enough of it to actually get it.
2. I enjoyed Star Trek regardless at that age, so it didn't bother me.
3. I think it is by far one of the best fleshed out Star Trek's with one of the best crews.  The moral dilemmas presented in DS9 were not to be found anywhere else and the mix of Starfleet and non-Starfleet allowed for characterizations which would not be found elsewhere.
4. I think having Ro Laren be the executive officer would have ultimately weakened the series.  Her disconnect from Bajor and her trust of Starfleet would have killed a lot of the early tension of the show and would have reduced how connected the executive officer was with the station, resulting in only the security officer being a native to Bajor.
5. DS9 was a show about Starfleet trying to help a post holocaust world get back on its feet and find its way in the galaxy.  Along the way, they encountered a very powerful foe and had to fight for survival.  Babylon 5 was about a peace station designed as an apolitical zone where different races could get together and talk out their differences.  It was here they were able to bound together to fight an enemy.  While the very base concept is similar or even identical, it's the differences about the mission of those on the stations that keeps it from being a ripoff.","1356999623"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","That however happens in traditional ranked as well, people would troll in order to force others to leave, but to address this issue I was thinking of setting up a function that would allow people to report a player, 4 people for a person that is not in duo queue and 3 if the person being reported is in duo queue. Then the report would be sent to the tribunal where players would decide whether the person was abusing the system, if the player gets successfully reported 3 times in a period of 50 games, then they would get a warning, each follow up report would consist of a ban.
However, this will work the other way round as well and if the player is found not guilty and abuses the report function thrice in a period of 20 games, then the player will receive a warning with a notification what report they abused thrice *(e.g if the person reported people for trolling, holding a queue or a combination of the reports, they would get a notification that they shouldn't abuse these report functions as well as they were found misusing these particular named reporting function)* with each following up misuse being punished with a ban.

Wayne Hunter at right tackle then replaced with a below average RT which was a massive improvement.  Ya think?

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I wrote a [blog post](http://transparentseas.net/2012/04/23/126/) about crowd-funding back in April that was overwhelmingly positive, and I still believe most of that, but with a bit of an added caveat.

While I still think the idea of crowdfunding offers indie developers an incredible opportunity to make what they really want to make, we have to be wary of abuse of the system. Some recent projects I've seen on Kickstarter - namely, the Obsidian-developed RPG, and *Elite: Dangerous*, the game that wants 2 million dollars - make me worry for the future of crowdfunding.

If we're willing to throw money at an established studio like Obsidian, what's to prevent other larger studios from simply launching kickstarters for games so that they don't have to risk their own capital making them? Crowdfunding originally seemed like a great way for small developers to release games that were too niche or too experimental for traditional publishers to release; are we to believe Obsidian couldn't have put out their game via traditional publishing channels?

So yeah...if we can keep crowd-funding as a mostly indie platform for adventurous developers, without it turning into a way for big studios to make you preorder their triple-A game before it even exists, I think it's a fantastic idea. We need to make sure that we as consumers regulate that, though.","1356999638"

"fantasybaseball","t5_2quxe","With that keeper, do you lose your draft pick for the round in which he was picked or does it not have any bearing on next year?

Regardless, I think Price is a no-brainer.  Definitely keep him.  After that, it gets a little hairier but in a good way.  Having more than enough to keep is a good problem to have.

If this were my team, I'd be keeping Bruce for sure.  He's maturing into an elite power hitter and is only going to keep getting better.

After that, Goldschmidt is really enticing as an 11th rounder.  Medlen as a FA pickup is too good to miss though.  If he pitches like he did in the 2nd half next year, that's a 3rd rounder at a very low price.

I don't think Cueto should even enter this discussion, personally.  I would rather have Moore, Goldschmidt, Headley, Medlen, or Minor over Cueto.  Cueto, even with his successes the last two years, has had an xFIP and SIERA over a full point higher than his ERA.  His K-rate is nowhere near elite, and he's only pitched more than 200 innings once in his career (last year - a career year).  That's just my opinion, though.  Ultimately, all you can do is gather all the information you can, and then try and make the most informed decision possible.  Hope that helped.","1356999639"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The question of measuring infinite sets is somewhat tricky. The solution your friend is thinking of is _cardinality_, discovered/invented in the late nineteenth century by Georg Cantor. Two sets are said to have the same cardinality if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their elements. For example, consider the set of days of the week and integers from 1 to 7. There is a one-to-one correspondence:

       Sunday &lt;-&gt; 1
       Monday &lt;-&gt; 2
      Tuesday &lt;-&gt; 3
    Wednesday &lt;-&gt; 4
     Thursday &lt;-&gt; 5
       Friday &lt;-&gt; 6
     Saturday &lt;-&gt; 7

The important thing to note about the correspondence is that each day of the week appears exactly once on the left, and each integer from 1 to 7 appears exactly once on the right. That is, each day of the week corresponds to one and only one integer from 1 to 7, and each integer from 1 to 7 corresponds to one and only one day of the week. So we would be justified in saying there are as many days in a week as there are integers from 1 to 7.

Now suppose we only consider the working days Monday through Friday, but we still want to compare to integers from 1 to 7. Then we could start to write a correspondence:

       Monday &lt;-&gt; 1
      Tuesday &lt;-&gt; 2
    Wednesday &lt;-&gt; 3
     Thursday &lt;-&gt; 4
       Friday &lt;-&gt; 5
          ??? &lt;-&gt; 6
          ??? &lt;-&gt; 7

However, we find nothing for 6 and 7 to correspond to. With some playing around, we could convince ourselves that there is no possible correspondence between these two sets. So we are justified in thinking the number of working days is different than the number of integers from 1 to 7. (With a little more finesse, we could show that it is strictly less.)

So for the integers and natural numbers, we might have a correspondence like:

     0 &lt;-&gt; 0
     1 &lt;-&gt; 1
    -1 &lt;-&gt; 2
     2 &lt;-&gt; 3
    -2 &lt;-&gt; 4
       ...
     n &lt;-&gt; 2*n - 1 (when n &gt; 0)
     n &lt;-&gt; 2*(-n)  (when n &lt; 0)
       ...

Because there are infinitely many elements, we can't write out the whole correspondence, but you can maybe see the pattern developing, and check that it matches the general forms at the end. And you can convince yourself that each integer appears exactly once on the left, and each natural number appears exactly once on the right. So we can say that these sets have the same cardinality, that they are the same size.

For any finite number n, you can consider the set [n] = {0,1,...,n-1} of all natural numbers less than n. Any set with the same cardinality as [n] is said to have cardinality n (i.e. it has n elements). These are the finite cardinalities. With a little work, it can be shown that the set of natural numbers does not have the same cardinality as any of the sets [n]. It has the first infinite cardinality, called aleph-null. (That is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscript zero. It is also read aleph-zero or aleph-naught.)

Now we could just call this infinity and stop there, but we might ask whether there is anything bigger. That is, are there infinite sets which are not in one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers? Surprisingly, the answer turns out to be yes. This unexpected result of Cantor's created some controversy surrounding his set theory when first published, but is now generally accepted by the mathematical community. (There are some dissenters still who are mostly ready to give up the infinite entirely.)

Cantor's proof revolves around an idea so simple that it can be hard to grasp. Indeed, people come up with ""disproofs"" with some regularity. (One of the signs of a mathematical crank is they think they've found a logical flaw in this proof. The dissenters-in-good-standing generally have a problem with the premises rather than the logic.) But it boils down to a proof by contradiction.  Suppose there were a correspondence between natural numbers on one side and real numbers 0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1 on the other. We would create a table like

    0 &lt;-&gt; 0.1111111111...
    1 &lt;-&gt; 0.1231231231...
    2 &lt;-&gt; 0.1415926535...
    3 &lt;-&gt; 0.7071067811...
    4 &lt;-&gt; 0.6789699879...
      ...

Cantor suggests that we create a number by reading down the diagonal, that is, by taking the first digit from the first row, the second digit from the second row, and so on. So for this example we get 0.12116... And now the key trick: change each digit of this number in some way. For example we could add one to each digit, except 9 which we make 0. That gives us the number 0.23227... Now spring the trap. If our table was a one-to-one correspondence, this new number must appear somewhere in it. So where is it? Can it be the first row? No, by construction, the first digit of our number is different than the first digit of the first row. Can it be the second? No, the second digit is different than the second digit of the second row. Can it be the seventeenth? No, the seventeenth digit is different that the seventeenth digit of the seventeenth row. In fact it can't be anywhere in the table. So the table cannot have been a one-to-one correspondence.

Now you might want to try just adding this new number to the table. Now you have a different table than you started with. But Cantor pulls the same trick on you to find a number than isn't in the new table. You can keep adding numbers, and Cantor can keep finding something you've missed. The key point is that Cantor's process for finding a new number works for any table, so there is no possible table that is ""finished"". So there is no one-to-one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers between zero and one. So there is more than one kind of ""infinity"".

(It should be noted that I've left out some technical details surrounding decimal representations of real numbers. They basically boil down to the 0.999 repeating equals 1 thing, and they mean that my naively constructed table might contain the same number more than once, and that the number constructed to not be in the table might actually be in the table. You can either work through these details to get a proof that the natural numbers are not in one-to-one correspondence with the reals, or you can adjust the above to work with infinite sequences of digits rather than real numbers. In that case, you've still seen that there is some infinite set which is not in one-to-one correspondence with the naturals, it just wasn't the real numbers.)

So we can say that the set of natural numbers is strictly smaller than the set of real numbers. We called the cardinality of the natural numbers aleph-zero; should we call the cardinality of the reals aleph-one? Perhaps not; there could be cardinalities ""between"" that of the naturals and that of the reals. Are there? It turns out that we can't prove it one way or the other. The statement that there are no cardinalities greater than the naturals and less than the reals is called the Continuum Hypothesis. (It deals with ""the cardinality of the continuum"".) It has been shown that the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved from the axioms of set theory and also that the opposite of the Continuum Hypothesis cannot be proved. (The result that there are such statements, neither provable nor disprovable, is interesting in its own right. It was shown by Kurt Goedel in 1931 that such statements exist in any system powerful enough to describe the natural numbers, but the Continuum Hypothesis wasn't completely shown to be an example until 1963.)

In the time I've been typing this, others have probably said much the same. Hopefully someone else has also pointed out other ways to measure infinite sets because I am going to stop here.","1356999648"

"PhilosophyofReligion","t5_2sfeh","A karmic perspective:

We have ourselves to blame for all the bad things that happen. We can thank ourselves for all the good things. If you put money in your bank account and use it to buy new computer speakers, it makes sense to credit yourself for having earned that money and deposited it in your account. On the other hand, if you spend all of your money on frivolities and your rent check bounces, it makes sense to blame yourself. This is how karma operates: like a bank account.

In my tradition, it is appropriate to be thankful to the Lord when you feel you have received ""mercy"". People usually discuss this in the context of gaining understanding, teachers, or austerities. This is considered to operate separately from the karmic system, and the appropriate mentality in that context is that even bad experiences are cause to be thankful. ","1356999648"

I don't think Gilbride was as bad as Fewell was, because the offense's problems were stemmed from the personell issues (save for the occasional awful play calling) Fewell just refused to give up on our pass rush and lack of good LB's, which was the eventual demise of our defense.

It's open world, but there are only a handful of mission types. In that regard, it's a lot like the original Assassin's Creed. It can get a little repetitive, but they ratchet up the difficulty as the game progresses and provide you with a variety of means to complete your objectives, which helps to relieve the tedium. Overall I had a good time playing through the single player. 

Multiplayer has its fault. It's not that great. The progression system is solid and it's fairly balanced, but there's not auto balance if teams end up lopsided. And of course the lack of dedicated servers and no region filters makes every game a dice roll basically. It can get frustrating trying to find a decent connection. But multiplayer isn't bad. It's just not as well rounded as single player.

There are completely other ways to phrase the mind-body-problem than the choice between 
a) the ghost in the machine (and then to chew on how that ghost can affect the machine, ref. your antenna question) and 
b) the concept that consciousness is a fairytale without consequence that the brain tells itself while ticking along according to natural laws (and then you can't even begin to understand qualia, intentionality or the validity of your own argumentation.) 

To phrase the problem in a sufficiently subtle way is the task of the philosophy of mind, but there is of course a multitude of ways to do that, including not so subtle ones.

One argument is that the object of the neurosciences isn't ""the brain"" as a naively understood tangible, directly accessible object, but hypotheses and theories and that through highly specific methods and procedures. Science itself is an institutionalised, collaborative project based on rational arguments and counterarguments and rules about their validity, agreed upon by - minds. In that sense, ""mind"" precedes ""brain"".

To phrase arguments like these (and more subtle ones) in other than laymen's terms, requires sufficient knowledge of philosophy (and special disciplines like epistemology, analytic philosophy etc). I only dabble in these matters these days, an interested spectator more than a competent player.

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","Ok so here's my take on the whole emperor/king/duke relationships. When handing out duchies/counties I do my best to make sure that the one I want to control the duchy has the most power in the duchy itself, with maybe a vassal or two under the duchy to keep the area's power from being consolidated.

Keep the crown authority at either autonomous or low, it really makes no difference to me. Low is better because you can revoke titles and appoint military leaders, but if your vassals demand it I usually will give in. Max feudal levies, small feudal tax.

This way, most all of the people who control the duchies/counties are happy with their lot. They don't desire any more (at least nothing that comes with a negative opinion penalty) and are perfectly content. They will still remain loyal to their king (me) as long as I don't let them get too powerful. Sometimes I have to trim the hedges and keep the more powerful ones down through revoking titles and excommunication. This doesn't work all the time as I try to put useful family members into positions of power, and no one wants to be a kinslayer.

Finally, if the vassals are *really* that upset at me for having the king title, I will set the succession type to elective. In my playthroughs, as long as my heir has an heir (a legitimate son), I'm pretty much guaranteed to have my heir elected into the kingdom. If someone else gets nominated other than my heir well...time to trim some more hedges :)

Edit: Elective is also extremely useful when your first son is a drooling imbecile and you want your second or third son installed instead.

Edit 2: Also I would like to note there is a very very good reason for wanting as many vassals as possible. If you have feudal tax, then instead of those individuals taxes going to a king, and you getting a percentage of the kings take, you get nearly all the tax in the regions.","1356999657"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","&gt; We need to show that the difference between a 30 round magazine and three 10 round magazines is measured in a few seconds.

I recently found this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yHYARkMZiig

The guy is using 5 round magazines. He has to change mags twice.

By my count, he still manages to fire 15 shots in 21 seconds. Accurately. At person-sized targets.

**Using 5 round magazines.**

Limiting magazine size? That'll be about as effective as re-arranging deck chairs on the Titanic.

And that's not even getting into the fact that the Sandy Hook shooter had three guns. Suppose that those guns only had 10 round magazines. (All three of them had larger magazines than that. But just suppose.) He killed 27 people. So, in theory, assuming one bullet per victim... he wouldn't have had to reload even once. Just dropped the empty gun when the magazine was empty, and grabbed the next one.

...

Right now, I get the impression that some of my fellow liberals aren't even interested in examining the issue rationally. They don't even want to talk about whether X, Y or Z would actually solve the problem of school shootings. Don't think critically, just go ban something!

I guess perhaps we have a case of ""You can't reason someone out of a position that they didn't reason themselves into."" :P

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, guess I'll pipe in a bit here as well. My youngest sent me this link, and I was halfway expecting to find her story in here. And perhaps it is, just a little further down.

Oldest, son, has Asperger's. Given the initial diagnosis I didn't think too much about it as I suspect I have a touch myself, and at that time we were very busy with our middle daughter. She was born in heart failure, and now some almost 20 years later her diagnosis remains ""Previously Unidentified Syndrome of Suspected Single Gene Origin"". Doctors have a really funny was of saying ""We don't know"", don't they?

If you want more of the story of the birth and the early years, one of the reasons I started a blog was to talk about that. Link is:
http://a1.blogspot.com/2002/12/savannah-life-lessons-learned.html

In any case we were contemplating my getting a vasectomy when we discovered that my wife was pregnant again. As one of the middle daughter's nurses was also pregnant about that time, we claimed my wife ""caught it"" from her.

So the middle daughter had just the normal pregnancy tests and scans, and nothing was found until birth. Insurance company didn't want to take chances and so for the youngest there were weekly scans up until three weeks before delivery.

Yes, we were asked early on if given what had happened with the first two if we wanted to abort. We said we didn't. The tests showing we made the right decision didn't hurt either.

In addition to her two siblings, our youngest has also had to deal with a mother who has suffered from depression for years, and even attempted suicide a few years ago. My wife's two sisters don't live with us now, but have at various times in the past because they are both somewhat schizo.

That the youngest is above average intellectually, and working to go to Baylor after acing her first year of college given all that is as much if not more a miracle than the middle daughter still being alive at this point.

We have gotten wills written up to try and make sure the youngest can be as involved, or not, in the care of her siblings as she chooses to be. Of course finances will have some part to play in that as well.

Fortunately we have not had to ""give up"", either of our two differently abled children. However we are hoping to find a good group home for the middle daughter in the next year or so. Our son has his own place, but because of the severity of his condition it is hard for him to keep it up, and so he spends several days a month back at our house.

If knowing what I know now would I do it again? Well, I certainly would have all three kids. However I obviously would have made sure the middle daughter's delivery was different, and made some different financial choices that might have made things easier.

Not sure this was moving or inspirational, but hopefully helpful.

I think it has more to do with the MOBA genre than the fact LoL is F2P. In MMO's you generally have to spend at least a month achieving the maximum level, then months more to get decent gear, takes even longer to learn your character and how to play in various events, PvP arenas and dungeons etc. Because of the amount of time and effort needed to do this, compared to LoL specifically, the number of trolls is reduced significantly. In my experience anyway, most of the time I somehow get into one of the bigger/higher rated guilds so I may just be lucky enough to not run into those kinds of players.","1356999689"

    }

Here marks is of size 1, but you're writing count (a value put in by the user) elements into it. This is bad news bears.

Other things that are bad news bears:

* Your first CourseMarks constructor is blank, your second one isn't blank but might as well be as it doesn't actually do anything.

* consider using initialization lists for constructors.

* constructing CourseMarks with nonsense values and then depending on (and allowing) the user to set them appropriately is bad. As a rule of thumb, it should be hard for code using your class to get an object of that class into an invalid state (such as array being pointed to being smaller than size variable).

Look at how something like the string or vector types in C++ limit their interfaces to make sure their internal state is always something sensible.

Also: 

* Avoid raw pointers, they will betray you. Prefer not using pointers at all and prefer using smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) when you do use pointers.

* In your case using a vector&lt;int&gt; instead of an int* and size variable would be helpful in solving some of your design issues.

* What is check for? it's named confusingly and looks pretty useless.

I take iado now, but most men in their mid-30's don't really have to deal with schoolground bullying anymore, and even if I did, I don't think cutting them in half with a sword would be the appropriate response ... assuming I carried my swords with me all the time.

One thing that did happen about 8 or 9 years ago ...

I was hanging out with a couple of friends on St. Patrick's Day ... by the time we met up, my friends were already pretty sloshed, so we went to a couple of bars.  When we got to one of said bars, I went in, grabbed a Guinness, and started flirting with some girl by the pool tables for a couple of minutes before noticing that there was a commotion and my friends were MIA.

Now might be a good time to mention that one of said friends was a moron and the other one was a Marine.

And so I left the young lady that I was flirting with to go outside and find the laughing idiot in the middle of a fight with the bouncer.  Some folks were holding him back, while my more level-headed friend had the bouncer in sleeper hold ... although it was more like the fight between Wesley and Fezzik in The Princess Bride ... 

Eventually, my sane friend lost his grip on the bouncer and started charging for the giggling idiot, who I was holding back and trying to talk down.  I turned around just in time to catch a left hook that sent me spinning in to one of those grates that come down in front of a store when they're closed.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","BMI is from the mid-1800s.  It's intended to look a trends in populations and not individuals.  But a vegan diet sounds like something out of the 1800s as well so you are all set.

In all seriousness...  Your silly body mass index doesn't take into account muscle vs fat and the scale becomes incredibly skewed for tall individuals (I'm 6'4 - thanks Milk!!!).  According to BMI many NBA players are overweight.  I choose NBA because they are obviously thinner guys - but the same could be said of any professional sport - if you're not vegan-weak you're probably going to be high on the BMI scale.  

My blood work is also excellent.  I eat about 1/2 lb of uncured bacon a week, then use the fat to fry potatoes. And I use so much fucking butter I could strangle a grass fed cow just thinking about it!!!","1356999698"

"electricians","t5_2slrm","The only time I've personally been mistreated by a company, I posted above as an example of the role of job stewards, and the union on the job site.

That said the day that I started my pre-apprenticeship I walked onto a site that had nothing bus a single port-o-potty baking in the sun for us. Middle of summer and we ate lunch with no shade, sitting next to a seacan full of material.

After a few weeks we got more journeymen, and a steward assigned, and pretty soon we had an air conditioned lunch room, and proper job boxes dropped off and chained up to leave our tools in. That was it. Still hot and disgusting, but now our tools can't be stolen, and we get to sit at a table to eat lunch, and not be cooked ourselves. 

I've never been treated really badly by a company, only by individual foremen, or journeymen.

The first two years I was a pre-apprentice and first term apprentice. I hadn't gone to basic trade school yet (in Ontario trade school is split into Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced) I knew *nothing* when I started.

Some memories :

* I spent the most time by far shuffling materials around to where they were needed, inventorying, and organizing.
* Fetched gallons of coffee. 
* Swapped propane cylinders on our scissor lifts
* Spent one memorable day fabricating 2 foot rigid conduit nipples, using the threader. 
* Unloaded by hand 21 trailers of fluorescent light fixtures.
* Rolled up, and moved the 1.5 inch rope used to pull feeders, and it's axle and stands.
* Spent 3 days digging a hole(with a pick and shovel), before being told that it wasn't necessary after all, and to please fill it back in. 
* Installed the disconnects and hooked up 7 HVAC units on a roof... in a blizzard.
* Learned how to move the 12000lb reels our feeder cables (500kcm) came on without giving myself a hernia.
* Sprained my back anyway, lifting something stupidly light the wrong way.
* Pulled cables whenever and wherever directed by a journeyman.
* Learned to love yellow 77.
* Learned how to bend EMT
* Learned how to install a receptacle, and GFCI; standard switch, 3-way, and 4-way

I love any day they give me a job and leave me alone until it's done. But that's me. I hated taking coffee/snack orders every morning for 35 guys - getting stiffed for cash, bitched out by the guys I work with because the coffee truck didn't have donuts today, I asked for 1/2 cream 1/2 sugar and I can tell this has too much sugar, I think you shorted me 10c on the change... Getting bitched out by the guys I don't work with - what the fuck is taking so long, I only have 15 minutes of break, and I want a fucking coffee!

Bah. I don't do coffee anymore. I didn't drink it to begin with, now I flat out refuse to be the gopher (go fer this, go fer that...) at this point in my career either they have work for me, and I'll happily do it, or they don't and they can give me a layoff. I don't do pointless busy work. (Of course I don't have a wife and kids to support. Don't own a home, and live dirt cheap. Actually 4 days pay covers my minimum monthly expenses, and I save almost everything else.)

Advice - don't get cocky, you don't know anything and it will be frustrating because it takes a while before anyone starts teaching you anything. Like most other jobs there's a 'hazing' period where you'll feel completely unappreciated and wonder when you'll actually get to do any real work. It'll come.

If you get the opportunity to take any educational courses, take them! No knowledge is ever wasted. My union hall runs evening classes that cost nothing (our dues pay for them) so while I'm still six months away from being licensed, I have certifications in communications cabling, fiber optics, introductory sensors and instrumentation, and 3 of the 4 (starting the fourth in January, if all goes to plan) courses required to get my fire alarm certification. By the time I get my license I will be employable damn near anywhere. 

I've been seriously thinking about travel, so getting all the certifications out of the way while I'm locked into the apprenticeship is great. Also, my union recognizes the courses as hours towards my apprenticeship, so I've worked about 3 months off of my apprenticeship.

The only other insight I might offer is into the application process. It varies depending on your local, and they'll tell you how to apply. Here's what I had to do.

Wait. About 8 months before they announced they were taking applications for one week.

Provide a resume, proof that I had taken high school grade 12 english, math, physics, and optionally chemistry.

Wait. A couple of weeks later they gave me a date and time to take an general aptitude test. This test absolutely did not require prior knowledge. It was things like given this random image, count the number of blocks in a structure. (requires you to picture it in 3d and count the 'hidden' blocks). Given 4 cut away drawings, which one represents how a can lid is sealed (this was an actual question, I will never forget it. I think I stared at the paper, and wondered what kind of job I was getting into.) etc... I didn't need to memorize formulas, or know anything in advance really.

I suspect that test was just to weed out the idiots.

Another wait while they went through the tests, and then they scheduled interviews over the course of two weeks. Mine lasted about 20 minutes, I talked to two gentlemen, one representative of the union and one representative of the contractors association. I had no prior knowledge and experience to offer them, only my enthusiasm. I'd been reading about CNC at the time, and we ended up discussing manufacturing labour trends, and the likelihood that with automation a small amount of skilled labour would replace a large amount of unskilled labour. 

They were both smiling, I hadn't been slurring too many words together in nervous haste, I chalked it up as a win, and went home.

I was notified by mail that I'd made the cut, and they would contact me before my orientation.

Another 4 months went by before I was called in with 20 others. We were the second group from that one intake session. I learned later that they had over 900 applicants and took about 150 that year.

We spent two weeks in training, getting our fall arrest, and whmis, and doing some basic electrical projects under supervision.

Then we were sent over to Dispatch to find out who we'd be working for. We sat through a few hours of paperwork and administration stuff, and had our benefits explained to us. And finally we drew lots for what order we'd be hired in. I was 4th of 22 (I think), and they had me placed with a company about 2 weeks later.

Since then I've been working, going to evening classes, and trade school.","1356999701"

And any such deliberation is completely irrelevant *after* the individuals joins any such collective.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Also, foreplay. You don't mention foreplay, so its hard to know what you've been doing.  

But it's perfectly normal for women to require a serious amount of mental build up and then slowly intensifying physical stimulation (and not just on their genitals) before sex can be at all comfortable. It's also perfectly normal for neither they nor their partner to realize how important it is to pleasurable sex, or just how long it really takes.

Maybe you've already been doing this, but even so, still try more of it, for longer, before attempting penetration. And we're not talking five or even ten minutes either, nor are we talking jumping straight to going down on her: build up to everything, add lube to the picture once you finally get to the stage of stimulating her clit and fingering her, etc.  

If you're still having pain, maybe then consult a doctor.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Not strong enough to remove all faith.

Everybody tries to make sense of his/her own existence, getting a purpose, meaning. Most religions and the faith accompanying that can provide. And then there is of course the whole discussion of materialism itself being a belief system ...

&gt;I'd like to see those.

There is a little bit of a wealth to choose from. A quick and easy way to information (and knowing what to read) is through following the podcasts [here](http://www.skeptiko.com/past-shows/). It's really interesting and I suggest not jumping in at the end but start from the beginning. It's not necessarily about dualism, but more about consciousness and the research into consciousness. I'll leave any further conclusions up to you.

To answer more directly, here are a few researches that I know from the top of my head: [P. van Lommel et al.](http://profezie3m.altervista.org/archivio/TheLancet_NDE.htm) did a prospective study into NDE that appeared in the lancet. [D.J. Bem](http://dbem.ws/FeelingFuture.pdf) who did a psi-study that appeared in JPSP. And the journal of frontiers in neruoscience is going to do a special issue on non-local mind this year (2013, happy new year by the way :)

If you want to have a more formal argument for pantheism there is always Spinoza to read. For a more formal argument for dualism there is always Descartes. (and the world of proponents and opponents, which is quite vast and fills a library rather quickly.) You can read for and against on the wiki (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dualism_(philosophy_of_mind) ), to give yourself an overview.

Laban goes after Jacob and confronts him. They confide to each other and then set up a monument dedicated to the peace between them. This is what the man meant when he said שרית עם אנשים.

I suggest you watch the movie ""Fight Club"". It is very interesting... Edward Norton's characters name is ""Jack"". Brad Pitt plays ""Tyler Durden"", whose initials are T.D. It might give a good explanation who Jacob was actually wrestling.

&gt; no. god's name is a form of the verb ""to be"", thus אהיה אשר אהיה = יהוה.

this is an equally potential possibility.

&gt; correct, and 1:1 should be an infinitive as well, because בראשית is in the construct form. had the author mean it to be qal perfect 3rd masculine singular, he would have written בראשון ברא instead. see rashi on the subject. or orlinsky.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Okay, I'm here to defend MB.

Yeah, I watch him a lot. But people who are going out of their way to bash him are simply jumping on the hate band wagon. The fact of the matter is, many people do stream SNIPE him. I almost never hear him accusing people of cheating anymore(he has a list of obvious stream snipers).

Furthermore, he streams for hours nearly every day. He rarely blames his losses(not always) on the other player cheating. He always explains what he could have done better and even gives props to his opponents more than you'd think. Sure, he rages, but not a lot during Starcraft 2(mostly when he's palying let's plays or whatever).

Anyone who accuses MB of blaming everyone for stream cheating obviously doesn't watch his stream very often. His stream is one of the best on Twitch and he is better than the majority of players in your clan. I've also seen him beat GM players on ladder and in customs many times... Not that it has anything to do with this situation at hand. Your post reeks of unprofessionalism, and you should be ashamed by the way you wrote it.  You're harming your reputation more than helping it as far as I'm concerned.

And what does your CLAN have to do with this? Are you trying to say how much better you are than him so there's no way you need to cheat? That means NOTHING. It was just one player in question he apparently accused(do you ahve any proof of this btw???). You're trying to get publicity and start another witch hunt. That's all I see.","1356999721"

It would be cool if it only affected my spelling and grammar, but it also affects my speaking ability. Most people think I have an accent because I have learned to hide most of it behind a droll, but I always have to concentrate when I speak so it comes out as coherent thoughts. Because of this a lot of people think I am being rude when it looks like I zone out when I am listening or speaking, but it is because I have to concentrate to the point that sight because too much of a distraction. I think people place too much value in grammar and mechanics thinking it hints at the level of education of a person or their intelligence, but that is not true. It is not that I cannot spell against or occurring because I am stupid, it is just part of who I am. My mind simply does not think in rigid rules of language. If someone lets dyslexia, or any learning disorder, significantly impact their life then I am see why some would judge them based on it.

**That said**, *if* you can afford to feed your friends, I would suggest you do so. Bear with me as I explain. You probably don't want to spend the whole vacation sniping about food, right? And you don't want to have to deal with your friends passive-aggressive comments and the minor dramas that will come out from this. 

So (if you can afford it, I'd like to stress that part) take these moochers to the grocery store and buy them a few groceries while smiling politely and saying they can pay you back after the trip or something to that effect. Don't actually expect them to pay you back; moochers rarely do.

After having this nice vacation and time away, confront them when you get home. Sit them down and explain in clear terms that you don't feel comfortable going on trips with them if they can't afford to pay for basic necessities like food, and that their behavior was rude and added unnecessary and uncomfortable tension to the trip. 

It sounds like this whole friend group went to extra lengths to negotiate an affordable rate for these moochers, *and* that the moochers were aware of the food situation *before* the trip. So basically, they're repaying the generosity already offered by demanding more. If they couldn't afford the trip, they shouldn't have come. Simple as that. 

The friendship may hit a rough patch, or y'all may even grow apart from the moochers after this. If you value their friendship more than explaining their bad behavior, then maybe just buy the groceries and suck it up. Never invite them on a shared cost trip again, because they're bad guests.

It's not fair, they are bad at managing money, and they are  being rude. Unfortunately, they clearly see nothing wrong with their behavior, and any attempt to get them to admit they were out of line will probably just end in strained relations.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The majority of the government cuts were generated by bureaucrats and public servants.  Management within the departments sat down in conference rooms and protected their own jobs first (no reason to cut themselves out).  Once the Executive Group firmly established their own job security and healthy performance bonuses (which would have easily covered the costs for the ELA and more), they laid out a series of cost saving proposals which they would present to their respective ministers.  These proposals would be presented to save between 5-10% while maintaining necessary service delivery and achievement of the department's mandate/mission.

*Very* likely for the ELA's case is Public Servants recommended the closure in order to capture some of the savings required by the DRAP. Based on the recommendations the Minister(s) approved the cuts.

So yes, the CPC government could have opted not to cut it, but the initial recommendation would have been provided by public servants.  Consider the reaction the CPC gets from the public when it ignores the recommendations of experts, government employees and the like.

[$556 billion](http://www.kff.org/medicare/upload/7305-07.pdf) on medicare in 2012.

[Medicaid is jointly funded by the feds and states](http://www.kff.org/medicaid/upload/8380.pdf), only ***$100 billion*** of which comes from the federal government

&gt;The Medicaid program is jointly funded by states 
and the federal government.  In federal fiscal year (FFY) 2010, total Medicaid expenditures climbed to over ***$389 billion***

[Social security](http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43649) is estimated at ***$773 billion***

**$556 billion + $100 billion + $773 billion = $1.429 trillion, roughly the same as the total amount of defense spending of $1.03-$1.415 trillion.**

I feel much more comfortable spending money helping people rather than bombing them go figure.

&gt;Between 42% and 53% of US tax dollars goes to military spending, although a lot of it is hidden outside of the actual pentagon's budget. While the government's 2012 budget may be projected at ~ $3.7 trillion, 1/3 of that is funded by debt (~$1.1 trillion) which means only ~$2.6 trillion is paid through taxes.

&gt;First there's the actual pentagon budget, which in 2012 is projected at $670.9 billion then you have to add in $117.8 billion for overseas contingency operations, $55 billion to fund some national intelligence programs (the entire budget is classified), $2.7 billion for FBI counter-terror programs, a projected $5.6 - 63 billion spent on international affairs, $21.8 billion department of energy (defense related), $70 billion to fund veterans affairs, $46.9 on homeland security, $3.5 - $8.7 billion funding NASA's military programs, $54.6 billion spent on veterans pensions, $8.2 billion in other mandatory defense spending, (the rest of the classified intelligence budget, in the billions), anywhere between $109.1 and $431.5 billion will be spent on paying interest on the debt incurred from our wars since 911, bringing the grand total to...

I tend to define white knighting as insincere attempts by men to impress women. It's pretty hard-wired in most men to want to impress women, and when we get the chance to show them what a good and awesome guy we are, sometimes men say things that aren't well thought out or rational advice. In /r/okcupid this kind of white knighting tends to show up when a woman posts about dating problems and it sounds like she's actually the one at fault and is just posting for validation of her belief that it's not her but the man who is to blame ... and then there's usually a few guys who can't resist telling her what an asswipe the dude was. This kind of white knighting usually doesn't help anything.

"AskScienceDiscussion","t5_2vlah","I don't entirely agree with Pylori's answer, it seems to have multiple ideas that don't really converge. 

Firstly, Pylori mentions that we don't know the root problem and this is entirely true, but to add to this we don't know how a lot of the medications currently used work in great detail. For instance, in the case of Bipolar disorder, Lithium is often prescribed, however how it functions isn't completely understood, so you can't really design an optimised drug if you don't know everything the drug is affecting. 

Pylori's second point is about protein aggregation, which I don't think relates to the point, a lot of recent research has been showing that Alzheimer protein aggregations are caused by misfolding of the Tau protein in cells, this misfolded protein may then ""infect"" other cells after time causing their working form of the Tau protein to fold incorrectly, maybe in the process of recycling. But I don't think this idea relates to Anxiety or Depression. 

In the case of Anxiety, a lot of the time it is caused by social conditioning, leading to over secretion of certain hormones causing physical effects, in the same manner as the fight or flight response. In cognitive behavioural therapy, these effects can be reduced by reconditioning the mind that the ideas causing the anxiety aren't dangerous and the fear of them is irrational and overtime and gradual exposure to the things causing anxiety can reduce the body’s response to it to a level similar as the general population.

The other solution is to block the response and in the case of anxiety this is easier than other conditions as normally it can be achieved by blocking adrenaline for which there are drugs with few side effects available. The real problem is that some level of anxiety is perfectly normal in life and required to make good judgements, everyone experiences at some point, the problems occur when it is unduly impacting you life in a negative manner, be that in your job or social life. 

In the case of depression this has been shown, in some cases, to be caused by rumination and effects a large percentage of the population at some point in their life. If rumination is successful it can lead to the resolving of the issue. Problems start to occur when rumination isn't successful and ends up in a negative cycle where you can't solve the problem yourself. This can also be solved by many different therapies that aren't drug related, be it by gaining a new perspective from talking to a friend or therapist or by removing the issue from your day, or even replacing the problem with something else. 

Depression isn't understood at any molecular level so it is very hard to make inhibitors or activators that can target pathways and not have extreme side effects, as they not only don't know what to target, they also don't know what this target does in other circumstances. A lot of time the current treatment of extreme depression is treated by ""neutralising"" the brain, by that I mean you aren't extremely depressed but you also can't be extremely happy, you are just level, no happiness or sadness, but if your body has decided to set your happiness scale between 1-3/10, constantly being on 5/10 is a better thing.

Also peoples happiness level have been found to set at different level naturally, some people are inherently happier than others and this is your base level. Say you win the lottery, for a short time you will be really happy with this lucky streak, but after a while, even in their new house and with plenty of money they will go back down to this base level of happiness whatever that maybe. 

Solving root problems within the brain would have to be done either at a genetic level or epigenetic level, either of these is currently impossible in humans with the current level of technology, even if the targets were known. However, much research is being done in targeting of cells with [retroviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_vector#Gene_therapy) for a variety of genes to insert new genetic information to ""fix"" cells genetics in conditions such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy as well as many other genetic disease. The reason depression is occurring is due to activation/repression of certain genes and how to stop this at the level of DNA is very complex without affecting other pathways, not only in the brain (as it is hard to selectively target therapies) but also throughout the body. There are many ways this could be done, repression could be achieved by [promoter methylation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_methylation), but how to achieve this selectively isn't really understood, a second method could be to use retroviruses as I mentioned earlier to remove the current in-optimal gene allele or promoter and replace it with a better allele, this is possible in other genes but is very hard to successfully achieve consistently and depends on many things such as number of gene copies and level of DNA condensation. 

As you rightly say these conditions are currently treated by medication, which works at protein level rather than at a level before the protein is created such as the transcriptional (which I have already mentioned) or the translational level, the problem is these therapies often affect other pathways as well causing side effects that can't be predicted. It is far easier to blocking it at the level of the protein because each type of protein has a unique shape so if you can find an inhibitor or gain a structure of the protein then you can create an inhibitor and only blocking this one protein rather than affecting many other molecular pathways.

While I try not to be too noticeable when I am touched, or when I hear uneven sounds, I find it necessary to not try to change the way I think when I write papers for college. Instead of trying to force a change, I allow my autism to help with the paper.

A way I look at it is this:

Imagine that people are throwing a baseball and catching it. Now their hands are typical so they throw it normal. Aspies have different hands. They can try to throw and catch the ball like normal people do, but this will be quite painful. Instead they should embrace their different hands and learn the best way to throw and catch with their hands. This can end up making the different hands having the upperhand as it were.","1356999738"

My phone will take a GSM SIM card from any international phone company. I can go to Europe and use it on Vodafone no problem. Please get your information straight before you go calling people braindead. The CDMA versions of the iPhone 4S and 5 have a GSM radio as well. I have full access to GSM roaming with my current SIM card, as it is activated under Sprint. It'll still work on Sprint's network without it though. And Sprint unlocks iPhones for free once they're 3 months old. And mine almost is. So when I go visit relatives in Bulgaria (my home country) this summer, I plan on using my iPhone on Globul BG. And it'll work. Most people in America have no idea what a SIM card is, nor do they care. Luckily, I am not American. I'm not even a US citizen yet.

"howyoudoin","t5_2tqcj","I also grew up with the DVD extended versions. Some episodes only had a couple of lines added, while others added entire scenes. Each DVD episode contains two-to-five minutes of extra footage.

I have mixed feelings about the new set, having gone through only the first season on Blu-ray (after at least a dozen times through the entire ten-season run on DVD). Some episodes don't seem to be missing any noticeable footage, while, say, ""The One with all the Poker"" is missing the great scene where the guys are dancing to ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight."" Scenes like that are jarring in their absence.

From what I've read, the extra footage on the Friends DVDs existed only in stardard-def video only. By contrast, the show was shot on 35mm negative, then edited in video for broadcast (and later archived in 35mm once the broadcast cut was ""frozen""). Thus the HD Blu-Ray versions were simply remastered from these archived broadcast cuts. I'm not sure if the extra 35mm footage was thrown away once a given episode was frozen and archived -- or if the extra scenes exist in 35mm but would have been cost prohibitive to integrate into new masters for Blu-Ray release. If the latter is true and the footage exists in usable form, Warner Brothers decided not to go through the painstaking process of rebuilding each episode to conform to the DVD cuts.

Here's an explanation of the original editing process as told by editor David Helfant (from a Bluray.com forum post):

&gt;Friends, like a majority of sitcoms at the time, was filmed on 35mm negative @ 24fps, then telecined 4x3 to 30fps digital SD video (digibeta, D1, D2? - I can't recall because this varied through the years). It was edited low res on Heavyworks (and later Avid) then onlined from the SD masters for broadcast. Per Warner Bros TV policy, all their filmed sitcoms also had to protect for international distribution or a possible widescreen future by cutting the film negative to match. They wisely knew that a 35mm version afforded them the maximum flexibility for high quality distribution to whatever possible format the future might present. Cameramen were supposed to frame all scenes for 4x3, but protect the edges for 16x9 (which didn't always happen). After locking each episode, we'd send an EDL and the ""Flex"" (*.flx) data files (encoded with the negative's keynumbers) to WB's negative dept for conforming to A-B rolls for archiving.","1356999746"

On a side note, I think Wenger might be trying to turn Ramsey into a false 11. He has the energy to run up and down the side and has the skill and passing ability to make the crosses and cut inside like Nasri did. It also seems to be his best chance of being a starter later down the road with Wilshere taking the 10, the Ox as a box-to-box or CAM, which would leave only the DM/deep-lying spot and Ramsey doesn't fit those spots.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","I just want to say that I sympathize with your situation. It really sounds like you care and are trying. No one is perfect, and no one has a perfect child or dog. You're doing your best. You obviously understand that the dog is stressed, and you don't want him to be miserable, and you don't want your child to be bitten because he's miserable.

I just want to remind you that the fact that your dog is only growling or giving a little snap/nip, is a good sign in terms of the dog managing things. If you've seen a dog really attacking something, you know it looks different. So it means your dog doesn't want to hurt the child, he's really just trying to warn the kid. He's still your dog, he's just getting old, and he's trying to adjust to this rambunctious little person he has to deal with now. 

You can definitely work on treating him when the kid is around, check on his pain levels with the vet, and of course try to supervise, and use some sort of gate or playpen for either the dog or the kid when you can't keep a completely attentive eye on them. But I would absolutely consult a behaviorist. Find the money, somehow, if you need to. From my experience, the details of training aggression-related issues can be tricky, and I wouldn't want to approach it without someone with experience. With any luck, some combination of small changes will make all of you a lot more comfortable. 

Anyway. Good luck. You've given your dog 10 good years, and I hope you can succeed in helping his last few be comfortable and happy. ","1356999758"

Also, we are always, it seems, rubbing the edges of our nails with our fingertips to make sure they are smooth, and this action also makes them even smoother. And I agree with those who say to rub them on your jeans to check for snags. don't be afraid to get a manicure, either. I am very butch, and wear flannel and jeans etc... but a manicure will do wonders for your nails and cuticles.

The way I see it, it's lowering inhibitions that are there for good reasons. If you don't think a person would have sex with you sober, the answer isn't to get them drunk, it's to find someone who *would* have sex with you sober. And I'm not saying that everybody in this situation would agree with my views either, the whole tradition has always seemed pretty messed up and backwards to me is all. I suppose I also had in mind a situation where person A stays sober while getting person B drinks--if they're both drunk that's something else entirely IMO.

Well show us! Prove your point! Don't just make a claim, after all, we don't know you from Muhammad. If what I said is ""a lie"" it should be easy for you to show that. You may start at any time.

Really? You mean the q'uran prohibits slavery? Please cite the verse. Muhammad didn't own slaves? The majority of the world's Muslims can read classical Arabic? Really? You have some statistics on that? Illiteracy isn't high among Muslim countries? Really? Here, I'll show you how it's done:

The world's ten most literate countries are:
Finland 100%

1 Georgia 100%

1 Luxembourg 100%

1 Norway 100%

5 Cuba 99.8

5 Estonia 99.8

7 Barbados 99.7

7 Latvia 99.7

7 Poland 99.7

7 Slovenia 99.7

None of them are Muslim. The world's ten least literate countries are:

168 Guinea-Bissau 39.6

169 Senegal 39.3

170 Gambia 37.8

171 Benin 33.6

172 Sierra Leone 29.6

173 Afghanistan 28.1

174 Chad 25.5

175 Mali 19

176 Niger 14.4

177 Burkina Faso 12.8

[source](http://www.edcal.com/251425.page)

I believe that all of them are predominantly Muslim--correct me if I'm wrong. Thus I have shown that illiteracy is common in Muslim countries, more than in the rest of the world, as I claimed.

&gt;you're just an arrogant idiot.

Ah, the refuge of the person with no argument: insults. As soon as you start insulting the other person, you reveal to all of us that you have lost the argument. Good job.

&gt;Mohammad (PBUH) owned slaves?

Are you joking?

&gt;The major juristic schools of Islam have historically accepted the institution of slavery.[1] Muhammad and those of the Sahabah (companions) who could afford it themselves owned slaves, 
[source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad's_views_on_slavery)


&gt;""the fundamental problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis the morality of slavery is that Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves"" [Rodney Stark]


&gt;The legality of slavery in Islam, together with the example of the Prophet Muhammad, who himself bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves, may explain why slavery persisted until the 19th century in many places
[source](http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml)

Please note that I avoid anti-Islamic propaganda sites, using only neutral authorities. I advise you to do the same if you want credibility.

Would you like a few dozen more? You didn't know that about your prophet? Are you sure you've read the q'uran? Slavery is covered extensively there. Of course, it's never outlawed.

&gt;Prove it, Islam is the first religion on earth to free slave you retard.

Ha ha, where are you getting your information? For centuries, wherever Islam went, slavery followed. Muslims slave traders were famous throughout the world, and traveled all over the world capturing slaves for trade, for centuries.

Can you argue in a civilized way, or are you unable to control yourself? Are your bad manners Islamic?

&gt;Your generalizing and claiming all Muslims are ignorant?

I never said that. Do you have a reading comprehension problem? What I said is that literacy is lower among Muslim than non-Muslims. That's just another uncomfortable fact you need to accept.

&gt;Well it would be a debate if you had much to contribute, all your comments are full of arrogance and lies.

Great! Prove it! Go ahead, produce the neutral, non-Muslim propaganda sources that show I'm full of lies. Start whenever you like. It's fun, and you might learn something.

"dwarffortress","t5_2qyn1","I'm thinking about it and with a selfwritten script, quickfort and gimp you could do most of the work outside DF so you have just to press one button ingame and the whole layout will be done. The main Problem is the size. I tried to divide the pictures in an 7x7p grid, which was to small (needs probably 4x4 or 3x3). The Fortress has a size of 2253x1347p. This results that you would need 322x193 Tiles in DF to map the whole thing ingame. Like said, the 7x7 Resolution feels a bit to small, so you could double the DF Size to 644x386. According to DF Wiki:

&gt;The local view constitutes a 16x16 grid of embark area tiles (each representing 48x48 tiles when you are playing the game) that is within a single region tile.

With 7x7 that means we would need a ~6x5(4,02 :( ) embark. 12x10 if you want to use the smaller grid...

The other Problem is that the map is only from the top 2d view. You don't really know when you have to build ramps or the actual level you're on. 

Oh and it's an annoying job to mark every tile in gimp. But theoretically this could be automated...

This all doesn't take ingame Problems (Sieges, time, food, your computer exploding due to having calculating a 12x10 embark etc) in count...

TL;DR: It's possible to do it, but it takes effort and a great computer...

Edith: This is what it would look like: On the right picture you can get the colour of a tile and look up it's command. f.e. Red =&gt; Dig and create an excel file that can be read by quickfort

"neuroscience","t5_2r3cs","**[High fidelity optogenetic control of individual prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo](http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.2720)**

Abstract: 

Precise spatial and temporal manipulation of neural activity in specific genetically defined cell populations is now possible with the advent of optogenetics. The emerging field of optogenetics consists of a set of naturally-occurring and engineered light-sensitive membrane proteins that are able to activate (e.g., channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2) or silence (e.g., halorhodopsin, NpHR) neural activity. Here we demonstrate the technique and the feasibility of using novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) tools to activate (AAV-CaMKll{\alpha}-ChR2-eYFP) or silence (AAV-CaMKll{\alpha}-eNpHR3.0-eYFP) neural activity of rat prefrontal cortical prelimbic (PL) pyramidal neurons in vivo. In vivo single unit extracellular recording of ChR2-transduced pyramidal neurons showed that delivery of brief (10 ms) blue (473 nm) light-pulse trains up to 20 Hz via a custom fiber optic-coupled recording electrode (optrode) induced spiking with high fidelity at 20 Hz for the duration of recording (up to two hours in some cases). To silence spontaneously active neurons we transduced them with the NpHR construct and administered continuous green (532 nm) light to completely inhibit action potential activity for up to 10 seconds with 100% fidelity in most cases. These versatile photosensitive tools combined with optrode recording methods provide experimental control over activity of genetically defined neurons and can be used to investigate the functional relationship between neural activity and complex cognitive behavior.","1356999775"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","UK one here. Two Sisters Food Group. 

They are the Serco of UK processed food production (Nobody has heard of them but they have their fingers in every pie. Literally.)

Owned/operated by [Ranjit Singh Boparan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranjit_Singh_Boparan) a person i have come to loathe. Like all business men he strives to get as much profit for as little money as possible. He makes profits selling organic high welfare chickens to one supermarket, while selling the lowest grade, most poorly treated chickens to ""basics"" brands and places like KFC, essentially ensuring no matter where you spend your money, it still goes in his pocket.

Not only that, he produces food for many other sources as he has bought out so many other companies - Marks and Spencer sandwiches, Goodfellas pizza, Fox's Biscuits, Harry Ramsden's Fish and Chip Shops just to name a few well known brands. 

His attitude to employee welfare and fair wages is entirely below par. His company makes massive profits (he awarded himself a £12million dividend this year, £11million last year etc) and yet he cuts his workers wages since he can get away with it thanks to the economic downturn. He introduces new and exploitative contracts which compete with pre-existing contracts and eventually hoping to replace all workers with these newer, minimum wage, ""work till finish"" contracts. He discourages union behaviour on all of his sites. 

Also, though not strictly business related, but adds insult to injury when working for a douchebag - His son destroyed a family's life by speeding ridiculously in a Range Rover, paralyzing and severly brain damaging a toddler. Was then caught speeding again 6 months later. Served less than a year. And apparently there was a prolonged battle to recieve any money from the billionaire Boparen family in order to care for the child. [Story here](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-561740/Tycoons-son-left-toddler-brain-damaged-70mph-horror-Range-Rover-crash-jailed-21-months.html)

Source; the factory i work at was taken over by Two Sisters. I (and many others) was almost moved to strike action over his intended wage cuts. We still took a wage cut, though slightly less substantial (but still unacceptable, considering our site made him profits of a few million that year alone.) He has gotten around this by introducing minimum wage ""zero hour"" contracts. (You are contracted to work till finish 12+ hours if necessary, yet if there is nothing to do you can be sent home before having the chance to earn enough to pay your bus fare for the day.)

Furthermore, prices in different countries change. For instance, average rent in the US may be $800 a month, whereas average rent in England is probably like $1200 (in USD) a month (probably way higher). PPP takes into account all of this. Therefore if all costs in England were 1.5x that of USA, then getting paid 45k in England would be the same as 30k in USA (all measured in USD).

**Burial** - *Ashtray Wasp*
- This is by far my favourite track this guy has recorded, I can't even explain it.  It just takes you to a different place.

**Cloud Nothings** - *Wasted Days*
- Epic EPIC song, I'm not usually into this style of music but the end of this song is so cathartic, and cathartic songs are my favourite. 

**The Antlers** - *Endless Ladder*
- This EP was a good follow up to their last album which was amazing.  Just a very chill song.

**Coheed &amp; Cambria** - *Domino*
- When I first heard this single I was very excited for coheed's new album, the old Coheed is back! Unfortunately this is by far the best song on the album.  

**Deftones** - *Tempest*
- Amazing song, amazing album, this band just is sooo consistently good, they haven't put out a bad record. The production quality of their albums is just getting progressively better and better.  

**Frank Ocean** - *Crack Rock* (or Pyramids)
- Pyramids is the obvious choice with this guy and I love that song but Crack Rock really stood out for me on this album.  

**John Frusciante** - *909 Day*
- Very short but emotional and epic song.  

**The Mars Volta** - *The Malkin Jewel*
- This band is just crazy, they are so talented.  The new drummer is almost robotic sounding, I love it.  

Fav Release this year would have to be either: 
**John Frusciante's Letur-Lefr EP**, every song on it is amazing.  Having a harder time getting into his new album though it's abit difficult to digest, or 
**Deftones - Koi No Yokan** Just a solid album, no fillers amazing song writing and production.  the only downside is the album doesn't have one of their signature ""insanely heavily"" tracks on it","1356999785"

Maxes do not render for aircraft until the aircraft are very close.  3 burster maxes, or more, will make it so liberators cannot zepher your infantry.  

&gt;The thing about the Dalton is, as an MBT driver you don't know wtf is hitting you until the second or third shot lands, and even once you figure it out, there's fuck all you can do about it. 

There is not fuck all you can do about it.  Any MBT who takes 1/3rd damage and doesn't move is inexperienced.  An experienced player will begin to move, which makes landing a direct hit with the dalton extremely difficult.  If the dalton liberator is close enough that he can accurately hit you while moving, then the fault lies with your team for not pulling burster maxes, or not having skyguards rolling with your armor column.  (which, by the way, should have sunderers that have burster maxes in them, or a sunderer can deploy and people cna pull burster maxes).  If nobody is pulling anti air and working together, you will lose.  

Air is balanced well.  The only thing not balanced is the exp you get from being a burster max.  The engis supporting you get more exp, yet burster max is probably the most important infantry role.  3-4 burster maxes on the ground, or worse, around 6, will completely deny any air.","1356999798"

Firstly, for a close enough approximation, the only thing that will change the frequency of a pendulum is the length of the string. Mass doesn't have an effect on frequency and starting height will only affect amplitude. 

Since length doesn't vary with time, we can break down the position of any pendulum to be pos = A * cos (wt + p). A is the amplitude (how high), w is the frequency (and is some function of length) and p is a phase shift. So if we give multiple pendulums the same amplitude and start them at the same time, all the positions are just different cos waves. 

What makes this fancy is that the frequencies are picked so that they make a pattern over time. This same effect is shown in this little chart I mocked up, http://i.imgur.com/wLLg7.png , you can see the point where they separate apart from each other, then about a quarter of the way through you have 2 at either end, about halfway through the cycle has met back up and starts over.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I say reveal everything. My parents told me their combined take-home income per month. They called it the available money. Then, when each bill came in, we subtracted it on a piece of notebook paper from the available money. If we bought something, it too got subtracted. A running total was kept. I saw how close we came at the end of the month to hitting zero. Or not.

Excess money went into savings.

This started as soon as I learned how to subtract in school. I never once felt stressed about it. I never wondered how or when I was going to eat. My parents were very good about telling me that my needs would always be met, and I believed them.

On the other hand, when I had a want that wasn't in the budget, my parents would pull out the previous month's notebook paper sheet and point to it and say, ""And where is the money for your Polly Pocket playset going to come from, exactly? Your allowance? Can you think of a way to have as much fun without having to buy the toy?"" And they'd redirect me to other ideas such as sewing new clothes for my already-owned dolls with scrap fabric, having a playdate with a friend with the toy, creating my own set from clay, etc. In other words, creatively resourceful.

At times that my parents either dipped into savings or put something on their credit card and carried a balance (very rare in this last instance), I was included in the discussion and helped list the pros and cons of the thing. In the end, my parents made the decision they made, often overriding me (I voted not to dip into savings for a vacation but we went, anyway) when I was too conservative, but it helped me build up a list of circumstances when, in my adulthood, it would be okay for me to take money out of savings. I learned what savings ""was there for"".

Knowing teens as I do as a high school teacher, and having close to 10 years of experience with 16 year olds, I just want to point out that they either will or won't be distracted from their studies as they so choose. You have no power over that, anymore. (This is a good thing! A stress relieving thing!) This is about the age where they test just how little attention they can give to their academics while maintaining the grades they want. (If I had a nickel for every parent teacher conference that was caused by a student incorrectly judging the minimum amount of academic attention needed ... but then the students always figured it out by the end of the academic year.) I've had students tell me that they think their parents have bad financial skills and of the things they are going to do differently when out on their own. I've had students who tell me that they think their family needs some social services assistance so there will continue to be food. But I have never had students stressed by finances beyond their control and I doubt your sons will be the first.","1356999803"

Seriously, she's awful in bed and doesn't give or receive oral (because... well I haven't gotten a real answer on that so I'm going to assume it's something to do with religion) so it's not like she's sex goddess gracing certain boys with her favor.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The problem is that the notion of what constitutes self-defense varies greatly, and is highly subjective. Every state is different. Every town is different. Every prosecutor and every jury is different. It is a crap shoot. There was a case in Texas where a guy was asked to watch his neighbors house while they were on vacation. He witnessed people robbing their house. He called 911. As he was on the phone with 911, he witnessed two guys running out of the house with their TV. He told the 911 dispatchers this and said he was going to go out and stop them, and you can hear him pumping his shotgun. They told him to stand down. He didn't. He went out and shot one of the guys in the back and killed him as he was running away. He was found not guilty and they ruled this was self defense. In most places in the country, this would not be considered self defense because he was not in immediate danger. In Texas, they considered the fact that he was asked to protect someone else's property as protecting his own, and that constitutes self defense even though he was not in any danger until he ran after them. It was even considered self-defense given the fact that he shot them in the back while they were running away. Again, most places, this would result with you being convicted of murder. In my mind, he was very lucky. ","1356999817"

The failure of gun bans to reduce murder rates, the reduction in murder rates in general in the US as gun laws became less restrictive, and the increase in mass murders where guns are banned, mean you cannot conclusively show that possession of firearms does more harm than good.","1356999819"

As far as the existence of Jesus - it's pretty much agreed upon that he existed by most scholars.
For the lack of discussion of Jesus, you have to remember that the Jewish people rejected him, and he was a leader in the Jewish faith - it would be foolish of them to talk about miracles that were witnessed (they were, in fact witnessed, they conspired to kill him because he healed a man on Sabbath - *The gall he had, to work on Sabbath*).  
Finally, another reason they didn't mention him is because their temple (and with it their traditions) were in dire straits endangered of being completely destroyed.  The focus of writings was to preserve the tradition and Jewish people.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","I'd say it depends on who's around and what you're working toward.
With your knowledge, do you plan on composing or performing?

I'm not much of a composer, but I can help more towards the performance.
Are there local choirs or performance ensembles you can easily join? 

I'd suggest starting there. You probably won't get much straight music theory, but it'll definitely sharpen aural skills and give you more connections. From that ensemble, you can easily find private lessons and other people to jam with.

I suggest taking in as much as you can manage, having both a formal and practical grasp of music helps you connect theoretical ideas to the emotional potency of music.

For myself, I've found all of these programs available at my local community college. I joined the mass choir and the chamber chorus. This introduced me to literature and gave me ears for parts I typically would not have an ear for.

If you're working within the framework of composition, I'd suggest learning informally. Not many colleges provide a composition degree at the lower level. ^1 I'd say start analyzing literature. Pick up the kind of music you want to create. 

-What are the parts of this music that make it profound?
 
-What are the patterns within it?

This kind of analysis help shape the rules of the common practice and you can use this kind of analysis to dictate the creation of you own music. Depending on what kind of music you create, the study of the common practice (aka. Music theory classes at a community college) may or may not help you. I'd say it depends on who you are working with.

If you're working as a formal composer (ie making music for choirs/symphonies/operas/musicals/BGM score) I'd suggest taking formal theory. It'll help develop your vocabulary for formal performance.

If your're working more towards the songwriter standpoint (ie Bandstand, studio, industry), I'd suggest sharpening your performance skills and your own personal analysis of musical literature. 

Keep in mind, these two approaches NOT mutually exclusive and NOT stagnant dogmas. The structure of these approaches were formulated from conversations I've had with other musicians and composers at my school on their start to becoming musicians. These may not work for you. I am a music student at community college rounding out my associate's transfer (AAT) degree. My personal goal is a Bachelor's at a state school, so that should be kept in mind.

Thanks for reading, and good luck! :{D

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Like Facebook not being that old

I'm saying a newborn, born in 2012, looking through this stuff 18 years later. It doesn't matter how old FB is now. And frankly I doubt FB will still be around in 18 more years. But just think about how many albums of pictures would accumulate in 18 (technically over 18 years, assuming they made a FB before 2012). I have over 100 already, and I joined in 2007. I'm not sure if this is the norm, so maybe I'll put it at 10 albums per year. Even assuming the FB wasn't opened until the year the child was born, that's 180 albums (not pictures, albums) to go through. I do not see why someone would be concerned with pictures 18 years old buried in 180 albums. Literally no one would be seeing it unless they went digging for it, so how could it be embarrassing?

Are you really not ever going to share ANY pictures of your children with your friends and family? Ever? Is it just because the internet is new? Because it is more accessible than the physical photo albums your mom or dad treasures? I feel like the internet is our new way to store these treasured memories. You can't lose them in a flood or fire. You can share these wonderful moments with people at a moments notice, hundreds or thousands of miles away.

I mean, my grandmother would show her wallet fold-out (literally like a dozen pictures) of me to ANY stranger without even being prompted. A little embarrassing? Sure. Do I feel disrespected? Absolutely not. I'm flattered she felt the need to share it, that she was so proud of her grandbabies that she'd talk about/show them to anyone willing to listen. FB is the new medium for this.

I'm curious, how young are you? I'm only 23 but I feel completely comfortable with any pictures of me as a kid being on FB. Frankly, I think it is silly to be embarrassed by pictures of yourself as a kid. I find this is something found horrifying for high school kids or younger. Maybe some college kids. Sure, the pictures aren't always great. Untag yourself then.","1356999832"

Even assuming R+L=J is true (which is believe with the entirety of my cold, dead heart), his entire identity is made up of rejecting everything about himself that he did not build. Every time he is given a challenge, or a chance to do something that he feels he 'should' do (running away to fight alongside Robb, for example) something stops him. His friends, or in the most recent case, death.  
These are lessons for Jon. Lessons that I believe will lead him to realise that nothing matters except fighting the coming winter. If he does ever find out that R+L=J is true* it will be his final challenge in this regard, and he will finally refuse it, all by himself.  
IMO, Jon's destiny is to be the Last Hero. To fight the cold alone with just his sword, a few friends (sam pyp and grenn, i suppose) and his dog. and maybe a horse.
  
  
I think Dany is obviously one of the 'three heads'. I think Tyrion is very likely to be one also (too much talk of his dreams of flying lately for him to not be one). The identity of the last one is harder.  
Currently, my money is on Bran, not riding the last dragon, but warging it. So when, and if, we end up with all three dragons facing off against an evil, it will be two dragons with riders, and one dragon alone.

*which I do not think will happen. I think if that theory is ever revealed to be true, it will be courtesy of someone like Bran, and it will have an impact on the absolute bare minimum of characters, because at the end of the day, who you are is not as important as what you do.","1356999834"

"redditdev","t5_2qizd","SNI is [fairly well supported](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#No_support) and in the worst case can be done as ""opt-in"".

I'd very much like to help, either by writing code or designing it (no payment expected, I actually pay reddit gold for some of my other accounts in hope of getting SSL on reddit implemented).

My qualifications:

* I wrote a better fork of [Perspective notary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication#No_support) and run two notaries of my own storing all certificate history for 1.6M sites scanned daily (for about 1-2 years now)
* I wrote a [X.509 parser almost from scratch](https://github.com/hiviah/pyx509) and found out that where various SSL/TLS libraries are not conformant to spec (especially openssl is too permissive, just ask Peter Gutmann). Parser is tested on ~2M real-world certificates from my Perspective notaries (currently 2032096 unique end-entity certs and 10970 CA certs in one notary's DB). I also submitted some security patches to pyasn1.
* I am a co-author of [DANE protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6698) and wrote [a proof-of-concept client implementation for Firefox](https://github.com/hiviah/DanePatrol)
* I wrote the [HTTPS Everywhere rules for Reddit](https://mail1.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere-rules/2012-April/001109.html) which worked fine when user added the CN exception for reddit.com's cert. Also submitted some fixes to HTTPS Everywhere (e.g. [#3533](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3533) and [#3766](https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/3766)).
* I wrote an [automated checker of HTTPS Everywhere rules](https://mail2.eff.org/pipermail/https-everywhere/2012-November/001610.html) that should detect most breakdowns of rules and rule errors (deployment is WIP).
* Found [additional certificates with weak factorable key which were exploitable for code signing](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mozilla.dev.security.policy/cn1sBm2ibWo/Lm3LtFPx__AJ)
* ...there's more, but the point I'm trying to make is that I know rather well what I'm doing

**The offer**: if you want some help with the setup, just write me (either via reddit or by e-mail, it's in the linked mailinglist posts). Put together a list of requirements: on price, on network, what are the limitations of Amazon and Akamai CDN in reddit's case, add some sort of diagram how the CDN is deployed (I have a rough idea how it works, but details would help). 

I'm not promising miracles, just that a reasonably-priced and hopefully not-a-PITA solution exists :-)

**Epigenetic inheritance of a cocaine-resistance phenotype**

http://www.filedropper.com/nn3280

We delineated a heritable phenotype resulting from the self-administration of cocaine in rats. We observed delayed acquisition and reduced maintenance of cocaine self-administration in male, but not female, offspring of sires that self-administered cocaine. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf) mRNA and BDNF protein were increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and there was an increased association of acetylated histone H3 with Bdnf promoters in only the male offspring of cocaine-experienced sires. Administration of a BDNF receptor antagonist (the TrkB receptor antagonist ANA-12) reversed the diminished cocaine self-administration in male cocaine-sired rats. In addition, the association of acetylated histone H3 with Bdnf promoters was increased in the sperm of sires that self-administered cocaine. Collectively, these findings indicate that voluntary paternal ingestion of cocaine results in epigenetic reprogramming of the germline, having profound effects on mPFC gene expression and resistance to cocaine reinforcement in male offspring.","1356999853"

Either way, you can learn a hell of a lot with a scope or irons. I really recommend if you want to go with irons, to use tech-sights. The peep sights really, make a huge difference, at least to me.

The sling is also critical. Everything that they're going to teach you involves the sling, and it'll make you a much better shooter if you use it. I took a friend of mine with me down there, and she went from barely breaking 100 on the evening of the first day, using a borrowed rifle without a sling, to shooting a 196 the second day, after switching to one of my rifles that had a sling on it.

&gt;In argument there's something called 'argumentum ad absurdum' and it involves taking the principle being espoused by someone and taking it to its most extreme conclusion to point out why it's a bad principle.
In this case, the principle is 'as long as someone has good intentions, let's not judge them' - and yes, Hitler had good intentions. He intended to give Germans their rightful place in the world, to rid them of an evil imposed on them from the non-human Jews. now you or I might consider that fucked up and evil, but the point is that he had positive intentions and thought he was doing the right thing.

The projects are REASONABLE, just start them right away. The specs are pretty straight-forward. Allocate a LOT of time for Project 3, it is far and away one of the biggest/most complex projects you'll do for the next few years, and its hard to wrap your head around. Draw ""class diagrams"" (i.e. how things interact, even if they aren't true classes), it'll help.

Things you can do right NOW:

- Teach yourself pointers and pointer syntax in C++. There are posts in /r/learnprogramming, /r/programming, and even /r/uofm about this.

- Get REAL acquainted with the term ""abstraction"". Some people call it black-boxing. All it really means is the concept of wrapping up blocks of code into some kind of package that is **well-defined** and **works**. If part of the code doesn't work, then that black-box is broken and you know to fix that one. It's a LOT easier than looking over WALLS OF CODE and trying to find the ONE offending line.
You **will** be using this.

- Learn the BASICS of Object Oriented Programming. Learn what the ""pillars"" MEAN, and how they translate to C++ (Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation).

That made my night.

&gt; he is very defensive about that situation and that one only

One thing that could be going on here is he could be ashamed of how all this happened.  You reminding him of it is making him more ashamed.  Him working on it may make him more ashamed so he would rather not.  He thinks ignorance is bliss and if he just ignores it it's not so bad.  

&gt; I thought I was out of line but recently a conversation with a coworker made me see it is more that some stupid feeling of betrayal that he'd create a situation that might adversely affect his future wife/family with someone he doesn't give two craps about.

If you were just a girlfriend you may be out of line.  Once you start talking about marriage things are different.  The decisions he makes and actions he takes directly impact you.  It's not even a matter of specific things it's his attitude in general.  If he's impulsive now he'll be impulsive when you get married.  Nothing changes just because you get married.  

If he's a good hard working guy and this is the only thing he drags his feet on I would say you don't have a lot to worry about.  If that's the case he's dragging his feet because he's ashamed.  You think he learned from it and that's the important thing.  If you guys are 30 now and this happened three years ago then he made a stupid decision as a 27 year old guy.  I'm 28 and I feel I have a much better than average handle on finances for someone my age I'm sure there's something stupid I've done in some area of my life in the past year.  ","1356999870"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I totally understand.  My 25 year old daughter told me recently, after a break up, ""dad, I don't think I can be monogamous"", and, yeah, I understand...

A few weeks later, the guy she was seeing says, ""me and nobody else on the side, or no me""

She picked him because she likes him, but she's leaving for Europe in a month and told him she's fucking around, so he can do what he wants.

I like the idea do being honest, but not everyone can deal with honesty.


As to the 12-step, yeah, when I trashed and burned my last marriage, I went to SA for 6 months.  No masturbation, no sex, no porn, I even avoided R-rated movies.  

It was a good cleansing.  I wouldn't do it again, but I'm glad I did it and I've had to really think about whether I want to get into another committed relationship.

I love marriage, I love being in a committed relationship, but, fuck, sometimes, like you said, the thrill, the newness, the fun, etc,, 

Plus I like to fall in love.  I think I like falling in love more than just the new sex.  Actually, I know this.  

Anyway, I wasn't suggesting you needed a 12-step, just pointing out that they exist, mostly men attend, because sometimes men can't stop the dangerous obsession with sex, prostitutes, porn, and they have wives and children, etc.  I saw a lot of heart break there, men that couldn't stop with the porn addiction and had wives that were done with them.

Don't listen to the haters, they aren't in your shoes, but you do have to decide if you want to be honest with the husband, and you have to consider there is always risk, even if you are careful, of unwanted consequences, ..

Kind of the decision the OP is facing, what the fuck do you do, at least he's thinking it out first.  My marriage failed because by the time I went for some help with talking it out, I'd already crossed a line, and when she found out, ""there's the door, asshole""....","1356999873"

"esports","t5_2r08k","I think CS:GO could certainly have more competitive players than either game. At one point, it had more than probably any competitive FPS game combined, of any time frame. CS between 04-07 was massively huge, walking into any LAN center, you would see countless people scrimming, inhousing, pugging... A lot of people will blame the CGS and what not, but if you really pay attention to the time frames and the trends, games like WoW killed dealt a vicious blow to competitive CS. To this day, I don't think anyone can comprehend how many of the upper crust of Pro CS were spending their time playing WoW instead of playing CS.

Prior to WoW, something that made the competition so epic was that most CS players were not just playing CS during official team practices. Teams would either scrim all night or break off into small groups and pug or pug with friends. That died with the mainstreaming of MMO games. I have first hand experience and accounts from very close friends of players having to be screamed at to get off of WoW to just deal with the official practice, which they would half ass, biding their time until they could get back on WoW.

I think the problem with FPS games being spectator friendly is a presentation thing. You could approach a team FPS game with a much sportier take on it, and I think it could be made a lot better for the casual audiences.

There has to be a very perfect balance of first person camera angles and third person or location shots. To appropriately film a competitive match of CS for the enjoyment of both casual and hardcore players, you would probably need something like 10-12 in-game cameras or camera men. Maybe even more. You need first person views getting captured for on the fly 'zoom-ins', but you would need frenetic, moving camera action in 3rd person around the battles, as well as map overview shots.

It's technically very hard to do but if they ever did it right, it could look like one of CoD's epic commercials, with the integrity of a competitive match at the heart. ","1356999875"

I hate to inconveniounce someone becuase it's me with the cancer and not them. Why should they suffer.
 I don't do the medical pot thing because I hate to spend my life not aware of the time passing by. Pot does that to me. I do have some pain from surgery and radiation damage. I do as little of the pain meds as I can for the same reason as above but also because the more you use it, the less effective it becomes.

"gay","t5_2qhef","THIS. This is good advice. 
Here's why: Sexuality is a spectrum. As in the [Kinsey Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinsey_scale). Society uses the terms Gay, Straight, Bisexual, etc. for convenience largely. You shouldn't feel compelled to identify with any of these arbitrary categories. Live life true to yourself, and go from there. 

...and while I don't have a convenient Wikipedia article to back this up, I firmly believe that love is individual, and happens regardless of the gender / orientation of the people involved. Truly LOVING someone means just that. You care about THEM, not their gender, sexuality, or anything else. Again, there is no need to use society's categories. If you really care about this guy, tell him. Talk through it. I can't guarantee it'll be easy, but it's worth it. 

I definitely understand how you are feeling, though. It's tough. I wondered about my sexuality for many, many years, before finally coming out at 21. I was scared about how my friends and family would react, and I was scared about how I would fit into society. Needless to say, I went about it in the wrong way. Live your life, and love who you want. Don't let your fear of what might happen ""if you're gay,"" get in the way of your happiness. 

Also, feel free to message if you need to talk / need advice. All the best!

The addition of level specific challenges and the ever present bonuses for not killing anyone or setting off alarms means I'll be trying to perfect level runs for a while.

* Spec Ops: The Line

I had a fair bit of this spoiled for me because I didn't think I'd play it.  That didn't matter. They made a great game as far as the impact on the player is concerned.  The deconstruction was well done and got me thinking. I think I'll be taking the third option to all the decision moments in the game from now on, which 'stop playing'.","1356999886"

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","I don't think anyone wants to see Chamakh or Gervinho starting, and Ox's place will be in midfield before too long.  That leaves Podolski, who is not suited to playing as a single striker (or at least hasn't shown his ability to with us yet), Walcott, who I'm still not convinced is ready to be a full time striker, and think he's far more useful to us on the wing), and Giroud.  Walcott and Giroud are both excellent at taking chances, but I think we could use someone who's better at creating them for himself.  Like a Luis Suarez, except someone who's not such a cunt.

I don't think we need another defender intended to be a starter, the amount of money we'd need to drop for someone better than Gibbs could be better used elsewhere.  I wouldn't argue with some better cover for him though, even if I do like Santos, I think we could do better.

If we aren't keeping Walcott I think replacing him should be our top priority.  If he's not leaving in January, I think a strong DM would be our biggest need.  It'd allow us to be more physical in the midfield for those games where our opponents are pressuring us hard, and would free up Arteta/Wilshere to move forward more freely.","1356999889"

"animation","t5_2qlmp","**Always start with a brief** for what the character should portray (cute, funny, serious?).

I tend to pick a theme for the character to build around. The theme would depend on what the character's role is in the story, or their personality. For example I had a character who was flying into space so I tried to give her bird-like characteristics. Her outfit had ""wings"" = long sleeves that joined to the rest of the dress diagonally (if that makes sense?). She also had long hair like she had a tail. Something like long hair also makes it easy to show how they're moving, so it was useful for more dynamic/action type images. 

If you have some kind of a theme or core inspiration it's much easier to think of ideas because you've narrowed down what you can take inspiration from. If you don't want your character too ""cartoony"" then just use the theme as a starting point that you can then bring back to a more subtle design. It's good to start out crazy and interesting, in my opinion. 

**Draw heaps of ideas!** Everything you think of! Fill up pages of different versions, aim for a really high amount so you have to really force yourself to keep going (50?). Then sleep on it, and pick the one you think is strongest once you have a fresh mind. Then develop that one more! Also consider the silhouette once you've started deciding on the design. A strong silhouette makes the character more recognisable (and show in your book that you have considered the silhouette and why). 

If you're stuck on the process start looking up early concept art for characters you like, often the artist will have little notes about why there are certain features. If you're able to find a lot of their early concepts then you can see how they work.

I'm still a student myself but that's how I work, and I never seem to get stuck (not yet anyway). I hope it helps a little","1356999892"

Yeah, ESFs and Libs will dominate infantry and armor if they aren't opposed, that's kind of the point.  

Also, keep in mind you shouldn't really be able to solo an enemy vehicle most of the time.  One HA shouldn't pose a massive threat to a Magrider unless they can get behind it.  However, multiple HAs working together can easily take one out.  Coordinate with your teammates.

Look at it this way: when you want to run Windows Server on VMWare, do you buy a license for every OSE on the entire server, or just the Windows Server VMs?

What about for XenServer? Do you license every OSE on the box or just the ones for which you want to run Windows Server 2012 (or previous versions)?

You can and should have a cover letter.  Since it’s a career fair setting, employers will know it’s nearly impossible for you to customize a cover letter and résumé for every single company at the fair.  Instead, take a look at the companies who are coming.  What jobs do they have posted right now that you’re interested in or qualified to perform?  How do they phrase things?  What key words do they use?  Make a short list of the companies you know you want to approach at the fair and see if you can at least customize a cover letter for that company.  To paraphrase what it might say: “Dear Hiring Manager, I want to work at (company x) because of ___.  I understand ___ is a priority for you and I’ve demonstrated success in that area through my ___.  Please read more on my résumé…”

If you’re looking to work in corporate accounting, there’s no shortage of accounting jobs available right now nationwide.  Just pull up a few postings at related companies even if they’re geographically far from you.  The requirements from a company in a similar field will likely be related to the companies you’ll find locally.  Then use key words from a variety of postings that are all related and explain why you’re qualified using !@#$%, the Signs of a Great Résumé.

As for your research, did it help you develop a skill you’ll use in accounting?  How about data analysis?  Trend reporting?  Metrics?  Identifying efficiencies?  Finding savings?  Use the job postings again as your guide for the parts of your research that will be most relevant to an accounting role.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes!! Both instances happened when I was 16 years old.

#1 - I was walking through an underground tunnel that connected two train stations, beneath a large city, late at night... a bit after midnight. I was wearing tall high heeled boots, tights, a large sweatshirt worn as a dress, and a scarf. I was wearing nice makeup with a nice hairstyle. This man came up to me and asked if we could be friends. I said no. Then he asked that, if we spent some time together that evening, could be be friends. I said no, again. Then he tried to pull me aside into a dark nook near the tunnel. I struggled away from him, and kept walking. That was really freaky, and maybe he was just planning on straight-up sexually assaulting me, who knows.

The second instance was funny:

I was walking through the same tunnel mentioned above, wearing a similar outfit, same time of the night, etc. A young Asian man approached me and said ""can I be with you tonight?"" I was confused and was like ""Sorry dude, my parents don't let me have people sleep over, especially not strangers...."" then he said ""no, can I *be* with you tonight? I have enough money."" I was shocked and told him I wasn't a hooker, then walked away really fast.

In hindsight, I should have asked what ""enough money"" was. Not that I would have done it... just curious to know what price was put on me, lol! ","1356999902"

* Where do you get that which trials had anything to do with atheists? I can find no data on this, just assertions.

* [nobody was burned at the stake in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_burning)

* [atheists are not bared from holding public office](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torcaso_v._Watkins)

**We atheists are not the most hated demographic in the US.**

A couple of suggestions: 

* Empty out your house and donate it to goodwill. Deduct all of your donations

* Increase your contributions to non-taxable things like your 401(k) retirement plan to reduce what can be taxed

* Refinance your home and start your mortgage over again. You'll be able to deduct all of your mortgage interrest, and the earlier in a loan you are, the more interest you pay and the more you can deduct.

There are other ways to duck and weave which are perfectly legal. Play with a tool like turbo tax or see an accountant now for suggestions. ","1356999904"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have faith but I'm not religious. I don't go to church and I don't pray every night. I was raised in a Catholic household but grew away from that at a young age. 

I agree. Religion has been the root of many atrocities (well, man's actions due to religion... guns don't kill people, people kill people kind of thing) and I also do agree that without this concept of organized ""there can only be one"" religion, the world would probably be better off. 

But I also believe that with religion comes faith (duh), and I think that there's a difference between being religious (to the point of extremity)  and having faith. I know a lot of very good people who have strong faith. These are some of the best people I know and they've told me about their lives or I've listened to their testimonies and it was made very clear that without their faith, they would be very different people. Drug addicted, sex addicted, alcoholic, violent, etc. Heck, there was a point in my life where I had stronger faith than I do now but was also in a depressed state. Call it corny, but I credit the level of faith that I had then that prevented me from doing really stupid things. 

Basically, my opinion is that there are good people who rely on their faith to make it through the day. Faith is a spawn of religion and unfortunately, the whole package includes extremists. There's no changing the fact that before scientific evidence, the predominant thing was religion and believing what the Bible or other religious texts taught you. With this in mind, one can put aside the ""wishing that religion never existed"" and make do with what's already happened.

Sorry if that's all kind of scrambled. I've gotten very little sleep but I'd be happy to elaborate more on my opinion if you really wanted it.

Edit: I also want to make it clear that I'm not implying that the only good people are faithful people. I probably know more really good non-faithful people than I do faithful. Just for clarification. ","1356999913"

And I never said arm everyone either. Thats not how the gun laws work. You have to be approved for sale by the NICS. Some states like mine even require a redundant standing background check permit with your local chief of police. 99.58% of all legally owned firearms are used for their appropriate purpose (sport,recreation,defense) and 90% of all guns in a crime were acquired unlawfully (stolen).

We can't destroy all guns or the means to produce them, that is impossible because someone would find a way to make them in their basement *(See Sten Gun)* . So the only alternative to allowing arms to be used by the sane, law-abiding public is total disarmament which is an impossibility.","1356999923"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The Hebrew word translated to serpent in Genesis is *nahash* which appears in other books. Isiah talks about a *nahash* which is a sea dragon, a leviathan. Job also uses *nahash* to talk about sea monsters. That's the image you see in Revelation 11:19-12:8:

&gt; And a great portent appeared in heaven, a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; she was with child and she cried out in her pangs of birth, in anguish for delivery. And another portent appeared in heaven; behold, **a great red dragon**, with seven heads and ten horns, and seven diadems upon his heads. His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth; she brought forth a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne,  and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which to be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon; and the dragon and his angels fought, but they were defeated and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.

Adam and Eve were not faced with a small garden snake. They were attacked by a dragon. It was Adam's responsibility to guard the garden and his wife:

Genesis 2:15

&gt; The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and **keep it.**

But Adam was scared if he and Eve didn't do what the serpent said he would suffer and die:

Hebrews 2:14-15
&gt; Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and deliver **all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.**

He was there the whole time the serpent was talking to Eve but said nothing. It doesn't translate but the *you* the serpent uses is like *you all* or *y'all*. It's second person plural. He's talking to both of them but only Eve is speaking back. Adam isn't protecting the garden or his wife. He left her hanging, lets her make the bad decision, and tries to give her the blame. 

But this is immediately followed by the first proclamation of the gospel:

Genesis 3:15

&gt;  I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.

The ""you"" is the serpent, the devil. The woman is Mary and the emnity between the devil and Mary is a reference to the immaculate conception. Her seed is Jesus. The devil will bruise his heel as Jesus crushes him under his feet with his crucifixion and resurrection.

Revelation 12:9-17:

&gt; And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world--he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, ""Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brethren has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God. And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. Rejoice then, O heaven and you that dwell therein! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"" And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male child. But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time. The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with the flood. But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon had poured from his mouth. Then the dragon was angry with the woman, and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and bear testimony to Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea.

A couple years ago, my friend, Jose, who I knew for 3 days, invited me to his family's summer trip to Florida; this was right at the time of the BP spill. Having nothing better to do, I accepted the offer.

Third or fourth day there, Jose's parents brought us to some seafood/ bar and grille on the beach. Shortly after arriving, and learning of Jose's 3rd degree some-fucking-color-belt, it started raining. And being the rebellious teenagers we were, we decided to leave the actual building, and stand under this rickety, wooden stage the bar lets local bands play on.

Drunk guy braves the rain to come talk to us, REEKING of bad tequila, and mumbles something about being our age, missing out, all that good stuff. The guy was too drunk to notice when we weren't paying attention. Eventually, Jose's little brother came up to us...

the drunk man starts...messing with Jose's little brother: specifically, trying to take the kid's clothes off to get him to run around naked(HIS WORDS)((more or less)). Jose tells his brother to leave as soon as the man gets his hands under the little man's shirt, and calmly tells the drunk man ""I'm not accusing you of anything, but if you put your hands on me or my brother again, I will bust your face open.""

Well, the drunk guy took that threat as a joke, and immediately put his arm around Jose's shoulders. Jose, true to his word, flipped this guy over his shoulder. The drunk landed dead on the top part of his skull with a nice mix of a thunk and a snap, effectively cracking his skull.

Now, I expected shit to go down at this point. However, a cheer came from the bar, another man came out to collect the injured party, and he asked us with a heavy sigh ""what did he do this time?""

That's it. No problems, no cops, nothing. It was an interesting day.","1356999936"

Then he gets to respond with 'I'm sorry for not paying attention, just wait until Valentine's Day' or 'I think it's a waste of money to buy something that's just going to die in a few days' or 'I have a secret phobia of flowers' or whatever. And then you know what the actual issue is. If he just responds with 'sorry', press him for why. 

Other than that, this is about all you can do short of begging. Eight months isn't a very long time investment, though, and if you need more attention and romance in a relationship, this might be a sign to move on.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I spent several months last year living in a neighborhood that was being terrorized by a series of stabbings (all inconclusively linked to a single perpetrator.) The victims were nearly all women who were walking alone after dark and at the time I didn't have a vehicle, was new to the area, and *had* to walk home nearly every day in the dark because it was winter in the pacific northwest and sunset was at 4 pm.

Needless to say I really wished I knew how to fight. 

I took some self-defense classes that heavily focused on reading cues to dangerous situations and some maneuvers if someone brought a knife into an altercation (turns out I'm pretty boss at disarming someone) since that was the main problem in the town at the time.

..I think the most disheartening thing about it (and what scared me the most) is that in reality, if I was to get attacked by a fairly fit man, there's little I'll be able to do about it. I'm 5'4"" and in moderate shape (not terrible but I definitely don't have a lot of muscle), but I'm unlikely to be able to overpower them, put enough power into a surprise attack to get away, and if I did get away (and they were intent on a chase) I wouldn't be able to outrun them.

That's terrifying.

Self-defense for women is almost all about not getting into the situation in the first place, which has always put me very on edge (and frankly probably contributes to the over cautiousness of many women when it comes to interaction with strange men.)","1356999944"

"amateurradio","t5_2qi86","Nice find.  First thing is to be gentle with it, it has tubes inside and although they're not ridiculously fragile, they're a bit more easily banged around and broken than modern equipment.

I wouldn't remove any of the stickers and stuff on the outside. My opinion is that stuff like that adds character.  I'm really not a fan of the ""strip everything down and spraypaint it"" school of old equipment refinishing.  Particularly since yours has some family history!

Are you in the UK with access to 240V mains to test it?  If not, it looks like it's switchable to 110V mains, although of course you'd need to swap off the UK plug.

If it's really not working and it's not something trivial like the power supply voltage or connector making it impossible to use, then you definitely need to get a service manual.  Generally they will have troubleshooting guides and tell you particular points to check voltages at, to see if various parts are fried (at least, the better service manuals do...).  I would probably not bother to pull out and test all the tubes (which carries some risk of breaking them) until you go through the basic diagnostics, and of course just take the case off and visually inspect everything.

"KarmaCourt","t5_2v788","That is why I said ""A reasonable amount of down votes."" I do not want us to be labeled a down voting brigade, But I don't want these people to get away with getting Karma for Lies. Most people found guilty in the Karma Court are guilty of more then one offense. (meaning there is a lot of evidence against them.) The biggest reason for a repeat offender is KARMA, they want it, and people are more then willing to give it. Karma is what they thrive on, you can tag them, you can call them out a thousand times, you can fake sentence them to 20 years in spacedicks, as long as they get that karma they don't give a shit, (excuse language). Now If the offender has the fear in them that ""hey, if I do this shady shit I'm prob going to get more down votes then up votes"" then odds are they will think twice about posting/lying. I don't know about you, but if I see someone is guilty...their ass is getting a few down votes from me. 

RES tags are good for personal use, since you tag them only you can see it, so other people will not know of their past discretion's. It's a great reminder for when you see them post you can think harder on if they deserve a up vote or not. But in the end..Down voting (reasonable down voting) is the only way to hit them where it hurts. ","1356999952"

3) I consider myself an experienced investor (not that it means much since i don't think I've ever outperformed all 3 indexes)

4) Conviction and sticking with the original plan.  Actively trade when my initial goal was to trade the stock, and not turn it into a buy and hold stock... and not turn buy and hold sticks into trading stocks.  Stay the f* away from trading options.. fun and i'm probably up a bit overall, but should have walked away with more of my early gains (this was only a very very small portion of my portfolio &lt;1% and was to be honest, was more akin to gambling)

5) Goals for 2013: consolidate positions (36 positions currently, way too much to keep track of), maintain relatively low beta, moderate increase in equity exposure (via indexing), have a larger portion of gains come from capital gains vs. dividends (most of my 2012 gains were from dividends)","1356999957"

In fact, she told my husband she didn't want to even be there at the hospital after I give birth, so she planned a vacation for months in a far away state. Oh, but she did make plans within those plans to see my nephew's school performance next year, just long enough to see him about 8 miles away and then travel again.","1356999964"

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Nope. 

1. ""Run"" is simply a keyphrase in Doctor Who. It encapsulates perfectly that the show is about intellect and wit. Not about charging the issue head on and trying to outbrawl them. 

2. Pond was incidentally the right word, yes. But how would ""children"" or ""nightmares"" have captured the danger? They wouldn't. Pond, on the other hand, is enigmatic. Why would someone choose pond as a word to describe simultaneously danger and a motivator? It's precisely because of that, that Clara chose that word. Because she knew it would intrigue the Doctor. It doesn't matter that she didn't know about the additional effect.

3. If there was a way for River to exist outside the Library then who figured it out? Who made it happen? And more importantly, why? Who would have the skill, knowledge and motivation to do this? Only the Doctor and River would have. And given that one is trapped inside the system and the other apparently doesn't think there is a way, then I really have to say that this is definitely the weakest point.

4. The Doctor got kissed, he didn't initiate. Admittedly he didn't really try much to stop it, but hey, it's still an important distinction. The Doctor already flirted with Clara in the Asylum. Clara is simply a flirtatious person, that much is clear.

ILLEGAL AS SHIT. It doesn't actually save lives. It destorys them. A mother who had ONE glass of wine doesn't have $20,000 to fight the charge. And will probably lose her job and maybe her children. These are the kind of people they are arresting. Its the wealthiest repeat offenders that get off, that kill someone. But in reality and in context of all accident put together, its not the rampant problem that lobbyist claim it to be. Its just another BUSINESS.","1356999977"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I'm not sure what you mean by ""fuzzy math.""  Kahn makes assumptions before he begins his calculations; but every financial analysis starts out with assumptions about the market.  

As to your point about appreciation:  Historically inflation on the dollar has paced actual appreciation in value which is a big part of the reason why housing market bubbles exist.  The public generally holds the misinformed belief that because the dollar sign amount goes up, the value has gone up, but that just hasn't been the case throughout this past century or so.

Ultimately though, Kahn is not arguing that *you should* rent.  He's merely showing you how he came to make an intelligent choice in his market, at the time he was faced with the choice.  Plug in your own numbers based on real values *you've* seen and do the same mathematical operations he does; you'll have a pretty good idea of the cost of renting versus buying.  His math, taking his assumptions about the market as true, is quite precise.  There are of course other factors to consider if you want a more accurate read on which choice is better, but these are the basics.  And those other lessons in the sidebar go even further into detail, bringing up the very points you bring up..

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I haven't read more than bits in the original, but by accounts of Hegel's own contemporaries (and I think in his own later rueful admission), yes it was turgid. He was praised for the clarity of his lectures, by contrast. They are also far easier to read than the books originally written for publication.

The difficulty comes from Hegel's own insistence on being absolutely thorough in his phrasing and terminology from the beginning--he wouldn't settle for a book that said things approximately-but-innaccurately, for clarity, at the beginning. They had to be perfect philosophy through-and-through. Incidentally, he started doing things this way a little before the Phenomenology; some of his earlier published essays have a clarity comparable to his lectures.

Incidentally, part of the difficulty in English, so I've heard, comes from Hegel's resistance to using existing philosophical jargon, and trying to express himself in the vernacular, even as he tried to transform the meanings of ordinary words. (Still, strange vernacular, hard to believe.) Uh, I'm told that in this respect his works were much more readable to a German of 200 years ago, turgidity aside. (I think Heidegger's attempt to eschew fixed jargon and appropriate natural language is something similar to what I understand Hegel to have been doing.)

Good:

* Wonderful battery life, noiseless, light.
* SSD is very fast
* Great value, blows x86 out of the water IMO in what you get for your money
* Great for developing, fast enough for me to run a local django dev server
* Great for browsing, casual usage
* Installation is just a script you run
* Compared to other ARM ""laptops"" it's wonderful. Everything else is just too locked down. EEE pad transformer should be awesome but too much of a pain to get Linux working in my experience. Surface, ipad, etc can't run Linux at all
* Easy to dual boot chromeos if you want, which is needed for graphics acceleration
* You'll be super trendy being the 0.00001% of people running traditional GNU/Linux on ARM

Bad:

* No graphics acceleration, so no games and even compiz is a stretch
* Proprietary software probably doesn't support ARM Linux if you need it (flash)
* Open source stuff has a huge advantage in terms of ARM since you can recompile everything. But that doesn't mean it's easy to do or practical. Check your favorite apps first.
* Be prepared to spend some time making it all nice, fixing sound, etc. ChrUbuntu ARM is alpha
* Touchpad is usable but annoyingly touchy, on part with most buttonless trackpads in Linux.","1356999998"

added: i didn't answer your question. I didn't bring EXTRA as in, more than I need. Me, my bf, and our friend went in on food that was NOT covered in the communal meals. I.e. lunch food, etc. We WILL run out of food if my friend keeps eating it. 

It's not a big deal until you spend over $200 and your friend, who you already had to beg to offer a lower deal for renting the house, is not only taking your food but demanding it. 

It's not ""vacation costs"". It's EXTRA costs, as in, I might as well be paying for two grown kids that I don't have. That shit is extremely expensive. Again, this isn't just a once in a while ""Can I have a cracker? a sandwich?"" This is them wanting all food for all meals.","1357000003"

Of course, it's weird to say you're not accelerating, when you clearly are relative to the ground. But from your point of view, it's more natural to say that free fall is zero acceleration, and terminal velocity is acceleration equal to 1g, like we feel on the ground.

2) Okay.  So in this situation, the female is controlling the incidence of homosexuality.  Can they not perceive, and therefore react to, population density?

3) It was just a weak example to show to the nonscientists that effects based on environment can occur.  You agree that homosexuality has an epigenetic basis, so why can my theory not be true?  

4) Sure, the kin selection theory would assist the propagation of homosexuality throughout time; however, there's no clause in that theory that suggests that incidences can't be increased.  

The fact of the matter is, we have not yet pinpointed the cause of homosexuality.  Ergo, theories like mine are still feasible.  And from the biological perspective, my theory isn't really that radical.  Wow, sensory information influencing the evolution of a species, what a revolutionary idea!

"austrian_economics","t5_2stjd","I would also like to add that using the economic effects of dragons in middle earth to justify the need for a central bank in our world would makes about as much sense as saying that we use gillyweed instead of scuba suites because that's what harry potter did. 

The reason the dwarves didn't rebuild, besides the fact that the choice to wage for lonely hill brought about more destruction, is that it would have made for a very uninteresting story. Imagine it went like this: After Smaug the dragon had claimed all the gold, the dwarves fled to the forests where they abandoned mining and instead switched to lumber production. Because of there loss of gold as a currency they switched to iron, which was first a commodity to make axes. Within ten years the Dwarves had began rebuilding their nation in the forest, supplying middle earth with the highest quality lumber at the lowest prices, which, in turn, brought great prosperity to middle earth...ect...everyone lives happily ever after and they never bothered with Smaug again...the end..

As you can see, the causal relationships that exist in our world need not exists in a fictional world. And, since economics should chiefly concern itself with actual causes and tangible good and services (no fictions, like models) then we shouldn't have to defend against this sort of argument. except to say that we reject fiction for reality.

We are in a thread about NYE where, in most cases, we aren't talking about having a glass of wine/beer with dinner over the course of an hour and driving home. Driving out to the bar and having ""1"" drink and planning on driving home is a different beast. Like I said, it is very easy for that 1 drink, to turn into 2, into 3, etc.

[Taxi in Gunnison](http://alpineexpressshuttle.com/services.php). ""Local Transit Service Alpine Express offers Local Transit Service within the Towns of Crested Butte, Mt Crested Butte, and Gunnison. 24 Hour advance reservations requested""

I did nothing of the sort... I ""attacked"" him for having a ""Plan A"" that consisted of drinking, then driving home. That said, AAA is a good last resort, terrible Plan B.

Alcohol of the same type, yep. Hell look up the legal requirements for Wild Turkey to be called Bourbon. It has to be bottled at 80+ proof to legally be called a Bourbon. They all have specific requirements. How in the hell do you think they define different liquors? Based on how they are feeling that day?

""Beer"" is an extremely broad term, just like ""Liquor"" and ""Whiskey"". You are comparing a Stout to a Pilsner, which is like comparing a Everclear to Rumchata.

No offense but I think you're homering a bit here. The announcing team was just effusive in their praise of Jim Haslett's scheme over and over through the course of the game (I promise you the only reason I even know that Haslett is the Redskins DC is because the announcers were draped all over his nuts last night).

And there's a potentially vast difference between ""we had to play our backups because the starters are injured"" (which as you mention, pretty much everyone has to cope with) and ""screw it, we'll just send our injured WR out to play because he's the *least* injured"". Elite defense or not, having to go with WR #4, 5, and injured #2 when you're having to pass to win is at least something to note.","1357000032"

"mcpublic","t5_2s52h","My opinion:

Spawn, I liked the spawn for last rev more. It was a cool looking starting area and it had the upper/lower section feel to it. Just don't have a walkway that gives people heart attacks while walking on it.


Ores, keep them plumped. I liked not having to constantly worry about mining for ores for armor and tools and being able to focus on projects. 


Modded terrain, I didn't really like the modded terrain because it made getting across the map pretty annoying. I'd always constantly come across a huge overhang that you had to go way out of your way to get around or be walking and all of a sudden I'm at a cliff floating way above the ground below and would be a lethal fall if I just jumped. 


Portals, keep portals at specific cords but also a couple random portals also out there.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","There's a world of difference between being a skilled liar and a compulsive one. Even the fact that he's deceptive in general doesn't mean that he'll lie all the time and about everything. He'd conceal the knowledge that's in his interest to conceal, and he'll not deliberately mislead his allies and friends unless the benefits of doing that would heavily outweigh the consequences of being caught.

Another thing to think about is the fact that a skilled liar probably tells the truth about 90% of the time even if it's not the whole truth. A key element to his success in deceiving people is that he's gained their trust by appearing open and honest.

To answer your actual question, you'd have a real problem with the meta-knowledge side of things. Your fellow players would know immediately that your character's lying if you have to roll any dice at all. If you tell them that you plan on deceiving them then they'll know you mean to deceive them and just mistrust everything your character says.

That said, our group tends to prefer playing characters who are slightly dirty (in two decades we've never had a single paladin!) and so the way we've handled it is just to take for granted that characters are probably going to lie. Any information you can pass to the DM in a note without being caught by the other players remains secret and is never mentioned. No rolls or anything... the perception check is replaced by the real life perception of the folks sitting around the table. Some players actually hand the DM blank notes from time to time just to keep the other players on their toes!","1357000036"

#3: When I grab a questionable part of a woman that I am rolling with, I ignore it and keep rolling. This has the simultaneous effect of generating plausible deniability (so we can both save face) and allowing me to (hopefully) keep my position and not get swept/submitted.

Most of the people on this subreddit are fairly introverted according to their own affidavits. As an extrovert, I have absolutely no problem with going into a crowd of people and interacting with them no matter the size. But introversion level aside, the descriptions of these 16 traits fit most people. I will tell you this: most descriptions of ENTP have me nodding my head in agreement with 99% of sentences. 

You mentioned your teacher reading a generic MBTI profile to everyone in your class and everyone agreeing with it–they should have. I can look at *every* Myers-Briggs profile and identify with most of the stuff in each of them. However, if you give me the opportunity to read *all* of them and pick the one that *best* fits me, I would pick ENTP anyway. How do I know this? Because I have already done it. I read them all and still identified most strongly with ENTP. Is MBTI be-all-end-all? No. Should it be discounted as you suggest, though? Absolutely not. It is and has always been a tool. Most people use it as such and are better people for it even when their flaws persist. ","1357000037"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So, okay. My parents got divorced when I was nine years old. I've basically always known my father had another child, making that child my half-sister. I'm 17 currently. I met my half-sister who we shall call Susan about 3 months ago out of the blue. She sent me an email while I was in Tokyo and simply asked if we had the same father. We started to hang out a bit (she's nearly double my age) and one day we were having coffee. The subject of our father comes up. She said he'd done some *things* in his past. I became very curious, because I never really thought my father did anything ""that bad"" other than drinking too much. Turns out that my (our) father did cocaine, smoked pot, and did other hard drugs before I was born. Susan told me he'd been an alcoholic her whole life as well as my whole life (I finally figured it out at about age 12). She said they were estranged for a long time (and still are, somewhat) and he paid for about half of her college education as part of a divorce agreement with her mother. Weird.

The owner of his company had a house nicer than ours, but not extravagant, and a few miles down the road.  He belonged to a slightly more prestigious country club.

Eggs
Wheat breed/based cereals (I amuse you can see eat it because you didn't list it?)
Milk (s)
Fruit/fruit juice
Fried meats

Now the healthiness of all those things are much debated, but honestly, don't over do anything and you should be just fine. I mean, still worth looking into if you wanna, but I'd just see keep track of how they effect how *you* feel and go from there. Health freaks also like to have protein shakes/smoothies for breakfast and they're good, quick and easy. A protein powder with some fruit and a milk.

The shadows are a bit too sharp I feel for my tastes, I'd soften them up a bit. I can't say I like the almost letterboxing effect you have going currently, I'd zoom in farther and have the Scout's back closer to the camera. It looks awkward the way the desk is blocking the Scout's lower half, adjusting the camera will fix that.

While the lighting work is nice, the technique is a bit lacking. There should be a light coming from behind the Scout, this will help with how his back is getting lost to the shadows.

The Spy could be doing something with his resting hand. Either holding an intel case or simply holding it in a fist would be better than having it being held limply behind him.","1357000046"

"Firearms","t5_2ryez","Been doing this since I heard about the bans. got one response from a rep it said... ""thank you for voicing your opinion"".... here's my letter I stole from a redditor.

As a proud citizen of the United States and the State of Iowa, I want to voice my concern over what constitutes ""meaningful action"" in the wake of the Connecticut school massacre.
In the weeks ahead, as the effort to create policy intended to keep us safer is embarked upon, I implore you to also consider our past policies and the oft-overlooked consequences of laws which provide a false sense of security that subtly undermine the rights of the American people.
There has been speculation that a renewal of the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban would be entertained as an option of ""meaningful action"". We cannot ignore the studies performed by the CDC[1], the Department of Justice National Institute of Justice[2], or the University of Pennsylvania[3] that were unable to prove the laws enacted over the 10-year period did anything to help curb gun violence. Some of these studies even suggest that a reimplementation would produce little to no measurable reduction in violent crime. To re-enact similar laws that have no meaningful benefit to society shows at best a disregard of empirical evidence and a tendency to implement knee-jerk legislation, and at worst a desire to dictate what your constituents do or do not ""need"", regardless of concrete evidence that the item at hand is a clear and present danger to society.
As a nation, we must be absolute in our resolve to strictly define the circumstances under which our rights can be restricted. Our litmus test for the First Amendment was adopted by the US Supreme Court in 1969 and is known as ""imminent lawless action"". This gives the State the ability to restrict an individual’s First Amendment rights if failing to do so would produce imminent lawless action.
The data that would support the notion that a new Assault Weapons Ban or further gun control measures would circumvent an ""imminent lawless action"" simply does not exist. In fact, data showing the opposite effect, that more restrictive gun control laws make it easier for law-abiding citizens to become victims of violent crimes, is available in abundance.

Money has value--the importance or preciousness of something.  Our beliefs might change the value of an item but an item still has value even if it is reliant upon the subjective--our beliefs.

To answer OPs question, I believe that nothing good would come of it. Look at certain countries in Africa, that's what I think would happen. Money was invented for a reason and by removing said invention, you just step back a few decades.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I'm pretty much running your build (PvE), I'm only different in few things (which are mainly because I rarely ever feel the need of using wells) that I think you left out of the guide as viable options:

* I have 20 in Spite for *Signet Mastery* and *Spiteful Removal*. The reason is, mostly the 20% condition duration for maximizing damage. The major traits are just chosen for convenience: the signet recharge is obvious, it's good with *Signet of Undead* and *Plague Signet*, the removal is just chosen because I found nothing better.

* In Curses, I have chosen *Weakening Shroud* over *Master of Corruptions*. The reason is that I just love the free second *Enfeebling Blood* (~14s internal unshown cooldown) and it's the only thing that I usually switch into *Death Shroud* for. Also I'm not a fan of the recharge, I never noticed the difference with *Epidemic* or *Blood is Power*.

* I only took Greater Marks in Death Magic

* I only took Dagger Mastery in Blood Magic

My build is pretty much less defensive but I've always gotten away with it and never felt the need of wells (except in the Imbued Shaman fight).

Also you forgot something about *Well of Corruption*'s uses: it's much better than *Corrupt Boon* when the enemy has only a few boons that will be applied again automatically anyway (Shaman in lava fractal, dredge boss in fractals, hotw bosses).","1357000075"

While many people across the country may pose a majority opinion the state system prevents sweeping changes. The only way you'll see a disarmed America is with complete removal of heavy pro gun states and we know that is a silly scenario. 

I'm not even against guns in America, I'm fairly gun neutral, my only stance is that I don't believe in semi-automatic weapons or carrying a concealed weapon however that is a completely different debate. ","1357000079"

Classical instruments are made to different sizes to accommodate different sized players. Why guitarists shit on smaller sized guitars I will never know. Wait, that's right, they do it because their cock would shrink if they were caught dead playing a 22"" scale length. 

Yes, shorter scale guitars sound fine. The Baby Taylor and Little Martin are both great guitars. Do they sound like fuckin' dreadnoughts? Hell no. Who cares? Does a fuckin' nylon string sound like a steel string? No. Why? Because they're DIFFERENT. 

You have to consider the ergonomics of the instrument. I blame the majority of wrist issues that I have on my early playing days when a 12 string dreadnought was the only thing I had to play. For years I've struggled with pain, then I started buying shorter scale guitars and hey... now that I have guitars that fit my frame I'm actually able to play better and for longer. Who'd have thought?

So yes, fit the instrument to the player. Anything else is garbage perpetrated by dimwits.","1357000085"

Volume isn't to bad once they finish the high speed ""takeoff"" routine finishes during POST. The 2811 is a little louder than the 2821 because it has smaller fans (although the 2821 has a bad fan that is starting to grind a little). They pretty much sit at idle since I don't really put much traffic through them...the fans hardly spin up. I only use them for practice...they only run when I'm down there working. The volume isn't obnoxious.

I couldn't deal with the flaws in packet tracer creating doubt in my configuration, so I bought these off ebay a little at a time (2811 with 3 T1 cards ~$250, 2821 ~$250, and (3) 2950s approx ~$35/ea...all prices with shpping)

I figures it would be a good idea to stick with more modern stuff esp since in plan on doing CCNP. That is one reason I liked the T1 cards. I figured that I'll likely see that more than any other serial interfaces these days (although I familiarized myself with all of it). I also like the fact that I can make cables to length on my own (although it toom some time to find the correct pinout of those T1 loopback or xover cables...if that's even the correct terminology)

I'm planning on getting another 2811 as I really need 3 routers (or a 2821 if I can get a good deal) as well as one somewhat modern L3 switch. I'll also be builing a nice wood rack with rails at that point...gotta stay as cheap, yet modern, as possible I personally feel.","1357000099"

TL;DR: A Christian, Czechoslovakian girl witnesses the rise of Nazism, and becomes enthralled with Nazi values. She discards her Christian upbringing, falls in love with a fellow Nazi, and becomes a hard-working citizen. When the empire falls, the girl is taken to a Russian labor camp where she witnesses several fellow inmates get raped. She escapes, heads west, and eventually finds herself in the company of gum-chewing Americans, who treat her with a lot more respect and compassion. She meets up with her love, who convinces her to accept Christianity back into her life, on the promise that God can help them. The two move to America, start a family, and learn about American freedom and consumerism. By the end Hansi, now a fully grown woman, is proudly telling groups of misguided hippies about how fortunate they are to be living in a Christian society where the values of freedom and kindness are so prevalent.","1357000099"

If you are still obsessed with this idea, talk to one of your friends you respect and trust (maybe even your best friend and his wife) and let them know how you feel and ask them what you should do.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It was cold. I remember that because it was unusually so in the spring. The days had just started getting longer and twilight washed in at 6. Regardless of the chilly air I simply wore a white t-shirt and jeans.

 I was looking for a tending job in the city, I needed a bit of cash to pay for school and that seemed like the right way to do it. I spy the bar I was looking for and park on the next block over. I spotted an alleyway nearby and cut down it.

 I was about halfway down it when I heard the scrape of gravel coming from behind me, it sound like someone was in a hurry, so I moved aside and turned around and I felt sudden cold across my chest, and I looked down to watch a knife tear through my chest, and I just reacted. I grabbed his had on his wayward downward stroke and twisted his wrist until I felt his bone snap and kicked him as hard as I could between his legs. I drew the knife out of his hand and plunged it into his bicep where it slid in, snug in its new home, and he began to scream; I then attempted correct that by reaching behind his head and slamming his face into my knee over, and over again until he slumped and I had to hold him up. 

I threw him off me and assessed what I had done. There was a lot of blood, but he would live, he was breathing, and I made a snap decision to leave this whole mess behind. I attempted to yank out the knife, being sure to step on his broken wrist as a did so, and this elicited a soft moan from my friendly neighborhood larrikin. It didn't quite come out the first pull, nor the second, and finally I heaved and it came out all at once. 

 I ran back to my van temporarily stopped my bleeding with my med kit and started home, shaking from all the adrenaline.  Half way home I pulled over to vomit I did so and dug a hole, taking the shovel from my go-bag, and dropped the knife and my ruined tattered shirt in the hole. I quickly changed out my bandage, which didn't look like it would last for very long. I needed medical care but couldn't risk going to the hospital.

I arrived home and grabbed everything I would need and heated up an iron rod to just below red hot. I got a pair of pliers and pressed the wound closed as much as possible. I stuck a belt in my mouth and went to press the iron to close the flesh in the shallow hole that appeared across my chest. I missed. I let out a muffled yell and bit down hard on the belt. 

I heated up the rod again and yelled out as it made a hissing kiss with my chest. I did this about 4 or 5 times until it stopped bleeding. I put everything away and a combination from adrenaline and shock had me asleep in minutes. 

I went to hospital the next day and said I burned myself while cooking. I received a burn cream for it, and it healed up. This is probably one of the dumbest things I ever did. ","1357000111"

Though many may not like it, minaj is being featured on pepsi commercials, beyonce on make up ads. Hip hop, r&amp;b, and rap are the prevailing cultural winds. Part of the reason big rock acts aren't hot is because maybe a lot of youth don't want to start up rock bands.

A kid today is probably going to want to emulate current successes like eminem, nelly, lil wayne, jay z, and so forth. Heck, even bieber was discovered by usher,  that means that 15-18 year olds today are thinking ""I wanna be discovered by what's his face, better throw some rhymes on youtube"".

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","Your friend comes to you, shows you this, and tells you how it makes them feel. It makes them feel sad, lonely, insignificant, melancholy. You notice that the animated gif is, in fact, devoid of all color, mirroring the monotony you feel from reading it. The opposite of ""sonder"" is ""wonder"", and you point this out to them. ""Are you an ant?"" you ask, as you put the backs of your hands on your head, sticking your index and middle fingers out to mimic antennae and swaying your head to and fro. Your friend, for a split second, breaks their dejected look. ""No...but sometimes I feel like one"".

And, because this is your friend, you just talk. At no point do you say, ""you are not a face in the crowd, you are my friend, and I value you, you are a part of me and I am a part of you"" because you don't have to. Eventually this real feeling shines its light not in a conscious way, but through the subconscious. You aren't trying to make your friend feel any way in particular, because empathizing means you forget about your feelings for a little while and float into the experience of another. If your friend is truly depressed, then you should be careful, because the force of their personality may be too strong for you, and it may drag you down too. Such is the risk of friendship.

Weathering these emotions, tasting them, you become wiser. Compassion, empathy, and loving kindness, the names we give to a sort of sub-conscious glow that is older than language. Listen, let them give you an understanding into their feelings, and then switch, allow your friend to gain an understanding into your feelings. A depressed friend may be closed off in this way, and may not be able to crawl out, but give them a chance. Lower down a strong rope into their pit, and let them know ""when you are ready to leave, grab hold fast, and I will pull you up.""

Some friends, upon emerging the pit, promptly jump back in. Sometimes you just have to sigh, take a deep breath, and leave them there for a while. If life were really as easy as a Reddit comment, don't you think it would be a little boring?

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","&gt;But Connellan was not interacting with videotapes, Connellan was interacting with the babies. It was her face, in fact, that they were responding to. If she subconsciously made eye contact more intensely with babies she knew were female, or induced more motion in the mobile with babies she knew were male, that would cause differences in eye-gaze time, which would later be measured by these ""independent judges"" ... The damage was already done.

I actually thought of this same objection while driving home, and I think it is an apt one. It's unfortunate.

&gt;This is like arguing ""in order to check for pneumonia, we can't ethically vivisect the patient and check the lungs for fluid, so using a dowsing rod is the next best thing."" That's not a good argument if there's plenty of reason to distrust whether a dowsing rod tells you anything useful at all. And Fine devotes several chapters and numerous citations to what's wrong with the fetal testosterone hypothesis--not only the methods used to measure it, but the studies that suggest it has any influence on cognition or behavior.

Unfortunately I'm not well versed in FT and amniotic fluid vs brain studies, so I guess I will say that for me the jury is still out on that one until I look into it further. I take the meaning of your argument, but I will have to look further into it to see if it is a dowsing rod or a real technique like an X-ray.

&gt;Only a very small portion of Fine's book was focused on Dr. Baron-Cohen's work, but the entirety of his rebuttal is focused on that narrow slice.

Which makes sense since it is probably the work he is familiar with. A larger point could be that if she does a poor job of criticizing his work then her other criticisms are suspect. That having been said at least for her first criticism there is some validity to it. 

Even so, I guess I would just be surprised if the observer effect has a large impact with newborns, but it is certainly possible. The study should be re-done, either with strong controls for sex identification (is this possible, can people tell the sex of a newborn just by their face?) or with a digital image of a face instead of a persons face.

Edit: I am also curious as to whether Dr. Fine addresses things like the prevalence of left handedness that Dr. Baron-Cohen brings up. ","1357000130"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","As I think about this more, I appreciate that it is causing me to view the creation story a little more deeply.  I had never considered Eden so symbolically before.  I have a hard time letting go of the literal interpretation of Eden, that those events did happen that way.  But maybe it is both literal and allegorical?  Like how Israelites smeared the blood of the lamb on their doors so that death would Passover them.  That is both a literal historical story, as well as an allegorical prophecy of the role Christ would play.
Maybe the serpent crawling on his belly is allegory for satan being thrust down to earth from heaven.  Maybe the two trees in Eden do represent different heritages?
But I still have hard time swallowing the idea that the serpent was directly responsible for the birth of nations.  Maybe he meddled, sure...but fathered?
Anyway, I'm hoping someone who has studied this topic in more detail can lend some insight.  I also feel I owe theriverrat an apology for coming down so hard on him/her.","1357000130"

i'm also trying a lot of flat land butter type stuff, never did that before so it's all new to me.

when it comes to rails and boxes, i just do simple ride on ones for the most part. i try to do more and more difficult ones, but the boxes and rails i see are either really easy or really difficult.

and the last thing i'm trying to do this season is 180 off a big table, or possibly 360, the only reason why i don't wanna spin a 3 is because every time i've tried i start tilting off axis. so i'm gonna try to get 180's down so i can do them easily.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; And it all still wouldn't meet the $8 trillion in new unfunded SS and Medicare promises this country incurs each year.

Because the only reason Social Security and Medicare show up as ""unfunded in that reckoning is because both are intended to be paid *over time*, and they both have specific funding sources separate from the general fund to pay for it.  The total $86.8 trillion liability your article cites is, for instance, the sum of the total amount of Social Security benefits to be paid out over the lifetime of everyone currently living and eligible for them.  Divide that over the average life expectancy and you end up with around $750 billion per year over the next 85 years.  That sounds like a lot until you consider that the Social Security tax alone brings in more than that each year.

Sure, things will get tight when the baby boomers are fully retired and the population is top-heavy, but that's what Social Security's been putting its surplus into the Trust Fund for.   It's just that Reagan employed a concept called ""fund accounting"" to allow the rest of the government to loot the Social Security Trust Fund, so it's the *rest* of the government that put Social Security into a dangerous situation.   *Social Security* itself would not have run out of money -- it's just that the rest of the government will when Social Security starts wanting some of the money that was borrowed from it by the Defense Department (et al.) back.","1357000141"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Try 7 wonders. The entire deck is dealt creating a 7 card hand (deck size changes with number of players). A card is played each turn then the remaining cards are passed. Since the entire deck is dealt and the cards are shared there is minimal luck involved. However, the optimal strategy changes based on your opponents are doing. Furthermore the game is asymmetric as each player represents a city which has unique properties. 

You trade resources and go to war with your neighbors (left and right opponents). The only way you can impact players who are not your neighbors is through indirect interaction. Selling resources is mandatory, but selling a resource does not limit your ability to use the resources.

The game ends in about 30 minutes regardless of the number of players because turns are simultaneous.","1357000142"

I've been getting so many mixed messages on commuting, some say it's such a hassle and it doesn't let you get involved as much as you can, while others don't mind it at all and even prefer it.  Hence my third question, as people have been telling me it's ""difficult but you get used to it"",  so maybe I should of asked ""what's so hard about commuting?"".

Considering you were in poly sci, what kind of clubs, organizations, etc do you recommend as a poly sci student?  I really want to get involved as much as I can as I never really got involved in high school.  Also, I noticed on the Poly Sci faculty website there's a big list of internships, is it possible to get involved in internships in first year?

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","Typically when you do something like this, you put the relay between Vcc and the drain of the MOSFET and ground the source, like this:
http://imgur.com/nk3KZ

You also need to put the diode in like shown to prevent the relay coil from killing the MOSFET with back-emf.

In this configuration, the MOSFET will turn on when 3.3V is applied to the gate, putting its drain to ground, and energizing the relay coil.  If you have a normally-open relay, this will close the switch circuit.  If this isn't the behavior you want, either choose a normally-closed relay or apply 0V to turn on the relay and 3.3V to turn it off.

As far as choosing a transistor goes, you will need what is called a logic level MOSFET.  First google result for ""logic level fet"" points to the IRLZ44N.  Maximum drain current of 47A with a maximum gate threshold voltage of 2V.  It is probably overkill for your application, but it'd certainly work.","1357000143"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","As a sailor, I am not in support of the LCS program.


It represents the single greatest waste of funding in relation to the kinds of mission packages that it provides to the Navy as opposed to what has been available for decades. Contractors I've talked while going through INSURV (the single largest inspection a ship goes through, once each five years) that have spent extensive time on the new LCSs and with their systems have hated it--it's a platform that isn't reliant on her crew but on contractors. Contractors are responsible for most of their maintenance and repair. In short, her sailors are systems operators. 


More than that, LCSs have quite a limited range, as their speed is both their greatest strength and weakness, as it consumes massive amounts of fuel in short time.


Another purported advantage of the program is the ability to support ""mission modules."" These are hull sections that are inter-exchangeable. In other words, while drydocked a LCS can swap out for an anti-mine module, for example. Those close to the program, however, are confident that the LCSs will be designated a certain role and then a homeport, rendering this advantage all but moot.


The LCS program is fun to think about, but brings little substantial value to our Navy. If people are interested, I could answer some questions based on the knowledge I've gathered about it thus far. ","1357000165"

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Don't be put off by sticker shock, ladies. The numbers don't matter; all that matters is that it fits and flatters and doesn't hurt.

Years back, I very seldom bought new bras, as bra-buying was frustrating and expensive, and poverty has been my middle name most of my life. So I wore the same shapeless, nearly useless bras for years, and I don't even remember how I put up with that for so long. I knew that I had some back and shoulder pain, knew I didn't fit into the bras at Lane Bryant very well, knew that nowhere else on the planet seemed to have bras in my size. I figured my boobs and the rest of my person were unmanageably large.

Then, a busty friend recommended I get fitted at Nordstrom. My boyfriend, who had a better job than me, bankrolled my first visit. I got measured by the fabulous professionals at Nordstrom's of Stonebriar in Frisco, TX, and suddenly, my size 42DDD (US) was a 38G/H (UK, now my preferred sizing). My eyes were opened. After calling my sister aghast with my new size, I started to acclimate to my new bra almost right away, and it was like a light switch was flipped. I felt awesome.

As I gained and lost weight over the last several years, I went from a 38G/H to a 36H/I to my present-day 34G/GG. Once upon a time, my dream was to someday fit into a Victoria's Secret bra. Since being properly sized, I don't ever see that happening, no matter how much weight I lose. But that's OK, because the bras I have picked up from other retailers have been beautiful and well worth the prices in the pain they have prevented and aided.

I had frozen shoulder that was so debilitating, I went to physical therapy and couldn't wear bras with straps for most of 2011. Regaining the use of my shoulder and the ability to wear bras has been freeing. The right bra makes all the difference with how clothes fit, how my shoulder heals and feels, and how awesome I feel.

The only thing that does kind of suck is the price of bras in my range. I lost 30 pounds in a few months this year following a diet prescribed by my doctor, and I had to go buy all new bras thanks to back pain from too-loose bands. Thank goodness for internet sales.","1357000171"

"wow","t5_2qio8","My suggestion would be to have a skull macro made, and on an easy to reach shortcut. Mark A mob in each pack you pull and pay special attention to that one. It will make it easier to deal with whiners, and give a sense of where the biggest threat from the dps will come from... Or to be used as a failsafe when someone pulls aggro ""you didn't dps skull"".  It gives breathing room, and you want that when learning to pull and tank.

I can't speak for slowmotionjones but that is one thing I tend to dislike about flairs. 

All in all, I like that you can provide your flair. I think it can add a lot to threads. I also can understand why someone would not want theirs shown and why it would be annoying to hear ""flair up"" after every post","1357000183"

What share of total government revenue of income tax does the top 10% pay? ~70% from what I can gather.. Not sure how we can honestly say they need to pay more. 

Having said that, the typical CEO pay structure in America is insane, and for the life of me I can't see how that is justified from a shareholders perspective. Other than, most of the companies are tight with the government, and thus have guaranteed contracts, and ""big brother"" in the corner should things get messy. In this case, government provides that which we hate. Remove that ""in"" with government, and I have to assume that those looking to invest will deal with just the operations of the business, and not its connection, which will give a impetus for the board of directors to scale back the insanity.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","Well, depending on your scenario, I imagine difficulty (here's some of them). The issue is that you probably need to have either a well-established lab (for benchwork research) or access to a specific clinic with specific equipment/patients (for clinical research). If you're having to do this remotely from the Carribbean, these difficulties that may arise. Additionally, say you just want to do some case reviews, now you're going to go through the IRB (if you're writing the proposal) in addition to all the hospital-specific requirements. Some hospitals may not allow you to remotely access patient data, especially from outside the US. Laws, requirements, and you're location are all hiccups in your plan of research.

I think there are two options for yourself:

* Apply to some of the countless programs designated for medical students. These are 4,8, 12 week programs (typically between year 1/2) where you'll get paid, and possibly end up getting published.

* During your 4th year/electives, try to hook-up with your residency of choice. Jump on research projects, getting everything that you can get done in time for your interview.","1357000186"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Call PoE what you want, but its crafting system is nigh on amazing. 

Blizzard got one thing right: Crafting should not be easy. The chances of getting something amazing are extremely slim *and I am okay with that*.

The issue is that, unlike PoE or many other games, there is no versatility to the system. I can't even begin to summarize how complex PoE's crafting system is. You have a mix of RNG, resource devotion and time devotion, meaning that getting the BiS gear isn't 100% about winning the lottery ONE time, while 100% of everything else you do is useless (D3 crafting).

Here is the entire D3 crafting system:

- Buy recipe on AH for 20k gold
- Buy materials on AH for 5000 gold
- Press craft button
- Attain garbage
- ???
- Anything but profit

Where is the fun? Where is the slow and gradual optimization of gear? My near perfect gloves should be able to become better than perfect after I devote hundreds of hours to them, eliminating the RNG aspect from small stat increases.

Let us build and optimize gear over time, and let those optimizations be account bound (so when the item is traded, it's how it was before crafting).

Then, let us create what is essentially our OWN Legendary items via crafting mats. Mats that drop from monsters. Mats that are not sold on the AH. Mats that can become a new currency...

The director wanted a broadway play, not a film. They are not equal. There is no program to follow, no stage you're tethered to. But that damn director still treated it that way.

There were so many great opportunities for fantastic exposition, all of them were miserably missed. Songs were cut - not playful diddies, but important storytelling songs, like Do You Hear the people Sing. The character who played Enjorlas did fantastic, but you'd never know, because his INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT role was truncated to damn near nothing.

In this case, the key assumption that turned out to be important to check was that image files were the things being served to the browser -- they were actually rewritten to be routed through the timthumb script.

For the interview, be sure you’re following some of the same advice I’ve given about résumés.  Be specific.  Explain your experience using !@#$%.  Study the job posting beforehand.  Understand what the posting indicates are the most important qualifications and have a clear plan for how you’ll articulate why you’re well-qualified.
The best advice is to practice interviewing.  Get a friend, colleague, mentor or teacher to do a mock interview with you.  Record this mock interview, on video if possible.  Then watch yourself.  See how you answer questions, how you look when you respond and ask yourself whether you’d hire you.  If the answer is “maybe” or “probably not,” learn from your observations and adjust as necessary.  You can do it.  If you’ve got the qualifications to get you in the door for an interview, you just need to refine your in-person presentation of what makes you a great candidate.

I hope you’ve found the tips I’ve responded will help you in creating a résumé that speaks for itself.  I offer personal one-on-one reviews through my web site.

Between the cell wall and a large store of water in the cell, it keeps the cell rigid, so when you're eating plant cells, they feel crunchy.

Think of cooked spinach. The heat breaks down the cell walls, and the spinach leaves become floppy and kind of gooey. Think of lettuce. When you get it fresh, it has a stronger crunch. That's because it has a lot of water to support it. When it's been in the fridge a few weeks and dried out some, it flops over really easily, and we call it ""wilted"". Old lettuce and cooked spinach are the difference between having a cell wall but not enough water, and between not having a cell wall at all.","1357000211"

Fast forward 7 or so years and I finally manage to talk to him again. We caught up on the good times and played RS together. He did notice how rich I was and I give him 25m for being a good friend and helping me out over the years. A week later, I noticed he started to act somewhat strange. He kept asking if I was getting off early (in which I told him I was going to). The next morning my 500m bank was cleaned. Used the cc info that used to be on my account and cleaned me. I was shocked that I lost a good friend. How greedy you can become over pixels.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I agree 100% with just not being a dick but I feel like I need to play some devils advocate here. I want to start by saying I don't think this applies to ranked because I feel when you decide to start a ranked game you make an agreement to play at your best and do whats best for your team and for victory above all else. Sadly I'm not offering much of a solution rather trying to elaborate on the problem. Let's talk Normal/draft for a moment I don't know about you all but I personally use N/D because I'm practicing a new champ and there is only so much you can learn from bot games and normal blind or I want to play a game and play well but don't want to invest my entirety to the game (had a few drinks, expecting an important call at a random time etc.) I think a big problem is when you start a game and you want to play a certain champ either to practice or you know...have fun with a video game and you are neither first pick nor able to call the lane you want first several games in a row which last about 45 min. you get unbelievably frustrated. I've had those days where I really want to play this new champ I got and after a game or two where my team just wouldn't allow it and after those games I call AND have the pick priority but 3-4 games drop then I lose it the following game I just ask myself ""why am I playing a game where I have to actively have less fun?"" I have gone a whole day without being able to play the champ that I WANT to play and then just didn't play LoL the next day because of the exhaustion of trying to actually play. I don't think it is always as simple as ""don't play if you don't know how to do every role!!!"" I'm very good at almost every role but when you smash on someone 6 games in a row as adc you want to mix it up and see if you can do it elsewhere in case you ever NEED to. Don't just hammer someone down because they are weak in a specific lane, try and help them out and offer to give them some pointers so they can get better after all isn't lane adaptability what you want from your teamates? I'm not at all trying to justify trolls or auto locks but I'm trying to clarify that this is probably a good deal of the problem and not so much just some kid that gets shit on at school or at home so has to make people feel bad behind the safety of the internet though I'm sure it is the case some of the time. I guess all I'm saying is it's a two way street and you need be willing to give what you expect to receive be generous and optimistic in champion select, TALK to the people you will be spending the next hour of you life with and at least TRY to be excellent to each other. Riot will never take a definitive position on which is greater pick order or calling so let's all just try and communicate a little more and reach some common ground as a wise man once said, ""we're living in a society! We're supposed to act in a civilized way!!!"" I have a tendency to ramble so I will leave you with this....Hey hey hey, smoke weed everyday.","1357000214"

"listentous","t5_2sqe4","Not the album version, but a radio performance he did. I like this version a little better. His pads aren't as obvious, however, so [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2_ziDb6tOo) is the original album version if one would like to hear it. I am posting the performance because I think what Stetson is doing becomes that much more appreciable if one sees it. [He says](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWMmJuTjkO8#t=8m28s) that miking only part of an instrument is biased, which is why he uses contact mics on his sax in order to pick up the pads as well (a decision I guess I subvert by picking this over the album version :P). In a way, he wants to emphasize the physicality of his performance as well as the sound of it. He mics the horn, he mics the pads, he even mics his throat. At multiple points of this interview, he suggests that the best way to take in his music is by being right there in front of him. The implication is that the aural aspect of his performance is only as important as the visual, physical, etc. It is quite the effort to scream ""I am here!"" to the listener.

I do not think, however, that ""I"" means Stetson himself, but the performance. He also states in his interview that one of the most remarkable things he learned from his time with Tom Waits is to remove one's self from art and to deliberately engage in a sort of ego death. The thing claiming its thingness is the performance itself. By also demanding that the listener be right in front of it, Stetson (the performance?) demands that that listening also experience an ego death. Listening to the record engages in the biases that he wishes to abolish, but it also implicates the listeners own biases about jazz, a term that he does not want to associate his music with because it brings into conversation a larger history that Stetson does not feel should compare. More importantly, it ignores the performance, *what is right in front of the listener.* Bringing in an understanding of jazz may offer an excuse for the listener to not participate in the visceral aspects of the performance beyond its aural virtues, though the sound is certainly contained in and important to that visceral experience. In short, ""Judges"" seems like an attempt to proclaim the ""thingness"" of the performance and, subsequently, as an object demanding intimate reflection on the listener's part. This song really deserves the label ""unique.""

Mine extended into college where I was allowed to take zero-interest loans, one time per expense, for unanticipated expenses. My latest head-shaming loan from the Bank of [Last Name] was when I'd just purchased a house and they sent the property tax bill and, though I'd saved, I hadn't saved *that much*. Got me out of the bind at the time, allowed me to learn the lesson about how much more I should be saving, and never had to borrow again.

In other words, I could borrow and repay for the first property tax bill I'd ever received, but the following year if I needed to borrow for my property tax bill, again, I'd be told to take my needs to a proper bank because my consistent failure to budget was not what Bank of [Last Name] was for.","1357000234"

There's certainly degrees of this of course. It can absolutely be malicious, like disguising the strength of a drink, or drugs of course.

I personally suggest min.us for a quick file share, but there are lots of options including the usual Flickr/500px/other dedicated photographer site.

Also, quick note, you may notice that I'm going to submit an image and other mods might as well.  I swear we're not cheating and we're not eligible for prizes -- we just like to participate in the fun as well :)

Network connections open, download data, then close. This is why you need a session ID, because your connection is closed after you send the username and password. 

You create a connection to send the authentication credentials, and receive your session ID. Then you make a new connection for accessing your server's API. The server engineers should tell you the parameters to pass to access the data you need, i.e. http://www.yoursite.com/api?sessionid=123&amp;params=asdf

"ronpaul","t5_2qh0r","&gt; Which gives all the power to the corporations because if you're for never taxing someone so that someone may be on welfare for a bit when they hit hard times, and the only way to earn anything is to earn money or beg, then the corporations set the wages as low as they can and everyone works because there are no other options.

Firstly, 

&gt; Socialism, like the ancient ideas from which it springs, confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all. We disapprove of state education. Then the socialists say that we are opposed to any education. We object to a state religion. Then the socialists say that we want no religion at all. We object to a state-enforced equality. Then they say that we are against equality. And so on, and so on. It is as if the socialists were to accuse us of not wanting persons to eat because we do not want the state to raise grain. -Frédéric Bastiat

Taxation for govt provided welfare is NOT the only option to work. There are many options including, but not limited to, private charities and religious organizations, which were the primary assistance for the poor prior to govt assimilating that role.

Secondly, remember that businesses compete for workers too. True, in today's market, companies can be more picky than workers, but that isn't always the case and also doesn't justify. 

Thirdly, when you place an artificial floor on wages, you end up pricing many people out of the option of getting an entry level job that may allow them to build skills and responsibility.

&gt; I believe the best society would be one with elements of libertarianism, socialism, and capitalism. They all have great ideas but none are perfect.

I'd be interested to know how you think those work and blend in your ""best society"", without creating massive potential for corruption.","1357000252"

I'd been in the unit for less than auspicious reasons for 4 to 5 days. These guys think I'm going to be bartender? Rules just changed. Bartender got drunker than fuck because he'd open a can, drink some, hand it to the next guy that asked for a beer and open another can.

They carried me back to my new room and actually helped me up to my top bunk. Sorta nasty, since if I puked, my new roommate was going to get a faceful. However, fate had made him black so they didn't care.

The bunk is spinning, I feel like I'm going to explode when I heard some asshole out in the dark hallway talk about waking up the new guy and scaring him.

Ah, purpose in life at last. The light switched on. The guy stepped up on the bottom bunk. I pretended to wake up and focus. Then I cold cocked him. I looked over to see him sprawled on the floor and rolled over and pulled my blanket over my head and pretended to sleep and snore.

I'd just knocked out my new Executive Officer. Guys asked me for days 
what they were going to do to me. Nothing. They just let it slide.

That Executive Officer called me over to meet his relieving officer who would be the new Executive Officer. He told him about me drunkenly punching him while I was passed out. 

Wasn't until the next day that it occured to me that it would have been a better idea to get straight with the new XO by telling him that I wasn't ""passed out."" ","1357000259"

As to why the episodes disappeared I would say its mostly a combination of Comedy Centrals fault for not actually releasing them all and the fact that VHS was the only household medium of recording shows at the time and pirating TV shows just wasn't that popular so those episodes probably don't exist much outside Comedy Centrals walls.","1357000264"

Like I said I think it would be great if you started a post about testosterone and whatever questions or experiences you have with wanting to use it/using it/fears you may have etc. One reason there are so many MtF posts is, well, MtFs tend to be way more vocal. I think there's a certain amount of male socialization that is retained by some, just the idea that they have a right to speak up. (which they absolutely do) However, for an FtM and/or transmasculine tg/gq people retained oppression can keep us silent. I notice masculine folks are more likely to just slink away when there's a sense of not being welcome. Speak up! I would love to read a post like that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is coming from a first year med student in the US so take it for what you will.

Med schools don't care what your high school stats are, nor do they care about your high school activities unless you've carried them out through college or you've done something pretty significant like Eagle Scout (shows a dedication to service and community) or National Merit Scholarships.

What they're really looking for is a dedication not only academically, but also professionally, to the career and lifestyle of medicine.  This will mostly be borne out of your experiences in college through service, leadership, scholarship, research, and clinical experiences.  

Scholarship is easy - get good grades in college, great MCAT scores and this is set.  This is especially important in your required medical school classes: 1 year General Chemistry with lab, 1 year Organic Chemistry with lab, 1 year Physics with lab, 1 year Calculus (some med schools want this, some don't, it all depends), 1 year Biology with lab.  Those are your essential classes to get some kickass grades in because those are the big courses that will determine your grade cutoffs for the sciences.  Other courses to throw in might be biochemistry, anatomy and physiology, genetics.  Now, it doesn't matter what your major is, as long as you get in the required classes and do well in them.  What you have to watch out for is in the coming years - the MCAT and the academic requirements for med schools may change with the flavor of the medical school interview.  Do a bit of research into the possible changes through the AAMC website.

The others are going to take a bit more time commitment outside of your college studies.  

Service can be nearly anything that shows an involvement in your community - soup kitchen, free clinic (gets you clinical experience too), free tutoring, etc. 

Leadership is just what it sounds like - Managerial positions, leadership roles in fraternities/work/student groups, youth groups, scouts, etc.  

Research - you want to do something that is scientifically relevant and possibly medically relevant.  Getting a publication while still in undergrad is a big accomplishment since it shows how much of an involvement you had in a big research project. 

Clinical experiences - this is a little touchy.  You need to do things that give you a bit of exposure to the life of a clinician.  Long shadowing experiences, EMT experiences, CNA experience, overseas mission trips, etc.  Things like volunteering in a hospital gift shop or delivering flowers to patients doesn't count.  This isn't quite as hard as it seems to get experience.  Many doctors are pretty responsive to shadowing experiences if you contact them directly.  There isn't anything saying you can't email a couple doctors in possible specialties and ask if you can follow them on rounds or during patient interviews, etc.  Who knows, you could see some cool surgeries, get really into a certain specialty, get some really good tips on applying, or even get some experience saying you don't want to be a doctor anymore.

In all of these non-academic experiences, you should be able to speak about them and their effect on you.  Not only what you did, but what you got out of it.  Did it change you? What effect did it have on you?  Did it strengthen your resolve to become a physician?  

The road is really long and it starts early, sometimes even before you realize you need to start preparations. But in all of it, there's a lot of opportunity to figure out whether or not you want to continue or even if you're fit for the lifestyle.  Good luck to you.","1357000269"

experience in farm management and the intention as well as the ability to purchase and manage a farm in Canada.

But *why* do we suffer? That is what is important, not that we suffer at all. The base state of human kind, if we take no actions to better ourselves, is suffering. So suffering that is not directly caused by another human is NOT the result of any other human, but of nature and the nature of humanity. You cannot blame other people for having to work to be happy.

&gt;And honestly how the fuck is unversal healthcare and public schools making them slaves? 

Either you force me to work to pay for the goods of others at the point of a gun, or you force the doctors and teachers to work for free at the point of the gun.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Like buying expansion after expansion of dominion is any better? I used to think like you do. It's different strokes for different folks. People like the idea of an ever evolving game that takes skill and luck. Yeah the game does cost a lot of money but it also holds value. You can sell your collection and get back some of the value you spent on it, so the whole money sink stuff is a bit off. If you're good enough, you can go infinite and essentially play for free.

If you play casual your cards never really go bad either. It's not that different from playing any other card game like dominion in that regard.

The thing about Magic type games is it sounds like a sink if you only look at it from one angle but the game fits many different styles. If you make a cube, you can play as much as you want for no further investment. It's essentially like making your own mini card game like Dominion. You can even add new cards as ""expansions"". It doesn't require a constant payment to keep playing. If you're not into the idea of having to play against people who have better/more expensive decks, you can play limited where everyone just gets packs and you make decks with them in a draft format or a sealed format where you just get 6 packs and make a deck with it.

Now you can argue that with a non collectible card game like Dominion, you're just paying once and you're done and can play forever. But that's not really true. No one's playing base vanilla dominion anymore are they? If you can use that same logic, why can't one say that you can buy a few decks of magic and keep playing them forever?

There are many formats for collectible card games that appeal to super casual gamers and super competitive gamers. The whole idea that it's evil is just biased thinking. Commander/EDH doesn't cost that much to make a deck for since you're only using a single copy of each card. You can have a ton of cheap cards in there. You can even be competitive with a cheap standard constructed deck sometimes.","1357000275"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I think people would have understood if they'd come back immediately after the pricing mistake was corrected and said that they couldn't afford the financial hit and would thus be refunding purchases (with optional store credit or something to compensate). That'd be closer to your analogy than what actually happened:

Which is that GG sold a bunch of keys before ""running out"" but promised customers that they would be available by mid-January. They took people's money, promised them keys, and then about a week later, rescinded that promise and gave their customers refunds while taking away their games from the GG library. This happened to customers who were given keys but had not activated them yet as well as customers who did not get the keys but were promised them. 

In the meantime, with so much time passing between the purchases and the refunds, people have skipped other holiday sales with the same titles assuming they'd already owned them and have even gifted or traded away games, which were then taken from them. And that's really the worst part of how they handled it. They should have either decided to take the hit &amp; honoured their sales or refunded them immediately, not jerked people around with false expectations.","1357000290"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","While your criticism seems to come from a reasonable place, I must admit that I disagree heavily on 2 points. One a bit more subjectively: The skill tree is actually nice in my opinion. I really like the amount of control over how your character will be, the amount of experimentation and the cool builds you can make.
The other point is the controls. I will tie this one into another one, the combat. See, I feel that, while the controls in both games were good (I didn't, myself, experience a problem with TL2's controls), TL2 really delivered on meaty and cool combat. It felt much better to do combat in TL2, you felt much more like your spells were useful, your attacks hurtful and the enemies, powerful. I felt like the combat as such was much better in TL2, as I really felt the spells and abilities in D3 was weak and felt like nothing, even when they were doing huge amounts of damage.
Also, I disagree with some of your other points, but mostly on the fact that I don't find the way potions are used to be bad, don't dislike the aesthetic (I mean, if you had to go away from D2 and D1's dark setting, you might as well not go 'slightly less dark' and just go 'cool colourfull world'), and actually find TL2 to be a more polished product in some areas, due to simply having a better weapons and skill system that is more polished.

Otherwise just running around and fighting him whenever you're near a place you can break line of sight is good. Some way to leap over minions in the event you do get surrounded is good, though generally not required if you watch where you're going.","1357000294"
"space","t5_2qh87","Assuming it slows gradually, the days and nights would lengthen until summer was daytime and winter was nighttime. (as i'm sure you know, the seasons are dictated by the earths tilt, but really just because one hemisphere is exposed to more light per 24 hour period depending on that tilt. Without the rotation, the tilt would no longer matter. one side would face the sun, one side would not.) This would likely lead to the death of the entire planet as it would get very hot on one side of the planet and extremely cold on the other.

Once things start moving in the opposite direction, seasons would return to normal and if any life survived, it would begin its dominance over the planet. 

Humans may survive, but likely only those that moved along the edge of day and night. they would likely need to become a hunter gathering society that moved with the 365 day long ""day"".

That's my take anyway. work is boring.","1357000294"

I believe an armed society has more of a chance at true freedom than one that is unarmed.  Freedom is a loose term though and really all depends on how much you trust those in control (government).  That's my larger philosophy.  My individual philosophy is I have the right to kill by any means necessary and available, anyone that wishes to do me/my family harm.  Guns are available to the bad guys.  Always have been.  I want the same (albeit legal) access to guns.  That's my rub on gun restriction in my country (USA).  It does nothing to stop those who shouldn't have access to guns, from having access to guns.  Now, if you are in favor of the government going door to door seizing guns, that takes you down a whole different form of government than I know today.  That is if you live in the USA, which I'm trying not to make any assumptions.  I think my government has too much control of my life as it is and I'm to the point where I'm not willing to give up my guns.  They (my government) screws me on a daily basis and I'm armed.  A lot of us are armed.  I'd hate to think what they would be capable of doing if we weren't armed.  If it ever came to that, our only real hope is that the military would be on our side.  I can't buy an Abrams tank even if I had the money.

That's the way I see things, but I'm sure you won't and don't agree.  Which is fine.  Maybe that's fine for you.  It isn't for me.  I really did give you an upvote too.    ","1357000297"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There's a few points that haven't been made yet I think would help in understanding this. The CGPGrey video is excellent and everyone should check it out.

There are a few things it fails to mention though. The other big problem not talked about is the access problem. This happens on a number of levels. I hate to start with a wikipedia quote but from the Third Party page on wikipedia ""Nationally, ballot access laws are the major challenge to third party candidacies."" Democratic and Republicans candidates on any level never have to worry about their party showing up on a ballot. Lesser known third party candidates may never appear on a ballot at all. Laws are designed by those in power (both Dems and Repubs) that make it nearly impossible for third party candidates to get on the ballot without massive amounts of money and volunteers. These two things are hard to come by as people don't want to invest time in money on a campaign that won't likely compete in the short term.

Another huge access problem, when it comes to things such as the presidency, are debates and media. The media one is easy to understand as news networks are not going to give any third party candidate much time to espouse their views to a national audience. They don't feel like they have a shot and they're right. The larger, more hidden problem is debates. The Commission on Presidential Debates, which runs all national presidential debates, is composed of just Democrats and Republicans. The rules to qualify are designed to make it nearly impossible for a third party candidate to appear on stage and share their views with the general public. This makes getting any traction almost impossible.

The only way a third-party candidate can get any nationwide traction is MONEY. Lots and lots of money. Someone like a Ross Perot would have to run again for their to be an outside shot for the presidency. This is why someone like Michael Bloomberg is talked about every 4 years.","1357000298"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Toronto (Old Toronto/Toronto Proper): the transit is pretty unreliable, and cab drivers aplenty will follow you like hawks. 

Eventually you will break down and may find yourself preferring cabs to public transit, but since a monthly pass is so expensive, you might not really end up spending a lot more than you would if you only got a Metropass. Especially if you split the fare with friends. 

Terms to know for transit: ""short turns"" = the bus/streetcar is going to only go to a certain location. You need to make sure you have a transfer/proof of payment to get on the next vehicle.

""detour"" = typically streetcar detours that go out of the way of where you're trying to go, on a somewhat parallel route, but don't stop anywhere throughout the detour, leaving you several KM away from where you want to be.

""Frequent Service/FS"" refers to a vehicle coming ON AVERAGE once ever 10-15 minutes, but really means you will wait for an hour and then 4 empty buses or streetcars in a row will show up.

One way I tried is to hyjack the Ingress cookie (needed so the server API will talk to you) and make the request that way specifying you are interested in all portals. This seems to work but is exactly the kind of thing Google dont want you doing in their TOS. Plus its quite difficult to achieve without substancial screwing around.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I think your advice is rather poor and amateurish. Look at any of the top critics for major publications (Ebert, Roeper, Travers, Scott, etc.): none of them write reviews that follow a rigid formula. Following a formula that takes you paragraph-by-paragraph through all the different dilineations of a film (acting, technical aspects, effects, etc, etc) is a sure-fire way to write a boring review and is something most amateurs do (check a site like epinions.com to see this formulaic reviewing in full force). 

Film critics, at least the good ones, focus only on whats relevant. Acting might be an important component to analyze for one movie, but may not deserve an entire paragraph (or even mention) in a review for another movie. Structure is important for reviews, but trying to review every single aspect of a film is pointless. Focus on whats important - what really makes or breaks the movie for you. A film critics job is to describe why a movie worked or didn't, not to review all the random individual elements of said movie.  ","1357000309"

I assume that the mined material is mostly iron as it is abundant in the crust. That's why the storms happen. But I'm sure that there are more exported goods beyond that. So there could be multiple ""cities"" each harvesting different resources.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Coming from someone who dated someone who was bipolar, it's really important that you're working on managing your disorder and sticking to your treatment. The reason that we wound up breaking up was because he was consistently going off and on his meds and would be so nice and sweet one day, but the next day blow up, call me names, and flip out over things that normally wouldn't bother him. It's important to communicate where you're at and be honest about that with your girlfriend. In addition, make sure if you do have a bad day and she is affected by it, you not only apologize but show her that you're making a real concerted effort to help yourself and make things better. I never minded dating someone who was bipolar and would do it again if I happened to meet someone who was affected by BPD, I minded it when it got to the point where he wasn't trying to help himself and was consistently hurting me as a result of his disorder, it just got to the point where it was way too much to handle and too much stress on our relationship.

Honestly though, as long you have things under control it shouldn't be a huge deal and your girlfriend should understand, especially if you provide her with information on BPD, tell her where you're at, and how this would/could affect your relationship.","1357000317"

They don't need to be able to see nearly as well in the dark as a predatory cat does, they just need to be able to hear them coming, know from what general direction the attack is coming, and even if the attack is successful, most of the herd will survive, so there is not a very strong evolutionary pressure driving them to develop better night vision.","1357000330"

First, one that's not as 'heavy' but is such a good band that everyone needs to listen to them.  They're instrumental, so anyone who doesn't like harsh vox should listen, too. The album is one continuous flow that's worth sitting through and listening all the way through.  If you choose one song just to check it out, well, really any song on the album except track one (it's more of an introduction).  Go 3b for something a little more melodic,  2a for something more post-hardcorish, and either 4a or 2c for something a bit darker.
