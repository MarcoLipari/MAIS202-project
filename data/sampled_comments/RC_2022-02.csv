"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I lost weight by downloading a calorie tracker and eating about 200-300 calories under my daily calorie requirements.  When I used my tracker I saw that some of the foods I felt terrible about eating were actually not that bad.  Some of the foods that weren't great were okay in smaller amounts or on days when I exercised.  And some foods that I thought were healthy had a TON of calories.

I didn't change my life radically but it did make me more likely to go for a bike ride when I might have been feeling lazy, or get a side salad with my burger rather than the fries, or stop at one beer rather than having more.

You don't need a ton of money to start losing weight.  The two things I found really useful were a bathroom scale and a kitchen scale.  Other than that, the calorie tracker I used is free online.  At the time I wasn't going to the gym.  I did have a bike because I used it for commuting in the summer, but otherwise I just went for walks or spent some time dancing to Youtube videos.  And like I said, I didn't change my food drastically and start buying all organic produce or anything, and I probably saved a bunch of money not buying potato chips every week.

Other than that, different stuff works for different people.  My friends do IF but I feel like crap when I skip meals.  I also don't cut out carbs but a bunch of people have had success on low-carb diets.  If something isn't working for you then feel free to change it and see what happens.  The biggest thing is to be patient because sustainable weight loss is slow.  You didn't get to your current weight overnight and you won't lose it overnight either.

The mental health will be the hardest thing to deal with so try and get support for that.  Even just talking to people on forums like on here might help.  It's easier to do things together with others.",1643673600

He's an upgrade on Eddie, which could end up being really important. If you need a goal and you've got to bring on Eddie or auba who do you pick?

Id agree with you generally but having him available (obviously ignoring the issue between him and arteta but I'd have hoped they would have found some agreement) would have been better. Especially when our other options are pretty much having nothing at all

"CompetitiveForHonor","t5_3bbel","&gt;You seem to not know what power creep is

I know full well what it is. It's the reason BP, once one of the strongest characters in the game, is now a mid-tier. But it's also the abstract concept that has taken the game from 700 ms lights that were unsafe on block to the 500 ms standardized lights that we have today.  And it's been a necessity for the entirety of this games lifespan. Characters have always needed to improve, and dare I say they should continue to improve.


&gt;And making people more powerful does not make the game more interesting or deeper.

If done well, and I would argue it has been recently for the most part, power creep has led to far more interesting matchups and gameplay. Without power creep Zhanhu wouldn't have their dodge cancels. Without power creep Aramusha wouldn't have his recovery cancel to BB. Without power creep Shinobi wouldn't have a bash that requires additional reads from both the attacker and defender to punish. None of these were givens. None of these existed at launch. 

This games launch was painful, defensive, and binary (without exploitative glitches). You dodged a bash? Free GB. You parried any attack? Free GB. You dodged a light attack that can only chain into a heavy? Free GB. 

Now it's so much more than primarily static binary interactions. Pirate is a wonderful example of this. Matchup and hitstun knowledge alongside a players own risk vs reward scale and reads influence a players decision to use or not use the confirmed pistol blast after a heavy. This singular interaction requires more brainpower than any launch character did. Beyond that both players will make reads to punish/evade Pirates bash. Hell, even accessing Pirates bash requires a read from both participants. 

More powerful numbers does not make the game more interesting or deep, I agree. It's one of my largest complaints about the majority of the reworks we have seen since CCU. 

But when done well, more mechanics can increase the games depth (and in For Honors case help promote offense). Option selects failed this as they promoted defense in a defense heavy game. Shinobi's kicks (barring kickflip) failed to increase the games depth because they didn't allow the defender to succeed on read if the Shinobi reacted. 

On the other hand Orochis kick was a huge success for promoting offense, while still giving the defender the opportunity to punish it. Yet this was unjustly removed because the nerf crowd had their way with their favorite doll to molest.

In short, I disrespectfully don't agree.",1643673600

I've said it before but if you're unhappy at $400k TC, you're not going to be much happier at $500k TC. You're much better off taking some of that $400k and finding a damn good therapist.

Clearly if someone wants to fuck somebody or something that is unchangeable. So you can't treat them, in reality what society wants is to imprison pedophiles before they commit a crime. 

Then secondly no one should be forced to receive medical treatment if they don't want to. Society has a habit of fucking over mentally ill people. For reference electroconvulsive therapy is still practiced, and the Aktion T4 campaign ran for a while because society perceived that as being humane. If a pedophile or anyone else commits a crime or attempts to commit a crime they should be punished for that. However, no one should be forced to experience treatment someone else decided is best for them. Its wrong

"homeowners","t5_2r9c1","The entry point is the biggest issue to find out. I did a long rant on my profile around fall of ‚Äúmouse in the house‚Äù ‚Ä¶ in my case it turns out that my front entry was built by pouting concrete in a U shape with the basement wall being the 4th wall. The concrete was only about 2-3‚Äù below grade, with subfloor and flooring and walls overtop. So the mice were burrowing to get to the warm void and then chewing through the wood to get into the house.

Now this needs a different repair than if the mice are getting in from a gap in an exhaust pipe. 

So things to keep in mind on mouse entry points ‚Ä¶ they can chew through anything but concrete and metal. Metal (wire mesh), they can squeeze through a hole the size of a dime. The ‚Äúrodent control‚Äù spray foam is a deterrent, but it can still be chewed though. 

My best advice would be to get an exterminator to come and take a look and figure out how they are getting in. Address if from there because I was very surprised to learn they burrow in the dirt to get under / in my house 

Oh, and one thing ‚Ä¶ they don‚Äôt like mint smells ‚Ä¶ so plant mint plants or spray borders of your house with strong mint smelling things will **help** keep them away but not a guarantee

All this whilst also dealing with a global pandemic.  

What is the net effect?  House prices plateauing finally and economists across the board finally predicting a decrease in housing prices.  

Homelessness and poverty - winter energy payments, increased minimum wages and benefits, increased thresholds for what you can receive on a benefit whilst working, school lunches,  best start payments for new parents,

"nihilism","t5_2ql4x","Here's something to consider:

A lot of intelligent folks don't try when they're young because they're in life's tutorial and it's boring as fuck. That's basically what high school is. Turn up day in day out working on the same low stakes trivial shit that doesn't seem to really take any skill but instead merely takes some arbitrary amount of time invested to succeed at. Why bother. 

 My advice is to be careful if this sounds like you. Why? Because although a lot of the work you have to do *is* trivial busy work, nailing it shows two things. 1) you're not an idiot that can't comprehend the nature of the work (instead you're probably intelligent, a little lazy, and don't see the point - but if you fuck up in the tutorial you literally look like an idiot) and 2) that you can *grind*. 

Realistically it's not even about what you learn in the tutorial. It's about having a track record showing you have those two traits by the time you get *out* of the tutorial. You aren't an asshat and you are down to *grind*. If you have a sheet of paper proving those things (typically good grades), you're going to have a lot of opportunity in life b/c intelligent grinders are the dudes/dudettes that every employer wants to hire. 

So by all means, throw yourself into gaming if you're interested in it. I know highschool / early life is boring so you have to pass the time with something. But *don't* turn your back on your workload. It's not that hard. Be smart and figure out the time investment it takes for you to crush your classes and have plenty of spare time to work on your rank in whatever game you play.",1643673601

It was literally the first thing that I said. I asked you you reconsider whether your statement about most people being able to save $60k over 20 years was something that was actually true, or just something you believe to be true.

If you don‚Äôt understand how asking you to reconsider if your comments are accurate, or based in subconscious bias, is the same thing as asking if the things you are saying are ‚Äòtrue‚Äô then we share no middle ground. 

&gt;	I would do that, if only you‚Äôd ask a question. Lol.

If you reread my comments, you will find many sentences that end in question marks. Those are the numerous questions you somehow can‚Äôt find? This feels slightly surreal at this point. 

&gt;	Please tell me one inaccurate claim I made, that could possibly cause you to question my bias.

 That most Americans can save $60k in 20 years. That‚Äôs simply not backed up by any data available. 

&gt;	If you want to say my experience is not normal, please, say it, in context of the OP (someone with remote work) instead of waffling around for 1000 words without saying what you mean.

It‚Äôs impossible to honestly answer your question because you keep insisting that the answers you are getting are irrelevant.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I find this really interesting; basically, memories are not held within the neuron, but in the neural connection. That's why you smell something and then it reminds you of something that reminds you of something else and at some part you're thinking of something completely random. 

Whenever you reaccess a memory, you recreate it in your head. When you remember the cup of coffee you had yesterday, do you see an image? Guess what? That image is not part of the memory! Memories are essentially a script of what happened, and whenever you reaccess them your brain synthesizes the visuals, and thus recreates the memory.

Think of it like a book. You see the character in your head one way, until the book describes that character differently, and then you change how you see him accordingly. This is how memory implantation works. If you accept that someone is saying something, and that something is completely true, then your brain will add it to the memory script, and next time you access that memory your brain will have different material to work off of.",1643673603

Also yeah perfect iv isn't protecting you from a quad weakness but that's true for anything really if you pin point a specific quad weakness then investment won't matter. Same goes for comparing gengar and umbreon speed are so different it makes little sense to compare. Like yeah in this scenario the iv doesn't matter but you just chose a situation where of course it wouldn't matter.

Some of you guys in this sub are really fixated on circle of healing as if it‚Äôs some game ruining perk that behavior has to nerf into the ground, but that‚Äôs flat out not true. It‚Äôs actually a really interesting perk from a design standpoint, but the problem is you can just keep booning and you can boon in places too inconvenient for the killer to go to. The problem is that boons are poorly designed, and circle of healing is what exposes that. 

If half this sub had this way, circle of healing would be a useless perk that nobody would run, and we would never see a good perk for boons get made because they‚Äôd all be nerfed into the ground. If you fix boon mechanics, you can have interesting or even good perks as boons and the game will have a different dynamic.

"indianapolis","t5_2rtt2","To answer your question: budgeting for FTEs is based on the local ‚Äúlocality‚Äù. So if DFAS Indianapolis hires you, the expectation is that you live in the Indianapolis locality pay area (or cheaper nearby rural areas possibly). They are not going to pay you the Chicago rate, so you‚Äôll have to move. With that said, it is possible to work out of any locality area, but good luck getting it approved (aka it‚Äôs not gonna happen). 

In general they are very pro telework tho, so that‚Äôs a plus. Employee experiences there vary since it‚Äôs very dependent on your directorate‚Äôs function and how competent your management is. So take others‚Äô opinions with a grain of salt. You will be getting underpaid with great benefits and work/life balance like most federal jobs‚Ä¶but the more technical/specialized your expertise, the more you‚Äôll just be straight up underpaid.

When trying to even broach the concept of ""what if we did keep the child"" despite stating she was still going to get an abortion, he said things in the vein of ""No. It's not even a question. You are going to ruin *my* life. That would be the worst thing to ever happen to me.""

Yeah, he says there are some good people among the neo-nazis, the ones who were there to join with them. It wasn't called Unite the Right rally because they had nothing in common.

Trump goes onto say:

&gt; ""No, no. There were people in that rally -- and I looked the night before -- if you look, there were people protesting very quietly the taking down of the statue of Robert E. Lee. I'm sure in that group there were some bad ones. The following day it looked like they had some rough, bad people -- neo-Nazis, white nationalists, whatever you want to call them.

The night before was the tiki torch rally where white nationalists paraded around a university chanting Nazi slogans: ""Blood and Soil"", ""Jews will not replace us"", and ""Tomorrow belongs to us"". So there were some neo-nazis there.

Sleep is super important. Everything looks healthy, not sure why your taking creatine for mental health though. Honestly it looks like a lot of money spent on supplements that can help to a certain degree but constantly depleting your brain through drug use is going to negatively outweigh any gain you'll make with supps.

I‚Äôm a newer rat mom, my first boys are now 14mos old and I got two more babies during thanksgiving. So I actually did have an overweight rat , Charles, and I put him on a diet. I don‚Äôt see it as ‚ÄúI abused him‚Äù, I was learning and adjusting. At first he was just bigger than his brother. Then he was so cuddly, but not playing or climbing as much as his bro and he seemed a bit clumsy/bumbly at times. So I gave him a diet, all the Oxbow they want but less veggies/fruits at dinner and less treats. He had no interest in exercise saucers. Then we got the babies introduced and it was like having the two big boys become new rats because the babies were sooo stimulating for them. So it worked out perfect to get Charles to play more. Now he lost weight and seems perfectly healthy‚Ä¶still a bit unsure when climbing, so we stay close by and encourage/help him, made some spots easier for him to get up to, and he plays just as much as the rest of them, as well as being the biggest cuddler and a complete pushover to the other 3. He loves to be trampled by the babies and groomed. He bruxes just because another rat is touching him/brushing by him üòÇ lol It‚Äôs so cute. 
Anyway long sorry‚Ä¶.long üòÖ I actually did have to help my ratto lose some weight and that does not mean I abused or neglected any of them, I just had to learn and adjust ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I would have felt awful if ppl came at me like that.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","The same people who help malign 3rd parties and perpetuate the 2 party duopoly, like to talk about cynicism and say it's nefarious people trying to convince people not to vote, that if they only voted harder it would make a difference, and not the politicians to blame for this cynicism. If you were around for Obama and then saw what happened to Bernie, you would be cynical about it too because for leftist, it really does feel like the whole establishment works against you. I mean even the government, from FBI targeting Occupy to govt targeting civil rights leaders like MLK, Malcolm X and Fred Hampton. You see their friends in the media mislead people about Bernie's 'socialism' being far left, pie-in-the-sky and fearmonger over other countries like Venezuela, but fail to mention how U.S. helped to sabotage countries practicing 'socialism.' And this is not just a GOP bad thing, this is a rotating villain/political theater, dems would rather lose to Republicans than progressives type thing that people need to wake up to. Thankfully more and more people seem to be done with MSM and the two-party system. The issue here is collusion of elite, who controls the flow of information and manipulate/interfere in our own elections, it's about the corrupt being dug in and benefiting from a corrupt system that is protected from fundamental/institutional change. It's about the elite using divide and conquer tactics. Even using identity politics as a weapon to protect themselves. Also, look also to Chuck Schumer's comment about the security state having 6 ways to Sunday to get at even a sitting president. I don't have a lot of faith left in electoralism, but think if we have a chance, we need to be trying to work inside and outside the party at the same time and promote class solidarity and a general strike - which I have had DSA people say is too extreme and political revolution people hate on (3rd parties), which speaks to the co-opting.",1643673606

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","&gt;That's simply false: https://www.fatherly.com/love-money/what-is-divorce-rate-america/

Did you read the article? It's about how little data there was provided on the divorce rates and how this source is inaccurate.

&gt;The CDC‚Äôs number is imprecise. The latest CDC marriage and divorce stats are based on data reported by just 44 states and the District of Columbia, leaving out a number of states to base marriage statistics on. But that‚Äôs not all: some states report marriage counts, but not divorce counts, and vice versa

&gt;The best estimate, based on projections, is that 45 percent of marriages will end in divorce.

This is an estimate without all the data from your source. (Although there are different projections.) That's nearly half of just divorces, this doesn't even estimate the couples that are happy with the arrangement. 

&gt;And you're still dodging the question. Do you genuinely not want a LTR, or are you just afraid?

This is your issue, you aren't looking at things objectively, I'm making a point that humans arent as monogamous as you think. They are switching around to other people after their relationship cycles end. Which more often than not they do. Most people aren't marrying their high school sweethearts. 

As for me personally, I don't have any expectations or entitlements on anyone. I have relationships they live their course, and they end. The only difference is that I'm aware of the fact.",1643673606

What was worse, the Gestapo or the KGB?

The KGB.

The Gestapo consisted mainly of pencil-pushers.

87 % of Gestapo officers had a university degree

and 50% a doctorate.

Most crimes attributed to the Gestapo were in

reality committed by other security and law

enforcement agencies.

The Gestapo did the paperwork and then

transferred most cases to the relevant authorities.

Of course such position couldn't be further away from what majority of Taiwanese people want nowadays, which is just to be left alone and live peacefully with all our neighbors. Most of us would abandon those claims long time ago but for PRC leadership it's a ""Red Line"" crossing which might result in military action against Taiwan.

Btw such claims are legacy of occupation of Taiwan by Chiang key-sheck who was a staunch Chinese nationalist with zero connections to the island (until he and two million other Chinese had to flee to Taiwan after defeat in Civil War in 1949). Chiang never accepted his defeat , until his death he imagined himself as the ruler of the entire China, suppressed local Taiwanese population (both pre-1945 Han settlers and Austronesian aboriginals) and promised to take continental China back (essentially until early 1990s all power was in hands of people who fled China after Civil war).",1643673607

"RealTesla","t5_3mgxy","&gt; But how about maintenance costs? Oil changes, brakes, drive train? These will all break down and need replacement.

Over 200,000 miles, a typical car will only have 25 oil changes. I can do it for $35 each myself, but even at $100 each the $7500 tax credit more than makes up for it and then some (25 oil changes x $100 == $2500 only).

S60 Recharge has regenerative brakes just like Tesla.

Tesla quotes $20,000 for an out-of-warranty battery replacement. No ICE-maintenance item is anywhere near that cost. 

---------

Look man. If you **actually** care about car maintenance costs, go look up the price of Tesla's 19-inch, 20, or 21-inch wheels, which pretty much dwarf the costs of my do-it-myself oil-changes. (You're likely going to need ~3 sets of tires over 200,000 miles. At the +$100 per tire premium you're paying, you're basically spending $1200 extra over more reasonable cars, which is more than my 25x oil changes at $35 == $875).

That $20,000 out-of-warranty battery replacement. The extra time  I need because Tesla is anti-right to repair (so I _MUST_ take it into the Tesla service center). The utter lack of service centers (it'd be a 30 minute drive for me to take my Tesla somewhere for repairs, while my typical repair shop down the road can handle any typical car thanks to open manuals on most other cars). Etc. etc.

If you care about maintenance costs, you need to support right-to-repair and open documentation. That way, these small 3rd party businesses down the street can fix your car for you. This whole ""lock Teslas behind Tesla-only service centers"" is going to screw the entire Tesla community over the long term.

--------

The $~~7500~~ $5000 tax credit dwarfs any maintenance issue alone. (EDIT: $5000, because S60's default battery isn't large enough for the full tax credit. Still though, $5000 credit is plenty).",1643673607

This is outrageous, this is unfair. I'm able to post on every other subreddit but r/shitposting. I tried posting on r/shitposting and it got removed by you guys. Literally 1984. Is this because of automoderator or something? Because it gets removed just after some seconds I post it. So I don't think an actual human moderator can remove my post in such a short amount of time. So I think it is because of automoderator as bots are able to do these kinds of stuff.

Too strong an attachment to our preferences can hinder potential growth and enjoyment that might be encountered unexpectedly after stepping outside of our comfort zones. 

Sometimes things can fit in ways we couldn't have predicted if approached with openness. I think this attitude might improve overall appreciation of what's being played as well as your adaptatability as a player.

General barbell or standard strength movements never seemed to do much for me personally.  I suspect there is a general bias towards programming strength training, at least from coaches based in the states.

"nycrail","t5_33me2","I totally agree with getting the subway to Bergen County, but Fort Lee is not the place for a big park/ride lot/garage. It's too choked by bridge traffic. Better to run the line down I-95 and built a terminal on Challenger Road in Ridgefield Park or at the Vince Lombardi Service Area. Also, build a transfer station where I-95 crosses the Northern Branch which will eventually carry the HBLRT. Absolutely have a station stop in Fort Lee.

EDITED to change Challenger Blvd. to Challeger Road. Apparently, the Boulevard moniker has been phased out. Also, with the expansion of Overpeck Park, Ridgefield Park may no longer have the space to be a terminus. Vince Lombardi might be more appropriate even though it means crossing Overpeck Creek twice.",1643673608

Remove hero bonuses and level bonuses from multiplayer. You can choose your favorite hero, but everyone has the exact same health and damage. 

From there, we weed out the hackers. Problem solved, the top player is generally the best, rather than the richest.

Rich players deserve a reward for their money spent though, otherwise how does Habby make money?

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","&gt;The Gulf States employ the very sensible strategy of not providing citizenship to their immigrant populations. 


Right but this is immaterial to class struggle given they're still brought there to undercut labour prices. But more importantly places like Jordan, Lebanon and Kuwait might not give citizenship migrants and there families are there for such an extended period of time it makes little material difference, especially given citizens effectively have little choice in their government anyway. 

&gt;The fact that some shithole countries have more migrants from other shithole countries is of no concern to me, I just don‚Äôt want them in Europe causing no end of problems and expense here. 

My point is that replacement theory holds that immigration is something that is only happening to Europe, which is not the case. 

&gt;Then stop supporting their mass migration, it only benefits the corporate class, and demonstrably hurts working class interests,

See the problem is that you're falling into their trap of tribalism. You see immigrants as the enemy instead of your fellow victim of capitalism. So now politicians who promise to play tough with immigrants (but won't) can get elected to placate you while nothing changes.

Lots of people have extenuating circumstances, that doesn't give you a right to be nosing into what we are dealing with on a daily basis. 

The fact that you can't understand that food should taste good is really out there. Because it's one reason people eat. Bland food can absolutely lead to malnutrition as it can be a stressor for many people taking away their desire to eat. Humans use taste to help in so many ways, including happiness. Oh wait, are you one of those food is only fuel types? Would you be perfectly happy eating that slop from the movie, The Matrix? Oh lord and now good food is equal to rape? You're the extremist that the OP is talking about.

And you are right, Vegans had few options, which is why it has been a luxury ideology. Most people eat what they can find. You're attempting to push your ascetic lifestyle on the rest of us through some moral superiority. Get over yourself. Yes, most of the modern animal food industry in developed nations is cruel and inhumane, but at the same time would you consider starvation of a human to be inhumane? How misanthropic are your views? Going back to The Matrix, do you agree with Agent Smith that humans are a virus?

"graphicnovels","t5_2qqjj","Well, he has not written other ""comics"" let me restate. I should have said ""art"" he is of course known for both but it is his novels, particularly Tartar Steppe, that won him fame along with his short stories, particularly Sessanta Racconti (sixty stories). I'm going to skip over his work as a journalist for Corriere della Sera because of that I know little. 

However, I think that an argument could be made that his final work ""I miracoli di Val Moral"" is at the very least comic like. It even has on the back of the copy a Buzzati quote ""Dipingere e scrivere per me sono in fondo la stessa cosa"" which means ""To paint and to write for me are in the end the same thing."" Clearly he views the two forms in tandem and Val Moral doesn't exist without one or the other sort of like how a comic can't exist without one or the other. Although, it might classify more as a ""picture book"" rather than a ""comic"". He presents a number of pictures accompanied by text. I'd add an image here but I'm not sure how so just imagine a block of text on the left page and a picture on the right page. The images are not sequential but if you consider that he chose to include them all into a single book then I think captions + picture + intentional combination = comic?....but well I can understand if this is not the case for all who read it and I am taking some liberties with the definition. Granted, I don't know if it is published in any language other than Italian so maybe it won't matter too much since only Italians will read it and if I write this in english none of them will be able to criticize my conclusion.........well he is an interesting author and artist nonetheless.",1643673612

I'm saying ""Right-wing politics are compatible with nazism in a way that left-wing politics don't seem to be, and that's awfully interesting.""

In fact, I'm saying something more than that:  I'm saying that despite the banner of ""Freedom"" being waved, the people at these rallies are still Authoritarians in the sense of Bob Altemeyer's definition (which I highly recommend reading).  Authoritarianism is the common thread between Hitler, Mao and Stalin and if there is any hope at all of uniting the two political sides, it is by recognizing this.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","While I don't necessarily disagree with your points, we have to separate different levels of evil here:  
  
1. bad deeds for self-interest  
2. bad deeds for emotional reasons to other bad deeds  
3. bad deeds because the character enjoys doing bad things  
  
If your standard is that Cersei isn't evil because all her deeds serve either her or her family's interests, or are done because she's getting back at someone then we have to apply these same standards to Joffery, Ramsey, and Tywin. If we apply those standards almost every ""evil"" deed they did (or even most of the evil deeds that anyone does in real life) can be explained.  
  
**Tywin** \- Generally the easiest to defend. Tywin is a dick to Tyrion, but in comparable times in history, people would often kill or disown physically abnormal children. He emotionally hates Tyrion, but when given logical options he gives Tyrion status and power up until it affects his long-term plans. In general, especially with characters other than Tyrion, we never see Tywin hurt, kill, or manipulate a person without the good of his family or the kingdom as its goal.  
  
**Joffery &amp; Ramsey** \- I'll lump these guys because they're basically the same character. These guys are generally monsters, but if we wanted to be generous with them (which I think you're doing a bit with Cersei) we could say that a lot of what they're doing was creating reputations for themselves that make people afraid to attack them or cross them. They're both leaders in kingdoms that we're either just overthrown or overthrown in the last few decades. When things are that crazy, it can sometimes pay to be seen as crazy and cruel to people that mess with you.  
  
It seems like we're setting a pretty high bar for evil, but even then I think you left out a few things that Cersei did that fall into the Joffery/Ramsey Category  
  
**Season 1**  
  
Killing Robert is pretty justifiable from a certain perspective, but he was also the first ruler of an entirely new dynasty. The odds of a civil war in that situation is pretty high. If Jeffery had been old enough or competent enough to be a stronger king it might be more forgivable, but she's pretty partially responsible for all the deaths that resulted from the civil war even if Joffery and others were the primary causes.  
  
**Season 2**  
  
When she imprisons Rose, she also has her beaten. Tyrion doesn't even know about the beatings, so it can't serve a real purpose other than Cersei wanting to have her beaten.  
  
Littlefinger says that when Robert had twins with a maid, she killed the children and sold the mother into slavery. There are some issues with other children or Royalty, but it's generally made clear that illegitimate children can't become lords or royalty in the show unless it's granted by someone of that rank or higher. Killing children is pretty bad regardless, but the reason doesn't seem ironclad, and selling the mom into slavery is a bit much. Arguably Littlefinger could be making this up, but it's hard to see what he would gain and these actions seem consistent with Cersei's character.  
  
**Season 3**

Tyrion talks to Cersei and we find out that when Cersei was young she had one of her servants that stole a necklace (also a child) beaten to the point where she loses an eye. Interestingly Tywin was mad at her, so it seems like it was an over-the-top punishment. Cersei doesn't seem remorseful about the incident.  
  
**Season 4**  
  
Sending the leftovers to the dogs wouldn't be that bad except that we know there are food shortages due to war and some people are likely starving  
  
**Season 6**  
  
Sure she might have been justified in killing the sparrow, but most of the Faith Militant were people who thought they were doing the right thing, but even if we say that they're evil, there seemed to be a bunch or randoms in and around the sept that died. Killing hundreds of people in an effort to kill one or a handful of people is pretty bad.  
  
She didn't consider how killing Margery Tyrell would affect the son that was falling in love with Margery. You could argue that she played a pretty significant role in his suicide.  
  
**Season 7**  
  
Cersei kill Tyene in front of Ellaria. I get that this is to pay back Ellaria for Myrcella's death, but Tyene didn't kill Myrcella. It's arguable that this isn't that bad since Cersei could infer that Tyene was intending to attack her by joining Yara's Ironborn fleet.  
  
I'm pretty sure this one is the worst. She's shown incontrovertible truth that weird ice zombies exist and is told that they are planning to essentially wipe out humanity and she decides that she's willing to risk that if it means a higher likelihood of her winning the war. She knows that if she's wrong, humanity could literally cease to exist.  
  
**Season 8**  
  
I know we're kind of ignoring season 8, but she kills Missandei in a situation where it explicitly makes things worse for her and the city. The only motivation it seems as she has is that she enjoys the sight of Daenerys being hurt by it.  
  
  
While I would certainly say that she's not necessarily a psychopath like Joffery or Ramsey, she seems content to kill innocent people without a thought if it serves her greater goals.",1643673613

I‚Äôm happy to mask up, but like everyone, I‚Äôd like to return to more normal interactions with people soon. Anyways, I asked my question because (1) hospital stats are relatively solid (they‚Äôre tracked in many areas and aren‚Äôt subject to as much uncertainty as testing stats are) and (2) many people are eager to drop masking. I assume there is an increased risk to doing so, and I wonder how the risk compares. 

Like you said, there is a lot between ‚Äújust a day or two of symptoms‚Äù and ‚Äúhospitalization‚Äù. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs not trivial to quantify that stuff and few people are tracking it. Are the studies overestimating the long lasting effects? Or are they underestimating them? I‚Äôd also like more data. In the meantime I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry.",1643673613

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed because we require post titles to be more descriptive, to make it easier for people to know if they might be able to help or not, and to act as a TL;DR.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics/Content`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

Guess what dummy, minorities are allowed to have their own spaces to feel safe and help members of their own community. YOU intruding on that space would be wrong. That's like saying ""Oh well, I can have white-only spaces because there are groups that focus on African Americans only."" When members of a majority who are not prosecuted in any way start excluding members of a minority, that's when there's a problem. Also, what kind of an example is a breastfeeding group? So what if a transwoman joins a breastfeeding group? What if she wants to stimulate a similar effect with her baby? What if she wants to learn the difference between formula and breastfeeding and wants to discuss it with her fellow mothers? Why should she be excluded from that? That's such a bizarre example. What about the cis women who are unable to breastfeed for whatever reason? Should they be excluded as well do you only have a problem with transwomen? By you're logic, they shouldn't be included in this ""ciswomen only"" space either since they can't relate. You're trying so hard to find a reason to exclude trans people, it's crazy",1643673616

Regarding career it is pretty straight forward and to be honest I don't have much to say here. 

Regarding the relationships I would ask myself a few questions: do you mean romantic relationships or any? What is wrong with those that you have? If you have none why? Was it always this way? Is there somebody who you wish to be closer with but for some reason (what is it) you are not? Howuch efforts do you put into it? Would you consider a group ""therapy"" that could help you to I cover how you act in groups of people ? 

Those are not the questions I am asking it is shut something I think you should be asking yourself to narrow down what you need.

"MHOCHolyrood","t5_sk5ky","Presiding Officer, 

I would like to ask the Cabinet Secretary to clarify some comments made in this session so far, in contrast with the PfG. 

In the PfG it was stated that the Beyond 16 white paper will include the following:

&gt; ""Expanding routes to vocational qualifications so that Apprenticeships are not the only route for those who may seek to improve their skills""

This suggests the Government will seek to promote other vocational options over Apprenticeships and that vocational training is a priority, however in another statement made so far, the Cabinet Secretary made the following statement on Apprenticeships: 

&gt; ""Of course, I would like to see more people in apprenticeships, but short of forcing them into them I don't see how this can be best achieved.""

Now, I know this may not seem a priority to many, and I may even been criticised for such a line of questioning, however I must ask the Cabinet Secretary what their policy towards Apprenticeships and vocational training categorically is?",1643673617

When you get popular and now there's 1000 stores, that's 1000 people to fit into your 50 person system. It becomes a bit much to handle and the system crumbles beneath it.

I also said in my post that there are other ways to respond to that besides just dropping everything and not wanting to deal with it. I'm not agreeing with their decision, I'm saying it could've been an issue that lead to said decision. I'd agree it'd be a bit of a dumb reason to stop everything.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/gender-pronouns

https://www.edi.nih.gov/blog/communities/what-are-gender-pronouns-why-do-they-matter

Your mom won't change unless she's motivated to, and feeling like she's under attack won't help either. You seem to have already addressed her feelings of being attacked, but maybe if she understands just how bad her sister would feel for being misgendered, she will begin to understand that you're not expecting her to change for no reason.

Once she understands the importance and decides to try, she'll need practice. You can help by simply talking about your aunt with her more frequently. If you don't have a reason to talk about her, just make stuff up. Your mom can do the same thing on her own by making up stories in her head, like ""This is my sister Sam. Her favorite color is red. She likes to ride her bike."" Just random stuff like that. It doesn't have to make sense.

Oh, and as far as respecting her gender even though you don't particularly like her, you're exactly right to do so. Misgendering a trans person you don't like implies that their gender is a privilege, not an inherent part of who they are.",1643673617

Kid uses his DF powers to control hundreds of metal objects in the area and surround big mom with it.

Law then uses **kroom**, but this time he combines it with all the metal objects using a new variant of **anaesthesia**. Kid then uses **assign** on big mom and follows it up with **punk clash** which attracts all the objects toward big mom, Law then uses **shock will**. 

This combined attack greatly damages Big Mom. However, it's not enough to put her down. Kid and Law are exhausted from their last attack and are barely able to move.

 Folks do skip tomes and such, but you can't control that. There's no use getting hung up over not being the one with the healing item if you have the talent cuz those ppl generally don't care. Can't micromanage every pug team unfortunately, but most will listen.

True, I shouldn't have used the word hogging, maybe chugging or something instead.  I meant specifically using up the heals to cure a scratch instead of keeping it or letting the high priority folks have it. I don't care if folks keep their healing items for wounds, that's the way I play too when I don't expect to clutch.

That is silly and I‚Äôve hashed out that argument already.  In the end you are making a pedantic argument, but nothing that you‚Äôve said with regard to the legal rights of individuals conflicts with my comments.

I also disagree vehemently with this idea that Rogan screwed up by daring to entertain challenges to the mainstream, left-controlled narrative.  There‚Äôs nothing wrong with having conversations with a diverse set of viewpoints, and I hope that he continues to do so.  A show that can host both Dr. Robert Malone and Dr. Sanjay Gupta in equal fashion is doing something right‚Äîand something that this country sorely needs (and, to be honest, I‚Äôm surprised that *you* seem to disagree there).

BUT you'd have to rely on other ""unofficial"" ways of getting visual odometry, whether that's through rtabmap, Slamcore, or something else.

Also, as a side note... the T265 might possibly be weird with connection issues sometimes.  Like you might have to unplug and replug the camera in for it to get detected.",1643673619

"SLO","t5_2r3yh","Putting a comment here as a reminder to myself to read through that full report later. I did see the snippet:

&gt; The federal government‚Äôs policy shift in 2013 to prioritizing housing first as a one-size-fits-all approach has not worked to reduce homelessness for all populations and communities.

&gt; Policies that do not address the real root causes of homelessness combined with high housing costs in over-regulated markets have exacerbated the homelessness condition in America.

Then later:

&gt; This strategic plan, Expanding the Toolbox: The Whole-of-Government Response to Homelessness, envisions an approach that dramatically reduces homelessness by engaging and assessing families and individuals with a trauma-informed approach to care that addresses the real root causes of homelessness. This plan focuses on:

&gt; * The Importance and Power of The Dignity of Work,

&gt; * Mental Health and Trauma Informed Care Are Critical,

&gt; * Affordable Construction Leads to Affordable Housing,

&gt; * Prevention Will Save Money While Reducing Trauma,

&gt; * The Need for Population Specific Programming,

&gt; * Renewed Focus on Racial Disparities,

&gt; * Promotion of Alternatives to Criminalizing People Experiencing Homelessness, and

&gt; * Importance of National Emergency Readiness.

&gt; Together we can make the necessary changes to dramatically reduce homelessness in America, and most importantly, to help improve the lives of the families and individuals experiencing homelessness.

My read on that is not that Housing First is necessarily bad/wrong, but that it doesn't work for all populations and communities. Which I can kinda see overlapping with the existing issues of the ""benefits cliff"" where you can't earn enough to support yourself fully *but* you earn to much to continue receiving benefits. 

I'll read through later. I have *opinions* on a lot of these programs because I grew up on a lot of benefits programs, and by far the biggest barrier I saw was people not understanding how to navigate the bureaucracy and requirements",1643673620

Your manager should have hired a snow removal service and planned appropriately.  Telling your cashiers to go out and shovel isn't planning, it's penny pinching bullshit.

I remember when I was a cashier and being told to clean a bathroom near the end of my shift because someone ""made a mess"". I was like ""*whatever*"" and wheeled the mop &amp; bucket in to prop the door and looked to see what the problem was.  The problem was that someone had stood about 3' away from the toilet, pulled their pants down, leaned over, and shotgun-blasted the wall, toilet, and floor with Taco Tuesday.

I didn't even say anything to anyone.  I just left the mop in the door, clocked out, and left.

My friend wants to become a therapist. I used to believe that she would be really good at the job but recently she has become significantly more judgmental than before. It seems like she likes to embarrass me if we go out in groups. She‚Äôll say hurtful things and then move on like nothing‚Äôs wrong. For example, the other day she got upset that I was in a hurry to leave because I had to be home by a certain time and she insinuated that I had nothing else important going on.

Yesterday she was stressed out about school and for whatever reason she ended up getting mad that I sent her a picture of my bird. She insinuated that it was childish of me to own a bird and that she was tired of my bird being my only personality trait. I‚Äôve never tried to make my pet a personality trait, so I was hurt by the comment. I told her that her comment hurt my feelings and that whether or not she liked it, I was going to own a bird. There were plenty of things that she consistently talked about that I didn‚Äôt like but I excepted it because I knew that those things were important to her. 

We went back-and-forth for a little while and she said that she was just stressed about school and trying to become a therapist, and she asked me honestly if I felt that it was the right path. I told her that she had potential to be a good therapist but she tended to make judgmental comments if she was frustrated. 

There were times where she said things to embarrass people and make them look bad, which you couldn‚Äôt do with clients that were paying you. She said that she was just speaking her mind and that she was entitled to her opinion, which I said was true but she didn‚Äôt need to be rude about things and she would have to be a bit more open minded in order to make it as a therapist. If someone finds comfort in their lifestyle, it‚Äôs not up to anyone to judge them. She got mad and said that my opinion didn‚Äôt matter and that she would succeed in therapy even if she was judgmental. She didn‚Äôt appreciate that I called her immature, which I didn‚Äôt do. 

She‚Äôs not speaking to me now and I can see why she was upset, but she asked for an honest opinion which I gave her. If she wanted me to sugarcoat it, she should‚Äôve said that. I haven‚Äôt told my other friends yet, not because I‚Äôm not sure what they would think but I just don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs necessary to get others involved. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs judgmental, I think that she makes judgmental comments. I definitely think it‚Äôs possible that I could have let our argument cloud my opinion but looking back I still think that what I said was truthful and it‚Äôs up to her whether or not she wants to take my advice.

It can be a little tedious managing the tons of crafting components, but it was also absurdly powerful against... everything. The traps you can construct do a ton of damage and, with max level stealth, can be placed directly infront of enemies in plain sight. Once you initiate combat, every enemy hits a trap and if they are not killed outright are severely weakened.

Bombs/grenades are also very powerful as they act like non-magical elemental attacks and each one of them has their own cool down - you can throw 5 different bombs all at once. Throw on some entropy hexes for even more damage.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","It kind of is.  Why do we need to consider policies or morals for a thing that does not happen?  

I live in one of the 49 states where cannibalism is not illegal.  No one sees a need to add a law or policy around that because it is not a thing that happens.  Murder and desecration of a corpse are illegal, and there are regulations around meat sales.  I guess people can still eat human flesh but [eh, this may be urban myth and not even an extreme minority](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/legally-weird/is-it-legal-to-eat-human-flesh/).

So for this to be relevant, it has to be a real world thing happening.  

But to go with the argument as presented‚Ä¶

We have the right to vote.  Now, that means I do have to register by a certain day, submit my mail-in ballot a certain way by a certain time, or vote in person on a specific day at a specific location.  If I refuse all that and say I want to vote three weeks after the voting day, my right to vote is not being denied.

One of those was KuCoin and I had about $100 in USDT in it, found their little slot machine game and started spinning for the hell of it. A couple spins in, and it says I won the $5,555 jackpot. Didn't think it was real until a few minutes later when it cleared and showed up in my trade account, but I had to wait 24 hours or so to withdraw from the exchange.

During that 24 hours I found out about the SOLO airdrop and went ahead and exchanged about $4k to XRP and sent it to the Solo app. Read more about the airdrop and realized solo would get more on the drop than xrp so I ended up converting it all to solo at just below its ATH. 

So now I'm sitting on 2.2k SOLO at about 25% of my initial investment. Thankfully I was basically ""free"" money that I wasted and aped into on short notice, so I'm not too upset, but definitely a lesson learned. Might as well keep it all in there and claim the CORE drops for the next year and see what happens at this point.

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","It is copying, but it's all your own material so you have all the right to do it!!! And it's even a great resource for learning.

If your goal is to eventually learn to draw plants on your own, I would recomend you don't only trace over the outlines, but try to consider how volumes work and how to create a structure out of it. 

So basically try to do this: [https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdaixyDgWuY/hqdefault.jpg](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pdaixyDgWuY/hqdefault.jpg)

(I know it's plants and not people but it's the same idea hahaha) Basically try to find simplified shapes, and then complete it with the outlines. That way you're training your brain to observe and to simplify anything you need to draw. It's one of the most useful things I've ever been taught. 

If on the other hand you just need them to look nice and don't wish to learn how to do it without reference (which I hope doesn't sound bad, that's not the intention), then tracing over the outlines is gonna be way easier and faster. 

In my personal opinion tracing and copying becomes a problem if your goal is to become an artist and/or profit out of your drawings, but you don't put in the effort to learn and improve your skills, choosing instead to stay in your comfort zone. But that's just me, no one is expected to be perfect at their craft from day 1. You do you!!!!!",1643673623

Clothes are a bit tricky, but everyone says nice things about her outfit with the Christmas sweater over the gold bicycle shorts.¬†After all, she was a normal American herself once.¬†¬†That was a long time ago, of course. Before her parents died. Before she and the others were taken in by the man they called Father. In the years since then, Carolyn hasn't had a chance to get out much. Instead, she and her adopted siblings have been raised according to Father's ancient customs. They've studied the books in his Library and learned some of the secrets of his power. And sometimes, they've wondered if their cruel tutor might secretly be God.¬† Now, Father is missing‚Äîperhaps even dead‚Äîand the Library that holds his secrets stands unguarded. And with it, control over all of creation. As Carolyn gathers the tools she needs for the battle to come, fierce competitors for this prize align against her, all of them with powers that far exceed her own. But Carolyn has accounted for this. And Carolyn has a plan. The only trouble is that in the war to make a new God, she's forgotten to protect the things that make her human. Populated by an unforgettable cast of characters and propelled by a plot that will shock you again and again, The Library at Mount Char is at once horrifying and hilarious, mind-blowingly alien and heartbreakingly human, sweepingly visionary and nail-bitingly thrilling‚Äîand signals the arrival of a major new voice in fantasy.From the Hardcover edition.",1643673624

"FancyFollicles","t5_2sa9a","To get a true blue red you would need to lift beyond the level that yellow occurs at (level 9) pale blonde, inside of a banana peel color. 

That's for the purest, best outcome. 

Color will come out as (color going in) (what's in the tube) + your hair color (your underlying pigment).

So if warm is +, and cool hair is -, you cannot add more warm to cancel the warm. You have to use a cool color. Unfortunately red is  a pure pigment, as is blue, so it's a hard line to cross without getting a purple tone. 

Best case scenerios: hair stylist
2) clean the canvas (with a direct dye lifter is this is a direct dye and with an oxidative color remover if this is a color you had to mix two parts together for) and then apply the cooler red you want , I think Vampire by Manic Panic might be cool? Not sure, never used it 
3) apply a very dark, cool red, and hope that the level drop will erase enough yellow for it to appear cool

Stossel has no moral or philosophical arguments and so ends up arguing irrelevant economic points.

Then what starts out as a video defending a victim of minimum wage laws, like Jeff Bezos, ends up calling Bezos a ""craven opportunist.""

The same video starts out apparently supporting capitalism but ends up talking about how ""ugly"" and ""gaudy"" capitalism is and even equates fraudsters like Madoff to a capitalist.

Does Stossel even know what he's saying? Does he know what side he's on?

So yes, some capitalists are the worst enemies of capitalism and in this video Stossel proves himself to be one of these.",1643673626

There are very few areas that allow a ""self-help"" eviction in which the landlord can use a  reasonable amount of force to cause the tennant to leave the property. If OP is in one of these areas, i dont think the court would find his method of force reasonable considering its most likely illegal to threaten revenge porn on someone. This being said, it only matters if the girlfriend in question wanted to fight him on staying in the apartment. Or if the police were called and she hasnt done anything illegal, the police could not force her to leave because that is her place of residence too. Therefore, an eviction process would have to take place. But yeah, legally, the manner in which he threw her out does not comply with landlord/tennant laws.

And if any doc had known anything, we would‚Äôve done things differently.  The 3 surgeries I had last year for vascular issues (another miss) could not be avoided.  But they would‚Äôve gone smoother if they didn‚Äôt have to spend the first *hour* of every surgery just dealing with scar tissue.

I also have MCAS, which means I react strongly to things, react to weird things, and sometimes don‚Äôt even need something to react to!  And by react, I mean anaphylaxis.

But yeah. Tell me again how surgery is the one and only.

Sandor has blabbed probably the most to Sansa about his life more then anyone else and I just find it interesting that he never mentions a sister even by accident. By that is a memory too deep for Sandor to share either. Maybe you‚Äôre right though that because he doesn‚Äôt like his father or brother he doesn‚Äôt feel like he needs to keep that part of his family private. 

Like you said it is all theorizing at the end of day so technically no one is right unless George explains it. 

I wonder if maybe Sandor sees different aspects in the Stark girls of his younger self. Maybe in Sansa he sees the naive innocent kid he was before he was burned. Remember he was playing with a toy knight so he might have had a head full of stories just like Sansa. He doesnt want Sansa to go through an extreme traumatic event like him so in his own callous way tries to toughen her up by disillusioning her of her fantasies before that happens while protecting her from mortal danger at the same time. I don‚Äôt agree with his methods though.

In Arya he might see his younger self after he was the burned. He lost nearly everything at the hands of his brother before he was 12 so he had to go into the harsh world by himself. He was an orphan who became an soldier and never got any affection or positive encouragement from others. Arya was an orphan in the wilderness, learning to become strong in an hard way just like him. She‚Äôs cynical at times like him, doesn‚Äôt fear anything which he probably admires, and she‚Äôs brave. She is probably more like him then any other character or at least on her way to that.

It could also be because of the sister but this is another element that might cause him to emphasize with the Stark girls a little.",1643673627

A randomized, blind study examined the effect of nail polish color on measurement of oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry. Fourteen adult volunteers had blue, green, purple, black, and red nail polish applied to their finger nails. A strip-chart recording of oxygen saturation (Nellcor N100) was made in room air and later interpreted in a blinded fashion. The absorption spectra of the five polishes were determined by spectrophotometry. The spectra of nine other nail polishes and three intravenous dyes also were examined. Black, blue, and green nail polish significantly lowered oximeter readings of oxygen saturation. Blue and green produced greater decreases than purple and red; black produced an intermediate decrease. Some but not all nail polishes absorbed light at the wavelengths used by the pulse oximeter (660 nm and 940 nm). The degree of artifactual desaturation correlated best with the difference between absorbance at 660 nm and absorbance at 940 nm (r = 0.95). Spectrophotometric absorbance data suggest that other colors may interfere with pulse oximetry. On the basis of spectrophotometric data, brown-red nail polish was predicted to interfere with oximetry; subsequent pulse oximetry measurements confirmed the prediction. Nail polish should be removed routinely before pulse oximetry monitoring.

If a significant difference is shown between the two groups, it can perhaps provide a springboard to trials of that kind. I don't see why a springboard should be needed with the evidence currently available but at you know there's not much money available for funding riskier and more expensive trials than this in developed countries.

&gt;Placebo control trial wouldn‚Äôt be too unethical if being used for prophylaxis as there aren‚Äôt any prophylactic treatments available. If they were hospitalised then you would unblind and treat as per standard protocol

This is where science gets the "" second brain"" idea from, since this nervous system is capable of acting independently from the brain and spinal cord and is quit large (about the size of a cats brain).

Our gut communicates to ""the other 2 brains"" (again, an eastern religious approach) the heart and brain and they try to keep in sync.

Paraphrasing from the above wiki article:

&gt; More than 90% of the body's serotonin lies in the gut, as well as about 50% of the body's dopamine, which is currently being studied to further our understanding of its utility in the brain.

Rather; somewhere in the daily life of now there is **something** present that wasn't present before.

Most of *that* is that smart phones (and this is my hot take only backed by former silicon valley execs saying they are using all the data they collect for really sketcy reasons) are addiction machines that are integral for daily life where all they do is condition you to pay attention to them.

But the smart phones provide the vehicle for people to numb themselves to the stresses of life. Porn sites for most dudes and social media for most girls/women.

I still think it is an extremely good idea to call, but I did want to sort of warn you that the law does not give LE enough cause to obtain a warrant on your call alone. It may be possible they have other evidence to meet the burden of cause required to get a warrant, and police being witness to smell or sounds *may* arise to that, but it is not certain, and it is also not usually the case that police will treat this as an emergency and can't exactly time what they might witness if and when they check. 

I am not trying to discourage you from reporting at all here. I have seen the damage meth labs cause and it's *really* critical they be addressed whenever possible. I just don't want you to expect that the police will definitely do something, or quickly, and may or may not be able to overcome the neighbors right to not have his residence searched without a warrant. It just depends what they can see or find, along with how the courts and prosecutors may wish to proceed.

I get that overly energetic people aren‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs favorite but for you to hate it so much or find it ‚Äúnot normal‚Äù is extremely concerning.

Sounds like you have a stressful life or unresolved issues. When your observations of people around you impact you without them actually directly doing anything to you, 100% you are projecting your own issues onto them. You have no idea if those people are actually happy. They might be trying their best to be respectful and pleasant to others in order to deal with their own mental anguish. People do not need to brood or less sociable to prove their stresses. Some people live a perfect life and are happy. Some people life a perfect life and bitch endlessly. Some people have a shit life, worse than both of us, and smile everyday. Don‚Äôt worry about other people. Worry about yourself. Thinking other people should only act a certain way or being over sensitive to others and their actions shows that you are either very immature or going through some rough stuff and are trying to vent it out onto others who are happy.

On some real shit, try therapy. Most people overlook it but a good therapist can really change your life. Ty for sharing but anyone who thinks, ‚Äúwhat are you so happy about‚Äù, probably doesn‚Äôt have enough things to be happy about themselves so they don‚Äôt understand/ are spiteful of others happiness. Life is hard man, I‚Äôm there with you but we gotta be aware of our own positions and better ourselves too.

I‚Äôve been there, it‚Äôs a personal problem. Now you get to decide whether you continue being mad at others or improving yourself. Good luck!",1643673629

Still it can glitch either way. Point is, this doesn‚Äôt prove anything.

Some plugins can have different offline and real time quality settings you can change, resulting in differences. Sometimes oversampling is calculated or processed slightly differently on one or the other with certain plugins. Modulation effects that aren‚Äôt synced can be different even between real time bounces. Some plugins and VIs can have a degree of randomness built into them which causes differences.

I was up in the weight room earlier, working out with my team and some other guys. A few girls I know are there for our group workouts too. We were just doing our usually thing. Lifting mixed in with a little screwing around and yelling at each other, for encouragement and other reasons. 

I saw this girl who I know a little about to squat, I went over and asked her what she was going for. She told me and I asked if she wanted me to hit her. A few of us guys do it to each other so I jokingly asked her. Her reply to me was ""You can smack my ass."" I laughed and asked her ""really?"" she told me ""yah, get me some glute activation."" So I went ahead and gave her a smack. I thought she was cool and we were just joking around. But then she got mad at me.

She wasn't like furious or anything but she then asked me ""Why did you actually do it?"" I was confused at that point because I literally asked if she was serious. I was just doing what *she* said. AITA?

Don't know the appropriate name for the bit but that tab on the trigger bar (arrowed in first picture) is I think making enough contact to just drag on the slide at all points of cycling. I can feel and see it stop as soon as it hits that bump in the slide channel (pic 2). And from there on its taking significant force to get it the slide all the way on. Once on, it's extremely heavy to rack the slide and when I do it does not return to battery.

Really not sure if it's just an out of spec trigger bar and I can remove some material to make it work properly or if I need to buy a new one or what. Added other pics if it's helpful.",1643673630

To be honest, most researchers that I have worked with are not like amazing incredible statisticians (my PI in particular literally says ""I don't know"" to almost all stat questions). Of course, you need an firm understanding of the concepts, but most of the ""math"" at a research level is done through software, no one does that math by hand. Knowing the concepts and learning how to interpret results is what you should be focusing on after the class if you want to improve your stats skills for grad school.  Also, qualitative methods get published and have a really interesting process that basically doesn't have any statistics to it.

"arcane","t5_2re2c","We see Powder mention that she wants to fight Piltover as well at the bar. I dont believe Jinx was always necessarily a part of Powder. I believe the seed of Jinx began whenever Mylo first started to refer to her as a jinx. We see depicted that Mylo is a primary image of her affliction as an almost scale dummy of him sits on the couch she made. His apparition appears behind her when she activates the flare. 

Due to Mylo‚Äôs reference, jinx was there even unbeknownst to her. Jinx would‚Äôve never flourished if she never went to the factory where Vander was held. 

In some aspect that fact Powder felt the need to go on any job with them and endanger it could be looked at that perhaps that need to be there and cause problems was always jinx but i believe it was just an innocent Powder wanting to help and prove herself.

I believe the catalyst that created Jinx was seeing that her monkey bomb killed Mylo, Claggor and Vander and Vi hitting her, calling her a Jinx and leaving her there.
 At this point Silco was left only to nurture the seed that had just sprouted as Jinx. Her words of wanting revenge is the reason he felt for her related to her pain of being abandoned/betrayed. If Powder never felt this anger Silco wouldve likely murdered her im cold blood as she was a loose end. I dont believe Silco necessarily created Jinx but thats what was left for him to nurture when Vi left.",1643673630
"OnePunchMan","t5_2vm97","Elizabeth Bennet exists within the setting created by the author. Which is a very real world and grounded setting of rural Hertfordshire in the early 1800s. You could introduce new and super natural elements to a new story or take the charachter out of her elements but it would not be the same Elizabeth Bennet written about by Jane Austen and she is long dead so that will never change.

Talking at cross purposes, not talking across from eachother. It means your arguments are fundamentally incompatible due to discussing different subjects. He appears to be discussing the charachter in a meta sense concerning how he relates to the author and the overall tone and design of the anime, you appear to be theorising about saitama as a charachter within the universe created by the author. They are not compatible arguments.

‚ÄúThink about this some more, because the answer is obvious.‚Äù

Rather patronising there. What is obvious is that you are incredibly keen to be seen as right on this. Ultimately it doesn‚Äôt matter. It is your opinion that his argument is very weak, it is not the opinion of everyone, my opinion is that your arguments have little to do with eachother, and that doesn‚Äôt matter either.",1643673630

I understand them not wanting to immediately invalidate the probably ungodly amount or firstborn marine models out there, but the way the handled it was even worse.  I love the models, they look awesome and have a better proportional scale than the original marines ( why does my guardsmen have a larger head and stand as tall as an 8 foot robotic murder monk?), I just wished they said its the new mark of armor in primaris scale, then just start releasing primaris size old armor pieces.  I mean, I would have loved to have a mark 3 chest plate, a mark 5 helm, and mark 8 shoulder pads on the primaris size model. I woulda bought the shit outta primaris and the upgrade sprees to do that.  The lore they have now is so meh and forced.  The only cool ish part of primaris lore to me was Gabriel Seth calling out the primaris when they first arrived.  I woulda loved an true scale model or Lysander and Seth and Dante without the shitty lore that comes with it.  The lore is half the fun for me.  I remember spending hours, and I mean hours, with my gaming group talking the lore during the fall of cadia and the seige of baal and all the crazy shit that was going in everywhere, we loved that shit.

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","Heather McGhee's specialty is the American economy--and the mystery of why it so often fails the American public. From the financial crisis to rising student debt to collapsing public infrastructure, she found a common root problem: racism. But not just in the most obvious indignities for people of color. Racism has costs for white people, too. It is the common denominator of our most vexing public problems, the core dysfunction of our democracy and constitutive of the spiritual and moral crises that grip us all. But how did this happen? And is there a way out?McGhee embarks on a deeply personal journey across the country from Maine to Mississippi to California, tallying what we lose when we buy into the zero-sum paradigm--the idea that progress for some of us must come at the expense of others. Along the way, she meets white people who confide in her about losing their homes, their dreams, and their shot at better jobs to the toxic mix of American racism and greed. This is the story of how public goods in this country--from parks and pools to functioning schools--have become private luxuries; of how unions collapsed, wages stagnated, and inequality increased; and of how this country, unique among the world's advanced economies, has thwarted universal healthcare.But in unlikely places of worship and work, McGhee finds proof of what she calls the Solidarity Dividend: gains that come when people come together across race, to accomplish what we simply can't do on our own.McGhee marshals economic and sociological research to paint a story of racism's costs, but at the heart of the book are the humble stories of people yearning to be part of a better America, including white supremacy's collateral victims: white people themselves. With startling empathy, this heartfelt message from a Black woman to a multiracial America leaves us with a new vision for a future in which we finally realize that life can be more than a zero-sum game.",1643673631

"awfuleverything","t5_346d4","This is why towards the end of the war they introduced trench raiding, where the objective wasn't to take ground but to capture prisoners and ensure your men were actually fighting.

You couldn't just crawl out into no man's land and wait a couple of hours then come back, you either came back with prisoners or casualties.

The hand to hand fighting in such situations was absolutely brutal, improvised weapons like trench clubs made of a wooden shaft with a toothed gear on the end or just a piece of metal hammered out into a spike, entrenchment tools sharpened and used to hack at other men which reportedly would cleave from the collar bone well into the chest.

The brutality of the machine guns was only surpassed by the brutality of getting in close.

You can see why they called it ""the war to end all wars"", if only they had been right.

EDIT: Here's a good video on trench weapons and their usage in case anyones interested, really helps visualise how brutal those engagements were.

The tricky part comes when you go from 2 individual hits (open roll) to a rebounded double (closed roll), but that's the point of this exercise. Also there's no functional purpose to only doing the double stroke at 1 tempo, so learning to do it across all feasible tempos is extremely effective.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Spooning is not a platonic act, so your boyfriend was justified in being weirded out.

Beyond that, the bed that you share with your partner is just that, SHARED. Nobody wants to come home and find someone else sleeping in their bed when they were never asked or told, Goldilocks!

Granted, I WFH, and can get away with my hair looking a little wild most of the time, and don't mind just pulling it back and smoothing it down with a little bit of oil when I need it to look presentable.",1643673635

"Anglicanism","t5_2uk8h","There is a real chance that we experience further splits in the 80m Anglicans worldwide.  One very polite and gracious solution is to have various rites.  We could have a traditional and progressive rite.  It would be strange b/c it is likely that the traditional rite would have the lion's share of the parishoners and clergy, while the progressive rite would be much smaller but much wealthier.

I like the idea of striving for unity, though the concept of an Anglican Communion is not more than 150 years old (feel free to correct me!).  However, unity at all costs is not sustainable.  There are some clergy who would object to every classically understood line of the Apostle's Creed and I don't see how being in ""communion"" with them accomplishes much.  That being said, splits are tragedies.  No other way to put it.  They break Christ's Church in two and that's terrible.

It is humbling to observe the state of the Church in 2022.  Where will we be in 2100?  I cannot say with any real conviction.  I only know that trusting in God's good will toward His Church gives me the peace I need to continue laboring as a priest in the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.",1643673635

"confidentlyincorrect","t5_2cn1kk","It was 95% effective against Covid.  But viruses mutate over time, and many vaccines decline in effectiveness over time.  This is called new information, which results in new conclusions.  That‚Äôs how science works.  The original statements were entirely accurate under the conditions they were tested.  And the vaccines still absolutely reduce the chances of you catching Covid and very nearly completely eliminate the chance of getting severe Covid which could kill you, which is the most important part.

Anti-vaxxers claimed that ‚Äònatural immunity‚Äô would provide permanent immunity too, but looks like that prediction was completely wrong too - ‚Äònatural immunity‚Äô fades over time just as quickly as vaccine resistance to Covid, and is also similarly reduced effectiveness against new strains.

So I‚Äôll take getting a booster every six months to a year, and maybe getting some minor cold-like symptoms if I do catch Covid anyway, and anti-vaxxers can have their 50 times greater chance of being hospitalized and/or dying when they catch Covid every year instead.

Again though, you are not presenting an actual scientific data to support your claims.  Because it doesn‚Äôt exist.  Neither I nor anyone else has claimed vaccines are a perfect protection, but the fact that it is far safer to be vaccinated than to be unvaccinated has been established by scientific studies over and over again all around the world.  You don‚Äôt have a single shred of actual scientific evidence to support your claim that the opposite is true.",1643673635

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","You dont really have to pair everyone, you know. Nina is not a great child and her paralogue is not great either, for example. Niles is a good unit but not necessarily a great combat unit. I do gotta say, i did NilesxMozu a while back and he is a damn great player phase nuke, with Quickdraw cause he is fast enough to double, so if you ask me, i would go for that.

Silas is another good to ok unit that you dont really need to pair up for stats or class changes. He is good at what he does and after a while you can drop him. I do like Sophie's paralogue for the Energy Drop that makes reaching the benchmarks for Endgame boss easier, but Sophie herself is another not great unit. Same with Azura's child, but that paralogue is great for exp, in case you need it. So i would actually say SilasxAzura just to get those 2 paralogues out of the way. None of them, nor their childs get something worth it out of that pairing, but it is a fast one cause you get them both really early. Beruka is another good pairing i guess so she can pass down Wyvern, but Silas dosnt really need her.

Finally, until the last shop upgrade, pairing everyone is not that good because you dont get enough seals to class change back and forth all the units you want and even then, while CQ gives you a good amount of money, im not sure you have enough to buy seals for every pair, their childs, skill dip then go back to a class you want, etc etc. So again, you dont have to pair everyone and use all the childs. It is easier to use 4 or 5 pairings and go all out with them (The royals mostly).

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt; People who have never been in a large company --- maybe who have successfully run a small one, THINK that big companies are just more powerful businesses. They aren't.

I believe that's true. On that point I had no idea about how commonplace glut is in big business or about the insane level of lavish spending going until I saw it first hand when I decided to ""get a real job"" a few years ago. It's mind-boggling. I wish more people knew. It's hard to believe because we are conditioned to believe (at least I was) corporations (especially the big shiny publicly traded ones) are these PERFECT machines designed to maximize efficiency, increase profits, and innovate - or die by the trial of fire in the ""free market"". 

Boy is that untrue and on so many levels. One example that isn't too abstract is employee retention 'incentives' like a stocked open cafeteria and 'gifts'. I have a friend who works at Bloomberg who told me she was bored after idling in a Teams lobby all day and did the math on the freebies she's got since Covid began, after her boss told her Bloomberg is delivering Purple (brand) pillows to the entire division. Over $2000 in junk like pillows, designer coffee mugs, massage vouchers for the in-house masseuse (yup) and on and on. 

Sounds good, right? Sure, but if I were her and I'm sure she'd agree, I'd much rather have a $2k salary bump over some junk.",1643673636

She immediately said, ""You know you could live with us forever.."" I gave him a confused look and he continued, ""We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here"". I then said ""How.. How did you know?"" He then giggled and said ""Because we've been watching you, silly!""

This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. He then said, ""I talked with the Mechanic and she agreed that you would be PERFECT for Terraria, you just have to do...one thing"". He then stared at me and looked deep into my eyes and said ""...You have to kill yourself for the transfer to work correctly."" I then gave him some questions, ""How long do I have before the deal expires?"" She then said ""Mechanic said 3 months.."" I added by saying ""What's the most painless way?..."" He giggled again, ""Suicide will require pain buuut...if you want it quick...Get a voodoo doll and a nice drop in lava works.

I then agreed and he gave me a shitty piece of information I already knew, then said ""I know this will be tough but once it's over and done, you'll get to live here!""

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","You made a key assumption that is entirely false. You seem to think that an ""easy mode"" wouldn't affect anyone who plays at normal difficulty or any of these vets. But you're actually wrong. Now hear me out. 

This whole thing assumes that a player, before ever entering the game, will know what they want out of it. But people really dont, we say we like x but actually like y. What dark souls does is by having set difficulty it gives us this ""flavor"" of difficulty. 

Say you have some player who is up against some hard boss and cant beat it after the first few tries. Now this player isnt a sweaty vet. If the easy option is there they will change the difficulty and beat the boss. This seems fine, However, say there isnt one. Well, now they have to learn the attack patterns, figure out an underutlized mechanic, get new gear that will be more effective, etc etc. And at the end of that boss when they beat it on their last estus after trying and trying they feel overjoyed and yell at the screen over their victory. 

That was my experience against pontiff sulivan in ds3. The joy I felt after beating him is the happiest I have ever been gaming. And I assure if there was a difficulty slider I wouldve just set it to easy mode and never had that experience. 

Now to be clear, not everyone will have that experience. Some just dont like that. But how many players will simply change difficulty in the face of a difficult experience and lose that amazing experience that could only come from that sort of difficulty? The point of any video game, especially dark souls isnt mass appeal, its to make a player have some experience only that game can create.

I should also note the bulk of my arguement comes from this video. I think its nice to think about accessability, but not if the core vision of the game is put at risk.

You aren't running a close range loadout. You have a sniper and a handcannon. From the angle of red on the radar, the enemy pretty much WILL be turning 90 degrees to fight you. You're right up there in the doorway.  Consider your ranges. If you didn't have a super up, it would still be advised to back up. Turn around and sprint to one of the two exits out the back of donut and then either snipe or be ready with HC. When that guy slides in and kills your teammate you can easily retreat or challenge from range.",1643673642

"CoronavirusColorado","t5_2gn67c","First of all, I‚Äôm sorry you lost your friend. He did all he could, being vaxxed, and had an incredibly unfortunate compromise of his immune system at the worst possible moment. 

I *clearly* said it‚Äôs the unvaxxed i have no sympathy for, and i specifically said the ones I feel bad for are those like your friend, who did all they could and still got incredibly unlucky. 

I too have lost several people who were close to me, one of whom was incredibly foolish and chose not to get vaxxed. I wish i could‚Äôve convinced him, done something more. His kids might still have their dad around. Two other folks *were* vaxxed, but just got unlucky somehow. One day we may know why. Another one, a college classmate, died of unrelated causes after having an accident and not being able to find an ICU that would take him. Fucking tragic, and totally avoidable if more people would‚Äôve been vaxxed during Delta. 

So, I care more about these things than you give me credit for, for incredibly personal reasons. Working in healthcare, I also care about the devolving state of mental health in our society, about the isolation of a nation, about kids who will have long term troubles, about healthcare providers (some in my family) who are being put thru hell‚Ä¶. it just doesn‚Äôt end. 

This is unfortunately about statistics and probabilities, an incredibly hard thing to digest in the midst of grief. And though this happens one person, one story at a time, it‚Äôs also a system of illness, medical care, social services, hidden impacts‚Ä¶

I know you‚Äôre grieving. I‚Äôve been there. But please don‚Äôt try to blame me for the passing of someone who did the right things and got terribly unlucky. 

I hope you find peace.",1643673642

&gt; I understand your point and I think that the testing of an actual API response would then form part of the integration tests instead? But maybe not since they'd still rack up api usage costs also.

Well, sort of, ish. But in the case of mocks that's irrelevant, and I think this is possibly why it looks a bit like gobbledygook (I can remember being in the same position). You're maybe approaching this from the wrong angle, and it's simpler than you think.

What you have to bear in mind here is that, if you are mocking something, you are *removing* that from the test. It allows you to test a unit, rather than testing that various bits of the system work together.

So take, for example, take a React component that within it has a hook that makes a network call, and the hook returns something like `{ data, loading error }`. For a ""unit"" test (I'm not sure how unit-ey it is when you need to render a whole mini app to run it, but anyway) you *do not care* about the actual call, the only thing you care about it those return values and what the result of them is on the rendering of the component. So *maybe* you just mock that hook, and the mock just returns one of those three known values for three tests.",1643673643

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","Harrison Fritz, a 25-year-old who works in the finance industry, had invested $8,000 ‚Äî most of his savings ‚Äî into GameStop shares last January, lured in by the possibility of profit. But the abrupt shutdown in trading upset Mr. Fritz. Big guys on Wall Street had decided to cut little guys off in the middle of something, he felt. Why were they allowed to do that?

‚ÄúIt created a huge, deep-seated hatred and feeling of being robbed of what could have been life-changing money for many people,‚Äù Mr. Fritz said. ‚ÄúYou really saw the movement change from being about financial gain to being a way to sort of get back at ‚Äòthe man.‚Äô Many people on Reddit began using the terminology ‚Äòrevolution.‚Äô‚Äù

Kunal Gogna, a 36-year-old clinical data scientist in San Diego, began trading stocks at the beginning of the pandemic. Knowing nothing about finance, he began by following the advice of Keith Gill, a 34-year-old Massachusetts man who called himself Roaring Kitty. Mr. Gill had invested heavily in GameStop‚Äôs stock and was encouraging others to join him beginning in mid-2019.

‚ÄúHe provided a very clear thesis,‚Äù Mr. Gogna said, explaining that Mr. Gill‚Äôs work was an accessible contrast to other information ‚Äî ‚Äúcharts, all these dizzying things‚Äù ‚Äî out there. ‚ÄúIt can be overwhelming,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand I think that‚Äôs designed to keep the normal people away.‚Äù",1643673644

With little effort I remembered an line draw low polly of a cow rotating like 15 to 30¬∞

Its playing on my mind when I try to remember it, probably from an cartoon like Simpsons. I imaginsted a cow flying to a tornado probably from a 2000 American movie.

If i put my mind to work, like focus on this for like half a minute, I can guess the colors I could use to draw it or represente it in the world, I can estimate their height compared to others objects in the scene a saw. But I definitely can't replicate it. I can find lots of references and do something close to it.

I can't imagine sounds (in fact I don't know if regular people can). Like I can't remember my mom voice. I can hear someone voice and say its similar or not, obviously I have memory to distinguish between people voice tho.

I always had difficulty to explain things to people because of this. For me was easier to explain an objective by purpose, location and as last resource property (like if it was metallic with wood, if it looks heavy or light, if the surface was reflective or painted, the geometric forms in the object). I think it was related to my aphantasia, I didn't cared for details or superficial stuffs. Like if my cloth was x color or y brand, I classified my cloths from how it feel for me. The ones who fits well and use outside my house and the ones who fits poorly and I used inside my house or to do chores.

Obviously when I grew older I knew the importance of being part of a group and take more attention to this but just to exemplifies how my mind without social constraints thinks",1643673644

Sometimes it‚Äôs so loud and hectic that it‚Äôs hard to tell anything is happening. Sometimes you gotta take a second to receive all of the information and then your brain has to make an informed decision. Have you ever witnessed something from afar while being the one who must intervene? Because you can‚Äôt just instantly teleport there. Your body takes time to react as well as your mind. Then you have to get all the way over to the action.

I highly doubt a teacher would watch someone dump choccy on another student and just sit idly by until it escalates. Even the student didn‚Äôt have time to think- he just had a knee jerk reaction. Never mind all of the informed decision and getting over there because this is actually happening to him.

I don't really know what they do with cloud computing, but i think it would also count more to service than to production.

Apologies for the double pic, not sure how that happened.

I would've taken more pics of the Cidhna Mine quest expansion but want to leave it a surprise - there's some funny stuff and neat extras!

Surprisingly it ran very well aside from [breakdance central Morthal](https://imgur.com/a/usnnps6).. I believe it was primarily due to the Marshlands because that foliage was T H I C C. Also I missed a conflict with Lanterns of Skyrim and Cities of the North. 

Tested Embers XD, but there might be a conflict there too.

You include flower beds, which are also cosmetic, but not these other larger items.

Maybe I missed it but I don't see the furnace replacement in there, just repairs. Same with replacement/repair of major appliances, which maybe last 10 years these days.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","**Very** important, they can be a great indicator of your baseline, and it's much more important for fluidity to have consistent fps without drops. But, they might not even tell the entire story! I find frame time spikes can tell it even more accurately. Here's an example.

Your game is ticking over at 70fps average, with 1% low of 55fps. That could mean that the game regularly bottoms out in heavier parts of the scenes right around 55fps, or it could mean it's still mostly around 70, but with bad frame time spikes.

70fps = a frame every 14.3ms on average, 55fps = 18.2ms on average

So that 55fps 1% low measurement could have been 55 frames all around 18.2ms, or for example, 53 frames rendered at 14.3ms (on track for 70fps average), but two frames within that second that took \~121ms to render, and since it's averaged out to all frames rendered that second, you get the 55fps 1% lows.

Seeing that it only took you 25 minutes makes me think 1) MoP is probably a better choice, specifically for the final platforming section which requires some counterintuitive pogoing.

The fact that ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù is a more or less completely arbitrary category that was determined first by a statistician who Disney know anything about health, then regulated by  insurance companies (who also don‚Äôt know anything about health) who were just looking for ways to charge fat people more, and then *lowered* to its current BMI threshold by drug companies who wanted to make money selling ‚Äúweight loss‚Äù drugs is Incredibly Important

"The10thDentist","t5_233710","I get what you're saying, but I think you're underestimating the skill that goes into taking technically good photos, regardless of artistic merit. To take technically good photos, even if frames poorly, one must understand the fundamentals of lighting and a few other things. For instance, in portraits, to take a technically good photo, you have to know not to have the light source behind the subject, and you have to position them in a way that they aren't partially in light and shadow. 

Also, it greatly depends on the subject. I mainly take wildlife photos, and I'd be willing to bet that if I handed my camera to someone who'd never tried it before, without setting anything for them or giving them any instructions, they would not be able to produce technically good photos. There are many complexities involved in photography, especially when dealing with fast-moving and far-away subjects. For instance, my camera doesn't have an automatic mode. The average person would have to know to use a high enough shutter speed to freeze the action and a small enough aperture to get enough of the subject in focus while keeping ISO high enough to get enough light while low enough to not make the photo grainy. They'd have to know that if you want any detail in the subject you need to have the sun at your back when taking the photo. They'd have to have the ability to stay zoomed in enough/get close enough to the subject to have enough detail in the photo while still being able to keep the subject in the viewfinder. They'd have to know what type of autofocus to use and keep the focal point on the moving subject. 

Now, I get that that is all very specific and wouldn't apply to every field of photography, but that isn't really the point anyway. Even if we discount that and say that sure anyone can pick up an iPhone and take technically decent photos, that doesn't give any validity to OP's claim that photography doesn't require artistic ability. Just because someone can make a technically decent photo doesn't mean it is a decent photo. I don't think your pointing to visual fidelity is fair. Sure, it is much easier to take a photo that looks clearer and can be identified than a painting. However, that does not mean that it is any easier to take a photo that was able to pass as artistic than to paint well.",1643673649

2. There is a reason why we don't have term limits on doctors or lawyers or auto mechanics or graphical designers, or anyone else. It takes a lot of time to be good at something, and no one is going to be good at something if they know the gig is up in four years.
3. Term limits vastly increase the power of lobbyists. Legislators that get replaced every 4 years don't really know much about how the legislative process works, and have no time to specialize in any issue. At the same time, they know this is a short term gig, and have to look for the next thing to do. And in come the lobbyists, carrying the prewritten bills and the job offers..",1643673649

Look at the Indiana Limestone Handbook, or other limestone handbooks (Rocky Mountain Masonry Institute, Natural Stone Institute) they normally do a good job of providing architectural details/sections for installation of stone. You can do thin veneer on almost any structures as long as the fasteners for the metal lathe are strong enough for the shear force they experience. Full thickness veneer just needs a ledge for the vertical load to bear on. Using steel is not a requirement for using masonry and I would say that this Chateau was probably over engineered if they used steel studs (I am not an engineer so there may have been a structural reason).",1643673650

"Ayahuasca","t5_2s8ss","This is a good summary.

I've done both multiple times. With Ayahuasca i had the experience that it wasn't merely a 'drug' but an entire bifurcation of human endeavor, different but equal in magnitude to the West's tradition of Humanities, Universities, Enlightenment, etc.

The same way one can feel honoured and humbled to have participated in the Grand western projects of Intellect, Reason, Universities, and Individualism, one can feel honoured and humbled by participating in the Ayahuascan tradition of Deep Empathy, Connection with Nature and Ancestors, Non-Separateness with Plant, Animal and Energy manifestations in deep time.

Of course it's hard to put into words, but i totally get what you get what you mean by calling it a part of 'Amazonian Plant Medicine' and not just simply Ayahuasca, I had the feeling that it was the result of millenia of work and deep exploration into inner ""technology"", the same way that the western tradition represents millenia of ""outer"" technology aimed at intellect capable of drastically modifying the environment. But i never felt judgmental about either side of the comparison. Ayahuasca gave me the opportunity to reflect on my own western heritage with a maximum sense of empathy and feel what was good about it. I reflected on my teachers, and science fiction authors such as Ursula K. Leguin who represent our defense of forests and rebirth of forests via the written/spoken word. I sensed the message that we can create new forests by focusing our language on this endeavour, and that the Western tradition of the Humanities is greatly equiped to multiply forests thru the force of our language.

Possible, but I doubt it. The argument against his coaccused was always much weaker than against him (since the kid was the driver). Where they're equally culpable the youth will, as a general rule, get a lesser sentence -- but they're not equally culpable here.

&gt;Might even be time served

Unlikely here. If he's sentenced as a youth, the YCJA doesn't grant credit for pretrial custody. If he's sentenced as an adult, it's because a sentence under the YCJA would, in the Court's estimation, be too light. If he's sentenced as an adult for murder, he's looking at a life sentence with a 10 year minimum parole ineligibility, and he gets 1:1 credit from the date of his arrest. If he's sentenced as an adult for manslaughter, he'd be eligible for enhanced credit, but he'd be looking at a sentence in excess of 3 years (the maximum under the YCJA for manslaughter) because of the court's decision that a 3 year sentence is insufficient to hold him accountable, a necessary precondition to sentence him as an adult. That's the only scenario where he potentially gets time served.",1643673651

You or anyone. It's just an insanely entitled thing to do. 

I elect to sleep with *the person I am intimate with* in this bed, not them, and apparently all of their siblings whenever they decide to spend the night and it's apparently *so cold*, sharing a bed is the only reasonable option. You are subjecting your boyfriend to a total invasion of his own personal space and boundaries simply because ""you're fine with it."" 

Question for you: Would he have done that if your boyfriend was there? Because tbh if this is truly so super duper normal, why not? And if this was such a normal thing to do, why wasn't your boyfriend prepared for this possibility? 

Answer for you: *Because it's not a normal or appropriate or thoughtful thing to do* in your situation. 

You are both *very much adults*, and you share a space with someone else - this is not an appropriate ""default"" sleeping situation anymore.

"euphoria","t5_2ssjq","i think they had a brief discussion over that in season 1, Jules asking if Rue was okay with all the alcohol around them and her saying yes. addiction is a million things, not just being tempted by substances around you, we‚Äôve seen that Rue‚Äôs main trigger for using is emotions she wants to suppress rather than just being around it. But also arguably the biggest theme of their relationship is how Jules isn‚Äôt responsible for Rue‚Äôs sobriety and doesn‚Äôt want to be. When she‚Äôs crying in the car i read that as sort of a ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù response where she knows she can‚Äôt really help without getting even more hurt or making it her responsibility next time too so she just didn‚Äôt say anything.
I have a theory that similar to last season‚Äôs finale, and Jules‚Äôs mom showing up, we‚Äôll get the scene from the girls‚Äô perspective before the 10 second kiss. we saw Elliot leave the room, and when he came back they started a game of truth or dare. maybe Jules tried to confront Rue about the fake orgasm, sexuality or whatever.
I find it very telling that Jules interpreted Rue‚Äôs and Elliot‚Äôs intense friendship as sexual, while for Rue it was purely about drugs. Actually the two things are very much linked in her story, (and Jules is all about self-destructive sexual habits like cheating and the Cal-incident) in some way it makes sense for Jules to assume the relationship was sexual and Elliot seemed to be in denial about the seriousness of her issues until this episode, and by extension their relationship bc let‚Äôs be honest, Rue doesn‚Äôt give a shit about Elliot. literally their first scene she says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my new favorite person‚Äù bc he had drugs and she‚Äôs never interested beyond doing drugs together, he probably didn‚Äôt want to think about that aspect so he just went along with the ‚Äúbest friends‚Äù thing.

But yeah generally i just feel like both Elliot and Jules wanted a three way and neither really considered that Rue probably isn‚Äôt into that, while Rue just wanted to get high. All three had selfish intentions, Jules is clearly not done with men, Rue‚Äôs too high to love anyone at this point and Elliot just wanted to fuck his new buddy‚Äôs gf.

""We've got a bunch of pre-made characters we can slot into any given story on a whim"". Great planning.

&gt;And Disney, funnily enough, bought an already established story to them with the story of the ST. Some guy named Lucas had already done a lot of the work decades before! Talk about luck.

So in your mind, Peter Jackson adapting LOTR is exactly the same as new sequels being made to the OT?

&gt;Three entirely new sequels? Wow that is alot. Did you know he had to invent three prequels? Insane right? 

Not sure you're quite following this. Lucas just joined up the dots to make the PT fit the OT. He already knew where his story needed to go and had the characters to tell it. That's *not the same* as having to come up with three entirely new stories with no pre-set end point.

&gt;Well that is just an opinion because what defines as intricate? I'd say the first two were planned out in that sense. What isn't an opinion is that there was more planning involved with the other previous trilogies than the newest one.

That is an opinion, yes. And it's one I disagree with. The OT and PT weren't intricately planned out beforehand. Lucas made them up as he went. The PT perhaps had the most planning, arguably, but only by virtue of having that pre-established endpoint in place, so that ""planning"" was mostly ""well I've got to make sure Palpatine ends up as the Emperor here, and oops, don't forget to show Darth Vader right at the end"".",1643673652

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Envision Florida Geometry Topic 7 Test Help!!

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Well, if Celtic pagans had direct extant descendants, one could argue: yes, absolutely. The problem with using Celtic Pagans as an example is that very little of preliterate, pre-Christian Celtic culture has survived. 

While there are definitely descendants of those Celtic Pagans of western Europe's Iron Age in the world today (myself among them, albeit distantly), the culture and religion themselves haven't survived in a direct, unbroken line to the present day. 

The upshot is: what is today the closest thing to Celtic Pagan culture or religion is largely a modern construct, influenced in equal measure by limited archaeo/historical understandings of preliterate, pre-christian Celtic culture, and modern Neopaganism. The original Celtic Paganism has not survived. Blame christianization, I guess.

By contrast, Jews, Druze, and Sikhs have been practicing their cultural and religious ways of life unbroken from the present day all the way back to their respective founding in largely the same ways as way back then.

I mean, I know that a referendum on Crimea's status would lead to it joining the Russian Federation and I recognize that Crimea probably will not be returning to Ukraine anytime soon and I am opposed to any use of force to return it to Ukraine.

My contention is the use of force by the Russian Federation, in 2014, to secure the territory. I feel that such actions will embolden bad actors.

I would have much preferred negotiations between the Crimean's, Ukrainians' and Russians. Failing that, an autonomously organized Crimean referendum. But alas, life is not so straight forward.",1643673654

Yeah I have no issue with this. I understand all game engines can only render things up to a certain distance, at least without introducing massive amounts of lag. However I do believe this could possibly be improved to an extent with optimizations. I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre using a proprietary engine but if they are they could benefit greatly from something like Unreal Engine that does a lot of the optimization for them. My main issue though is with the textures. There‚Äôs just no excuse for textures that bad nowadays. There are plenty of examples of games on the Switch with better textures.",1643673654

Regarding soba noodles. They not fired, they are just dried. Just cook then like it says on the package, but use more water then you think and stir then often, they tend to stick together.

3. People believe what they want to believe and will follow their confirmation bias into the grave as to not bruise their ego.
4. Even though I like to think that stringing facts into a coherent structure will convince most people of anything, the truth is that the thing that has the most influence over a person's mind is the speaker and the way they speak, and rarely the content.
5. Due to a surprisingly low level of introspective tendencies in the general population, people will not only fall prey to the Dunning-Kruger effect, but also, and I don't know if there's a real name for this or not, something I like to refer to as Tony Stark Syndrome, where they'll begin to think that if they know a lot about some particular topic they will also be just as proficient in others (like Tony Stark saying he became an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics in a single night).

The one upside of being an anarchist community is that freedom creates a lot more wealth and prosperity then central planning. So if you presuppose that your people can keep a government in check, they can keep an anarchist society in check too, but they'll be wealthier.",1643673656

Protests are single issue one time events. 

The opposition gets to hammer the PM every week.  

Opposition is protected by parliamentary convention. 

Protest is easily spun into front pages of ‚Äòlefty louts destroying the nation‚Äô and rapidly cost the opposition votes as the public buy into the narrative of the angry left coming to take their homes and possessions by force.

Oh the irony of being called a heathen for not eating fish on Fridays while I went about not eating *any* meat *every* day of the week!

Mr. Gogna said he had persuaded her to move her savings into GameStop as well. (She delivered a healthy baby.)

As he dug deeper, spending hours reading what other traders had posted about GameStop, Mr. Gogna became convinced that something far darker was going on. Several posts detailed what users were calling a plot by Wall Street, the Securities and Exchange Commission and a trade clearinghouse to create fake or ‚Äúsynthetic‚Äù GameStop shares.

The goal of the plot, according to the posts, was to help hedge funds pull off the short trade they couldn‚Äôt last year. Shorting a stock involves an investor‚Äôs borrowing shares from another and immediately selling them, hoping that their price will fall and that the investor can buy them back cheaply, return them and pocket the difference. The theories were circulating on a Reddit forum called Superstonk, which had been created in March, after GameStop had receded from the headlines, by die-hard fans of the company. There are detailed research papers called ‚Äúdue diligences‚Äù ‚Äî DDs for short ‚Äî laying out far-fetched theories about how various Wall Street actors were secretly manipulating GameStop and other meme stocks.",1643673659

"Glock43X","t5_vwxmi","507K ALL DAY! 

I just got mine, I decided to get the little recoil nubs filed down on the factory MOS slide for a flush fit..

Couple things, I have a 48 MOS and I did my research, a TON of it. The 507K is by far the best option. 
- First: don‚Äôt get the green GR507K, they have some technical issues with factory reset. Look it up online, anything you‚Äôre going to get has the potential to be one of these faulty units that only exists with the GR dot version. The other thing, the plate required to mount on a factory 48 MOS has some issues as well. First the corrosion / oxidization has been something those that live in humid areas have had to deal with. Additionally the plate crate more opportunities for future zeroing and you will have to get suppressor sights to cowitness. 

The best part for me is the housing construction. The thing is basically a roofing hammer. It is by far the most well constructed micro RDS. The housing also sports a side load battery tray. This is HUGE because you will never have to take the sight off to replace the battery. Additionally the bottom load ‚Äúopen‚Äù battery tray on the likes of others sick as Shield or Swampfox allow for moisture to get in. This may be an eye roll kinda comment but I lived in Florida for years and moisture WILL find a way. Even in dry climates your sweat on hot days can find its way in there when carried every day. 

Lastly the zeroing tools are just well thought out. The 32 MOS is awesome for a nice contrast in brighter environments. If you are training heavily on target acquisition it‚Äôs like a cheat code, especially if you start your first 50 rounds with the 2 MOA and then switch to the 32 MOA circle. 

I‚Äôll include some links to good YouTube reviews.

*****
&gt; Attempts to develop smart guns have stalled: Smith &amp; Wesson got hit with a boycott, a German company&amp;#039;s product was hacked, and a New Jersey law aimed at promoting smart guns has raised the wrath of defenders of the Second Amendment.

&gt; The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the firearms industry trade association, says it does not oppose smart guns as long as the government doesn&amp;#039;t mandate their sale.

&gt; &amp;quot;If I had a nickel for every time in my career I heard somebody say they&amp;#039;re about to bring us a so-called smart gun on the market, I&amp;#039;d probably be retired now,&amp;quot; said Lawrence Keane, senior vice president of the NSSF.Guns coming to market could trigger a 2019 New Jersey law requiring all gun shops in the state to offer smart guns after they become available.

"LowSodium2042","t5_4zs5j5","The change in approach to gaming (the incessant need for more content, levels, and unlocks) reflects a change in people that the developers are simply reacting to.

Back in the day, when we all played Halo CE for hours and hours on end without unlocks or complaints, we did so because we enjoyed it.

Since then the internet has evolved, the smartphone was released, social media came to pass, and equities investing has changed dramatically.

Thanks to smartphones and social media we collectively have the attention span of a goldfish.

Thanks to modern investing, stockholders expect exponential growth tied to profits that increase orders of magnitude each quarter. Aggressive moneization and growth strategies are beloved at these entertainment behemoths.

Put those two developments together and we have a perfect recipe for the bullshit we're experiencing today.  Players that constantly cry that they need more, more levels, more maps, more guns, more skins, more battlepasses, more more more. And you have management that's happy to give it to them to squeeze every cent of profits.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I mean I played this matchup a lot in high challenger and cait absolutely gets outranged by mantra + jhin W. The trading pattern is very easy and foolproof for the karma lane while cait/lux rely heavily on bindings which are hard to hit against karma MS + jhin boots start. Outpoking is also unreliable as you would have to play much better to get through the 4 pots of jhin before you eat too much karma poke. Cait Q is not poke as it's way too easy to dodge compared to mantra and lux's E while reliable can be shielded quite easily. The only way for cait/lux to win is as i said all-in but if you don't find one then you're fucked. Just because Cait has more range via AA's doesn't mean she's gonna hit anyone in this lane as jhin has better pushing power combined with karma and when cait tries to depush with Q she can't trade against jhin anymore. I suggest watching some vods of pro players playing this exact matchup as its very common in challenger (especially korea) and you will see that jhin karma always has push unless they're scared of lv2-3 gank. Not to mention jhin karma has insane gank setup which can fuck cait if she plays too aggressively. One death means hell for the rest of the game.",1643673661

"Christians","t5_2qk5n","I‚Äôve been attacked by a decent amount, it was the begginging of my walk when I really changed my ways and decided to follow God and exit the world/Matrix 

If you‚Äôre getting attacked it‚Äôs usually a good sign that you‚Äôre getting closer to being in God‚Äôs will and the demons just want to make the transition miserable for you. Keep the faith, believe in God and within time you will overcome them. Pray for revelations and ask God to help lead you and then listen in and you‚Äôll hear the spirit speaking to you and guiding you. 

Demons will try to twist lies and make them seem like truth and then try to make you feel sad and miserable and in shame but Jesus has already died for our sins so don‚Äôt intentionally sin but also don‚Äôt feel guilty for the sins you have committed. The price has already been paid. Know who you are and know who Christ is or begin to really get to know who Christ is and eventually the the word of God being exercised in you will overcome them. 

The demons are kind of like prison guards trying to keep you stuck in the Matrix/the ways of the world. With time, faith and trust you‚Äôll eventually break free. My final break through was when I had a vision where the Word became a sword and I had to battle it out with the demons and kill them with this sword. This was in dreams and visions. This is what Jesus means by overcoming the world. 

As for Deliverence ministry and all that I think it‚Äôs overkill and puts too much focus on the powers of the enemy instead of the power of God. We have CHRIST in us, we don‚Äôt need some deliverance ministry yelling and screaming to get demons out. I tried it many times and maybe it worked to some extent but more then anything it just devalued the power I already had in me and instilled more fear.",1643673662

If it's any consolation, the best feature I've ever written didn't make the second round in the Nicholl or Austin last year, and got a 5 on the Blcklst. But that very same draft landed me in the top 2% of another major competition and landed me my very first manager.

You state that Ti is objective because it ""rejects"" intuition/feeling and personal experience yet I don't see how that would necessarily result in ""objectivity"" whatsoever. I don't think that ""true or false"" statement conclusions also would refer to objectivity as well, considering it's still from the internal world so I'm not really sure what you mean by this.

Thus far, *I* don't believe cryptocurrency has demonstrated any new utility, nor have the underlying  projects created any functions which couldn't ultimately just use existing payment mechanisms. The projects themselves haven't shown themselves to do anything that couldn't be accomplished before and that's readily apparent when you look at how much use these coins are actually getting versus how much trading volume they see.

I remain open to the possibility that something will come along that is a new product or service that couldn't exist on its own using conventional means of payment and requires a cryptocurrency to perform its purpose, one which sees real usage and isn't ultimately just a proxy of the dollar. Until then I'm not going to be watching videos on a shitty bootleg version of Youtube on a Chromium-based browser that pays me a few cents a month to see their ads just because those things have special coins instead of watching YouTube on Firefox and getting fed whatever ads Google has tailored to persuade me using a million and a half data points that say things about me no one, not even myself, knows.",1643673665

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","&gt;	Non-living matter does not produce life, and it does not generate unfathomably long sequences of information. 

This is not a statement of fact as you are presenting it to be. It does seem to imply that you think that life forming was a singular event though, which few proponents of abiogenesis would claim.

It‚Äôs an incremental process, not inorganic chemistry and then instantly to life. There‚Äôs simple replication without life, complex molecules forming without life, cell membranes and so on, all developing independent of anything we would call life. We‚Äôve made self replicating and organising microscopic machines ourselves, quite recently, but nobody would call them life.

They are the groundwork for life though, and the arrival of single called organisms that can self replicate. That being the status quo for a very long time before anything like sexual reproduction and what we would call life existed.

Even today we can see some grey area with something like a virus. A virus has many qualities that we could attribute to being alive, but it also fails in other conditions.

There‚Äôs not just some on/off switch where something is alive or it isn‚Äôt. Like the definition of a species, it‚Äôs a little bit grey.

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 3.49% and $0.49 as of 2021), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F with an **established GAFS member**, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.

I really wouldn‚Äôt recommend using a collar on a puppy this young, myself and my family have nearly 60 years experience with dogs, puppies and breeding and we don‚Äôt recommend a collar until around 8 weeks old. When they‚Äôre babies they‚Äôre more active and much less aware of their surroundings, susceptible to getting it caught, injured and they‚Äôre less strong so any pressure on their breathing is a little dangerous.

If you do continue with a collar, I recommend only when you‚Äôre with the puppy, its just not worth the risk otherwise and collar training isn‚Äôt much harder later on.",1643673667
"SteamDeck","t5_4rfocy","Thanks for the informed reply, very helpful. So it looks like we are up to three options.

I find the idea of a VM very appealing, perhaps someone will be kind enough to write a how-to guide for us newbies (or as you say automate the process with a script). This has the advantage of not requiring additional hardware, and the disadvantage of being limited by the space available on the internal drive. (Maybe)

HOWEVER FOR ME PERSONALLY THIS WILL NOT WORK. Because Mihoyo has iron-clad anti-cheat that makes it so Genshin Impact (the main reason I want Windows to begin with) will not run in a VM, at least not without modifying the VM parameters (and I would not know how to do this except for the one specific VM installation where someone wrote a tutorial).

I also feel that the approach of using an external M.2 drive could work if an enclosure becomes available, but not so much if you have to attach via an external cable because that would ruin the portability of the device. Also, this has the advantage of being simple to setup and add additional storage space. The downsides are additional bulk, additional cost, and any minor hits on performance.

Finally, there is dual booting, along with the pros and cons you already stated.",1643673667

Best way to do this is to 1) ask for expectations up front (so if you fulfill them, they will be more likely to score you well) and 2) know your role on the team. If you know your role, you know the things you can do to contribute (do these) and you know what will piss people off. Don‚Äôt do something you‚Äôre not comfortable doing that could put the patient at risk- ask questions if you‚Äôre unsure. Also, don‚Äôt do anything that would make your residents look poorly‚Äî don‚Äôt EVER pass blame, don‚Äôt try to outshine them.

"MSILaptops","t5_2y4t7","The fact that you're limiting the entire laptop to 100w is the problem.  My 2070 mobile will do over 100w just by itself easily under load.

As far as you reading about GPU memory being slow using that usb-c cable/throttling; it's quite intentional I'm afraid. The fast power switching necessary in a dynamic, load varying environment of doing anything GPU intensive simply can't be done with the usb-c setup.  The lightning port isn't designed to ramp up power like that quickly vs a typical AC plug.

Recall, the best you're going to get out of a PD USB-C setup is  20VDC at 5A with 100w and I could be wrong on this final point, but I believe the port wasn't designed to consistently deliver that 100w at 20VDC at 5A, or any combination of voltage/current to get to that 100w.

So I believe what you're reading into is a couple of things, the inability of USB-C to provide enough and consistent power to the GPU, and it's inability to power switch quickly enough for any level of gaming.

I suspect your laptop with that 100w usb-c setup isn't even producing 100w all the time as a result.",1643673668

&gt; 
&gt; 

""The presidential candidacy and presidency of Donald Trump prompted grave concerns among political scientists regarding accelerated democratic backsliding in the United States.[178][179] In a 2019 journal article, political scientists Robert C. Lieberman, Suzanne Mettler, and others wrote that Trump's presidency presented a threat to the American democratic order because it simultaneously brought together three specific trends‚Äî""polarized two-party presidentialism; a polity fundamentally divided over membership and status in the political community, in ways structured by race and economic inequality; and the erosion of democratic norms""‚Äîfor the first time in American history.[180] Lieberman noted that Trump has ""repeatedly challenged the very legitimacy of the basic mechanics and norms of the American electoral process, invoking the specter of mass voter fraud, encouraging voter suppression, selectively attacking the Electoral College, and even threatening to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power"" and noted that ""Never in the modern era has a presidential candidate threatened to lock up his opponent; castigated people so publicly and repeatedly on the basis of their country of origin, religion, sex, disability, or military service record; or operated with no evident regard for facts or truth.""[180] In 2020, political scientists Alexander Cooley and Daniel Nexon, wrote that ""the Trump administration has consistently de-emphasized the importance of human rights and democracy in its rhetoric and while adopting language and tropes similar to those of right-wing, illiberal movements.""[181] Colley and Nexon cited Trump's praise of autocratic rulers, his echoing of ethno-nationalist rhetoric, his efforts to delegitimize journalism and journalists as ""fake news"" and his policies erecting new barriers to refugees and asylum-seekers as similar to politics ""found in backsliding regimes"".[181]

Political scientist Pippa Norris wrote in 2021 that democratic backsliding under Trump culminated in his attempts to undermine the peaceful transfer of power and overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Trump was defeated by Joe Biden; Trump incited an insurrection at the Capitol in January 2021, which briefly interrupted Congress's counting of the electoral votes, which formalized Trump's loss and the victory of the incoming president.[182]

The 2019 annual democracy report of the V-Dem Institute at the University of Gothenburg found that the U.S. under Trump was among the world's liberal democracies experiencing ""democratic erosion"" (but not full-scale ""democratic breakdown""). The report cited an increase in ""polarization of society and disrespect in public deliberations"" as well as Trump's attacks on the media and opposition and attempts to contain the judiciary and the legislature.[66] The report concluded, however, that ""American institutions appear to be withstanding these attempts to a significant degree"", noting that Democrats had won a majority the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections, which ""seems to have reversed the trajectory of an increasingly unconstrained executive"".[66] The V-Dem Institute's 2020 report found that the U.S. had ""registered a substantial decline in liberal democracy"" under Trump; the report also found that ""the United States of America is the only country in Western Europe and North America suffering from substantial autocratization.""[81]""

The fitment has been alround exellent for me. They are not so stuborn in my ears as some people claim but stay where i want them for many hours a day.

The disconecting issue is something i have been noticing up. It wil randomly disconect but if i click on it in the bluethoot tab it wil reconect and wil work flawlessly for quite a while.

I only had it not outputting audio once on my phone but a quick in the box and out fixed it.

So for the money i spend last year. It has been wel worth it for the amount of hours i have put one them. Wear them probably 10+ hours a day. Mostly idling. But atleast 3 hours watching youtube. And the batery is stil amazing.

Tldr.
Have been more than happy with the buds plus.

Biggest sample, I am sure the notion of samples confuses you.

&gt;Unknown n=120
2 doses n=44
1 dose n=55
Unvaccinated n=63

Thank you for perfectly proving my point.

Firstly because you will try to lie about it your claim was

&gt;yet every single year the majority of Measles cases in Japan are amongst the vaccinated

of those 282 only 15% are fully vaccinated and 19% are partially vaxxed. Even if you dishonestly add them up they make up the minority of cases.

97% of the Japanese population is at least single vaccinated, 93% double vaxxed.

Of the total 282 we would expect if the vaccine wasn't working 8.4 of them to be unvaccinated. Instead it is 63. Meaning they are 650% more likely to catch it than they should be statistically. 

If being double vaxxed didn't work we would expect the double vaxxed to make up 262.25 of the cases... instead they make up 44 meaning they are 496% less likely to be infected.

Thank you for presenting a truly excellent case for vaccination as crucial.",1643673670

If so are people who feel the same but do not have to endure the same hardships less legitimate because they haven‚Äôt proven their feelings as substantially with their actions?

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","I'm pretty optimistic as an Illini fan because I think we match up well against Wisconsin. 

Wisconsin relies a ton on their starting 5 to score points. Damonte will likely be the one guarding Johnny Davis, and he's one of the better on-ball defenders in the Big 10. Every point will be difficult to earn. Trent will be on Brad Davison. I think slowing those 2 players will be key for the Illini. Crowl vs Kofi should be an interesting matchup. Kofi has trouble guarding the perimeter, so Crowl may see himself open for quite a bit of open threes. Wisconsin's best bet is for Crowl to stretch the floor for them, and open up the lanes for their guards to score. 

Wisconsin isn't a great 3 point shooting team, so if the we can get hot from 3, I don't see a way the Badgers can keep up. Though, if we turn the ball over a ton, that may keep the game close.",1643673671

Given opportunity, hug her and tell her you care for her... Perhaps holding a bit longer than you normally would. Complimenting her on her care or her attentiveness, etc.

First, I‚Äôm not really asking if I should go to a chiropractor, I have my own opinions on that, but your point about going to a DO isn‚Äôt a bad one. Second, my experience has been that it‚Äôs a very mixed bag and physicians I‚Äôve worked with (both in clinicals and at the school) have widely varying opinions on the topic, but the general consensus I‚Äôve seen has been that if done well it can be helpful for symptomatic relief when the mechanism is appropriate but obviously isn‚Äôt a replacement for pcp management, so I neither agree with the idea that it‚Äôs poor form to go to one as a physician nor does it match what I‚Äôve seen.

She also was not doing this often she was laughing that from time to time she needs good fuck, being treat like a fuckmeat and whore, cum in her pussy and then return to her normal life of being lesbian and return to her girlfriend... with cum still in her pussy.

"HobbyDrama","t5_k4fie","I was an avid fan of ME1 and ME2, playing through both games multiple times to experience the whole breadth of story options.  95% of the way through ME3, I felt like this had a chance to cement it as the best gaming trilogy of all time.

Then the end happened, and I never even picked it up for a second playthrough.

I can't agree enough with your point that there was no Paragon-worthy ending.  Every single one of the three options was a complete nightmare, ethically speaking, and resulted in some form of cataclysmic outcome.  And yeah, sometimes it makes sense to force a no-win choice on the player; choosing who to sacrifice in ME1, for instance, was handled really well, and reminds the player that rarely can an actual flawless victory be achieved, there will always be consequences and casualties.

But the thought that destroying the Reapers would basically shatter the galaxy into fragments unable to communicate with each other or travel to one another, in addition to causing untold death and destruction, and that was the BEST you could manage to achieve... man, it was such a letdown for such a fantastic story.  I went in prepared for my character to make the ultimate sacrifice, not choose the method in which he became the ultimate monster.",1643673673

"CanadaSoccer","t5_2sf14","I did a similar thing this morning. Here's a list if you're wondering what to cheer for in other confederations.

There are a TON of assumptions that are needed to figure out how we go up to Pot 3 at this point.  Also potentially necessary for Canada to win remaining games. Then we need a combination of 3 of these scenarios:

1 - Egypt over Senegal *and* Egypt doesn't win in AFCON

2 - DR Congo over Morocco

3 - Ghana over Nigeria (may not be necessary as we may pass Nigeria anyway)

4 - Panama or Costa Rica directly qualifies over USA or Mexico (if both, by some miracle, that counts as 2 separate scenarios)

5 - Australia directly qualifies over Japan (without winning all remaining games would be nice)

6,7,8 - Turkey/North Macedonia win their UEFA Path (lol), Austria/Scotland win theirs, or Russia/Czechs win theirs

Not all of these are perfect assumptions as I'm not sure if we would pass some of the teams in all scenarios (e.g. Australia, Russia, Czechs, Austria). Also a few other assumptions in play (e.g. intercontinentals go right to Pot 4, Ecuador directly qualifies).",1643673673
"newzealand","t5_2qhma","The right to bodily autonomy is a thing that is at least acknowledged but not if it affects other people in a negative way. If the vaccination is ineffective or harmful we would surely be hearing a lot more, now that so many are vaccinated. There has been a few amount of reactions, like ischemia, affecting the heart but that same affect happens a lot more often from the actual virus infection. So we could say that bodily autonomy is paramount but then have to be willing to suffer far more as a population. What if when the polio vaccine came out decades ago. I had the vaccine. What if I and many others had refused it? (more precisely parents had refused) Polio would have wiped out many and still be doing it now. I don't dismiss the idea of bodily autonomy when it comes to some risky medical treatments that should be well known and that don't affect the health of others.",1643673673

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","7. Give them two weeks to reach out again.  


Two weeks?! I know, I know. But bear with me.

Someone may need to figure out how compatible you two are and what plans they can make even after a fantastic date. I wouldn't put too much stock in how quickly they text you‚Äîas long as it's within two weeks, that is. That's more than enough time for someone to decide whether or not they want to see you again. (At that point, it's safe to presume they're unable or unwilling to put you on their priority list.) Next!)

Pay attention to how they follow up when they do‚Äîthat‚Äôs an important of what you‚Äôre looking at. Waiting a week to send a one-word text (""Heyyyyy"") is very different from reaching out after 10 days with, ""Hey, things have been hectic at work, but I‚Äôd love to see you again‚Äîare you free next week?""

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA. Big time.

She just gave birth to your child, many people don't recover(physically or mentally) from pregnancy for up to a year. Sometimes even longer.

Another important detail to consider is what kind of complications occured during the pregnancy and how the birth went. Complicated pregnancies and stressful births can increase the likelihood of issues in post partum, including depression.

Even if it was an ""easy"" pregnancy and birth, it takes a lot out of a person and there are now permanent changes to her body that she is going to live with for the rest of her life to bring the life of your son into the world.

You should be showing her compassion, sympathy, and support during this time. Not yelling at her because of expectations that were set before giving birth. Circumstances change and it might be worth having someone, a friend or family member, move in for a little bit to not only help around the house and with the baby, but to also give her some company since you aren't around much anymore.

Not only that, but you are a parent too and it might be worth discussing with your work that you need more family time off for health complications (post partum depression, and it sounds like she is currently disabled if she is having a physically hard time taking care of herself like showering).

You need to do a lot more than apologize, you need to step up and take full responsibility. Don't just say I'm sorry or make excuses, show that you know why what you did was wrong. Have her discuss with you her struggles, see what you can do to assist, come up with solutions, and urge her to see a doctor for her post partum depression. She shouldn't be suffering for your lack of sympathy.",1643673674

The only way to counter the plot is for individual traders to buy GameStop shares at any price to keep them from falling ‚Äî the ‚Äúmother of all short squeezes,‚Äù or MOASS. Mr. Gogna is among the traders who have pledged to ‚Äúhold on for dear life,‚Äù or HODL, as the acronym goes.

Frank Partnoy, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said synthetic shares can exist because the same shares are often lent out to multiple short sellers at once, creating the impression that there are more shares than there really are. But, he added, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not true that the S.E.C. would be involved, and it‚Äôs not easy to do something like this. And it also would be manipulative, so it would be illegal.‚Äù

The Superstonk discourse shows how the gospel of meme stocks has taken hold among a wide range of investors ‚Äî from those who no longer buy into it, like Mr. Fritz, to others who accept it without question.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt explain it all,‚Äù said Ben Pomeroy, 38, who lives in Columbus, Ohio, and works for a manufacturing company. ‚ÄúI read it, and I was like, ‚ÄòOK, that makes sense,‚Äô but if you asked me to explain it I don‚Äôt think I could give you a very coherent answer as to why these synthetic shares exist.‚Äù He has continued to add to his GameStop position.",1643673674

The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the associated contributing factors for intelligence between individuals to the associated contributing factors for intelligence between groups. This assumes a genetic contribution because our from our priors we know that genetics play a role in intelligence.

By this logic we can say, ""genes play a role in intelligence and hair color, so if we find an IQ difference between brunette/blond, the default assumption should be that hair color genetically correlates with a difference in IQ."" 

This is not only faulty on its face, it presumes two huge factors: IQ properly correlates with genetic intelligence, and the populations being measured don't have environmental pressures that distort the IQ measurements. Since we already know these assumptions are bad with race/IQ, why would you maintain the same default hypothesis? It's backwards if anything.",1643673677

My friend made this Jaunt through Italy from December 22, 1956 to about January 6, 1957.  He was in Rome at Christmas, and saw the Pope's Christmas Mass.  He said in a letter a month after the trip that he felt a bit out of place, being a Protestant, but he happened to be so close to the Pope as he passed by that he could have reached out and touched his sleeve if he wanted to.  After going to Naples he must have been back in Rome on New Year's Eve, but he didn't write about it and doesn't remember now.
 
Edit to add:
 
Looking at the map, I got the impression that the western route would more likely not be right along the lake, but farther west, so the two lines wouldn't meet up until somewhere in the area of Arezzo.  Just my impression.

I will give it credit- the instrumentals are amazing and some of their best. On the contrary, the vocal performances are some of my least favorite. I always thought Tilian sounded really shrill and out of his element in most of ArSe (especially Son of Robot and Midnight Crusade), and while this technically isn‚Äôt Jon‚Äôs worst, I just get really tired of his screaming after a while. (Admittedly, there are some songs with great vocal performances like Suspended in this Disaster) The songwriting itself is fine, it has some highlights like Shelf Life and Evaporate, but most of the other tracks can blend together for me, leaving a bloated experience. I‚Äôm glad there are fans who love ArSe, and I‚Äôm sure I would love the instrumental version of this album.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

The closest thing we'd get is protests like we did ~~last year~~ 2 years ago (jesus pandemic time is wild) and that was spurred on by a massive pandemic making everyone on edge and eager to do **something** outside with others. It also had a single clear goal: Justice for George Floyd.

Most people realistically are opposed to conflict so they won't do anything out there.

So you probably shouldn't be too concerned with a hypothetical breakdown in the United States. If you're that concerned, then just make sure you have access to non-perishable food and clean water so you can hunker down in your house with your family while all the violence plays out. If there's one thing I have faith in our government to do, it's to violently suppress opposition using the police and military.

There are examples of the Killing Curse striking objects, sometimes with destructive force, sometimes doing nothing. And Zion is a hell of a lot bigger than a desk or a statue.

At best, you'd pop his Scion avatar, but it wouldn't hurt him any more than cutting a marionette's strings would kill the puppeteer.

If you managed to fire one into his actual body? Just the difference in scale is going to assure that it does nothing. It's a matter of scale, force, and leverage. You're trying to sever the connection between body and soul of a being whose size is, at minimum, measured at the continental scale.

I would imagine it'd be like trying to cut the moon in half with a butcher knife.

It takes several wizards repeatedly casting the same spell to have an effect on a dragon or a giant in the Harry Potter setting, and comparing the size differences between a human, the largest Potterverse creature, and Zion's full on continent-to-planet sized form that basically makes the size difference between humans and Pottercritters effectively a rounding error.

I would spend mornings at home. I'd then go out for the afternoon to a cafe or Starbucks or other sort of establishment, and then work for another 5 hours or so, hyper focused. It helps to get away from the house.

Another tip would be to have a designated working only area. Don't mix your home computer desk or entertainment area with a working area. Best option would be to have a specific working room with only working related items in to help frame your mind and not mix signals.

Your post was removed for not following the proper title format. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *[FS/FT/GA/LF] - LOCATION - PRICE - title*  Example: [FS] - Location, Place - $42 - Stuff for sale

# **Make sure you include the hyphens**

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

1. Use only LF, FS, FT, GA as tags (looking for, for sale, for trade, give away)

2. Use [] around the tag, so it looks like [FS]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.

3. For multiple tags, only use /'s, so it looks like [FS/FT] or [FT/GA]. Don't use . , \ | - : ; ~ or anything else.

4. If you are posting a discussion or PSA, please use a [PSA] tag at the beginning of the subject.

5. Your location must be included after your tag.

6. Your price must be included after your location. 

* If you are selling multiple items, please use a + after the lowest priced item.  **Example: [FS] - location - $5+ - multiple items**

* If you are giving something away, use the giveaway tag [GA] 

* If you are are posting LF, FT or LF/FT, a price is not required.   **Example: [LF] - location - stuff**

It angers people that your political (non-)opinions depend on whether politics are protecting you or not

Personally, I think your friends are right to judge you  because it sounds like it's causing you to self-reflect about it

If your country were to suddenly take a sharp turn for the worst and politics effected you deeply in a negative way, I know for a fact you would suddenly care about politics and you would immediately form a ton of political opinions

"Male_Studies","t5_3ims3w","Abstract  
Research on sexual violence and related support services access has mainly focused on female victims; there is still a remarkable lack of research on men who experience sexual violence. Research demonstrates that people who both self-identify as men and are members of sexual-orientation minority populations are at higher risk of sexual violence.   
They are also less likely to either report or seek support services related to such experiences. The present study is an exploratory one aimed at filling the gap in the literature and better understanding how men, both straight and gay as well as cisgender and transgender, conceptualize, understand, and seek help related to sexual violence. A sample of 32 men was recruited on-line and participated in either a one-on-one in-depth interview (N = 19) or one of two focus group discussions (N = 13). All interviews and groups were audiotaped, professionally transcribed and coded using NVivo 9 qualitative software. The present analysis focused on barriers to and facilitators of support service access. Emergent and cross-cutting themes were identified and presented, with an emphasis on understanding what factors may prevent disclosure of a sexual violence experience and facilitate seeking support services and/or professional help. Through this analysis, the research team aims to add knowledge to inform the development of tools to increase service access and receipt, for use by both researchers and service professionals. Although this study contributes to the understanding of the issue of men‚Äôs experiences of sexual violence, more research with diverse populations is needed",1643673680

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","&gt;Ronda freaked out when Charlotte filled in for Becky,

When did Ronda freak out when Charlotte filled in? Becky choose Charlotte as her replacement so why would Ronda freak out?

&gt;did the DQ beatdown as the heel

Charlotte didn't turn heel with Ronda. Go watch SD after she was treated like a hero on SD and then beat both heel IIconics in a row and said she beat up Ronda for Becky. She turned heel when Becky came back from the Nia punch because Becky was the one everyone was cheering. 


&gt;and Charlotte got a monster pop. It wasn't Becky getting cheered that broke her brain. It was Charlotte getting cheered.

Charlotte got a pop for beating the shit out of Ronda BECAUSE she was helping Becky. People automatically hated Ronda because of Becky not Charlotte. Any women would've gotten a pop for beating up Ronda there because everyone was team Becky especially after the bloody face moment. Charlotte was team Becky so on SD 2 days later she got cheered. Once Becky came back and Charlotte went against Becky she automatically got booed and became heel.

The crowd turned on her because of Becky not Charlotte so yes it was Becky getting cheered out there with Charlotte being Becky's surrogate. If it was Charlotte getting cheered then Charlotte would've not been turned heel 2 weeks after this. If it was Charlotte getting cheered then Charlotte being added to WM 35 with Ronda wouldn't have the most lopsided disliked video on WWE's channel ever and Ronda. If Becky never got big Ronda would've never been booed and Charlotte would've not been cheered for beating up Ronda. Becky is the reason Charlotte got cheered and Ronda got booed she had that type of power at her peak in popularity. She literally mocked retired Edge's neck injury and still got cheered.",1643673680

To help provide a means to sell the asset. That's a win for the vehicle companies, of course. But it's also irrelevant if OP has already decided they want that asset and simply want to finance it via PCP instead of cash. We're not discussing the pros and cons of buying a new car. So PCP vs cash is the comparison that is relevant, not old car versus new car or expensive car versus cheap car or whatever else. 

If the new car costs ¬£X cash or ¬£X at 0% credit, what exactly is the downside to taking on the credit? Aside from the temporary hit to one's credit file (which is more than offset by the benefit of payment history on one's long term credit file, plus finance agreement protections on the asset).

As another thread in this very forum highlighted today, deals of getting a new car discounted because you're paying in cash are often not reality these days. Getting a discount for taking on PCP is actually quite common.",1643673681

* the mono's always 'drop down' to the spawn point, so while you can't place a roof, you can raise the conveyor platform to be all on one 'level' if you wannt instead of all slanted with upward/downward conveyors, they will never spawn below your platforms/ conveyors
* mono's can escape INTO your conveyors and/or the cooking pot.. it's nuts
* no matter if you're in Line of Sight or even stealthed, the second the mono's start cooking in the pot, they will 'spot' you
* putting up walls 2-3 tiles high prevents them from jumping away from you should they spot you before getting to the cooking pot.. these buggers can jump pretty high

"Objectivism","t5_2qjr6","Human beings did not evolve to benefit from instinct the way (practically all, at the very least) animals have. However, human beings have evolved to each have an individual volitional consciousness, which is absolutely necessary to a human being's survival. Having a volitional consciousness, human beings can make choices which either fulfills their ability to live (i.e. crusoe economics: the values and virtues necessary to be practiced for the gathering of food and water; celebrating what it means to be and to love being alive by going to parties with friends), or they can make choices which lead them to their own death (i.e. hurting oneself, wasting, giving up what matters to them in life), or worse, they can expect other people to make self destructive choices only for the sake of it (i.e. expecting other people to hurt themselves, expecting other people to waste away them selves, expecting other people to give up what matters them in life).

Of the basic necessities for survival, such as food and water, human beings need private property in order to survive. [The need of property for survival  is demonstrated by the creation of shelters by paleolithic humans.](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-arthistory/chapter/the-paleolithic-period/) The product of a human being's individual mind and effort, therefore, must morally belong to the human being who produced it, because the human who created it has created it for their own survival and for the fulfillment of what it means to live. The definition of ""to live"" meaning two things - basic survival, and the fulfillment of an individual's values. 

The ownership of private property represents both of these two things. The ownership of private property provides a human being with the ability to have shelter and to produce what they need in order to survive; and, the successful ownership of for example a skateboard factory, and the feeling satisfaction and achievement which would accompany it, would be the successful fulfillment of a skateboard entrepreneur's values and virtues.

Therefore, the ownership of private property is objectively moral, because it satisfies what it means for an individual to live. The skateboard factory owner owns their skateboard factory in order that they can survive, and the ownership of the factory means the fulfillment of the person's values, and their ability to invest in other value fulfilling things in their life, such as supporting the people the person loves, or going out to do fun things as a celebration of what it means to be alive.",1643673682

i can't tell what board so no idea what CPU, but it has a GTX 960 (top,) an older mediocre 1080p-oriented graphics card that the previous owner was probably not using as their main GPU but to power multiple monitors.

The second is an RTX 2070 which I would certainly recommend keeping. You should sit on these parts for a while.

You should switch their slots. The 2070 wants more bandwidth, guarantee it.

The mainboard's got m.2 support which implies it's recent. Probably a very good match for the 2070. Tape the fans so they don't move and give it a thorough cleaning with an air compressor. If you got this free or cheap then it is a very very good find.

Edit: i just saw the comment advising ditching the 960, you will get a decent price for it, do this if you don't plan to use multiple monitors. You might also keep it because this looks like an AMD system, I run a potato of a gpu in x4 mode so that I can run things like teamviewer or YouTube without sapping performance.",1643673682

Not a fan of: goats or turkeys

Harmed by: 1 dog, 3 cats, several goats, 1 rooster.

So tbh, while I like cats, I also am a little more gunshy of cats, on the basis that they are somewhat statistically more likely to maul me in their basic care and feeding than the other friends I have made. :)

Liberals believe we should get rid of taxes and regulation?

&gt;*Considering you're using force to steal from everyone and take everyone's rights away (except when Government gives crony privilege) in order to get this lousy return, it's actually a bigger embarrassment.*

That's the misnomer. You are not forced because no one is stopping you leaving. If you were taxed as a child, that would be one thing, but you are free to opt out of the society everyone else is okay with by leaving it.

You just want your cake and be able to eat it too.

&gt;*I don't think the state has to authority to do that. Public property and all.*

It's public for the people that are a member of the public. You would no longer be such given your desire to opt out.

&gt;  
*Anyway, Government is terrible and causes a lot of problems.* 

Some parts of government are terrible and those parts do cause a lot of problems.

Some parts of government are good and those parts solve some of the problems that exist in the world.

&gt;*Daddy Gov simps refuse to let that stop them from using it to ruin people's lives.*

I mean, you'd need to define how exactly they're ""using"" it to ""ruin"" peoples lives, but I get it. You're anti anti government shill.

That's fine, it just gets tiring after a while to have the same conversation with you.

Since during my 1st appointment I was living a crisis, to ask about this situation was not a priority for me, but a primary or secondary ADHD was suspected. To acknowledge if I have an autistic trait is nothing more for me than a curiosity.

Personally I think it looks great now &amp; would transfer it to soil sooner rather than later. 

The longer the roots grow, the greater the risk of damaging them when transitioning to soil/stressing the plant. 

I would pot it up in a 4‚Äù pot with moistened aroid appropriate media &amp; place it in a high humidity environment (or simply ‚Äútent‚Äù it with a ziploc bag). You shouldn‚Äôt need to water it again until the new leaf unfurls.

Job Satisfaction: PTA might be better because you will see the result if your work after each session which can be rewarding. RT is more long term satisfaction but sometimes it never comes. Some patients are rude and some pt may die. No one really goes out their way to praise you for good work so if that what your looking for PTA might be better than RT for that.

Job outlook: RTs are in greater demand than PTA. Just because of covid alone and the geriatric population. PTA job availability is higher in outpatient setting than in hospital and in hospital they actually hire DPT to essentially PTA work but that observation is honestly anecdotal with other colleuges in PT telling me about this at some point.

Overall RT is better for money and work life balance. PTA i believe is 9-5 and that requires you to be there 5 days a week but the job satifaction may greater as well. I would say RT because of the financial advantage but some may say PTA because of the quality patient interactions.",1643673686

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","‚ÄúY‚Äôall‚Äù or ‚Äúthey,‚Äù whether you play these games yourself or not, makes no difference. It‚Äôs not part of my argument, just an innocuous assumption I made.

&gt;Second, you misunderstand the word ‚Äúaccessibility‚Äù. It‚Äôs not so people don‚Äôt have to try, it‚Äôs for people who physically cannot play the game due to disabilities

I‚Äôm rather tired of this bait and switch. You know I can still read your previous comment, right? You weren‚Äôt talking about people whose disabilities actually prevent them from playing these games: 

&gt;**it's literally just giving people the option to not be frustrated and struggling through the game.**

You‚Äôre talking about people who could struggle through the game like the rest of us, but who don‚Äôt want that.

&gt;If a difficulty slider changed the game for the hardcore fans, that'd be bad. But it's not, it's making it more **accessible** to those who don't have the **ability or time** that the hardcore players do.

Short on time =/= disability. Not having the ability of a hardcore player =/= disability.

You know what‚Äôs selfish? Leveraging other peoples‚Äô disabilities in bad faith to take the moral high ground in an argument.  There are real discussions to be had about disability accessibility, but far too often it‚Äôs simply exploited to bolster an altogether different point. 

And when it comes to difficulty, these games have options‚Äîoverleveling, to name one. If for any reason a player needs the game to be more forgiving, they can overlevel. It‚Äôs not hard to do‚Äîit‚Äôs just *struggle*, which is why y‚Äôall pretend like the option is not there. Because, again, this isn‚Äôt about being able to beat these games, it‚Äôs about whether someone wants to do what it takes to beat them.

As for your ‚Äúbattles of attrition‚Äù point‚Ä¶ not really. I mean, yes, souls games involve attrition, Bloodborne not so much. But the point has always been to give the player enough resources to succeed once they reach a certain level of knowledge and understanding of their enemies. More resources means succeeding with less understanding. And, again, less understanding means less fun, because not knowing how to fight in these games produces gameplay that looks and feels like failure whether you‚Äôre punished with death or not.",1643673687

but we also need a way to deal with the bad actors that are undeniably set out to provoke for malicious reasons, and cleverly accomplishing this by exploiting our freedoms.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","&gt; I can't see how it's not a disrespectful act.

Killing Ned was a disrespectful act.   Taking and reforging Ice was Tywin doing what the laws of the 7 Kingdoms allows him to.   Is Tywin proud, absolutely, but he's always been proud and he never acted against another house to get a Valyrian steel sword.  He only did so when he believed he had a right to one.

As for Tywin's control of Tyrion, Tyrion may be Lord of Winterfell as Sansa's husband, but he is still a Lannister and under Tywin's control.   Could Tyrion have challenged Tywin for the two Valyrian steel swords, sure, but even he admits he didn't.   He thinks he should have sent Ice back to Robb when Robb was alive.   He didn't, House Stark's male line is gone, Ice is now 2 swords, and Tyrion didn't act to prevent any of it.   That leaves his father Tywin to deal with Ice and Tywin did.   He wasn't attempting to disrespect House Stark by melting Ice, but had come upon Ice unchallenged and took it legally.   That's not disrespect.",1643673687

A minor suggestion that could help support your claims:

Adding the total number of players that qualified for this ranking would give a better picture of how Trae is performing. For example, 16th out of 100 isn‚Äôt bad, 16th out of 18 is pretty bad.

There's a [fairly detailed video review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmLY33WwJz0) of one of the Calphalon machines where the reviewer has similar trouble dialing in a shot.

the best would be: offensive wingers, L and R midfilelders TW and, as stricker, a technical player with high passing (16&gt;) that, playing defensive position, increases much more L+R attacking values.

if by doin so you see that you're getting there to break his defense, good, if not...

451 pressing level 13 could aslo be a good choice, I had good results with that, if you're defending well, it could be even better that CA

the problem with CA is that, if it goes badly, you can loose also 4-0/5-0, and that would destroy your Team confidence (if you've got a good one), while pressing in maily used to avoid large defeats in games where the odds are not good.",1643673688

"ReReadingWolfePodcast","t5_23ud84","Tangential thoughts.

IIRC, Borges has a recurrent trope that the Minotaur is the creator of the maze, but double-checking is in order.

Another topic: in my mind there is a basic conflict between Hamlet's Mill and Borges's labyrinths, such that talking about them together can lead to distracting static. My problem might be simply this impression, that Hamlet's Mill is about ""change,"" and Borges's labyrinth is about ""stasis."" John Crowley wrote at least three times about the change from one age to another, most directly in *Little, Big* where ""the magic goes away"" (as Niven himself put it for his own work on that concept). In ice cream terms, vanilla gives way to chocolate. But Borges, in ""Circular Ruins"" and elsewhere, is describing something different, a grinding stasis. Perhaps it is the grinding stasis in-between changes, but still. (Maybe Hamlet's Mill is ultimately ""meet the new boss, same as the old boss,"" which might seem to render the ""change"" as moot, but at the very least, the chaotic ""change time"" is still there.) 

Wolfe definitely shows the change from one age to another at the end of ""'A Story' by John V. Marsch"" (and maybe the old forms begin to reassert themselves in a ""new boss/old boss"" sort of way throughout *The Fifth Head of Cerberus)*. I think there is a similar deal to the New Sun.",1643673689

^(By: Madeleine Ryan | 304 pages | Published: 2020 | Popular Shelves: fiction, contemporary, literary-fiction, dnf, autism)

&gt;One of Bustle's Best Books of 2020! 
&gt;
&gt;An unforgettable story of a fiercely original young woman, whose radical perspective illuminates a new way of being in the world
&gt;
&gt;As a full moon rises over Melbourne, Australia, a young woman gets ready for a party. And what appears to be an ordinary night out is--through the prism of her singular perspective--extraordinary. As the evening unfolds, each encounter she has reveals the vast discrepancies between what she is thinking and feeling, and what she is able to say. And there's so much she'd like to say. So when she meets a man and a genuine connection occurs, it's nothing short of a miracle. However, it isn't until she invites him home that we come to appreciate the humanity beneath the labels we cling to, and we can grasp the pleasure of what it means to be alive.
&gt;
&gt;The debut novel from the inimitable Madeleine Ryan, A Room Called Earth is a humorous and heartwarming adventure inside the mind of a bright and dynamic woman. This hyper-saturated celebration of love and acceptance, from a neurodiverse writer, is a testament to moving through life without fear, and to opening ourselves up to a new way of relating to one another.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Classes are still pretty standard. We proved Bolzano-Weierstrass in analysis today and I actually really enjoyed the argument used. Linear algebra is a bit slow, we're just using eigenvalues to solve linear recurrences to see some standard applications of the subject.

As for my project, this past week was a bit slower than I had hoped but I'm still making progress. I'm a lot more comfortable with generalizations of Hopf algebras after reading about how they're basically defined to induce nice structures on their representation categories (which feels like a bit of circular logic, but I guess it works). 

I had to read about a bit of projective representation theory and I found that pretty neat. Admittedly, one of my weak points in math is thinking of stuff projectively so seeing it in different contexts helps me familiarize myself with it. It was also exciting because I got to see a group extension in the wild from lifting a projective representation to a linear one. Admittedly, the reference basically spelled it out for me but it was still cool to identify, and it actually has some practical applications relevant to the project.",1643673691

We saw that in top 2 in 2018, which none of them are competetive now. We are seeing right now in 2022 podium will be russians again, and we will not see any of them in 2026. But we will see another russian trio. And they will get all the medals. 

There is just no competition, and it really can't be unless somethings change. At least until 2026 nothing will change. Because juniors are already ready. 

There is literally nothing to keep an eye out for an international scene for women. I will watch russian nationals though, there will be more competition than any other intenational event",1643673692
"KansasCityChiefs","t5_2s3ft","I watched all of these with the exception of Super Bowl I and I disagree.

The difference between those years and this year is that we have Patrick Mahomes.  He's delivered some amazing clutch performances through his career.  So we all held out hope that he would right the ship through the second half.  The ending on this one really tears your heart out.  He choked.  No other way to put it.  Hopefully he comes back better.

It also hurts because in the back of my mind I can't help but wonder how many more years of Mahomes magic we'll have.  He's still young but there's no guarantee our championship window will be as open as it was this year.  The remaining competition was much easier than we'll likely face in the future.",1643673692

I 20F have suffered with anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and more as well as more then a few traumas (ex. death, abuse, etc.) in my lifetime. About a year ago I met my bf (20M) and we instantly clicked off the bat...  we are similar but also very much different this means our habits he does not drink ,smoke ,vape and I do. he also has a job that requires him to have a clean system and I however do not. We do not live together so if I spend the night I obviously don't bring it since he doesn't want it around I have never once done it around him!! I do not have the best home life so when I am here at night I tend to go smoke alone and it calms my anxiety, makes me eat, keeps me calm, Im not a couch slug either I clean my house every other day im OCD.

I (53m) have three children with my first wife, B (18M), BB (18F) and C (17F). Their mother and I split when they were young (3 and 4) and I got remarried to H. H and I had a toxic relationship with cheating on both sides, ups and downs, year long arguments, etc. She was an awful step mother to my children. She would make me feel guilty about spending time with them, would yell at them for unneeded reasons, and set such strict rules that C even peed her pants when she was young out of fear. She wouldnt let me buy things for the children, despite spending hundreds of dollars on her disney trips each year. From when the kids were 11 and 12,  I limited contact between them and her, and would only have them over when she wasn't home, or I'd take them out alone. They only saw her at larger family events and holidays for most of the marriage. She agreed to this arrangement of limited time spent, and never sought more time with them. 

Eventually I got the courage to start over and leave H in early 2020, when the kids were 15 and 16. The pandemic slowed things, but I left everything to H in order to end it peacefully and quickly, and started over.

Fast forward to now. H has been reaching out to my kids to spend time together because she ""misses"" them. She started by having them at her new place (when they were all underage and I was living in my office). I only found out because I asked my daughter for dinner and she guiltily said she was going out with H. I was upset, but said have fun and sent her on her way. I later asked all three children and H to stop meeting at her new place, and to please let me know if they were going out. They met at her place again for dinner, and I found out after the fact. 

I lost it, and repeated the same requests. Again, this past summer, they met her for lunch in a restaurant but did not tell me ahead of time. Obviously I was upset, and got into an argument with them, and then their mother (who can't stand H) for allowing them to go and not tell me. They didn't speak to me for two months, and their mother and I are not on good terms any longer. 

I found out today that my girls saw H for lunch last weekend because someone saw them and told me. I'm at a loss. I left the marriage because of her treatment and disdain for my children, something they could sense and my youngest even made jokes about her step mother hating her. 

I have told them my two boundaries are: 
1. Not at her house
2. I want to be told ahead of time. 

They have repeatedly broken those boundaries. 

So. I guess I'm asking AITA for not wanting my kids to have a relationship with her?

Like, drinking water is good, drinking 4 liters a day is really bad? Same thing with microbes Vs the immune system.
You need some microbes. It's what makes yogurt so good for us, it's the good thing about breast milk, and it's the fundamental basis of a healthy immune system. Our bodies fight off lots of threats, illnesses, infections etc every day, our whole lives. If you clean everything you eat and touch, your body doesn't have so many threats. But that's not actually good because it'll stop checking for, and remembering how to fight, threats, so you'll end up more likely to develop allergies to things, to get really ill from mild causes, and it's generally unhealthy all round.

The guy before me was talking about pasteurization, which is related, but I definitely think you should start by just reading a bit about the immune system - there a good overview at https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/21196-immune-system

I don't think there much point saying 'no you really shouldn't wash your fruit in salt water', though that's the most common response, as it doesn't really help you. But if you want to make your own decisions about health and food, I hope you'll take a few minutes to read up on why you probably shouldn't wash your fruit in salt.

Also, salt water is abrasive and dehydration (not great for fruit) without being antibacterial or anything.",1643673693

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","North Cork town. We have McDonaghs in our town doing the same thing. Two families of them. They moved into a housing estate in the grass, the locals went mental and it took a court order for them to move. Then they parked outside the local cemetery making a show of themselves at funerals, going to the loo in public in front of grieving families. Eventually they got another order for them to move, then they moved into the entrance of a small military church. Last I heard they are getting a house. Not forgetting their 3 year old was fished out of a pond while they were at it with other travellers. If that isn't neglect I don't know what is.
Meanwhile the other side of the town another family parked up at the lay by, about a half acre, right on the main road with picnic tables, put up fencing and black plastic to hide what they have. The council have provided them a gate as they went on the local paper claiming they were broken into and ask their expensive tv, DVD, microwave etc was stolen. Complete lies to be honest but some poor gullable locals kitted them out. The 2019 Ford van just proved they were too poor to afford rent.

 &gt;Antinatalism or anti-natalism is the ethical view that negatively values procreation. Antinatalists argue that humans should abstain from procreation because it is morally wrong (some also recognize the creation of other sentient beings as problematic). In scholarly and literary writings, various ethical arguments have been presented for antinatalism. Some of the earliest surviving formulations of the idea that it would be better not to have been born can be found in ancient Greece.

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt;The difference between a skeptical agnostic and a positive atheist seems to make sense to me.

I've never heard those terms before.

&gt;Would you be able to elaborate more on this? 

Philosophers just say Atheist, as to mean someone who doesn't believe in God, theist to mean someone who does, and agnostic to mean someone who thinks in some principle and significant sense we can't know one way or another. They don't use terms like agnostic atheist or gnostic theist or whatever, and if you said them to Philosophers that weren't aware of online atheist communities they would think you were speaking nonsense or misunderstand you. 

&gt;Why would you say I and everyone who uses these terms are confused?

I mean knowing and using the terms of a certain online community doesn't make you confused, it makes you knowledgeable about that thing, but I generally think it causes confusion otherwise. For instance it had tied you sufficiently in knots that you were unsure if there being no evidence for something gave you warrant to not believe in it, but this is surely a situation where with anything else you would understand you clearly had such a warrant, so this terminology rather than getting you anywhere, had in fact confused you more about the topic than you would have been just reflexively talking about it.",1643673694

My RH share count was always mostly correct, I can chalk that up to delayed data... but almost never will it will accurately show what positions I hold as far as options; sometimes just straight up no transaction, sometimes only showing parts of a multi leg strategy. when that happens, it is almost always ONLY the short leg displayed.",1643673694

Wasn't very intellectually stimulating or rewarding work either.

Now that they do it remotely, I've been toying with the idea during slow periods between matters for some extra cash.

The pay varies, but you can easily get $1,200 a week doing it. If you're trying to be all hardcore and work more than 40 hours, they often offer overtime and you can get $2,000. I knew some people who made low 6 figures doing nothing but doc review, but that was never my idea of a good time.

You can just get onto lists of recruiters who will email you whenever they're staffing a project. I think they ask you not to work on other things while you're doing it, but they typically only last a few weeks to a couple months, and you can just quit the project if you have to.",1643673694

I went to the laundry room in my apartment complex, saw there were tons of dryers not in use, paid for two washers and prepaid for two dryer (I had a big load). I returned when the washers were done to move clothes to the dryers, and saw both machines I paid for had clothes in them and were running. I removed them and resumed the drier so it would time out while their clothes were sitting on the counter, and put mine into a different machine (and paid again) so they wouldn't know it was me. 

When I came back for my dried clothes, a couple asked a guy next to me if he I saw anyone take their clothes out of the dryer and he said no. They didn't ask me and probably assumed I'd say if I saw anything. The woman said she asked the front office to check the camera but they couldn't because it's raining or something.

In the end, they paid the same amount they would have had to if they didn't use the machines I paid for, and they had to spend another 45 minutes doing laundry.  Am I the asshole? If not, what's the most creative way of telling them to go fuck themselves if they find out I did it and ask me about it?

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Well i don't know for sure but if i was on a long streak and i relapse just one time then even though I'd feel a bit weird at that moment I'm most likely to feel back to normal in like 3 - 7 days . 

But when I relapse many times and then get 1 day streak somehow and then i relapse again like 2 times then im sure like the content of nutrients and testosterone on your body is way less . You can even feel the weakness in your bones due to lacking of calcium just cause you are ejaculating it all out .. 

Atleast that's what I think . And to make it clear the calcium part i definitely feel better when I drink milk and wait for 1 or 2 days . 

Either way if you are asking this to know if it's okay to relapse then no it's not lol . Cause if you make the decision to relapse once then your brain will then convince you to relapse one more time and like the relapsing part might not stop .. 

So like don't ejaculate and relapse intentionally if you do then yupp it's most likely not going to end well. But if it happens accidentally then try to just be as productive and social as you can after the relapse be around your friends the whole time as you are most likely to relapse again on your first 2 or 3 days after the relapse",1643673695

If I had to guess, what happened to you is that one of the services you used was breached, and some bots are checking if you have used same email and password for other sites. If you are web owner, it's good security practice to not let anyone to know what accounts exist. That's why in many cases, when you want to recover password the website tells you they sent you an email even if you enter wrong address. However, I bet that many websites will tell you to log in if you try to create account with existing email, which is clear indication that the account exists.

Pole access is dramatically increased as we guarantee proportional polling places, early voting, mail-in ballots, etc.

Citizens United is overturned.

The voting rights act is constitutionally enshrined.

Like in Australia, not voting is punishable by a small fine.

Science gets to decide. When information is denounced and proved to be false by 99% of the scientific community then generally that means it is misinformation.

Yes I have listened to some, including the interview Joe did with the anti vaxxer doctor.

&gt;it‚Äôs important to hear all sides to an issue

Sure, by all means listen to all sides. But only one side has truth and that's the side of science. The nonsense that Joe has been spreading is essentially conspiracy theory, this is also coming from the so called experts he has had on his show.",1643673698

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","If you actually watched FNC's games (and aren't like silver or something) you'll know they had way bigger problems than just missing Upset. It's really disingenuous to pretend that Adam was a match for any of the top/jungle duos - even HLE's topside outclassed them. Nisqy has had a champion puddle for literally 4 years in a row. Even with Upset the entire team looked legitimately uncompetitive with MAD, who were forced into tiebreakers that they went 1-1 in. If your regional champions are even with LPL4, LCS2, and LCK points qualifier, then it's ridiculous to assume your easily-defeated 2nd seed is going to look similar or better.

Adam and Nisqy were solo-losing games by themslves. Bwipo's really good early game vs HLE (game 1) was the result of a planned invasion but he literally threw it away by inting around bot crab. 

People need to stop pretending EU 2018-2020 wasn't just G2 and FNC. MAD played at their own level. Rogue played at their own level. FNC played just a bit below their own level. You aren't suddenly a top 4 team because you're winning EU. G2 was winning EU because they were a top 4 team, NOT the other way around.",1643673698

That is good to know as well, because my first few years were in an abusive household. I do not remember any abuse, but I know my mum used to be abused regularly, usually fuelled by alcohol, and my older sibling remembers their hair being pulled. Mum said my dad tried to crush us with some heavy furniture (she got us just in time). I would've been neglected to a degree by my dad though, as if mum was working (dad didn't work, apparently mum worked multiple jobs to keep us afloat at the time) she'd leave us with him and I broke a bone very young because I was not being supervised and had a massive fall. That is all I know though, and I still have scarring from that incident at least.

Thank you for the advice about meditation too! I'd like to learn more about this type of meditation you're talking about - does it have a formal name that I can use to research?

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I mean, yeah you can try that but you're going to run into walls just as fast and need to grind exponentially more to overcome them by not following the meta. It is the meta for a reason.

Play whatever build you want, but expect to get stuck at some point and need to attempt 3-4 times the amount of Conquerors to even attempt the Sirus difficulty you're stuck at. Realize you might run into burnout a lot faster. Realize you'll need to work harder to make the same amount of currency an optimized build makes in half the time to buy the same items since both your builds scale with the same weapons that are rare and expensive. Realize you may not have enough funds saved up for your backup build and just quit the league because ramming your head into the wall that the devs didn't balance around you getting past.

I play a flat damage Chaos+Phys Occultist Cyclone. I struggle to clear red maps, I literally can't beat certain bosses in less than 5 minutes, A5 Drox is legit a raid boss in an mmo. I hit points where due to my build being offmeta, my upgrades an get very expensive because no sane person would even sell them (Shaper/Elder influenced Ming's Heart, like who the fuck would even hold onto that even if they got one, but I use it and maybe see 1 or 2 sellers per league).

I grabbed every Abyss modifier on the Atlas when they started doing the passives there because I love fighting Liches. I saw one in total in the first league they implemented that while only really doing maps in that region.

You can play off-meta, just be very aware the game activily punishes you for it because it's balanced around you playing the meta.",1643673699

Banging the ball for a quick clear is understandable when you‚Äôre under pressure but there‚Äôs a lot of times where you could have caught it and set something up. I think prime examples are your scoring opportunities. If you‚Äôre in front of net and the balls coming anywhere near you you‚Äôre banging it towards net and the opposition is easily able to predict it. When you see the ball coming out you- take a second to look at the opposition and see where the gaps in their defense are.

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","Yep this can definitely work, I did so with my own cat, who hated having his paws touched!

I'd recommend doing it as part of a general ""clicker training"" thing.

Start with just pressing the button on the clicker and immediately give him his favorite treat. Do so a few times in a row, for a few days.

Then try an easy trick. My first one is ""kissies"", where he rubs against my face. If I moved my face close to him, like 50% of the time he would rub against me. So I would say ""kissies"" and move my face close. If he rubs against it, click+treat. Now he does it 99.9%% of the time.

""Sit"" is another easy one. Say ""Sit"" and move the treat above his head. Chances are he'll keep looking at it until his bum hits the floor. If that happens, click+treat.

Do this as part of a routine, so he understands ""now is training time, not play time"". Doesn't need to be same time, but does need same sequence of events just before. I wake up at varying times, but I always get out of bed, drink some water, brush him, then train him. So he excitedly greets me when I wake up. You could do it e.g. whenever you come home from work, and it won't matter if you have to work overtime or something.

Then you go at whatever pace he's comfortable. Maybe say ""paw"" and lift his paw off the ground, click+treat. Then, when he isn't spooked by that, next day try holding the paw in your hand for a few seconds. If he doesn't withdraw the paw for that time, click+treat. When he holds consistently, then you expose the claw a bit. Then you boop the nail clipper to the nail. Then you wrap it around as if to cut. Then you actually cut.

And if he still starts playing with the nail clipper while you're holding the paw, say ""no"", and hide it, without giving any treats. Then you take his paw again. When he doesn't try to play with it, then you give him the treat.",1643673700

This is honestly the only meaning I've seen so far that makes sense. The next closest is that Paradis in ruin like this means everyone's left the island, and that Eldia is saved. That didn't feel right though, for several reasons. Do you also get the feeling that the ruination we see can't just be from nature eroding it away, but has to also mean there was a destructive conflict of some kind?

I accidentally encountered this issue last week when I did some benchmarking after new driver install.

I would normally get around ~17,000 points in superposition benchmark. But with NIS enabled and 0% sharpening in control panel, benchmark scores would drop to around ~16,700 points. Benchmarking was done in monitor's native resolution which I didn't expect NIS to kicked in, because there was nothing to scale and sharpen (it's 1920x1080 on 1080p monitor). I tried turning NIS on and off for a couple more times, and results were always the same; a few hundreds points lower scores with NIS.

"DreamWasTaken2","t5_3jqiry","So...throwing in another fandom as example: the Ryan Haywood incident with Rooster Teeth. All of it started on KF in the form of exposing leaked nudes from him along with another employee of the company. I believe it was done via a user catfishing the men. Everyone shrugged it off because it came from KF, whose origins lie in people too eugh from 4chan and (I think) 8chan, so what people view as the bottom of the barrel. When you're too scummy for 4chan, methinks you really gotta evaluate yourself.

Welllllllllllllll...a whole bunch of victims came forward after that got out and said, yeah he sent me pics and cheated on his wife with me, etc. and a handful of them were at that grey area of ""legal in their homestate."" Big yikes. Beyond yikes. You can easily google how that played out, but that's the sole example I know of KF pulling their usual stuff and it becoming a huge thing exposing a predator for who he is.

At the same time KF is responsible for the Dream doxx that the guy himself slammed as BS as well as Corpse (?) for the sole purpose of ""l0l ur fave is ugly af get reckt"" and in the process proved exactly why these CCs can't trust the public with their image, so I would take their leaks with a grain of salt.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Okay. I mostly agree with all of this, but it's still not enough for me to dismiss the following scenario altogether. 

Character acquires the original combination (swashbuckler and Slashing Grace)... only ever wields the weapon 1 handed until he reaches 3rd lvl u.c. rogue. 
Can he select the Bastard Sword with rogue's Finesse Training? If so, the scenario continues... if not, that's interesting because that weapon has been finesse for him so far, and I'm unclear why it wouldn't.

If he can select it, doesn't that mean that as a finesse weapon (even more officially now), reinforced by Finesse Training, that he would always qualify for dex to hit and damage? Wouldn't the conditional of how he wields it become more malleable now?
At this point I'm just curious which of these is the pitfall here... either:
A- why a character in this scenario couldn't select it with finesse training after the combo. OR
B- if he can select it, how does that address the 2- handed issue.",1643673700

It's not his overall intent that is malicious, I'm sure he thinks he's helping people.  But he knowingly decided that he wanted to use the authority of science to convince people that his alternative medicine was valid when he knows that's not true.

So if the opposing pitcher has intentionally plunked one of your guys and you don't respond, you are inviting other pitchers to do the same and pretty soon your batters will almost be out of the box trying not to get hit.

As the dichotomies of political discourse are easily broken in converging terms and nonverbal messages, you can challenge people to challenge their assumptions about what it means to be White, Black, Catholic, heterosexual, cisgender, homosexual or transgender, et al and etc. 


As to my relationship with God, it's the best, and as to my relationship with my Black significant other, it's also quite good. 


We tend to think for ourselves rather than take the yokes of political discourse, and in doing so tend to break down bonds of systemic racism which are forged in part from these systemic dichotomies of discourse and conventional thought.",1643673702

* For my first wedding (mid 20's), the girls paid for their outfits (we did a 2 piece so they could wear again, at least the black skirt) they did their own hair and makeup. The entire party paid for my hens night and drinks. I think maybe $200 maximum.
* Second wedding (mid 40's), I paid for the girls dresses, purses, corsages. They paid for their hair and makeup and shoes. Everyone who was at my hens kicked in for my seat and drinks (as much as I tried to argue!) One of them organised favours for my hens with little bags of lollies, a penis straw (I know!), and custom stamped cookies made by her mum, that was a complete surprise to me. I think maybe $200 maximum again.

Both my hens were located in the cities I got married in and where everyone lived. There was no need for overnight accommodation, its been common amongst both circles of friends that bachelorettes are pretty low key and mostly dinner and drinks in the city you are all located.",1643673703

By the time you‚Äôre our age, you‚Äôll have been living as yourself for many years. You‚Äôll have friendships and relationships and ridiculous stories and heartwarming stories, and you‚Äôll be a loving, positive presence in the trans community, helping the next generation of trans folks grow into themselves. 

You won‚Äôt remember much from your teen years fondly, but you WILL remember this time in your life with pride, knowing you persevered, grew even when it was hard, and that the challenges you faced help shape you into the fully realized adult man you have built yourself into. 

You‚Äôve got a whole trans family who wants you to succeed, who will give you advice and support, and who will delight in your successes.

I know that you can envision your future, and I know your hunger to get to that place. I believe in your vision of your future, and I know you‚Äôll get yourself there. Path won‚Äôt always be easy, but I‚Äôm absolutely confident that you are more capable than the obstacles you‚Äôll face. Go over, under, around, through, doesn‚Äôt matter.

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","Printing some text does not require printf, printf does way more than that. To print some text you could, for example, just use puts() or purchar() and family.

What happens under the hood are write syscalls to stdout (standard output). If you don't know what a syscall is, I would recommend you Google it as you'll find out better explanations than I can provide.

As for the code you linked, printf () is basically defined as a wrapper for vprintf, which works with varargs. Varargs are what makes the ... possible, va_start and va_end are macros that initialize/cleanup the vararg instance. If you don't know what those are you might want to lookup varargs as that's not really specific to printf.",1643673704

**Make sure people bid on your post! This is your best defense against scammers. No bid, no deal. It's the safest way to work on slavelabour.**

* If someone can't or won't comment on your post **DO NOT WORK WITH THEM** and [report them to moderators.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fslavelabour) Rule 11 fights scammers by requiring them to comment on your post before contacting you.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","https://thehill.com/homenews/media/592107-whoopi-goldberg-holocaust-not-about-race

The attempt to disconnect the Holocaust from the specific form of racial/ethnic bigotry against Jews (and to a less dramatic extent, other ethnic groups like Roma) and instead just depict it as a weird isolated form of cruelty that had nothing to do with anti-semitism is a particular, weird form of Holocaust denial that I have heard a few times in my live, and it's definitely one of the weirdest. It seems so incoherent to me, the idea that someone would accept that the Holocaust happened, acknowledge that it systematically wiped out most Jews in Europe, acknowledge that this was BAD, but don't think it was driven primarily by bigotry. It's REALLY hard for me to understand where this comes from.

I‚Äôll post some basic questions tomorrow, but if you have any tips for suitas (which I know is a little tricky because not every mines‚Äô Suita acts the same, or it might IDK), or natural stones in general that would be more than appreciated!

I‚Äôm really interested in looking at possible naguras to ‚Äúmodify‚Äù the slurry to ‚Äúincrease‚Äù or ‚Äúdecrease‚Äù the ‚Äúgrit‚Äù of the stone that I‚Äôm working on.

"indieheads","t5_2zj24","Your post was removed as we require all song/album/music submissions to be properly tagged and formatted as [TAG] Artist - Title. Please note that you need to pay attention to capitalisation (i.e. tags must be in all caps). Here are the tags you can use and the reasons behind them:

[FRESH] - For newly released songs, direct links to a free stream (Youtube/Soundcloud/Bandcamp/Spotify/etc.) are required, unless if embedded into the site such that it is not easy to grab a url to a direct link.

[FRESH VIDEO] - For new releases of music videos (or some other sort of video project that isn't a performance), but when the audio has already been released. Youtube or Vimeo links required, except when exclusive to another video player.

[FRESH STREAM] - For when before the release date, a project is put up on a streaming service. A direct link is required.

[FRESH ALBUM] - For when a project officially releases on streaming services and online stores. A direct link to a free stream of the album is required, except in the case where it exclusive to paid streaming service or web store (ie. not on Spotify/Bandcamp), or if it is released as a free download. Replace Album with EP, Single, Mixtape. etc. when appropriate.

[FRESH PERFORMANCE] - For when a live performance of an artist is posted online. These are required to be professional recordings and not fancams, with the only exception being the performance of new material, first-time covers, or when a song is being performed for the first time in a significant amount of time. Make sure to make a note of this in the comments so your post isn't accidentally removed.

[FRESH YOUTUBE VIDEO] - For non-musical content posted to Youtube (such as interviews, podcasts or video essays), we recommend that you use the [FRESH YOUTUBE VIDEO] tag.

[ORIGINAL] - For music you or someone close to you (eg. friend, sibling) created. Posts must only must only contain [ORIGINAL] Artist - Song [Optional Genre] in the title, so put any story or relevant info you want to share with us in the comments section.

"ProtonChain","t5_2i8klq","Heres a calculator. Obviously slight variations depending on the platform AMM math. https://dailydefi.org/tools/impermanent-loss-calculator/

You borrow 1000$ of XPR (100k) with the price of 0.01$, divide in half and put in liquidity pool. Thats 50k xpr and 500 usd

The price goes up, 0.05$. You have 22k XPR left in the LP and 1150 USD. You withdraw and convert USD half to XPR.

You are 60K XPR short, you dont have enough XPR to cover the loan. You will have to repay with your deposited assets. Thats it.

Total value changes. Thats the idea of impermanent loss. Your total value change is different than if you holded both coins, thats the loss, impermamence being the permanency only happening during the withdrawal. And with loan that basicly becomes a leverage. You are not throwing money away. You are putting them into AMM that sells your overperforming token to buy underperforming token so they match each other 1:1. The bigger the difference the bigger the loss. If you do a 1 million X, you will only get 100k out of it as value. Selling a coin halfway trough growth will make other half have less impact, and it compounds at every % of price

Sure your initial investment went from 1k to 2.2k which is a win.

Your borrow went from 1k to 3k. Thats a loss, double loss if we take into account rhe option of just holding.

If the XPR drops, then its a profit, because AMM has already sold part of it before the drop continued, which after withdrawal and converting will leave you more XPR. Basicly shorting. Unless you borrowed USD. Same thing just reversed.",1643673707

Please do follow the below steps and check if the issue gets resolved:

1. Replace with new batteries. If this doesn‚Äôt resolve the problem, check the battery compartment for possible damage or corrosion.  
2. Verify the product or receiver is connected directly to the computer and not to a hub, extender, switch or something similar.  
3. Move the device closer to the USB receiver. If your receiver is in the back of your computer, it may help to relocate the receiver to a front port. In some cases the receiver signal gets blocked by the computer case, causing a delay.   
4. Keep other electrical wireless devices away from the USB receiver to avoid interference.  
5. Unpair/repair or disconnect/reconnect hardware using the Connection Utility software: https://support.logi.com/hc/articles/360025141574  
6. Update the device's firmware:  
‚Ä¢ Download and install Logitech G-Hub (Available here: https://www.logitechg.com/innovation/g-hub.html)  
‚Ä¢ Launch the software, select the device from the home screen then go to Settings  
‚Ä¢ If a firmware update is available, a Blue """"""""Update"""""""" button would appear under the firmware version on the top right corner of the screen  
7. Windows only ‚Äî check if there are any Windows updates running in the background that may cause the delay.  
8. Mac only ‚Äî check if there are any background updates that may cause the delay.

I don't think its at all impossible that Rosinate had his own slave, he just didn't ask about it because he wasnt as entitled or spoiled as his brother. And the reason I bring up Doffy being born evil is because you said everything Doffy is, is because of his dad. And I simply don't think that's true. Having a servant at a young age can make you pretty entitled, but it doesn't turn you into Doflamingo. Homing treated his slaves way more like treasured servants then slaves. Homing believed that you should always treat people well and that humans are all equal to each other. If Doffy was actually influenced by his father at all, you would think he'd be even half as kind as Rosinate. But he simply isnt. Doflamingo is who he is inspite of his father. He never listened to or viewed his father as a good example, and only truly learned from the worst elements in his environment.",1643673710
"Unexpected","t5_2w67q","I really struggle with this whole thing as someone whose 20 and recently finished puberty. Sex is just a physical act that brings pleasure to me, I don't think having sex with someone my age or someone 40 years older than me will affect me personally in any special way. A person being older is problematic in my mind if I don't have control over the situation or if the other person is manipulating me into thinking I have control. So IMO if someone is sexually mature and the relationship isn't abusive/manipulative then I really don't think much of it. 

The problem though is we live in a reactionary culture, people will react and come to conclusions with very little context. Anyone that's in such a relationship just has to learn to accept it.",1643673710

Let‚Äôs break down the scenario using the same tool that we used previously, an example‚Ä¶

P1- Could we work a trade for Jimmy G?

P2- Yes, but in order to make that a viable option, we would have to give up valuable draft capital and clear a lot of cap space. So while certainly viable, it is not ideal. 

You see, viable does not mean best or ideal. It means capable of working successfully. In this scenario, when we are talking about the viability of making a trade, we are talking about ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù trading for the player. When we are talking about the viability of drafting a qb, we are talking about ‚Äúsuccessfully‚Äù acquiring a qb with one of our draft picks.

"Weakpots","t5_34op9","&gt; Oh yea definitely. Tbf most instruments I feel like are pretty expensive? But tbf I'm not very musically inclined other than enjoying listening to it.

You can get a perfectly serviceable guitar on the local used market for roughly $60.  And there‚Äôs other types of instruments that are similar. 

There‚Äôs a variety of quality at the $200-400 range which is still reasonably affordable. But eventually you start seeing things that cost over $1k or $2k which are fundamentally professional quality instruments. 

Some instruments are so uncommon that it‚Äôs hard to get them in anything other than pro quality. 

I‚Äôm interested in mandocello. I can get one that‚Äôs *okay* for $700, but to get one that‚Äôs actually genuinely good it‚Äôs going to cost over $2k. 

I can get a genuinely great electric  bass for less than $500. 

But spending possibly thousands for an obscure folk instrument that would need periodically sent back to japan for repairs seems prohibitive. 

&gt; Tho I also think a lot of metal gets characterized as ""noise"", even tho it's a completely different genre.

It‚Äôs hard to ‚Äúget.‚Äù  Metal is often rather intense and it can be difficult for people to become comfortable enough with it to actually start hearing the subtlety. But Sunn O))) genuinely pushes the boundaries of what you can call music.

Since many finishes contain ethanol and hydrocarbons be sure to let any finish cure properly before using with any food.  There are some who believe that finishes that contain ethanol and hydrocarbons are not food safe even after curing.

There is a large overlap between the femboy community and the LGBT one, since a large chunk of femboys are not straight or are some flavor of non-binary, but I wouldn't say that a straight cis femboy is LGBT (nothing against them, they still great and cute af). I think the main difference is being a femboy is more of a fashion/culture/personality thing, something someone chooses to be, whereas LGBT identities are deeply rooted in who someone is as a person and aren't a choice. Because of this, if someone needs support with being a femboy, not only shouldn't they go to a specifically lgbt community for help, but it wouldn't likely even be as useful since being a femboy and being LGBT are fundamentally different types of identities. That's why safe femboy communities like this one are so important.",1643673712

Alongamento se voc√™ quiser fazer manda depois da corrida n√£o antes.

Sua cidade provavelmente tem um canto bom para corrida, geralmente pra√ßas (como √© onde voc√™ correu pelo jeito) ou do g√™nero. Se p√° tem at√© uma faixa para correr e caso queira experimentar saia para correr em qualquer lugar como voc√™ bem entender.

Sempre corra na dire√ß√£o contraria ao tr√°fico, eu as vezes dou o vacilo de correr na mesma dire√ß√£o por√©m eu n√£o uso headsets ou do g√™nero ent√£o consigo ouvir e sentir bem se vem um carro. Mesmo assim sempre prefira correr na dire√ß√£o oposta de onde os caras est√£o vindo, dessa forma voc√™ vai de frente pra eles e v√™ de onde eles est√£o vindo!

Voc√™ n√£o precisa correr TODOS os dias, d√° um descanso para o seu corpo. Correr 3/4 vezes por semana √© produtivo e ajuda seu corpo a descansar o necess√°rio! Se quiser correr s√≥ na semana e descansar no fds tamb√©m √© uma possibilidade.

N√£o ligue para o seu n√∫mero do pace/ritmo durante sua corrida, ao menos n√£o por enquanto.

Por√©m ligue para o seu pace/ritmo no sentido do qu√£o r√°pido voc√™ est√° indo. Se voc√™ correr muito r√°pido vai queimar r√°pido, comece lento e vai elevando at√© chegar num ponto m√©dio que voc√™ consiga manter! Com o tempo e se voc√™ quiser vai conhecer outras formas de corrida que se encaixam no seu objetivo :D

Caso queira, da um corre l√° no u/C25K e pega [esse plano aqui](http://www.c25k.com/c25k_metric.html). Famoso do sof√° para os 5km, um plano de 9-10 semanas pra voc√™ seguir e ter objetivos nas suas corridas, aconselho tamb√©m o Nike Run App para medir o quanto voc√™ t√° correndo e etc.

Ou se quiser ignora tudo isso e simplesmente sai pra correr, independente de ter metas ou n√£o correr √© um √≥timo exerc√≠cio e vai te fazer bem voc√™ correndo 1km ou 5km por dia.

Boa sorte",1643673712

&gt; He said Konami offered him the Silent Hill IP

1. The claim does not involve Sony directly nor was it made on a Sony platform (interview with a third party).

2. Technically, the claim *may* be true (even if we think it's very unlikely). If Hasan had said that ""Abandoned is Silent Hill and Konami signed a contract with me"", that claim could be proven or disproven with external evidence from lawyers, etc. But Hasan is claiming to report details of a potential business deal that never came about. The only evidence for or against such a claim is Hasan's word (or Konami's if they cared to provide it).

Please understand that I am not saying that Hasan has never lied. I think it's pretty clear that Hasan is not a trustworthy source. What I am saying is that he has not lied *in a way which would expose him to either legal action or punishment by Sony.*

In the case of this alleged Konami offer, I think it's *very unlikely* that Hasan is telling the truth. But I can't *prove* that he is lying. If Sony started taking games off their store because they think that the developers made ""unlikely"" claims in an interview...there wouldn't be a whole lot of games left on the store.",1643673712

First of all, you need to understand phase transitions.

Most people think that when something is cold, it is solid, when you heat it up, it becomes liquid and then if you continue heating, it becomes a gas.

This is an oversimplification.

In fact, the state of the matter depends on many factors - including temperature but also pressure.

The exact phase can be determined by what is called a phase diagram. Here is the phase diagram of water: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase\_diagram#/media/File:Phase\_diagram\_of\_water\_simplified.svg

So, water vapor can exist even if the temperature is negative.

Liquid water can exist at negative temperature if the pressure is high enough.

And liquid water can evaporate at negative temperatures.",1643673713

"honesttransgender","t5_11h46y","When did I become so popular? I‚Äôve been noticing a lot more people in the past week recognizing me. I was able to live my childhood as a boy without really thinking anything of it and just assumed I‚Äôd be able to be a man no problem, but once I reached young adulthood, the idea of becoming a man became REAL and really scared me. I had never thought I was trans because I never hated my genitals or wanted SRS, but I was also just starting to learn about people who would transition by doing everything EXCEPT that, and it really appealed to me. I wanted to start HRT as soon as I could to prevent further masculinization and get a headstart on my transition while I was still young so that‚Äôs what I did. At first, there was a very real fear that I might regret it and detransition, but that quickly went away when I realized how much better I felt like there was no way I could ever imagine going back. I just knew that I went from being a completely nondysphoric cis man with a crossdressing fetish to someone with intense gender dysphoria in a very short period of time, only a few months, and I was afraid of the possibility that I could just as quickly and easily snap out of it one day, but that still hasn‚Äôt happened yet after 3 years. For the first 2 years, I thought I might not be truly trans on the inside for all kinds of bullshit reasons, but then I realized that if I had no reason to believe I was just faking being trans and even if I was, there was absolutely no reason for me to be this committed to it. If it was all just for a fetish, I wouldn‚Äôt have been willing to chemically castrate myself. If it was for attention, I wouldn‚Äôt have deleted facebook. If I was just a cis man LARPing as trans for any reason, there is absolutely no reason for me to be this committed to the role, that would just be ridiculous. The longer I transitioned, the more I felt I had legitimized my identity, and there‚Äôs just no reason I should‚Äôve had to overthink a justification for me to simply be who I am.",1643673713

While they don't mention an explicit reason for disallowing TFT-afk-ing, it is hinted on in their general goals: They want these missions to reward *time spent playing LOL* without influencing how or what mode you play. They don't want someone who's there to play ARAM or SR feel like they need to grind TFT cause that's the way to complete missions on a time-budget.

Whether ""rewarding time spend playing"" is a good system is debatable, but I do think removing a significant advantage of one mode (afking while getting progress) is the right direction.",1643673715

"Vaping","t5_2rg4n","I guess I spoke out without considering what coils are doing what.

Are we talking about clearomizers and cartomizers from 6+ years ago?

AFAIK, manufacturers made pods for low power devices, which required 50/50 ratios to help them wick. But look at the Caliburn coils: all rated 70/30. The industry seemed to have turned away from 50/50 juice (yes, there is still some on the market, but not near to what was), so manufacturers followed suit and adapted their coils. I hope you could find some designed for 60/40 so they can bridge between the two standards.

But how does a plastic container with a rubber plug in it, leak? The tanks are blow molded and sealed: bad QC and some are cracked? Maybe. The rubber plug isn't inserted? User error. Leaking through the coil? Basically a wicking issue which brings us back to the juice ratio issue. Leaking around the coil housing? Bad o-rings I guess, but how often does that happen? (probably the same rate as cracked pods).",1643673716

The Alaskan Iced Tea:

1.5 Oz sweetened lime juice
1.5 Oz Blue cura√ßao 
0.75 Oz white rum (Cpt Morgan works for us)
1.0 Oz dry gin (I use Bombay sapphire)
1.0 Oz Vodka (Absolut is what we use)
Lime juice to balance the drink to your taste (0.25 Oz for me)

Shake with ice, strain in a standard beer glass filled with fresh ice, top with sprite (should be enough room for 2.0 Oz of sprite at least)
If you make it, let me know what you think. It is fairly sweet, but it goes great with pizza or burgers",1643673716

"Northgard","t5_3fu3x","If you want you can follow my build:

1. Scout and Horgr immediately.

2. Get only 1 scout, go scout beach tiles first.

3. 2 Norns immediately if you claimed 1st scouted location, at 28 food otherwise.

4. Claim any scouted beach tile. Immediately woodcutter on second tile.

4. You're going to starve, this is fine, norns provide enough happiness so u save food.

4. If all beach tiles have wolfs, build woodcutter on town hall and sit until valkyrie.

5. Build fishery on main and house on second tile.

6. Get valkyrie asap and clear surrounding tiles.

7. Build second fishery, second woodcutter and third house.

8. Build iron mine and mine iron in winter.

9. Get some scouting off in winter. Try to have no basic villagers in winter.

10. Build forge and upgrade fishermen and woodcutter.

11. Build training camp and hire warchief.

12. In second spring try to clear something with warchief+valkyrie.

13. Get 1-2 trading posts up, trade with jotunns or dwarves if any.

14. Upgrade fisheries unless you're not trading food.

15. In any case, by at third spring you should have 3 fishery (hopefully), 2 woodcutter, 2 trading posts, 2 horgr, 1-3 camps, forge and some houses. Add healer hut if your warchief took dmg (shouldn't happen much, valk needs to tank).

16. Add camps until you have 15 warband (5 in total) and sit till 600-700 gold, then u can attack with warchief + 2 valks + 13 warriors + shielder + axe thrower (for tactics)",1643673717

&amp;#x200B;

Started out with trash ass makeup, with the over use of eye shadow, and bad hair, now, 2 years after lobas launch, we are presented with this. They are really giving Loba love now. :) This is gonna be the skin i wear indefinitely cause it tops every other skin that's came out so far in my opinion.

&amp;#x200B;

Hair: 10/10. I like the normal brown with tipped with silver, it looks good. She still has braids in the back which is meh, i think they could've given her short hair and itd be really good. But i don't mind it since i only see the front of the skin since I rock Hard to get and the legendary finisher so.

Overall, 10/10 job respawn. Keep spitting out loba skins like this and us loba mains will have a field day

&gt;3) I go all out when reading bedtime stories. Voices, shadow puppets, everything. 5 specifically loves it. 

&gt;4) I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself for the boys. Mark is a great father, but can be very uptight and will refuse to play with the boys in the park. I'm the one who is running around making monster noises and chasing all the kids.

Ultron: Man-Made creatures build from crazed scientists, becoming easily their greatest creation by far. Are also extremely resilient to kill in one way or another.

Doomsday: Creatures specifically created to be unkillable and who's goal it is to wreak havoc and kill a specific group (Z-Fighters and Justice League).

Hulk: Green clad experiments created (technically) from a lab. Grows unbelievably stronger the more they fight. Are hard to kill.

Martian Manhunter: Green clad aliens with a variety of powers and abilities (some from various heroes).

So, even if it was found - the fact remains that wife stole it.  Daughter didn't cause this rift.  Wife deserves to sleep on the couch for stealing from his daughter and not respecting his daughter's wishes.

Taking something from my child will piss me off, even if you give it back the next day.  Offering to buy her a better one?  How about you go your daughter her own necklace instead of stealing mine.

They both have Gnostic values within their identities, and they didn't/don't disengage from that while examining the Bible.

That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that nobody is getting hurt by this, and if you think this is about teenagers oversexualizing themselves, that's your problem, and twerking is only tangential to that.

I don't know.  Why are you talking? You're not helping.  I stepped in because I saw someone say something profoundly ignorant.

Sure you can. It's easy.

Yeah, teenagers are generally going to do what they want to do and banning it only makes it so they hide it from you next time.

"LateStageCapitalism","t5_39qgx","Congestion in my mind is generally caused by not enough transportation options (time competitive or price competitive). We like to design mass transit as a choice of last resort in most of our communities.  It is definitely rarely designed as the first choice. 

More density does mean more people. But it doesn‚Äôt need to mean more cars on the road. And there are also wide variations in what is ‚Äúdense.‚Äù

I live in a dense part of Oakland - and it probably feels more like Brooklyn.  My street is mixed with 3-5 store multi family buildings, single family homes, and duplexes.  But this sort of thing is basically illegal in most areas with typical building codes. 

The options are high rise or single family home and nothing else. There is a lot of space in the in-between. But we can‚Äôt design neighborhoods where the best and only choice to traverse them and the surrounding communities is driving to the day to day tasks. That‚Äôs when it feels congested and crappy.  We need good options to move around.  And that is part of the problem. There are few options, particularly at moderate prices, for people who can‚Äôt afford or don‚Äôt want cars. And then people end up moving really far and paying 70% of their take home on housing and transportation- the mix varying depending on where you live.",1643673721

Some blurriness at regular intervals is normal, especially if super stressed or exhausted etc. But at *intervals*, not as a constant and never-fluctuating state.

Edit: Okay, redid the whole thing and the picnic date is a major requirement for her.  Mostly for the photo.

It takes me a while to get (I actually run a lot in short bursts), as what I am truly allergic is vibration, just that running, eg. 5+ minutes, at the same exact pace triggers it (the pace is important)

I know it's vibration because if I shake violently on tracks while cycling which are very consistent vibration I get the hives almost instantly, exactly where I am vibrating the most, the hands, the feet and the bum; temperature is irrelevant, and contact with clothes is irrelevant (hands are uncovered).

"foxholegame","t5_3ejda","There's a level of common courtesy when it comes to vehicle ""ownership"" while out in the field, especially if you bring your own, but only while you're online and near your vehicles. Even then, it's best to lock any vehicle you leave unattended for more than a few seconds. Vehicles you leave unattended for hours are free game. The game only prevents locked vehicles from being wrenched open for a short time (think it was 30 min).

Only way to keep something safe is to put it in a private stockpile. If that stockpile goes untouched for two days, everything inside will become public. Most vehicles can only be stored in private stockpiles as crates (meaning they have to be made at a mass-production factory), so if you want to be able to access a flatbed quickly after logging in, your best bet is keeping a crate of rmats in stock and using it to build one when you need it. After you're done using your new flatbed for the day, it's best to park it somewhere where it may be of use to others. If you really want to keep it for yourself for a few hours while offline, you can try hiding it somewhere out of the way, somewhere without much traffic.",1643673722

"CodeGeass","t5_2tjxg","In my personal opinion it's a plot convenience, Euphemia's proposition opposes Lelouch's goals. The obvious goal of making a gentler world for Nunnally is thrown away as is the goal to find out who killed his mother because the SAZ removes Lelouch's tools to do so.


Its not like Lelouch doesn't know this, he goes into the conversation with Euphemia knowing that the SAZ crumbles the force he has built, diminishes his support, and stops his disempowerment of Britannia, even if that isn't Euphemia's intention.


The one line that changes this is apparently Euphemia giving up her claim to the throne to establish the SAZ, which I mean, fine, it's selfless and fits her character, but Euphemia's claim to the throne logically shouldn't affect Lelouch's thought processes. It's also not like this statement should affect him on a personal level, he already knows Euphemia is like this, his opinion of Britannia's deception shouldn't change because of Euphemia's statement because she is knowingly not like the rest of Britannia",1643673723

Plus I hate Ichigo's boring moveset because it reinforces one of my least favorite tropes, the main character getting a boring generic power like strength and basic stat boosts while everyone around them gets fun exciting and interesting abilities.

Like, I first got into Bleach because I heard Yhwach's The Almighty ability, thought it was really creative and interesting, and wanted to see the series. I enjoyed lots of the fights because of how interesting they were. Rukia's absolute zero freeze, Orihime's reject everything power, Mayuri's drugs and poisoning Bankai. The final arc was one of my favorite because of the Sternritter hax. Yet throughout it all, Ichigo never got anything more exciting than generic stat boosts.

I like everything else about him as a main character. His personality and motivation are great. It's just his trash moveset that irks me.

My biggest hope, though unlikely, is for Ichigo to display something exciting and new for the new Hell arc.  Perhaps some sort of Sankt Altar like energy redistribution power from his Quincy heritage and relation to Yhwach, or an interdimensional seal that traps an enemy in another dimension from Hollow Negacion, or something else.",1643673724

But as you say, there is multiple ways you can look at it. You can cry cause we are below our ATH or you can be happy you invested in something thats still relevant today compared to some other coins that were around in 2017 (OMG! I CANT BELIEVE I WON! THANK YOU \*\*\*\*\* TEAM! KEEP DOING THE GREAT WORK) and actually have a working product with real world usage and real world partnerships.

Also its easy to see that the majority of skepticism comes out when price is going down, I bet if you look at the dailys the weeks we went up to $0.28 there would be few to zero negative comments, but since price is going down there is 200 reasons why (no txs, wrong marketing, china hustle etc etc).",1643673724

Change my mind

Like honestly I play a smurf off role with a friend who's a low silver jg. We lose so many games because somebody on the team who 'totally knows what they're doing guis'. And that's not to say I'm amazing I'm only gold. But I at least know when a game is endable

I want a low elo tutorial to come out that says 'when your ahead group and try to end before the enemy scales' instead of 'the answer is always split push'. The amount of what should have been 25 minute wins that turn into 50 minute losses when I play with my friend are entirely too high and it's literally justbecause low elos 1. Don't know how to end and 2. Are obsessed with side lane pressure.

Its just. Lazy. 

They're not being big brains about it or trying to convey reliable firearms. They're being lazy. It's the same reason the minigun is just an m134 with a weird fire rate instead of any of halos already existing turrets (that have similar irl models). 

Yes, you could explain it away and try your hardest to say ""well maybe they found it and it still works""

Jouw persoonlijke mening is niet heel erg steekhoudend als ik het wegzet tegenover de mening van meerdere epidemilogen. Al de info die je wilt weten over de verschillende varianten is te vinden via Google Scholar. Al zal er op het gebied van Omikron misschien nog niet zo veel te vinden zijn. Maar ga maar helemaal los. Google Scholar is echt een goede voor wetenschappelijk onderbouwd zoekwerk.

Moet je wel nog steeds redelijk weten hoe je een wetenschappelijk onderzoek moet weten en de parameters van het onderzoek goed bekijken.

En voor een stuk achtergrond over gevaccineerde en niet gevaccineerde gerelateerd aan ziekenhuis opnames:

En ""vol"" in deze is een relatief begrip. Maar er wordt nog steeds reguliere zorg opgeschoven en opgeschort omdat er een relatief grote hoeveelheid corona pati√´nten is. De IC ligt op dit moet voor meer dan 25% vol met corona pati√´nten. Das best een flinke hoeveelheid. Minder dan het op de piek was, maar toch.

En wanneer kunnen we dan inderdaad weer helemaal open? Nou zullen we dat over laten aan de mensen die er voor gestudeerd hebben, de data ter beschikking hebben en die data kunnen interpreteren?",1643673725

"Vent","t5_2qimv","Actually I decided to say more. You see... you obviously didn't understand what i was trying to get to, since you immediately jumped to a couple of words that I said ignoring the whole point I was trying to make. 

I pitty you if you think that everyone who talks to you wants to hurt you and so you immediately jump towards those types of conclusions without actually opening your mind to other options.

Now my point was, if family doesn't make you feel safe and happy then sadly it is not the best, but they are still your family. 

I won't advise you on that... it is your family. if it was up to me I would get them to understand and change their mind on things, if their hate towards you comes from a place of ignorance... if their hate is directed at you due to them being assholes who have no empathy towards people then I would cut them off. 

You immediately jumped towards the terms of transphobia and racist.

Abuse, hate and discrimination stem from opinions. People have opinions about the people they abuse, hate or discriminate against... if the opinions change then so will the behaviour. After all... being racist is a choice... you chose to hate a race just for a feature they have or for your preconceived notions of them then you chose to be racist.

Your family might be like that... but it is completely up to THEM to be like that. It is not up to YOU to change them since it would just be plain arrogance if you think you can suddenly force your mind on others even if your opinion is correct. Getting worked up about it and angry will just make them think they are in the right in some usually wierd and convoluted way.

Getting them to understand that their hate is unfounded would be the best, but as I said in the first comment, it would just make you more angry at them if they end up not changing their mind and that would lead to you having a more miserable life. Overall trying to change their mind is probably not worth it unless you value your family enough to really try it.

The main takeaway was that if you think your family is causing you problems you should stop talking to them... either limit the topics that seem to cause disagreement or just don't talk to them at all.

Also, getting angry over anything is Dumb as fk. Why would you get angry at things? If they bother you solve them... if you can't realistically solve them... then it is best to ignore them and don't let them bother you. If your goal in life is to be happy then I think it is best to heed what I said. 

If your goal is to change the world. Start with your family first... and then know that chaging the world will be a billion times harder.

In the end... why do you give a shit what people who dislike and hate you think... isn't it the best that you are content with yourself and that those closest to you, whose opinions are worth considering because you know they mean well, are doing good too. 

Well whatever honestly. If you decide to at least consider what I said... then great. If not... that is great too. It is after all... your choice.",1643673726

I would also like to point out that the whole reason this debate began was because I was arguing that the thermostat in the picture isn't a crappy design.

But there's a proponent of people who start seeing how long they can fast for. They fast for too long, probably too frequently. There is no reason for anybody to do a multi-day fast. Yet you'll find people here who push 48 hour fasts and the like.

At the start of university he laughed saying they were still paying him his full salary, a few months later he was concerned he was still receiving a salary so he wrote to them informing them of their errors. Heard nothing. 

Followed up a few months later, still paid by said company and no response. We continued laughing about it for a year. All this money was being placed into a savings account. 

A year later, he continued writing letters to them informing them he had left and was still being paid. 

Two years pass (salary still coming in) more letters, finally someone from HR responded stating they would investigate and come back to him. 6 months later, another letter from the company saying they were currently investigating and that they thanked him for his co-operation. (whilst still being paid). 

Just after finishing uni, he received another letter stating that they had found issues with their payroll software and they appreciated his patience during the last 6-12 months however unfortunately they would be requiring all the money that had paid him in the last 12 months. 

Of course, he was more than happy to send back what they requested. 

Lucky git got paid 24+ months for nothing. I've not kept in contact but last time we were in touch, he still had the money in a savings account a good 5 years later.

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad","All you really need is a currency system. The concept of letting someone else borrow money and having them pay a fee for the convenience shouldn't be too much of a stretch. 

One thing that banks today take for granted are easily accessible credit histories and other documentation. A lot of banking in the old days was based on trust and personal relationships, and most banks only did business in a local area. Some banks even printed their own money, which would have only been trusted in areas where that bank's reputation was well known. If you didn't know the banker personally, then you'd probably have to put up something as collateral, like a valuable object or the title to property. Another thing that was important was relationships between banks. If you did business with a bank in New York in the 1700s, for example, and you wanted to go to London to buy goods for transport back to the colonies, you'd have your banker write letters of introduction to banks that they do business with in London, assuming they trusted you enough to commit to something like that. That would help you establish credit so you could borrow money locally instead of transporting large amounts of cash on your person. It would also help you find banks that you could reasonably expect not to cheat you since everyone is personally connected.

As far as renting goes, the one loaning out their carriage might require a deposit payment for the amount of the carriage. When the carriage is returned, the customer gets the money back minus the rental fee. That way, if the carriage is never returned, the owner isn't out a carriage because they can just buy a new one. If the carriage owner knows the customers personally, they might not require that much up front if they trust them to bring it back. This would probably only work as long as the renter had ties to the community, like family or property, that would allow the carriage owner to collect if something went wrong.

A cart rental would probably be something done on an ad-hoc basis, meaning that there wouldn't be cart rental stores where that was someone's only business. It would be someone who just happens to have a cart letting someone else borrow it for a while. A specific job people had was driving carts (this is where the English last name ""Carter"" comes from), so you'd normally hire the person instead of the cart itself. Most people were busy working their own trade and didn't have time to spend days on the road moving goods around, so they hired a professional to do it for them.",1643673727

Take tiny hits, no more then a couple hits, don't overdo it, and make sure the instant you feel the nausea or stomach pain creeping up, you  STOP, and wait a few weeks again (doesn't have to be as long as the first wait), and learn from your last experience. Learn your body's boundaries. 
These mother fuckers are so toxic. Honestly, people just want to smoke pot again. All of you, don't be a fucking douchebag to everybody who just wants to enjoy a wonderful drug again.

My middle was my rough sleeper. In the beginning he would sleep chunks of time but at the totally wrong time of day to be helpful to me (morning and mid day). I raised the issue with the pediatrician who said kiddo had his nights and days flopped. Recommendation was to keep baby in totally well lit areas during day - sunny rooms with all the lights on. Inversely to keep everything as dark as possible at night - no lights, tv, phones, etc. It was agony but in less than a week he had his longer stretch of sleep at night. 

He continued to be an absolutely horrible sleeper, but at least he slept when he slept it was when I could also sleep. 

Also, music has too much variation to be conducive to sleep. White noise drones on in mostly the same tone. The idea is it can fade into the background while also blocking out other noises.

Here's some ultra cheese for instance:
You can theoretically have someone who is not involved in the combat at all, from a few screens away, summon an Incarnate that approaches from range and hurls a fireball or something. That puts the Incarnate into the action but not the summoner. The summoner can just make a new Incarnate and repeat. This means you could pump out infinite Incarnate spells in a single combat round without ever letting the AI get a turn. Completely and totally busted, but Larian easily could have made their combat engine check that a summon's master is present in the fight, and/or ensured that effects that originated from outside the encounter didn't affect participants inside it and vice versa. They clearly were aware of this sort of thing, since they did patch Teleport breaking conversations, probably because that actually could break the game state, but making combat trivial does not inherently cause any problems.",1643673729

"AccidentalComedy","t5_2xbus","Man you fit right into how mainstream left likes to do things. You just leave of key pieces of quotes so they fit what works best for you. I went on to say ""hard pressed to find anyone who progresses the world, especially technologically, due to it's connection with business."" That doesn't discount anyone, also says they are very very rare. Which you took the time to respond to without saying anything contrary. 

Peterson didn't get his spotlight standing against ""trans rights"". Either you don't actually know or chose to see it biasedly. His stance was making it mandatory to call someone by any pronoun they themselves choose, otherwise there could be legal recourse was not only wrong but chilling to free speech. That has absolutely nothing to do with trans rights. No one should be forced to call anyone anything they don't want regardless of sexual identity. All he said was the same. The next part of your point is just you being racist. Trying to tie someone who hasn't shown any outward racist tendencies to somehow being racist for trying to teach men to take pride in themselves. Even if it isn't in the best ways and there is a whole lot to disagree with his teachings, being chauvinistic isn't racist and isn't ""colonialist white supremacy"". It's ok to celebrate women and being a strong responsibile woman (also chauvinistic btw) but doing the same for a man is bad? And the fact you think someone taking responsibility, getting help for their addiction and getting clean is a bad thing says a whole lot about you. Not sure how that can be a bad thing. I assume you're someone who wants everyone to blindly get a vaccine but then demonizes someone who gets medical help to get clean. It's weird to me. 

I agree there is a large wealth inequality in this world. I also agree that the world is in some ways rigged against those without it, and that the ones at the top make moves to hold the rest down or accumulate more wealth. I am not sure how exactly Musk and Peterson propagate that specifically, but at least with Musk I can agree he isn't altruisticly giving back or lifting the poor. Peterson I don't follow this line of thinking at all. How is he contributing to the oppression of the poor?

Why can't you be just a guy and have a massive platform? Who says you can't? I think Rogan proves your line of thinking false. Again what's most telling about your statement here is you understand it's a good thing to allow people with different views to have discourse but seem to think people with a view you deem to be horrible shouldn't be allowed to speak. Who decides what is a ""horrible view"" and how else are you going to explain to people what is factual and what isn't if you don't allow them to speak? Overwhelmingly the people Rogan has on don't provide ""factually wrong information"" and if they do he overwhelmingly calls them out on it. Something tells me you've never really listened to his podcast or you'd know that. Even the podcasts which started this whole thing didn't provide factually wrong information. The concern is people will hear the information and decide against the vaccine. Different from the information being wrong.

I think the problem is, and apologies if I am wrong it is an assumption, is that you think only ideas which you agree with should be allowed. That any information you, or your bubble decide is wrong shouldn't be heard. That is the dangerous way of thinking, and if you can't see that I'd say you're the gullible one.",1643673730

 My pregnant sister (14F) just celebrated her 14th birthday on Sunday. Well anyway my parents (56F 60M) had a birthday party for her and I (20M) don't like spending time with my family, other than my lil sis of course! Because they are very rude to me. Anyway if I go I get shit from them and if I don't go I get more shit. So either way I am doomed. So anyway I was tested positive for Corona a few days before her birthday party because I have to take a test each week for work. Anyway I didn't want to hear it from my parents so I decided to go. They don't know that I have covid-19 at least not yet. Should I even tell them? I had a good time with my little sister though :D I am so proud of her she is going to be a mother soon.

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","In my last session with my therapist last week, I was sharing how my dad gave me a bill for major expenses raising me over the prior couple years when I turned 18, and I was quick to assure my therapist that ""there wasn't anything overtly absurd in the list! Stuff like school supplies, clothes, driver's ed fees""

He was silent for like 30 seconds, that felt like 10 to 15 minutes, My mind was very busy. Trying to figure out if I shouldn't have had a problem with any of this. And then he said: "" I'd like to hear why you think that nothing on that list was absurd. Because I think the entire concept of giving a bill to my kid for raising him is absurd""

It kicked off a hole discussion about how I felt in that moment, how I felt abandoned, how that has continue to play a role do the rest of my life.

I guess what I mean to say when I'm sharing this even though it's completely different from yours, is that what we tell our therapist often changes their perspective on how they see us, but not as a judgmental perspective. Just adding another index card of trauma or neglect that the therapist has to mentally incorporate into everything that they're talking about with us. Because it's important.

That moment for you was hugely important to where you are today, with the path you have found yourself on through life. He takes that piece of information and goes back through everything you've told him previously, helping to figure out where and the overall picture of your emotional health this puzzle piece needs to fit.

The embarrassment is normal, although it shows how deeply not okay that event was. In that moment your mom tried to teach you a lie about how you see yourself. It's the shreds of that light. It still remain that drive the embarrassment you feel now and sharing it. It's not a weird memory, it's a traumatic one. That was horrible for your mother to have done that, and I pray that you find peace one day.",1643673731

"seventeen","t5_2spu6","Seungkwan is my ultimate favorite person ever. I see a lot of similarities in him and me.. maybe because we are both capricorns... but anyway he‚Äôs beautiful and funny and smart and so so talented but doesn‚Äôt see how much. I relate to him a lot, he struggles a lot with eating and his body image, he‚Äôs not afraid to speak up, the members say he nags too much, or makes too many enemies but he wouldn‚Äôt do any of it if he didn‚Äôt love them all deeply, he nags because he wants them all to be healthy as possible and take care of themselves, which is very sweet. i have been told my whole life i can be bossy or sassy and it‚Äôs hard to deal with because i feel so much and i‚Äôm just trying to help people make the best choices, he seems to come off this way often too, it‚Äôs clear he gets overwhelmed but never has a bad intention. it makes me happy he has so many members that love him for who he is. though he speaks for the group the most, you can tell it‚Äôs not all natural and he‚Äôs putting all the responsibility on himself, when another member speaks sometimes you can spot him nervously fiddling his fingers or biting his lips, like he‚Äôs on edge until it‚Äôs his turn again, like he never fully relaxes. work is known to be a curse for capricorn‚Äôs (sorry if you don‚Äôt believe in zodiac it‚Äôs just how i explain this kind of personality best.) work is almost addicting to them and you can see that in him, it‚Äôs like he couldn‚Äôt stop even if he wanted to. it‚Äôs admirable, relatable (to me because i feel the same, when i‚Äôm not working on something i‚Äôm failing), and sad because i and so many carats i‚Äôm sure worry and want him to rest more...anyway i just think he‚Äôs really likable, lovable, witty, caring, and a million other words.",1643673732

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","I'm not saying those numbers are wrong but to your last paragraph what would the downside to passing more gun laws be aside from inconveniencing hobby gun owners? The worst possible outcome I can see with that is that it doesn't work and nothing changes in which case we didn't really lose much. I don't think guns should be totally outlawed but it is probably a good idea to at least try to adopt some of the same policies as other Western countries regarding permits, training, and proper storage of guns. Doing nothing and complaining about gun violence is never going to solve the problem.  
  
I also believe that approaching the (possible) root of the problem (poverty) at the same just might do wonders for reducing the amount of gun violence. Again, I don't claim to be an expert but those things to me seem like common sense actions this nation can take to stem the rising shootings these days. I also don't think either of those solutions would be an instant fix, it would most likely take a while to implement and work through the process before we started take seeing large changes.",1643673732

Learning hadoop is not a bad thing, spark was / is a part of hadoop....but on its own, databricks has evolved spark to be (imo) much more effective than hadoop.

If you want to learn how these things work, take a course on distributed systems....hadoop is one example of distributed computing

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Nowdays I think this is just a post-hoc rationalization so that Christians can worship God and Jesus without it being polytheism.

But back in the day when I was younger, I thought that the most elegant solution was that God, knowing everything, being perfect, and utterly invulnerable, didn't know what it was like to have to follow His laws when you are ignorant, flawed, vulnerable, scared, hungry, and subject to all the trappings of our human existence.

So I looked at it as God essentially deciding to walk a mile in our shoes so that He could get a feel, from the inside, for why we kept on failing to follow His rules.

That's how I made sense of Christ saying: ""My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"" because that would be a weird thing to say to yourself, yeah?

And it's how I made sense of Christ saying ""Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing,"" because that is basically God having the realization - having actually lived through a human life and had it end in terror and fear and pain despite (by definition) having lived a morally flawless life - that humans are scared and don't know what we're doing.

In my mind, after Jesus died the experience he'd had as a human with the rest of the Godhead, and that God was then moved by this to change from a retributive model of justice to a forgiveness model of mercy. So God then miracled himself back down into Jesus' body with this new understanding, and that this is what the resurrection was, and also why Jesus' body looked different, because God was the one inhabiting that body and *God* was now different.

And that God knew all of that would happen, because God knows everything that would happen. But that God had to go through the steps for it to happen, because if He hadn't gone through those steps, then he wouldn't have had that change of heart.

I was then told - gently and firmly - that this was entirely wrong and not at all how that story worked. But the explanations I got instead - can't remember what they were now - but whatever they were, they didn't make sense, and the teachers trying to instruct me on what was the correct way to look at it didn't seem to understand what their own positions, they just wanted me to be quiet, stop asking for clarification, and stop defending my interpretation.

This wasn't the reason why I became an atheist. But it was one of several instances of my religious instructors giving bad reasons for things that put my feet on the path of questioning what I'd been taught, and that journey ultimately ended with me concluding that Christianity is a fictional and mythological story loosely based on some historical events... And through that lens it does (to me) make a lot more sense.",1643673733

"miamidolphins","t5_2s20n","Personally I am not a fan of this opinion, if we were to make that trade it would be taking a step backwards.

Tua has better per game averages than Jimmy G (not by much) and Tua has only played 1.5 seasons with a lot of room for improvement.

Jimmy G is now 30, been in the league for 8 seasons. There is possibly improvement in his IQ but his body isn't going to get better and his tosses will not be flying as far for many more years. 

To compare pricing doesn't make sense because Tua had himself a pretty good year and we would only be wasting money by trading for an experienced QB when the team qnd coaching staff isn't ready for a superbowl (if we beef up our line and fix our run game than we got something great).

The focus should no longer be on is Tua the guy or not. The focus needs to be in building a competent coaching staff that has great chemistry with the players.",1643673733

The scene linked is pivotal in examining a major theme of the show (Understanding and how because we don't understand each other, there can be a path to peace). Ex: Could Annie have explained everything to Armin in season 1, Could Bertholdt or Ymir explain their back story &amp; motivations in season 2. No because the reality and knowledge was they were the last remnant of humanity thanks to the walls. They wouldn't understand the sea, or anither country, or why they're hated by the world... Which makes Grisha's books important to the people in Paradis, because they understand more ofnthe world, and on some level the 104 who viewed Reiner as an enemy or a traitor to humanity, can understand him and why he felt he was right...

"AustralianTeachers","t5_3phq9","All the research since starting my degree has shown that teachers are extremely overworked without any compensation like overtime pay like other industries. 

Working a lot of extra hours without proper compensation is expected now fur teachers and it is not right.

It is expected to: 
do playground duty, prep for classes, attend meetings after hours, grade papers, report cards, patent teacher meetings, file paperwork, possibly coach sports on weekends or other weekend activities and on top of all that actually teach.  It seems most teachers are doing 60 hour work weeks and spending holidays preparing for the next term. It's like there is the common misconception that teachers are expected to work extra hours during the term but the balance of that is that they get a lot of holidays. It seems this is not true anymore.
A friend is a primary teacher and she spent the last week cleaning up her classroom from the previous teacher who left it messy and dusty. She took everything out of the classroom to do a thorough cleaning. Her school can't afford cleaners to clean the classroom on a regular basis and it barely got a regular vacuum throughout the year.  The rest of the summer holiday period was preparing for the approaching school year. 
I just don't want to put myself (mature age and doing a career change) in a situation where I know I'm a great teacher (I know I would be) but hate that my life is overrun by all the extraneous BS that is expected and not compensated for. Because I know me and that will drive me absolutely up the wall and I'll burn out very quickly.",1643673735

"CorpsmanUp","t5_2ztc7","First question - how is your eye sight? This is biggest disqualification point for incoming aircrew. Because most SAR units are rotary - you will need to qualify with depth perception. The SAR community is small small small. As for deployments: The kick in the pants is this‚Ä¶they combined AVT 8406 along with SAR 8401 several years ago. You will need to go through AVT school prior to class convening and going through aircrew school. The reason is that the higher ups feel that SAR HM are very underutilized. It is such a specialty niche. 

For me‚Ä¶I am a former ARSS Instructor. We got the Rescue Swimmers after they went through aircrew school. There are lots of games in aircrew school. The pipeline for most is that you are a fresh boot going through the pipeline. The washout rate for fleet people coming through is very high. Find out the requirements for the SAR fit test and get comfortable doing double the work. 

Hope this helps. This was my life for several years.",1643673735

"manufacturing","t5_2qz70","Well first things first, you're gonna need a manufacturing drawing, or something to tell the manufacturer what is the most they're able to deviate from a nominally perfect CAD model.

Imagine if you contracted a shop to make you 1"" square cubes. Without a drawing, they could theoretically deliver 1/2"" cubes, and say that it's within the specified tolerance and then you're still on the hook for paying for it.

To make a CAD model, you'll likely need to reverse engineer or model the housing from scratch, this will be neither fun nor cheap. You'll also want to take a sample of the mating components to determine what kind of tolerancing you'll need to apply to the interfacing features.

So great, you've got a spiffy 3D CAD model and a manufacturing print suitable for hanging in the Guggenheim. Then you start sending it out to manufacturers.

There are prototype manufacturers, then production manufacturers. Each one specializes in different volumes and capabilities, you'll likely need to start with the former. At a minimum, they'll want to know your minimum quantities and lead time before informing you that you'll need upwards of five figures ($XX,000) for tooling.

To you it's a game, to the players it's their livelihoods. They aren't ""parasites"" anymore than a retail worker is. I won't ever blame them for trying to get their fair share of the pie in a relatively harmless business from owners who do shit like war profiteer, help cover up genocide, and steal hundreds of millions from taxpayers by holding teams hostage in exchange for sweetheart stadium deals where they assume 0 capital costs and force the municipalities to go into debt to keep their team. The players want to get paid for their jobs in a career where the average career is 5 years long. They deserve fair pay, pensions and Healthcare for their work.

"languagelearning","t5_2rjsc","&gt;I asked how long the period lasts where you only say a few words

Until you know enough words to express yourself about a subject.

Do you have hobbies? let's say you love speaking about language learning. If that is the case, the words about the subject are finite, if you read and listen(and memorize with anki or other software) those words, you will be able to speak about it(if you have enough grammar knowledge, which you will because you are learning it naturally by exposing yourself to the language)

Basically, focus on a subject interesting for you, that you want to speak about. You will be able to after some months of just focusing on that subject.

BUT that's not real. nobody just reads and listens about the same thing(you probably want to watch movies and read books, perhaps speak about philosophy with your friends) So it will take a lot more time.",1643673736

"ChronicIllness","t5_2vh1a","In the UK so this is the NHS.

I have IBD and IBS. My gastro consultant put me on infusions that work as immunosuppressants. Once I was on the immunosuppressant infusions to treat the IBD, we were going to see what symptoms were left over for IBS treatment to focus on. Infusions started in January 2021. In April 2021, I was referred for treatment for IBS symptoms- biofeedback and hypnotherapy. The infusions have been gradually making me sicker- the frequent infections were making my other chronic illnesses worse even as my IBD improved. So I had my last infusion January 2022. I spoke to my gastro consultant last week about stopping the infusions now that it has been a year. I still haven‚Äôt heard anything about biofeedback or hypnotherapy. When I told my consultant that I hadn‚Äôt heard yet, he said he would chase them. Even he was surprised how long the wait was. The gastro department also has dieticians that I am waiting to see and they currently have a 42 week wait.

At least I spoke to my consultant though this time. During the first lockdown in 2020, I couldn‚Äôt get hold of anyone. They were so short on staff that no one was answering phone calls or emails pretty much. Luckily for me, my next door neighbour is a gastro consultant (not my consultant but same hospital, same department) and thanks to him, someone called me to book a phone call appointment with my consultant. If things had got any worse I probably would have ended up admitted to hospital. So I‚Äôm very thankful that I got lucky with who my neighbours are.

My sister is a midwife at the same hospital and she‚Äôs told me some of the behind-the-scenes of staff shortages.

I would not go to the local news about it. My first point of call would be the patient advice and liason service. They are basically the complaints department for hospitals. I‚Äôve had to contact them before and when they get involved, things do happen. But also my local news wouldn‚Äôt be interested in a vague story, and I would not be interested in giving details of my health.",1643673736

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","From reading what you've said, it seems you have been infected with spyware either by phone or laptop. The only other possibility is that your Netflix password was weak and they brute forced it, then tried accessing other accounts with the same email and password. Never use the same password twice. This is where a password manager can really help you. Some really good suggestions here but personally if I were you, I would just factory reset everything. Running antivirus checks etc may not be enough. It is absolutely of critical importance that you keep all devices as up to date as possible. The major benefit of this is that security flaws in most cases are usually patched up before the vulnerabilities go mainstream, so this could really save you.

Some bullet point suggestions...

1.  Factory reset everything and if your devices are cheap and outdated, consider replacing them with newer ones within your budget. You would expect the new devices would still be able to receive updates.

2. Use a password manager. NEVER, EVER save all your personal bank details etc in a browser password manager. Bitwarden or Keepass would be the best choices and they are free. You'll only ever need to remember one password. Just make sure it's a good one and back it up somewhere safe. Also, passwords with 8 or less characters are generally considered very weak and can be brute forced fairly quickly. With a password manager, it can generate passwords of 100+ characters if you wish which are impossible to crack (unless the password is exposed. Try stick with passwords of at l least 12 characters, or use 30+ characters if you're saving them in a password manager as you won't need to remember them.

3. USE 2 FACTOR AUTHENTICATION WHERE POSSIBLE. Sorry for the caps, bit this is really important because if your passwords were compromised again, 2FA would give you that extra barrier of protection that could save your bacon.

4. If you're using Android or IOS, you should be able to log on to your account and remove all registered devices. Do this too if you can.

Regarding your personal photos, do you know what platform you would normally send these over? Would it be iMessage? WhatsApp? FB Messenger etc? Most of  these services are end to end encrypted, so the only way they would be able to gain access to such photos would be if they had the login credentials to your messaging apps, or possibly from a backup, but unlikely.",1643673736

You had it right, actually. The ""you"" in the sentence is already the object of the sentence, meaning the infinitive verb at the end doesn't need to be passive to be acting on them. Or at least it so strongly implies the passive that it doesn't need to be marked and it's more idiomatic to leave it out, I keep going back and forth on which it is.

Where this doubles down is the concept that introducing mRNA to cells is somehow unique and dangerous, it‚Äôs used as a plea to expert claim that what the vaccines are doing is more dangerous than what almost all viruses do inside the human body every day, the thing that your own immune system exists to fight - corruption of cells to serve another purpose.

"relationshipanarchy","t5_2x0yu","I wasn't suggesting choosing not to have feelings, which we can safely say is impossible. I was suggesting that, if romance is some combination of biological impulse to exclusively couple and socially oppressive propaganda, then we may be required, as people who want to maintain autonomy in our relationships, to resist its impulses in various considered ways.

After hearing everyone's experiences, I've now changed my mind about the exclusive coupling part. Now I think we all get the feels (except aromantics) and engaging with the feels with another person is super nice. We just need to recognize that social conditioning would have us adopt all kinds of shit on top of that exchange (exclusivity, lumping all expectations into this one relationship, patriarchal ownership expectations, capitalist ""corporate"" merging of finances and leadership, and on and on) and resist said conditioning. Which is super hard because, it seems, few aspects of our lives are as comprehensively and universally conditioned as this.

And, I suppose I'm also starting to think one particularly helpful tool for resisting would be to not automatically change to another label like ""girl/boyfriend"", ""lover"", ""couple"", ""partner"", etc. when one engages in the feels with another person, instead just holding them as a dear friend you are sharing the feels with.",1643673737

Pisses me off the ass holes that created bottled water and now so many people wont drink tap water cause they think it will poison them.

It is all made on purpose by big faceless corporations. Coca Cola and Nestle sucks most of the potable water in the world and resells it to you in sugary drinks. Chemical plants dump their waste on rivers to pollute them so you can no longer drink from the tap so they can sell you bottled water from their water companies (in which the big hats also have shares). At the same time drinking bottled water will eventually give you some nasty cancer and you will end up using their other medical companies and insurance. Finally the last stop is with their coffin making companies and their crematory services. You complete the entire loop always being drained of money at all stages of your trip from the hospital you are born to the landfill disguised as cemetery you finally are dumped in.

You can't. 

&gt;Aristocratic Elite renaming Administrators to Nobles, Exalted Priesthood doing the same but renaming them High Priests instead, and Technocracy for Science Directors.

Those don't create new jobs, they just swap out jobs. The example given in the op would require new ones to be made, that are all exact copies with different names, and only tied to those governments. Typically if the devs are making a change to a job, it then applies to all of those jobs. That's how the back end code works. It's much easier to make a change to one, and then forget to make it to the other 3. 

&gt;Ultimately, it's up to Paradox whether it's worth doing.

They have weighed in on renaming Governors before. They won't be doing this. Besides, the easier solution, just clicking the box and renaming, was implemented years ago.",1643673740

*****
&gt; In 2018, Khuraman Abil, the former head of Bos Shelf&amp;#039;s administrative team, filed a case in a district court in southern Baku alleging that the company had withheld $214,000 of her salary and that she had been unfairly dismissed when she complained about corruption.

&gt; A spreadsheet of people&amp;#039;s salaries - which Abil said was accidentally sent to her while she was working for Bos Shelf and which contains data also found in the BP files - indicates that the company did indeed keep most of her paycheck.

&gt; After raising the problems in Bos Shelf with BP dozens of times over three years, Abil said she believed the British oil company knew what was going on.

* Fought in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921.
* Fought during the German invasion of Poland in 1939.
* Remained in the Polish army as it became the Home Army (Poland‚Äôs formal resistance force).
* **Volunteered to deliberately get himself arrested in order to infiltrate Auschwitz**.
*  **Succeeded in getting himself arrested in order to infiltrate Auschwitz**.
* **Infiltrated fucking Auschwitz**.
* Organized a secret resistance within the camp.
* Smuggled reports out to the Home Army detailing Auschwitz‚Äôs horrific conditions and its evolution into an extermination camp (he even accurately calculated the number of people being killed in the gas chambers.)
* Arranged the killing of a Nazi agent who attempted to infiltrate the camp resistance.
* Frustrated with the lack of outside action to liberate or at least destroy the camp, he escaped Auschwitz after **two and a half years** as a prisoner.
* Returned immediately to Home Army service after escaping. 
* Wrote a detailed report of his experiences and findings. Known as ‚ÄúWitold‚Äôs Report,‚Äù it was the first detailed firsthand account of the Auschwitz camp network and was even read by Churchill. 
* Fought in the brutal house-to-house combat of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, at first hiding his army rank of captain but eventually stepping forward when needed officers were badly needed. 
* Survived the Warsaw Uprising and eventually ended up in Italy at war‚Äôs end.
* Returned to Poland after the war to continue resistance activities- now against the communists, who were turning Poland into a Soviet puppet state. 
* Arrested by the communists, convicted at a show trial, and summarily executed. His burial whereabouts remain unknown. 
* Wiped from the history books as if he had never existed. 
* Re-discovered after the fall of communism as one of Poland‚Äôs greatest heroes.
* Posthumously rehabilitated, promoted to colonel, and awarded Poland‚Äôs two highest awards.

It‚Äôs nuts that his story isn‚Äôt a big-budget film yet. I don‚Äôt mean to downplay other heroes like Oskar Schindler, but the *balls* this guy had simply defy belief.

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","&gt;it became clear that these people wanted to abolish Islam, viewing it as a invasive threat to society

I want to abolish Islam. And Christianity... And all forms of faith in misinformation. 

It's not my place to do this by force or coercion. I don't want to have anything to do with people who live in an alternate reality. That doesn't mean I want to try to convert them(pointless to try using reason with someone unreasonable) not do I want to hurt them. I just literally want nothing to do with them. 

,&gt;people don't need to justify being religious to be included in stateless society and earnestly accepted by anarchists

Only until they start forcing their backwards bullshit on others because religion which is founded on faith rather than fact has some very backwards beliefs. To an athiest an abortion is preventing a pregnancy. To a Christian it is often murdering a baby. How am I supposed to coexist with someone who believes me a murderer due to what I believe is my personal autonomy? 

&gt;Religious people aren't the enemy, nor are they victims who are in need of secular liberation. 

Is that so? Thanks for maginalizing me! I tried to kill myself as a teenager because I had no escape from those wicked christians. I'd have given a life debt to someone secular if they liberated me from that disgusting filth. Christianity fucked up my mental health for half my life and left lasting scars I'll carry to my grave. Your claim that religion doesn't have victims is utter bullshit.

I wasn't given an option to believe in god. I was told god was a fact and zi had zero outside influences to tell me otherwise until the internet rose. I was FORCED and coerced to believe in god by my parents and community. Growing up in a Christian household was a direct violation of my personal sovergnty and liberty. They fucking brainwashed me into living in fear and constant surveillance by an all powerful psychotic judge jury and executioner who would send me to eternal hellfire if I didn't serve him. 

I find it highly offensive you suggest I accept someone who brainwashed their children like I was as an equal

Spirituality and agnosticism is different. It is a non organized opinion. Agnostics don't claim to know that god is real just that they prefer to this he is. Religion on the other hand is a cult (the two terms being synonymous except religion is wide spread and socially accepted where cults are not) that takes baseless claims without evidence and treats them as fact, an act that is inconsistent with every other aspect of our life.

I believe people who live by alternative rules and have faith in unprovable things are inheritly dangerous due to their delusions and this can be seen in the amount of religious violence in the world. 

How often do athiests suicide bomb churches in the name of no god? How often is the lack of a god the expressived motive for actions that target another party? 

Athiests do bad things like humans of all beliefs, but we don't do them to uplift the godless. 

What if my religion tells me to cut off my children's toes because God sees toes as dirty? Are you just going to accept me systematically mutilating my children because I read a made up story and decided it's actually a fact? Oh wait religious people already do mutilate their children! 

It's not my goal to hunt down religious people and force them to convert or kill them. I'm not some kind of athiest Terminator, but you'll have to forgive me if I don't want dilusional barbarians who hurt people for glory,mutilate oppress and brain wash and rape children in my fucking community!",1643673745

Are you not concerned about those people clogging up the hospitals? I agree that people who are more at risk should get the vaccine to protect themselves, but to mandate a drug that causes various health problems to the general population is an abuse of power. Do you wonder why they banned Ivermctin and demonized it in the media even though it's been proven to help with many viral infections? Because it wasn't made by Pfizer. On top of that, the Pfizer Covid pill (which is Ivermectin with a slightly different formula), has been approved by the US. Anyway, the vaccine is great for people who actually need it.

Breakthrough infections always happen when only part of the population is vaccinated. The reason you (presumably) never had any of the above is not just because you were vaccinated, but because you probably never met an infected person who was transmitting.  Case in point: people vaccinated against measles contract measles during outbreaks in unvaccinated populations.

Vaccines work just like traffic laws work: enough people need to adopt them.

So no hyperbole: they are a way out. But you need an almost universal adoption given the R_0 of covid. And the slower that adoption happen, the less effective current vaccines become due to the high mutability rate of the SARS CoV2 virus.",1643673745

They still have thousands of deaths from people not getting vaccinated and not avoiding unnecessary contact/exposure.

I can't say for sure based on the video, but it appears the car started from a position quite far back from the lane of stopped traffic, so it is likely the car had a good view past the last (furthest left) stopped car and could see the lack of traffic coming from that direction well enough to make an assumption about a lack of vehicles in the middle lane behind the stopped cars. This move (assuming good perception) is much safer when done by the car, because it doesn't have to look away from the left hand traffic (possibly missing a vehicle proceeding into the blind spot behind the stopped cars) in order to watch right hand traffic for a gap to turn left into.",1643673746

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1","Answering here because it is really well summed up. I'm totally ignorant about eastern philosophy but you got me there.

What you seem to describe is a sort of pragmatic ideology on how to treat/view others that shifts based on the other's sensibilities. 

It seems like a really emotionally intelligent way of acting and thinking. I don't think is the best path for seeking truth or enlightenment of the mind. But for sure one to ease the soul and be kind to others. I like it and would like to learn more about it.

One problem I see but for sure it may come from my ignorance, is when others are overly-reactionary or sensitive and it's not your fault that they cannot hear any opinion other than their own (like in the trigger mechanism of a society we live in) then your compass can become faulty.  


That would be for external suffering, for internal suffering, something that JBP makes a lot of emphasis on is in facing your fears, slaying the dragon, and getting tougher and wiser by not only doing what's easy but what's necessary. It seems to run contrary to what you said (again coming from my total ignorance), maybe to find enlightenment and betterment you need to endure some pain. To grow is painful but necessary non less. Like puberty, it fucks you up but it is how you forge your character. If you avoid suffering you can avoid progress.  


Anyways it is really interesting to hear about these ideas that I know nothing of. Any book you could recommend ?",1643673746

As per student life, relatively difficult siya haha. This assessment majorly depends on the profs assigned to you. Pero remember na law school in itself is already reallllly difficult, made even more difficult by the pressure of making it to UP. This is especially if di lang law school ang inaatupag mo. You will really gain top-tier level admiration for working students. Ako, i'm not working but first two months in, I'd sleep at 3am and then wake up at 6 to do chores and then study again!(only to forget everything come recit time!  :&lt;&lt;) . I feel like it was my first two months in law school which really made me doubt if worth all the pain ba to hahaha. 

On average, I study 6 hours a day sa weekdays and then 8 hours sa weekends. But there are days when I don't study at all. Those are the days that kept me sane my whole first sem in UP. 

Class hours are relatively fair naman. Depende sa sched mo. But I got to say, kahit isa lang class mo for one day, walang chill day bc that class can assign 20 cases to be read hahaha so walang pahinga. One thing a prof inculcated in me during my first sem was: rest when you're dead.",1643673747

So does an empiricist believe in Dark Matter, or he basically is anti current mainstream science, like how our gravity works. Cause there isn't any evidence that dark matter exists, if it doesn't exist that means our laws of gravity are wrong.

&gt; The pregmatist doesn't need to prove it (or disprove it). He cares about the practical implications only.

And what are the practical implications of believing there aren't any God. I'm saying he can't prove it's practical to (not) believe in a God.

&gt; Nah. He, the guy in our example, believed that the no gods approach was the most practical. So he also believes that a belief in God's would be impractical.

Really amps up your melee attack, and if allowed booming blade on it is pretty huge.  As mentioned, if you can customize your origin to get 18 dex right away, that is big time. 16 int is a good start, and slightly less impt for a bladesinger than most wizards.  Getting con up is really helpful.  As mentioned the proficiencies being tweaked would be nice.  Getting your flavor how you want it is the most important, so if you don't care that you're a wizard without perception or arcana, but have acrobatics cause....bladesinger then do that for sure.  Another kinda cheeky option for your concentration is to have a familiar and dragons breath it.

"EstrangedAdultChild","t5_333pr","&amp;#x200B;

How old are you? 

Are you a minor child with whom he has Court-ordered contact or communications, or are you an independent adult?

If the money he is holding hostage is Child Support, then there are mechanisms to get it paid  -- garnishment, Court Order, sanctions against your father. None of them have anything to do with you or whether you're talking to your father.

If the money is owed because of something else -- a contract between your parents, or selling a joint asset -- then your mom has mechanisms to get it paid: lawyers, Court, all of it. None of that has anything to do with you either.

&gt;So now, I feel like the ball is in my court in terms of communicating with him. I am also incredibly anxious about the response I may receive

Just because someone has thrown you a porcupine...does not mean you're obliged to catch it. 

If you're a child who has NO CHOICE and must communicate with this man because of a Court Order, then please employ Grey Rock and be as bland, boring and neutral as you can.

If you're an adult who has would prefer not to contact him, then you are perfectly able to shut it down, as of NOW. Because OP, you're a helpful person but it's **not actually your job** to get him to fulfill his financial obligations to your mom...by sacrificing your peace of mind, knuckling down and writing him the letter that is demanded. They're both asking too much of you. You're allowed to nope out, honey.

Whatever you do, please tell your mom: ""*I'm done with this mess. Please don't talk to me about Dad anymore, I'm OUT of this loop for good.*"" Repeat, repeat, repeat.  

But if she insists on dragging you back into the swamp, including over-sharing about personal stuff like herpes and who cheated on whom, you might want to look up ENMESHMENT, PARENTIFICATION and COVERT NARCISSISM to evaluate her conduct. Personally, I wish I could un-know some of the stuff my narcissistic mother unloaded onto me, as a child, about my father...gkkk!

Similar to psychological warfare the military practices these protestors are using psychological terrorism to terrorize, intimidate, threaten, and inflict suffering on Ottawa residents.

Residents are unable to sleep or function normally due to constant horn blowing, threats, restricted free movement and intimidation on the street causing people to be unable to live, work, and for services to be rendered. 

The antivax protestors are selfish, and have never shown any personal responsibility or respect for their fellow man. This has gone from a protest to around the clock terrorizing of Ottawa residents and unlike other protests that have a goal and respect residents by limiting protest actions these people will not. 

They have no realistic end goal and have shown they have no sense self accountability. They will not end their protest until they are forced to be accountable for their actions which has never been the case.",1643673749

"teenagers","t5_2rjli","my cardio gets significantly better when I am doing something some would consider devious",1643673750
"Epilepsy","t5_2s1h9","Positives‚Ä¶ There are a lot of positives. I don‚Äôt drink much alcohol. Maybe one glass a year. A shot of whiskey in my tea as cough medicine. I don‚Äôt know if I would drink even without the epilepsy because alcoholism runs in my family. I mean no disrespect to all y‚Äôall in this sub who do drink, but there are some days I read posts here, and I just scream at my computer, ‚ÄúY‚Äôall! There are other things to drink besides alcohol!! You can have fun without going to a bar!‚Äù I have done it my entire life! I‚Äôve even managed to NOT be the DD at every event! It‚Äôs crazy, I know. When people ask if I‚Äôd like a glass of wine or beer at an event, I just simply say, ‚ÄúNo thank you, I don‚Äôt drink.‚Äù They usually don‚Äôt press the issue. If they do, I respond with, ‚ÄúThe medication I‚Äôm on has screwed up my liver. I can‚Äôt drink.‚Äù That usually drops it. Most people around me know about my epilepsy and understand. Those that don‚Äôt find out fast. It‚Äôs not a big deal. Really, I promise. If it is, walk away. They‚Äôre not worth your time.  
  
I do NOT live my life in fear. My parents never wrapped me in bubble wrap, and they never held me back from doing anything because of my seizures except for swimming. And even that was only a minor precaution: my mom couldn‚Äôt swim, so I wasn‚Äôt allowed in deep water until I was in high school and understood the risks better. I take reasonable precautions. I pay attention to my body. I talk to people around me so they know what to expect if something happens and surround myself with good people. My last TC was two years ago ‚Äì a week before Covid shut down our city. It gave me the worst concussion I ever had and reminded me I could die without warning just by taking a shower in the morning. It really helped put the whole Covid panic that was building into perspective. I continued to live my relatively introverted life, taking reasonable precautions.  
More positives ‚Äì I‚Äôm pretty good at managing stress. I didn‚Äôt realize how big a deal this was really until the last couple of years. I maintain a relatively healthy diet. It‚Äôs not perfect. But I try to be nutritionally aware of what I‚Äôm eating. I cook from scratch a lot. I am very in tune with my body, and I usually know when something is wrong/off.   
  
A weird perk, my epilepsy was actually one of the reasons we decided to homeschool our kiddo. (My seizures flared up about the time we were making the decision on a school. If I couldn‚Äôt reliably drive the 30 miles to the school \[we lived in the country\], then we couldn‚Äôt go to that school.) Turns out to be the best decision we ever made because the pandemic has affected kidlet so minimally the last two years. There are so many blessings we‚Äôve had because of the decision to homeschool, not just the last two crazy years. We live in a different state from most of our family, so we can vacation whenever and go see them. We‚Äôre not held to a school schedule. We can take field trips to museums and zoos and gardens and such in the middle of the week when it‚Äôs not busy instead of going on busy weekend days. It also means we can go when the weather is nice instead of having to cancel our plans because it suddenly decided to thunderstorm on the one day we had free. My husband and I have been able to help after local disasters because we haven‚Äôt been tied down to making sure she gets to school every day. She gets to see us helping in the community instead. Sometimes she helps, too.  
  
(Side note: I had the best friends when I was at school myself. My epilepsy was never a big deal. I‚Äôm still friends with many of them, and we were talking about it a few years ago. ‚ÄúIt was just a malai556 quirk,‚Äù they said. Like you have that one friend that laughs too loud, or wears black all the time, or wears the trench coat even though it‚Äôs 90F outside. I had seizures. NBD. My grown-up friends are the same way. They don‚Äôt care. Surround yourself with these people.)  
  
Sometimes epilepsy is an ice breaker. I‚Äôve made friends and opened doors by talking about it. I‚Äôve shattered perceptions and misconceptions by talking to and interacting with other people. It‚Äôs given me empathy for others. I don‚Äôt let it hold me back, and I don‚Äôt hide behind it. People see that. When I had to wear an ambulatory EEG all day once in high school, I cracked the jokes before other people could (I‚Äôm trying out to be a robot in a new movie!). It exuded a confidence that invited people to ask questions rather than mock me behind my back (or in front of me).   
  
Oh, I got to spend some quality time with my grandparents because of my epilepsy. My parents were divorced, my mom had to work, my dad‚Äôs parents were still my mom‚Äôs lifeline when she needed them. If I had a seizure, they would drop everything to take care of me. One time my grandma was busy, so my grandpa had to spend the day with me. He pulled out his globe and told me all about his time in the Pacific in WWII. He never talked about the war. I‚Äôm not sure he shared those stories with anyone else. His version of how he wooed my grandma is different than her story, too, and it made a lot of people laugh when I shared it at her memorial service a few years ago.  
  
And finally, I know not everyone will agree with me on this one, and that‚Äôs okay. I am deeply rooted in my faith. We recently had a Bible study on afflictions/trials. Why does God let them happen? Sometimes it‚Äôs so you can share your experiences with others and through that, bring someone else to faith. It was interesting timing because my husband and I had just been talking about it a few days before. Maybe the Lord gave me this epilepsy experience to live through so that when I‚Äôm old and living in a nursing home I can share my experience with my roommate or nurse or whomever, and through sharing my experiences, bring that one person to know the Lord‚Äôs saving grace. And that‚Äôs all that matters. If that‚Äôs what my job is, I am happy to do it. He has a plan for me, and whatever trials I need to live through, this is part of his plan. He does not guarantee us an easy life, but he does give us help through it. Prayer is a powerful thing. &lt;3",1643673750

I used them fully until I was 23. It has been a rollercoaster with good and bad. However, the antidepressants gave me a bit of a shield to protect me from the worst downs, while taking away some good too.

Since 2020 until summer 2021 I slowly reduced my dose, and for the last half year I havent used anything. 

After I stopped I have been much more emotional. I have cried, which I never did before, but I also laugh more and feel good over all.

Without antidepressants I don't know where my life would be. I would never be able to finish school ordinarily, like I have. I also wouldnt be able to develop like I have. The antidepressants have allowed me to develop techniques to deal with the difficult things in life. I have been able to deal with one thing at a time and improve myself in a much calmer fashion.

For some antidepressants are wrong, but to me they have been lifechanging.",1643673750

How is he an expert on their safety in any way if he hasn't worked on them in decades and these have passed clinical trials?

I can answer some of those questions:

His patents for mRNA consist of very early technology for mRNA in mice and getting mRNA into lipid technology that is not used in these vaccines. Although the work he did was certainly a precursor to what's used today. The inventor of the Model T at Ford would not be an expert on the safety of a Ford F-150 (not a perfect analogy, as Malone didn't make it to the point of a working vaccine by far, but gets the point across)

He stopped working on mRNA technology before the technology got close to a human being. He dropped out of his PhD program and he parted terms with those researchers on poor terms. He started working on DNA vaccines instead, but those efforts failed. He self reportedly has extreme personal animosity towards the scientists that continued on without him. 

The technology used in these vaccines is pretty far apart from what he worked on back in the day.

He is not an expert on the safety of these vaccines.

Overall, if he had substantive criticisms of the vaccines, his points would be interesting. But he mainly combines misinformation along with his credentials and background facts to try and sow distrust. And it all seems to be from bad personal relationships he had previously and a sense of entitlement to more respect that he's now getting from the alternative media.",1643673750

Not sure how it looks like for UK citizens now but for me as EU citizen living in the UK if I spend minimum of half of year here my taxes belong in the UK.

Or where your address is really (OP said he can have UK address regardless). Probably it's a question to tax/immigration advisor.

My suspicion is this way you possibly could spend a month or two in each country on tourist visa (or whatever they require now) and no one would bat an eyelid. I mean, what could they prove to you.

From delta to omicron, what a marathon  
Getting from last year to this  
Strap on your mask, get down to the task  
Let fresh treasure be your bliss

  
We open by laying the ground rules, and urge hunters to wear a mask. Fresh refers to the recent makeover at Silverwood Park.

  
Clue 2  
Get out of your bed if you want some hunt cred  
Don‚Äôt wait ‚Äòtil temps hit the 30s  
With the prize as your driver be a vigorous striver  
For success means a life of ease

  
‚ÄúCred, 30s (as ‚Äòthirties‚Äô), striver‚Äù are an anagram for Three Rivers District, which includes Silverwood Park.

  
Clue 3  
Far from the path that leads to a bath  
The treasure waits so alone  
Step out of the dark go to the park  
But avoid obstacles of cone  


  
Silverwood has a forest bathing trail. The puck is hidden in a parking lot.  


  
Clue 4  
An item hot is the current lot  
Of at-home tests for COVID  
Ours is nice, in block of ice  
Inside the medallion‚Äôs hid  


  
The prize this year is tucked into the box of an at-home COVID test, which we then froze in a chunk of ice.  


  
Clue 5  
When the buttons showed up, we screamed out ‚Äòwhat?!?‚Äô  
Still, we didn‚Äôt cancel the order  
So when we hid the puck, we pushed our luck  
And hid it so close to a border.  


  
A nod to this year‚Äôs registered button misprint ‚Äì the button appears undecided if it‚Äôs 2021 or 2022. Likewise, St. Anthony Village is actually in two counties ‚Äì Hennepin and Ramsey. Silverwood Park is in the smaller part of St. Anthony that‚Äôs included in Ramsey, which had us making sure we didn‚Äôt cross any borders when we hid the prize.  


  
Clue 6  
Ride this rhyme for a trip through time  
From stone circles to the flood  
From a raised elevation you‚Äôll make observation  
That all of us spring from the mud  


  
Among the sculptures in Silverwood Park is a time machine, stone circles, a memorial to the 1927 Mississippi River flood, a raised platform, and a sculpture that focuses us on the ‚Äúearly developmental state that all living creatures take before developing their own biological directions.‚Äù  


  
Clue 7  
Scale the heights, look for the brights  
Where nature inspires the arts  
Is it life eternal or heat infernal  
That strikes at your heart of hearts?  


  
Silverwood Park, near Columbia Heights and New Brighton, is known as a place where nature inspires the performing, fine and folk arts. One of the sculptures at the park is ‚ÄúEterne,‚Äù an archaic form of the word ‚Äúeternal,‚Äù and the visitors center is heated and cooled by geothermal energy.  


  
Clue 8  
If saving souls is among your goals  
Then this hunt is for you  
Bring your legions to these regions  
And stay a week or two  


  
Saving souls = salvation; legions = army; stay a week or two = camp. Silverwood Park is the site of a former Salvation Army Camp.  


  
Clue 9  
See how brave, bucked and raved  
the tempo of the hunter  
take a break for your sake  
and tear the words asunder  


  
Silverwood Park‚Äôs sculpture tour includes a giant ‚Äú5‚Äù at the south end of the visitor center parking lot. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúHigh Five,‚Äù and we‚Äôre riffing on it with an anagram (‚Äúbucked‚Äù and ‚Äúraved‚Äù) about jazz pianist Dave Brubeck, suggesting readers ‚Äútake a break‚Äù ‚Äì a nod to Brubeck‚Äôs well-known ‚ÄúTake Five.‚Äù Tempo is a nod to the speed or flow of notes in music, which could lead hunters to one of the park‚Äôs overflow parking lots.  


  
Clue 10 (not published)  
Don‚Äôt skip ahead, follow the thread  
You need to observe beginnings  
Every clue has a bit that‚Äôs true  
Rely on it to find winnings.  


  
For folks who have found Silverwood but not the lot, we‚Äôve started each line with a letter that spells out ‚ÄúDyer,‚Äù a reference to Dyer‚Äôs Hill at the park, which overlooks the hiding spot.  


  
Clue 11 (not published)  
The finder will plot and search a lot  
Avoiding where others go.  
Away from the trail, how can you fail  
Your riches will overflow.  


  
The medallion is hidden out in the open, under a few inches of snow, in the middle of one of the park‚Äôs overflow parking lots. So don‚Äôt get stuck in the woods or searching the usual stumps and grass patches that many do.  


  
Clue 12 (not published)  
Noodling good? You‚Äôre at Silverwood.  
What you seek is so near.  
At county‚Äôs edge, this is our pledge ‚Äî  
The prize is in the clear.  


  
If it‚Äôs night, turn on your light  
And head from car through woods  
Atop a rise you will surmise  
Benches overlook the goods.  


  
Down below, an expanse of snow  
Bisected by small trees.  
It‚Äôs out from those, 15 paces or so  
The treasure lies at your knees.  


  
It‚Äôs the final clue, so this one almost puts you on top of the prize. Again, we note the puck is out in the open, or ‚Äúin the clear,‚Äù and give directions to head from the main parking lot to the adjacent wooded hill. If you follow the well-worn foot trail through the snow, you‚Äôll end up at Dyer‚Äôs Hill, which is marked by several benches. Down below is an open patch of snow ‚Äì an overflow parking lot, closed in winter ‚Äì that is split in half by a line of trees. Out 15 paces to the north from one of the middle trees, the medallion sits beneath the snow",1643673751
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I learned about evolution around the same time I deconverted.  I think it helped. 

I usually recommend Jerry Coyne's Why Evolution is True because he doesn't do any religion or creationist bashing.   He just presents the facts.   I never recommend Dawkins to Christians.   It's available on audio book. 

Another book I like (also on audio book) is The Story of Earth by Robert Hazen.   It doesn't mention religion at all.  It is just a fascinating history of our planet from the formation of the solar system through today.   It adds a subtle counterpoint to ""God did it"".   My mom and sister‚Äê both mildly religious - enjoyed it a lot.  This is the book I would recommend the most because it does not go at religion head on. 

Good luck",1643673751

There‚Äôs now rumours of it being a straight loan with no option to buy, and there‚Äôs no way we could afford Ramsay‚Äôs wages at anything close to his current salary anyway.


But if he helps win us the league and get us the ¬£40m CL group stage money, it‚Äôs been money well spent.

No one is a ‚Äúrestriction enthusiast‚Äù. People just want to be safe, housed, have safe access to healthcare, and enough money to keep roofs over heads and food on the table.

Personally, I didn't find the c-section recovery to be bad at all.  Frankly, once I got home I found myself so busy I didn't even really notice any discomfort.  Your abs just don't work at first so I did get some backpain as those muscles needed to compensate.  I tried using a binding belt but it was uncomfortable sitting or laying down so I was constantly taking it on and off and that got annoying, so I just ditched it.

THE LEADERS

‚ÄúThe organisers listed on the GoFundMe page are Tamara Lich and BJ Dichter. 

The Canadian Anti-Hate Network reported that Lich was ‚Äúan organizer for Yellow Vests Canada, a regional coordinator for the separatist Western Exit or ‚ÄòWexit‚Äô movement in Alberta, and now as the secretary for the Maverick Party ‚Äì another separatist movement and fringe political party‚Äù.

Lich has posted ‚Äúconspiracies about the ‚ÄòMuslim Brotherhood‚Äô operating in Canada‚Äù, the network said, while it pointed out that Dichter also has made Islamophobic comments. In 2019, at a national convention for the far-right People‚Äôs Party of Canada (PPC), Dichter said, ‚ÄúDespite what our corporate media and political leaders want to admit, Islamist entryism and the adaptation of political Islam is rotting away at our society like syphilis.‚Äù 

Patrick King, listed as a contact for the North Alberta group participating in the convoy, has regularly espoused anti-Semitic views on social media. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs publicly distorted established facts about the Holocaust ‚Ä¶ then invoked the antisemitic conspiracy theory that the Jewish people are secretly in control of world governance, media, and finances‚Äù, the Canadian Anti-Hate Network said. 

King said last month, ‚ÄúThe only way that this is going to be solved is with bullets.‚Äù‚Äù

&gt; In 2018, Khuraman Abil, the former head of Bos Shelf&amp;#039;s administrative team, filed a case in a district court in southern Baku alleging that the company had withheld $214,000 of her salary and that she had been unfairly dismissed when she complained about corruption.

&gt; A spreadsheet of people&amp;#039;s salaries - which Abil said was accidentally sent to her while she was working for Bos Shelf and which contains data also found in the BP files - indicates that the company did indeed keep most of her paycheck.

&gt; After raising the problems in Bos Shelf with BP dozens of times over three years, Abil said she believed the British oil company knew what was going on.

For an office space or something similar, they usually only have potties when bathrooms are under construction, they'll usually opt for either daily cleanings or three times a week and often they usually use our higher quality potties, called special events. That cost more but have better ventilation and end up smelling better, or so I'm told, I'm nose blind, definitely helps with the work. A worker will clean on average about 100 potties in a day and those are often spaced out across our service area.

What the US did for Europe after WW2 is amazing. They poured in funds and turned a broken hellhole into the best place on Earth (contrast that with how USSR treated east Germany), under the condition that Europe decolonized much of the foreign lands they possessed. That's two massive good deeds in one. They even supplied food to Russia after the Soviet Union fell. Provided aid to its fallen enemy. And its current role as a hegemon keeps the world more stable. Wages a few wars to remain the sole big hegemon, in turn preventing more wars. For example, Iraq would've waged war on Quait, Saudi Arabia, and more, were it not for US intervention. And with the US unfortunately acting a bit isolationist for the past years and China gaining some power, the world's stability became threatened because the US's position as the sole superpower is being somewhat shaken.",1643673753

No, there is no ""but"". You don't understand. At all. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;but it‚Äôs a little unfair of her to expect me to do everything just because she is nursing and recovering.

She's getting up every two hours to nurse AND having issues with nursing. She is taking care of your son. Nourishing him with her body. She carried that baby for 9 months. You're back to work for two weeks and throwing a tantrum? Get over yourself. Help her pick up the house. Do the dishes, help her with her titties, stop complaining. Christ man.

All you need to do is look at the history of San Francisco‚Äôs ranked choice voting results and see that it just creates more problems. 

First off it is not as straight forward as stated. People have lived here for years, voted multiple times and still do not understand the proper way to vote for candidates. This leads to people gaining votes that individuals otherwise didn‚Äôt want them to go through. 

You end up with really shitty alliances as well. The battle for mayor was insane. London Breed had to essentially face two candidates who had joined forces with a platform to rank them 1/2 in order to beat London.

The notion that I could gaslight myself into paradise just as we gaslight ourselves into hell was definitely a profound  realization. 

But the best practice I think was to make a mental list of all the things you can control and all the things that you cannot control. One list will be very long and the other very short. The list of things you cannot control should be completely removed from the mind. All they have to offer is stress and anxiety.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt;It can be argued, indeed, that the significance of the Crimean slave trade as a whole has been severely under-estimated. It was not simply a precursor of the Atlantic trade; it provided a model and, in a number of cases, the expertise for it. Some of the Genoese slavers who were thrown out of Caffa by the Ottomans a few years after the fall of Byzantium reappeared as founders of the Atlantic trade towards the end of the fifteenth century. Moreover, Ottoman Istanbul, the largest city in all of Europe and western Asia by 1550, grew rapidly in part because one in five of its booming population was a Crimean slave. And the Cossacks of the Ukraine first organised themselves into large bands to protect against Tatar slave raids.

People tend to see a game with rpg elements that is online and slap mmo on it, but that‚Äôs not how it works.

DF: depressed friend
NF: normal friend
HF: horny friend
Me: well me

So we're in study hall just chatting and I hear DF and HF talk about having the nasty nast later. So I said 
Me:""DF don't you have a girlfriend?"" 
Df: ""yeah, and I wanna get laid""
Me: ""you really shouldn't cheat on her. It's not right.""

He than went on and on about how the only reason he lives here is cause of something that can't be mentioned. I tell him I understand but he still shouldn't cheat on his girlfriend and he should probably think about how she'd feel. He than got mad and said idk anything and started to invalidate my own depression. I'm pretty sure him an HF are doing it anyway. But I'm worried about his relationship and am scared he may be making a big mistake. I only said something cause I care about him. Hf and Nf stayed out of it. 
However HF did end up breaking up with her Bf in the morning and was trying to cope dispite knowing DF has a gf. My father says I shouldn't have gotten involved. 
NF says I meant well and says he sees both sides so he says no one is in the wrong. 
HF doesn't care I tried to step in saying I can speak my mind if I choose however it is his choice and I can't stop him.

I just don't want his girlfriend to break up with him. 
Was I the asshole for saying something? I just want DF to be happy. He's my friend. Do I apologize to make him feel better or do I just stay quiet and stand by what I said?

BTW I am 100% sure he isn't faking anything he says, and I'm sure he didn't intend to invalidate me.  It's like my dad. He doesn't intend to do it either but it happens and he apologizes.

"AMA","t5_2r4eo","Thank you so much for this thoughtful response.  And I really appreciate hearing from someone else who has some similar experiences to me and my fiancee.

1. We are only looking to adopt into a family that accepts us and loves us unconditionally.  That could look a lot of different ways, so I can't elaborate much more other than to say that I/we want parents to give our love to and, in particular, grandparents to give our children we very much plan on having.
2. The general search has only been going on for a year and most of it has been IRL situations where I have bonded with older mentors and teachers.  I would say the more articulated search has only just begun.  I'm not sure how to go about this search strategically.  I have a lot of love and loyalty to give but I want to make sure it's a good fit since I have already lost so much in life.
3. Siblings are a BIG BONUS but not a necessary element to the search.  

Please feel free to reach out to me if you ever need a sounding board.  Best of luck and much love.",1643673759

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have much, but the thing that I find helps me is to understand the difference of *tidy* vs *clean* 

My room is a disaster right now, like I have trails from my door to my bed and desk and the rest is clothing and miscellaneous items. When I eventually get the random and intense need to start cleaning my room (usually it‚Äôs right before an assignment is due, very inconvenient) I‚Äôll mostly ignore all the clothing and objects in my room and start with physical garbage. 

Clearing away trash first is the easiest way I can start a cleaning task, probably because I find it to be the most important but it‚Äôs also one single task. 

*Find garbage ‚Üí put in garbage bag. 
*Find empty cans/bottles ‚Üí put in separate garbage bag 
*Find cups/plates/bowls/mugs ‚Üí bring to kitchen

If at *least* the garbage is cleared, you feel a lot better and you might find it easier to keep going but if not, then you have peace of mind knowing the space isn‚Äôt *dirty*, it‚Äôs just messy. 

For example if I were to start with clothing, I‚Äôd have to start by making 8 different piles: 
* clean undergarments 
* clean pants
* clean shirts
* clean clothes that need to be hung
* clean sweaters
* dirty lights
* dirty darks
* dirty synthetics
And from there I‚Äôd start the laundry. Next I have to fold all the clean clothes and then sort them again by occasion (eg. shirts for hanging out vs going out vs shirts I can wear in public) and while I‚Äôm doing that I have to change the laundry and fold it. And by that point I still have too many misc items hanging around my dresser so I have to organize those so I can put my things away but the items fall under so many categories it stresses me out so I just move it to another pile and start putting clothes away and then I have to put my clothes-that-need-to-be-hung on hangers and then hang them up and fold my sweaters. And then to sort and find a place for all my misc items. And **then** I‚Äôd start clearing the garbage and mugs and cans. And when that‚Äôs all said and done I somehow still have things on my floor and under my bed and that would take a minimum of 36 hours. 

The reason I let it get to that point isn‚Äôt clear to me but I think the problem is that it‚Äôs really difficult to find an organizational strategy that works for me. Dressers and cubbies don‚Äôt work because I forget they exist. Hangers don‚Äôt work because I usually also forget to hang things back up. The same is possibly true for anyone who struggles with keeping things tidy. 

I have learned one thing though, the typical ways of organization doesn‚Äôt necessarily work for everyone. If you can clean something completely and it looks nice and tidy, but it‚Äôs back to being a mess shortly after, that way of organizing doesn‚Äôt work. 

I learned that you shouldn‚Äôt fight yourself, if you can‚Äôt stop from putting something somewhere then finding a place to put it somewhere else won‚Äôt work. I just haven‚Äôt found a system where I can keep a tidy room by throwing things on the floor yet lol",1643673759

"bayarea","t5_2qjyy","Reverse mortgages only cause problems if you withdraw more than 1% of your equity a year. Mines basically just a state run reverse mortgage that only goes to paying off property tax. Either way, both of these render prop 13 useless except for letting the rich get richer is such a perverted way that it incentivizes not building enough housing to reach affordable market rate housing. 

I'm not sure how this is in any way kicking the can down the road. We have a huge problem in CA where the entire housing system needs fast growing neighborhoods to keep tax revenue up, then the locals vote against new housing. This of course is going to cause shit roads and schools. This needs to be solved.

The current problem is not enough new housing + dwindling existing tax base = not enough revenue for roads and schools. Prop 13 makes it worse solving a problem that doesnt need to be solved. 

That all being said, anyone on either side will support addressing corruption and waste in spending. But hand waving ""cutting waste"" without actually proposing a solution, while at the same time turning down other solutions, is absolutely kicking the can down the road making future generations deal with this ever growing problem.",1643673759

Discussion in this subreddit should be rooted in science rather than ""cuz I sed"" or entertainment pieces. Always be wary of unsupported and poorly supported claims and especially those which are wrapped in any manner of hostility. You should provide peer reviewed sources to support your claims when debating and confine that debate to the science, not opinions of other people.

**Good** - it is grounded in science and includes citation of peer reviewed sources.  Debate is a civil and respectful exchange focusing on actual science and avoids commentary about others  

**Bad** - it utilizes generalizations, assumptions, infotainment sources, no sources, or complaints without specifics about agenda, bias, or funding. At best, these rise to an extremely weak basis for science based discussion. Also, off topic discussion  

**Ugly** - (removal or ban territory) it involves attacks / antagonism / hostility towards individuals or groups, downvote complaining, trolling, crusading, shaming, refutation of all science, or claims that all research / science is a conspiracy

I hear you bout tryna hold things down and being grateful and not airing out, but sometimes talking with the right people bout what's troubling, the rough patches or issues isn't ingratitude, it's working things out in ur life and trying to improve the condition or your circumstances. For me that's appreciating and giving dues and appreciation to ur life as it deserves. 

I personally thing spiritual journey/happiness is overcoming various obstacles, some religious and some not. Finding people, resilience, happiness and peace is spiritually important to our journeys. For me Spirituality isn't in a vaccum. It provides much of the framework but it directs you to find happiness/stability in ur life. That's an important anchor for long term spiritual wayfaring.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","That's my mom's superpower as well. Her parents grew up in Appalachia during the Great Depression so she was taught early on to buy good quality items on sale. She then passed that to me. 

It's the Prachett boot economics. You spend less money over time if you buy better quality things. And when I was still growing, a lot of those good quality clothes got donated to local charities so they *still* got a lot of use. 

She also taught me not to put my clothes in the dryer because they last far longer. I have basic shirts that are a decade old that are just now starting to look old. And those were from *Walmart*. 

My mom was also super involved with the school and I think she got some snarky comments, but what most people didn't realize was how much my parents donated to the school in time and money. My parents own a small construction company so both my elementary and middle schools were gifted changeable signs (I'm in my 30s, so well before led signs) because the schools desperately wanted something to communicate important dates, etc. I think the PTO raised the money for materials, but the labor was entirely donated (by my parents, we paid the employees, obviously). 

I'm back in my hometown....the signs are still there and in use....

It's like people miss the forest for the trees. You're clearly dedicated to your kids and their schools. It's just petty to snark at the hand that ""feeds"" you.",1643673760

I do actually feel best when I'm in the 'never going to happen' mindset strangely, I think its because I'm a control freak and the idea of having no control over when or if it happens is really difficult for me.

most of the people I know that have research jobs started unpaid then transitioned to paid. They all built a relationship with a professor that they had or found a lab online that they liked, then emailed the prof to ask if they need any help with their research. Because it‚Äôs a less formal process it‚Äôs not really on a timeline so any point in the first half of the semester would probably be fine. If they say yes, you will probably be volunteering for at least a semester, but if a paid position opens up for them or their colleague you might get first dibs on the job before they put it up on a job board.

"homeowners","t5_2r9c1","Oh, you‚Äôll like this one, then. We had a house (several states away) that we had intended to live in temporarily while we acclimated and got to know the area better before we bought our ‚Äúdream house‚Äù. It needed a lot of work and we hired our realtor‚Äôs team to do all the renovations; they did a nice job and we rented it out for a couple years while we prepared to move down there. Eventually we decided it was better to sell it and use the profits toward our down payment and we put it on the market.


It sold very quickly and we were looking forward to getting the word from our realtor that the closing was over and our check was in the mail. What happened instead was that our agent had gone by the house Friday night to check on things before the buyers walk-through on Saturday, and he discovered that the condensate discharge line (from the A/C in the *attic*!) had gotten clogged, and the water had overflowed the pan and run down the walls and under the floating laminate floor through the entire four-bedroom ranch (lent new meaning to the whole‚Äùfloating‚Äù thing). 


He shut everything off and then called the buyer‚Äôs agent to explain what happened; he told them that insurance would cover it and it would be fixed ASAP, but that they were within their rights to back out if that‚Äôs what they wanted. Fortunately, our buyer *loved* the house and had the leeway to wait a few weeks for it to get fixed, and eventually everything was repaired (and the A/C fixed!) and the sale went through and everyone lived happily ever after.

*Side note before resubmitting: if you have a recording of the actual song you can call the music recognition bot in our [Weekly Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/about/sticky?num=2) (this link might only work in a browser)

Please post with a title that fits one of these 3 options depending on your question:

**1. For identifying a song/artist/album** - please include at least one of these details in your title:

`Era | Genre/Style | Artist type or Artist name | Music video information | Source name | Language | Lyrics/Content`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source name:, Music video:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details *don't overload the title* - only include the most important/unique details, and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of descriptive titles:`

  - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
  - Ballad by a female singer, sounds like it's from the 80's
  - Music video where a guy is walking in the street towards the camera {=Bittersweet Symphony btw}
  - Upbeat Latin song
  - Meme video of a cat bobbing its head to a fast beat
  - Calm piano instrumental
  - Source name: [the name of a film/show/YouTuber/etc. Please don't put a url as the detail here]
  - Lyrics: [the lyrics you remember]
  - Content: Song was about people on a road trip

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

  - What's the background music in this video?
  - I forgot the name of this popular song

**2. For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

  - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
  - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

**3. For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

  - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist"" [replace the quoted text with the actual details]
  - Where can I buy/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by ""Artist""?

Thank you and good luck :)

I‚Äôm seeing on multiple sites that average utilities cost is about $150/month? That can‚Äôt be right surely?? We pay $850 for a 1100 sq ft. one bedroom currently and our utilities are about $300/month total including internet. 

Based on our current income we could afford about $1000/month in Austin but the goal would be for him to find a job that makes $50k yearly and for me to work part to full time somewhere that makes a minimum of $14/hr. At that point rent budget would be $1200-$1600/month. Where would be good areas to look in?

Any tips on temporary housing while job searching? Or tips on jobs to look at? He might have an in at a tech company in the area, and worked at Apple when he lived in Austin previously. 

What is a reasonable gas budget monthly for one person? I know it would depend on commute, but we don‚Äôt drive much know as we both live less than 10 mins from our jobs currently and it takes max 20 mins to get across town. I fill up my tank maybe once a month lol!

Steak and I do not get along, but I eat it and I pay for it; by choice. 

For lunches, what has worked for me rather well is processed food.  (Yeah, I know, I know) Apple sauce and yogurt are good.  Ensure is a good filler too.  I also do ok with breads, bananas etc.  Soft  foods...  Another good thing is a cream of chicken soup made by Campbell's.  Take that and put it over rice.  Just overcook the rice so it is a bit mushy and top it with the soup.

"HermanCainAward","t5_35e6ns","The bottom line is that they weren't wanted or loved by their parents (often because their church told them they had to get married if they had sex and had to have the baby because birth control or abortion was a sin) and so they're incapable of intimacy with others. They think all relationships are about domination, and they're angry that they're not powerful enough to be able to command sex slaves. That's the core of the incel mentality, and not even getting laid will cure it. (In fact, a lot of the people who helped create the ideology of places like TRP were bitter passive aggressive divorced guys or even, get this, married dudes like Paul Elam, or PUAs like Roosh V. Btw, both of them are pieces of shit, but Roosh is particularly, well . . . he's like Ted Cruz levels of contemptible.)

UKRAINE DOES NOT WANT RUSSIA TO MEDDLE INTO ITS AFFAIRS. Just fucking accept it. Build a wall if you dont like it but step away from Ukrainian land. Heck if Ukraine wants Ugandan troops and Philipine bases on their soil they can do that. They can lease half their land to Samoans if they like to.

&gt;CIG is currently planning two main options.  
&gt;  
&gt;1. Your home hangar at the space port and an apartment in the same city, that is permanent and you don't have to pay for (in lore its paid for by a trust/investments you cannot access).  
&gt;  
&gt;2) outposts/home steads, we can build a number of buildings but it looks like only landing pads and storage builds (may fit very small ships but aimed at storage or vehicles) There are a number of video's showing their prototypes off. We may get two types of building the pre-fab style we see at POI and one inspired by a certain water farm under twin suns. There reason videos are showing off the last type, I think the newest CIG one was from Citizen con were then showed it being used for raid to steal an alien artifact.Its not clear if our hangars will above ground or not giving the volume of hangars needed and their plans to physicalize them completely instead of virtualising them (CIG's short term plan) would mean they need to be in layers underground so unlikely to have a view. Building in space is a no according to Chris, however the last dev response I have seen appeared to soft this decision. There will be capturable stations you can repair. In addition to the pioneer building bases CIG has mentioned being able to buy prefabricated kits you have to ship and assemble on site to build some outpost structures. So in theory you can build inside a hopefully extent volcano assuming CIG does not make that a mission location (which will probably make it a no build zone), One of the issues maybe power, solar is the main option shown off currently, not something that really works with a hidden volcano base.From that CIG has said, we will be able to decorate our apartments and hangars, how much and that the options we have, are not clear at this stage, but we not at tier 0.1 of the plan yet. You can also rent hangars and apartments at other locations, I have seen mixed messages about being able to buy other hangar/apartments or if we can only have one purchased home.Personally having a some storage of to the side of the main hangar with an apartment above, preferable on a moon if asteroid bases are out, would be my preferred option as it cuts down on commuting and fuel costs, but we know how CIG feels about us having to travel. I suspect I will logging out using my space campervan sitting in my hangar instead of the apartment a lot.",1643673763

What you are asking is for One Piece to have adopted a model that wouldn't exist for many more years, i.e., One Piece anime to not start airing until the late 2000s or early 2010s. Since we're dealing in a hypothetical world where this happens, let's look at some of the outcomes: One Piece manga has a fraction of its audience because with few exceptions, a manga getting an anime sees an explosion in readership (just look at Demon Slayer for proof); Oda doesn't make anywhere near the amount of money because manga revenue pales in comparison to anime and merch revenue; Kumamoto prefecture takes a lot longer to get rebuilt following the devastating earthquakes that hit it because Oda doesn't have nearly the amount of money to donate to the reconstruction; the landscape of anime as a whole is irrevocably changed because the massive influence of One Piece is no longer there. The One Piece anime, while certainly flawed, has had such a big impact on this industry. You might not like it for whatever reason, but it will never go down as ""just another long shounen"". It has brought so much joy to so many people, and while you're certainly entitled to your opinion, I for one am incredibly happy it exists in the format that it does and not the way you want it.",1643673764

Su Fedez e Ferragni: posso anche credere che tu non li segua, ma nel nominare il loro intervento a proposito del referendum sulla Cannabis c'era un certo compiacimento, come a dire ""nel 2013 Fedez e Ferragni non c'erano, e la raccolta √® fallita; nel 2021 s√¨""; cosa vera, c'era gi√† il web, c'erano le reti sociali, la tv via web, e c'erano gli influencer... ma si occupavano d'altro. Il problema √® che un aiuto portato da questi due non √® una vittoria, se non per il traguardo delle firme raggiunto: √® una implicita sconfitta. Sottintende che non sarebbero arrivate nemmeno stavolta. Ed √® una ipoteca sulla riuscita del referendum stesso, perch√© √® relativamente facile convincere via web a mettere una firma digitale 500.000 persone, pi√π difficile portare met√† italiani ad un seggio fisico, gli influencer non sono onnipotenti. Per quanto tu lo ritenga un ideale centrale nel dibattito politico, il numero di quelli che eventualmente andranno a votarlo ti lascer√† molto deluso. Dico eventualmente, perch√© la Corte Costituzionale si deve ancora pronunciare sui quesiti ammissibili. 

E torniamo alla questione iniziale, che era quel commento

&gt;""Ho perfino specificato ""i referendum di cui si √® parlato in tempi recenti"", che chiunque pu√≤ capire intenda quelli su eutanasia e cannabis di cui, appunto, si √® parlato in tempi recenti, in cui si √® raccolto un numero spropositato di firme rispetto a quanto il tema sia stato discusso"".

Anche alla luce di quanto hai esplicitato in seguito, √® di un egocentrismo senza limiti: siccome te ne sei interessato personalmente, collaborando col comitato promotore, allora gli altri referendum, sia tutti quelli del passato, sia quelli di comitati diversi dal tuo e che si voteranno quest'anno, non esistono, ""Fuori di me non c'√® nulla"". L'idea che ad altri interessino di pi√π quelli sulla giustizia e perci√≤ non colgano il riferimento a Cannabis e a eutanasia non ti ha sfiorato.

Il tuo commento iniziava con una critica agli attuali politici, e in un articolo sulla vicenda dell'elezione del Presidente √® quasi un'ovviet√†, avrei voluto vedere il contrario. Ma se i politici fossero monotematici ed egocentrici come te, sarebbe molto, molto peggio.",1643673764

"Undertale","t5_2xdht","That's still just a list of excuses. Murdering innocent bystanders for your gain is immoral. That's it.

They don't even know if it's going to work. They base it on a prophecy. You can't just murder 6 kids based on ""..but this ancient text says this might be an option.""

The game doesn't even show us if it's possible because a.) Omega Flowey doesn't  break the barrier and b.) Hyperdeath Asriel breaks it with 6 human souls and all monster souls - not 7 human souls.

So at least Frisks murder would've been completely meaningless, because their soul wasn't even necessary.

Which means Asgore is just killing kids in the hopes that this is a solution. Also Toriel calls him out, that he's a fucking coward, because he could've saved his folk after the first kill. So if ""doing nothing means monsters die"", he apparently had no problems to wait for potentially hundreds of years hiding in his garden, while his people slowly died in the Underground.

Asgore had like a million options and at every point he kinda chose the worst one.

&gt;also what do you think would happen if a child that fell down a mountain started talking about this story that they met an entire population of MONSTERS and there were different biomes beneath a single mountain and that the MONSTERS are actually friendly, that's right. They go to the asylum.

Nah, you're overdramatic. That sounds like a shitty plot from like an 80s cartoon. This would be way to easy to prove to your parents. Frisk walks out with a goddamn phone and talks to them in the neutral endings. They have social media. Frisk probably has photos of them on their phone.

Regardless that an event like sealing all of the monsters is likely to be very well document by myriads of historians. If that happened anywhere in the last thousand to two thousand years, it's practically a given. Gerson is the oldest non-boss monster and a tortoise and if he as a monster has a similar life expectancy then that would be 150 years.

So.. it happened some when between 1850-1900. There would still be people alive whos grandparents probably told them that story first hand.",1643673764

What you've done is basically looking through a catalog, circling the items you want, filling out the order card, went to the post office, put a stamp on the order card and sent it away. What you've done afterwards is taken an eraser and removed the circles you put in the catalog. Will that in any way change the order in the mail? No, it won't.

You can have characters that live to fight worthy enemies and characters that want to use their powers effectively both physically and philosophically. Either way, what gives characters depth is having good reasons for being either. And what gives stories depth is questioning why and how characters could become that way, and answering it well.

For example, Cradle, is mostly a ""numbers go up, fight more powerful enemies"" kind of story. But the moments where Lindon questions his purpose, when they use their power to affect big changes instead of just defeating enemies, where they show how the social structure of Cradle got there and is maintained? Those moments elevate the story from good to great.",1643673765

There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.",1643673765

"TinyHouses","t5_2rab5","Here's my overly harsh business plan critique. The web site seems like a startup style pile of dreams. They're collecting deposits inorder to get enough money to actually build a prototype.

1)spherical issues.  squares are boring but they are very space efficient. 

1.1 if you have rectangular furniture which 99% of furniture is you end up losing space trying to pack squares in circles.  

1.2 like wise most lots are rectangular so theres going to be wasted space especially in denser cities.   Are they aiming toward SFH? condos?  town homes?  condos and town homes seem particularly difficult to squish into the spherical hole so that seems to only leave most extremely low density places.

1.3 This is really going to fuck you when you try to build a kitchen with cheap off the self cabinets.  same with vanities in bathrooms and standard bath/shower things.

1.4 building straight walls is easy curved ones are much harder.  while the exterior walls are prefabed the interior ones are not.

2 they don't have any example floor plans and build costs.  makes it difficult to compare to traditional homes. 

3  The whole website tends to blend together many vvveerrryyy different types of innovation. which makes me wonder if they're actually innovating or if they're just throwing buz words around.  For example building domes and bioceramics. ""Now we have a fifth family. Chemically Bonded Ceramics (bioceramics) are a new class of geopolymers that enable cascades of innovation in construction.""  Theres no reason why this couldn't be used in traditional home construction.  so why build a company thats dependent on bioceramicsc working out.

4 they may be optimizing the wrong thing. ""Once the site work (foundation/sewer/water/power) is complete, a bioceramic studio dome can be installed and finished in 2-6 days.""  foundation/sewer/water/power/kitchen/bath is 90% of the time and cost of building a new home.  An off the shelf construction crew can throw up the frame of a house in a couple days.

6) they don't mention permitting and this is likely going to prevent these from being built in a large number of counties and cities.  Unless you're in the middle of nowhere jumping through this hoop is going to be painful.

7) comparables - i think this startups problems start to beome most apparent when compared to a typical new home construction for example compare a basic cheap 3br 2ba home ([https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1609-Lahoma-Dr-Pryor-OK-74361/86063562\_zpid/](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1609-Lahoma-Dr-Pryor-OK-74361/86063562_zpid/) ) with there family dome.  the family dome is missing. kitchens, bathrooms, living rooms, bed rooms, etc.

8) financing and time - Most home are so expensive that there's no way a normal person could ever afford to buy a home outright.  This means that this place needs to be finance able which means that the place needs to be appraised at a high value.  and looking at this website i do not see how this is going to get appraised for very much.  There's a whole host of issues wrapped up here.  What developer would choose this dome over a traditional stick house? I don't have a good answer for that atm.

summary:  Housing construction is a hard place to innovate in its already a very competitive and also very regulated industry.",1643673766

"footballstrategy","t5_2ubiw","It's not compatible with modern run schemes, and when teams do want to go split-back for passing purposes, the QB is usually in the shotgun too (so shotgun with two backs on each side is the modern version of split-backs).

It's not compatible with the modern run game, because of how developed the power scheme and zone running schemes are.  The zone-run systems and the way teams run power now require your ball carrier to be farther back from the line of scrimmage; at least 6-7 yards deep.  This is so the ball carrier can read the blocks as they set up and they can make a decision on where to take the ball.

Older running systems had very fixed hole-numbering play calls, meaning a run play had to go through a specific hole/gap, or just one gap over.  Modern run-games in the NFL has done away with much of the necessity of designated holes and focus more on an aiming point, then reading where to take the ball across a range of holes or gaps.  The deeper set back helps make this system easier, which doesn't compute with the split-back formation from under center.",1643673766

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","I experienced this too, and what I wish I could tell my slightly younger self is that it's okay to slow down, take breaks, or re-evaluate a therapist if that's necessary.

As important as talking about it can be, personally I think what's even more important is having your therapist help you with feeling somewhat safe in your body. Knowing how to self soothe, instead of just using unheatlhy coping mechanisms. If you're thrown into the deep end with no idea how to support yourself through this time, you're just ruminating and floating through life and not doing particularly kind things for yourself. I just don't know how that is helpful, how that creates a safe space to process anything. Just venting about traumatic events very quickly feels like retraumatization to me.

I don't know if this is the case for you, but when I started ruminating non stop I just piled on more therapy in the hopes that it would help. In hindsight, that was me being in flight mode, panicked, unable to stop. It didn't end well, it was retraumatizing, and that was so unnecessary. I don't know if your situation was like mine or if I'm just projecting, but just know that taking a break absolutely never hurts. If you feel like you can't stop, in my experience, that's a sign you absolutely need to.

And definitely discuss this in therapy, if you haven't already. Figuring out healthier coping mechanisms or ways to self soothe is not something you should have to do on your own. That's exactly the kind of thing they're supposed to help you with.

I'll just share some stuff that helped me: breathing exercises, affirmations, reading the emotional flashback steps again and again, diving into books(preferably page turners), going to an art studio and therapeutically and without any pressure expressing myself, playing guitar and singing, long walks. And since you wrote you're on your phone a lot, I do the same thing ‚Äì and I replaced that with doing puzzles while listening to a podcast, and I spend hours watching familiar movies and shows while embroidering at the same time, and sometimes I listen to an audiobook while I make drawings based on the story. Maybe that's all very personal, I don't really know, but know that there are other, healthier, kinder ways to engage your brain, to disappear into something, that give you a break from processing and ruminating. Because I think often, that's all we crave. Just some room to breathe. I found everything that works for me by just trying out everything I heard and read about ‚Äì that process never stops for me, and it can be exhausting, but it's so worth it.",1643673767

Good thing I didn't accuse you of anything. I said if x then y.

&gt;Why do you think I'm an atheist?

 want an honest answer? Because you're either ignorant of what the Bible says or self deluded. 

&gt;FYI, if I advocated for Communism, that's one thing but if I asked permission to kill your kids, I'm sure you wouldn't say 'allowing doesn't mean condoning'. That's what God allows.

Yes, it does and can. I'm sorry, where are your arguments? You acknowledge that allowing x doesn't inherently imply condoning it... yet you want to make some no true scott fallacy for job's plight?  Cmon. 

&gt;And he NEVER tells Job what's going on. In reality, Job would have spent the rest of his days paranoid about when this oh-so-loving God was going to curse him again. But no, he's a good little slave and just accepts whatever.

""A LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS 
OF THE EFFECTS OF LOCKDOWNS ON 
COVID-19 MORTALITY""

""Conclusions
Overall, our meta-analysis fails to confirm that lockdowns have had a large, significant effect on 
mortality rates. Studies examining the relationship between lockdown strictness (based on the 
OxCGRT stringency index) find that the average lockdown in Europe and the United States only 
reduced COVID-19 mortality by 0.2% compared to a COVID-19 policy based solely on 
recommendations. Shelter-in-place orders (SIPOs) were also ineffective. They only reduced 
COVID-19 mortality by 2.9%.""",1643673768

There is pretty good evidence that heavy marijuana use in teens and young adults can precipitate a psychotic episode as well as push someone who would have a mild psychotic disorder towards having a much worse psychotic disorder (Gage SH, Hickman M, Zammit S. Association Between Cannabis and Psychosis: Epidemiologic Evidence. Biol Psychiatry. 2016 ). Additionally, there is recent evidence that marijuana use during pregnancy leads to behavioral deficits in children (Corsi et al., Maternal cannabis use in pregnancy and child neurodevelopment outcomes, Nat. Medicine, 2020; Rompala et al. Maternal cannabis use is associated with suppression of immune gene networks in placenta and increased anxiety phenotypes in offspring. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2021 ). Alcohol certainly kills more people every year than marijuana, but marijuana is not without is own downsides.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","What do any of those teachings have to do with the Bible?  The Bible still doesn't teach that using contraception is a sin.  It doesn't demand that people be ""open to life"" every time they have sex with their spouse or that they should keep getting pregnant a bunch of times.  It only says that children are a blessing and a heritage of the Lord and to ""be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it"".",1643673768
"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","There are many gods in my universe, but only nine of them ""descended"" into the material world. It isn't a religion of faith, really‚Äîthe gods actively participate in society and govern mankind as the absolute rulers, so it isn't a matter of belief or lack thereof, but a matter of obedience.  


These nine gods share a purpose: to keep humanity (and the fey, sort of) in check. Mortals like to think the gods care for them, but deep down they know their love is only an illusion. Thing is, the whole world they live in is an illusionary world created by one of the gods, and this is a known fact, so most people have accepted that there is no distinction between illusion and reality, and therefore they hold the same value.
(Of course, the people who try to discover ""reality"" are met with divine retribution).  


The gods each have their own personalities, ideals, and beliefs. Some are more forgiving than others. None are inherently kind or evil. Morality is subjective, and the gods do have different perspectives on what is ""good"". Regardless, they feel resentment towards humanity, and that resentment is somewhat justified.  


They actually play as side characters in my story, often interacting with the main characters, who are humans. As the story goes, the main characters eventually understand why the gods are this way. One of those gods is actually the main character in a prequel.  


I like human-like gods, but I also like gods so large they cannot be comprehended. These gods are a mix of that!",1643673768

"Unexpected","t5_2w67q","I grew very early as a child. By the time I was probably 11, I was nearly 6 feet tall, and a lot of people assumed that I was in my mid/late teens. Then, I leveled off and tended to actually look younger than my age once I actually became an adult.

The point that can be made is that sometimes you literally can't tell the difference between a 16/17 year old and someone in their 20s (this applies to all sorts of age ranges, but is only really ever a legal issue for teenagers). I can 100% guarantee that at some point in your life you've been attracted to someone under the age of 18. You just didn't know they were that young. It's totally illogical to shame someone for being attracted to someone who looks like an adult; we simply can't say, ""excuse me, may I see your ID so I can determine if it's okay to be attracted to you?"" That's absurd.

***What we can control*** is how we behave once we know someone's age.  Don't be a creep, don't talk about the minor in a sexual way, and ***certainly*** don't make advances on them. In most cases, just acting like a normal, non-creeper will have you covered, especially because adults tend not to not be in close social settings with minors in first place, but this is something everyone should keep in mind.",1643673770

I'm going to guess you are young and your experience is from the last 10 - 15 years.

Since 1971 (The year the gold backed dollar was ended) the US has had an average inflation rate of 3.86%. That 3.86% includes the recent very tame inflation numbers.

Since crimson vow, the site has evolved a lot:

* You can now click on cards to see how well they're doing in different color pairs
* Rarity and card type filters have been added
* You can turn dark mode on or off

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

My daughter's boyfriend has told me that he ""loves"" her even though he really doesn't have his life together right now. I'm not a huge fan of the fact he doesn't have his life together, but what I also pointed out to him is that he doesn't understand infatuation versus love. They've only been together for like not even 4 weeks!

Infatuation is like when you notice someone is moderately hot and want to date them because of looks, and love is being committed to them and sacrificing for them and staying with them for the long haul even though it's not always great.

I told him that he doesn't understand the difference and that they are at best infatuated with each other. I don't think they love each other yet, and if they do, he hasn't shown any steps towards being committed for the long haul, such as like getting a job or going back to school for further education, as he has not earned a college degree yet. 

I told my child this too when she said that she hadn't thought about what sacrifices would be needed to stay together with him and she got annoyed with me.

As to culture, Russians did a lot to eradicate them as well to the point Belarusian language is almost extinct. And also, there were lots of direct murders in soviet union, especially in those political repressions. Secondly, sterilisation was used against Jews and Gypsies, no other group. And lastly, lots of people in soviet union lived in literal slavery until Kruschev. People that worked in collective farms didn't get payed for work, couldn't refuse to work and had no other option of employment in the countryside. And to leave their village they had to have a passport, but weren't allowed to get one in the village. Then Kruschev reformed this system of slave labour by lifting the restriction on getting documents and setting minimal pay for work in collective farms.",1643673772

I have about 4 bulbs and one of them I placed in perlite mixed with spaghnum moss. I wet the moss and perlite with rooting hormone and nutrients, then placed in a large ziploc bag sealed and placed it on my heat mat. It grew one new baby leaf out from the side of the bulb and new growth is coming out from the middle.

It didn‚Äôt help that it tried squeezing in the entire manga into 10, 25min episodes, so most characters were almost caricatures.

The themes were interesting but poorly executed as the series was too reliant on shock value to get its naive message across. The ending also made me roll my eyes, with the villain winning but realizing he was a dick the whole time. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Earning income is a personal incentive/requirement to working. Earning money to support your household is a personal responsibility. 

Being promoted isn't a responsibility. It's perhaps something that some people strive for in order to earn more money, but the business doesn't really care if you're promoted or not.

Making friends at work also isn't really a responsibility. It's something you can choose to do to have a more enjoyable work day. Perhaps the employer might consider it a minor responsibility as it helps teams work well together, but it's certainly not the primary reason the employer employs you.",1643673774

Maybe less CGI in general, IMO most of the CGI outside of Infinity War, Endgame, and Eternals looks *awful* (Infinity War and Endgame still have some incredibly ugly moments).

I think I'd go as far as saying the MCU needs a new ""look"". Even Moon Knight still has that ""look"".",1643673775

There is also ag workers/famers who need trucks for these reasons.  So mass transit would not work for lots of working class people.

We don't need the exact numbers to know that BHVR's priorities are arbitrary.  In the above example, we know Twins has the lowest pick rate by a pretty big margin, and they still decided to make them even more annoying to play.

The musician started singing an energetic song after the slow dance, people got into the stage and i saw too girls around my age
 (17/18 ish maybe?) holding hands and getting into the crowd and oh my god, they're gorgeous, the way they were looking at each other it was so CUTEE, they were laughing and gracefully dancing together the whole time and it was like the crowd and the people sitting and clapping from afar disappeared to them, it was only them. Fascinating like a movie scene. After i was passing the door i just couldn't get my eyes off them. My brother and mom was talking about something else and i was still under the influence

I would agree with the last statements: it's "" important to have diversity across schools to allow parents to send their child to a school that ""aligns with their beliefs and values"" and maybe we can now have a discussion as to whether discrimination based on these characteristics (including the ""wrong"" characteristics of being male, white, christian, etc) is a good thing.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I worked at FDOT about 20 years ago and in the four years I worked our bridge inspection office went from something like 8 inspectors to 2 and a supervisor that never left the office.  This was for an area over 5000 square miles and over 700 bridges.  

Even then like 50% were deficient to severely deficient and should be closed.  One of the inspectors told me that they were told to NOT be accurate in their results if it meant the budget would be diverted from other projects to fix deficiencies.  That came from Gov Bush's Transportation Secretary. Oh and they boasted about how great our infrastructure was. One of the inspectors tried to sue since his signature was on them but I'm not sure what happened as he left.

By the time I left that number rose to nearly 60%.  

They literally gave me a list of bridges to avoid",1643673776

Mashed potatoes and spaghettios saved me on those last 30 miles. Remember if you feel like absolute garbage and you‚Äôre puking your guts out, things will get better, just keep going.  Get in and out of aid stations quickly- if you don‚Äôt know what you want, keep going. Trust your training, and know that it‚Äôs enough. Recovery is important. Don‚Äôt give yourself an out during the race. Know that you‚Äôre going to finish and any suffering will be worth it once you cross the finish line.

Also I believe there's a huge difference between those who were hesitant to get the original two doses, and those hesitating to get the third or fourth.

I also would like to know why being critical of covid misinformation, something which brings quantifiable harm to those who are affected by it, is political. If you want to attribute spreading misinformation to a specific party, that's your prerogative. I was under the impression Rogan was some kind of centrist.

https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/

Given that there is evidence, and support from people who are assuredly more qualified than an artist/their supporters, I don't understand why Rogan's right to spread misinformation is somehow more acceptable than people's right to freedom of association. 

If I'm supposed to believe that people are doing the wrong thing in choosing to cancel their subscriptions (which otherwise the implication would be forcing them to stay) and in telling other people the reason why (the alternative being silencing criticism of medical misinformation), what is the acceptable course of action in response to something that they disagree with?

Which I wasn't against but it was going to be a difficult situation cause I'd have to stay with someone else for 3 weeks while my only toilet and shower was out. Plus his spitball quote was $15k. Came back with a $20k quote not really broken down at all. 

I kinda trust the guy, I'm sure he would have done good work but there's no point in putting that much money into my cheap house. I ended up with a bath fitter instead for a quarter the price. My parents had it done at their first house and it looked good 20 years later so I trust the product.

It had soggy suspension and needed new tyres so that was a few grand for Bilsteins and Hankook RSV4s.

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

And when you start running out of points in your pools, you fall down the damage track, which negatively affects you until you move back up by healing your pools.

The system is also incredibly flexible and modular and can handle most genres.

Not anymore though. Various states have passed so many laws over the past few years that are going to be coming up before SCOTUS soon, and the option of abortion is in jeopardy for so many women in this country. Unfortunately, my own state is one of those that passed a ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù bill several years ago that was ultimately ruled unconstitutional, but as soon as they come up before this current iteration of the Supreme Court, all of those bills will become law.

Why I put deserve in quotation is because, in common vernacular, when somebody says that it wasn't deserved the implications is somebody else caused it, like they shot him.

"Masks4All","t5_2j4zt8","It sounds like unless you have an exceptionally small or large face, you should order medium. 

I wish 3M provided specific instructions specifying what to measure on your face and explaining how to use that information in order to pick the proper mask. 

I copied the information below from one of TreatToke's links:  

Medium 3M 6800 Medium Full Face Mask  
3M 6800 Medium Respirator (Grey)  
3M 6800 Medium Mask  
80% of users  
The 3M 6800 Medium respirator fits 80% of the population, and I would argue that most individuals that fit the large respirator, can also fit this respirator. The dimensions of this mask from top to bottom are 7.5 inches with an opening of 5-1/2 inches. From side to side, the width of the opening is roughly 5.5 inches, with the opening being about 4-1/4 inches. In our office here at Enviro Safety, everyone ""fits"" the medium size mask, with one individual leaning towards the Large mask. None of our staff fit the small respirator.  
   
Large 3M 6900 Large Full Face Mask  
3M 6900 Large Respirator (Dark Grey)  
3M 6900 Large Mask  
15% of users  
The 3M 6900 Large Full face respirator here is distinguished by the dark grey rubber face seal. The mask openings top to bottom are 7-3/4 inches with an open space of 5-3/4 inches making the mask slightly larger in opening. From side to side the measurements are 5.5 inches with an opening of 4-1/2 inches. When held side to side, the large mask spreads open slightly more, but the differences are subtle. Not like the size differential you see with the small sized mask.  
   
Small 3M 6700 Small Full Face Mask  
3M 6700 Small Respirator (Light Grey)  
3M 6700 Small Mask  
5% of users  
The 3M 6700 Small Full face respirator here is distinguished by the light grey rubber face seal. The small version of the mask is suitable for individuals of very small head/face size.",1643673781

"ottawa","t5_2qpoo","Oh it‚Äôs you, the counter-protest guy. I‚Äôm getting a little tired of hearing your boot-licking cowardice over the sound of trucker‚Äôs horns. 
It‚Äôs not a brigade, it‚Äôs people seeing the ineffectiveness/complicity of law enforcement and wanting to have a conversation.

Edit: Hi, I just want to clarify **I am not with the protestors.** I‚Äôm the guy who went to the protest yesterday to make sure Terry Fox was okay. I just think u/Obi_Wan_Shinobi is trying to shut down the very discussion of counter protest over multiple comments and I think it‚Äôs really cowardly. Like‚Ä¶ maybe we should at least talk about it? What it would look like? How we might go about it? 
Personally, I see a counter-protest as taking form by protesting the polices inaction. Can anybody seriously find an issue with protesting police inaction during this occupation? Anyways.",1643673783
