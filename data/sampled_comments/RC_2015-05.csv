For starters, the interior. Heated leather automatic electronic cooled touch screen activated everything, most guys don't want to do a crazy overhaul on their interior and if you have money to burn (this is a hypothetical dream build after all) why not get the one with the fanciest interior?

Then there's the fact that the Rubicon trim level comes with a bunch of required off road kit. Lockers, heavy duty axles, and an electronic disconnecting sway bar to name a few... these are all features that any self respecting modern off roader would have. So, you could buy a Sahara or well equipped Sport for like $35K then spend 20 grand (or better) on axle swaps, gear swaps, skid plates, locking differentials, etc, voiding warranty, or you could just buy a stock Rubicon for $45K that comes with all that gear from the factory. In the long run it's just cheaper to buy the Rubicon if you plan on doing a serious build.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Because we aren't responsible for the actions of our forebears?

We should help these people not because of some race karma but because of love for your common man. 

And we've tried. We give them advantages by giving them things like affirmative action, diversity quotas and scholarships that white people (even ones as poor or poorer) don't get. They don't want change. 

The black community has lashed out against a problem for which even they don't have a solution. 

What do they want from us? To abolish police and law? To remove punishments for black crime and release black criminals? To force white people to not leave a neighborhood when black people start moving in (and as a measurable consequence, an increase in crime)? 

The cause of their problems lie in two places: 

The actions of a misguided ""community"" in which individuals use race as an excuse to commit more crime

And individual prejudice inside of every day people who collectively make life harder for them. 

The former of the the two possibly being a consequence of the latter but I digress. The second one won't be fixed with violent riots and crime. It only makes more racists. And the only way you could forcibly change that would be with an Orwellian Thought Police system which is immoral on the deepest level. 

How do you change the mind of the individual? I'm not completely sure. Nobody really is. If black rioters/criminals started taking responsibility for their actions, made an effort to improve relations with the common man and stopped glorifying thuggish and criminal activity, white people would take notice and shift even further from their subconscious racist tendencies. 

Because when something is so baked in to your consciousness, being a person isn't enough to earn a chance to not be hated, you need to give people a reason to not be racist towards you. (and I'm not saying this is how it should be, it's just how it is) ","1430438401"

Oh well, I guess it was good throughout the season. 7... or maybe an 8"" but then you go back and think about it a little ""Hmm why did I give it a 7 again? Yeah I liked the char... wait I didn't like the characters, they were all douchebags. There must have been one... Aoyama? And fuck the whole thing was frustrating. Fuck! Why did I like it again? ... I can't come up with anything. Now that I remember it was a terrible show, fuck! It's not even a 6, the whole thing was so shitty... more like a 4!""

I wouldn't count that as overanalysing. It's just that when the art and the characters are pretty you can forget and forgive a show for many things without realizing. Once this guy remembered the show was bad and there weren't more episodes or cute art to keep him distracted he gave it a more honest personal score.

Once awake, wide awake.  But I know to wait and eventually fall asleep again or my sleep schedule is even further off.  Since I got more sleep, I can stay up a long time the next day.  And then on the weekends I'm ending up staying in bed, dozing or sleeping until the afternoon or evening.   

Memory consolidation I still wonder about.  Am I not remembering as much if I sleep less?  Is my brain processing everything faster than normal, and it just doesn't need any extra time?

I'm sure satirical political programming exists in other countries, but we've mastered the genre.  Plus its like sports-- we can banter about how bad our team's draft picks were and how congress/the president/the democrats/the republicans are taking us to hell in a hand basket over a few beers.

because when I read about some of the political sleaze that goes on in other countries that I never hear about, I'm fascinated and amazed.","1430438404"

Original Post:

**Boss required me to sign a document waiving my right take a lunch/breaks. Help /r/legaladvice!**

&gt; I work in the food service industry in Seattle, and have been with my current company for about 5 years. Back in December, every member of our customer service staff (it's a small corporate chain, less than 200 employees) was required to sign [this document](http://imgur.com/iwa6IEQ), or else have all of our shifts cut to 4 hours each in length or less.  I work for minimum wage, and have never been offered or granted a raise by this company when I've asked.  I'm not passionate about my currently line of work, but my personal sense of justice feels violated to the point of needing to put my foot down.
&gt; 
&gt; I know what you're thinking: ""Get a new job!"" And yes, I'm in the process of looking for another job using other skills. A few of my coworkers are like family to me.  While I might be able to leave the situation, they aren't as fortunate, and that frustration bugs me to no end. The management at this company has stepped over the line of reason, and I'm not sure what legal recourse to utilize, or where to start.
&gt; 
&gt; -I know that their encouraging me to sign this document is illegal.
&gt; -I also know that I would lose my job if my employer read this post (as such, I've removed the header from the document)

&gt;The trans person will look way more out of place under the current system. It's shown pretty universally that allowing trans people to use facilities necessary for them to live as their gender generally leads to an increase in quality of life.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was a youngster until I was I was in my teens, I had the same recurring figure. Not the same dream, always ended differently with different events but always started with the same figure. Let me paint the picture here first. My bedroom window looked out on to a culdersac at the top of a very steep hill. It was lit by one street lamp. If you looked out into it at night, culdersac would be lit but it's entry would plunge off into oblivion. So from my window every night, I could see what looked like (to me) the poster from The Exorcist.

Now, the dream would always start the same. I'd be sleeping, and wake up to the faint incoming tune from beyond the hill. I would hear this tune grow as the figure of my nightmares would make it's way, lumbering up the hill. The tune was some sort of low double bass Looney Tunes or Tom &amp; Jerry number I can never find the name of. The figure? Sweetums from The Muppets. He would dance/lumber up into the light of the culdersac and I would immediately try to hide under the covers or bed or in the closet, nothing ever worked. I'd always hear him coming into the house and then down the hallway, into my room where he would proceed to violently fling me against shit until I was broken and laid their bleeding before finally putting me out of my misery and crushing my head. Often either with his foot, something nearby or by just biting down.

Over the years the dream varied as I learned to run and hide and escape into different areas of the house but everything always ended the same. One of the most messed up scenarios once was when he had two dogs, big white wolves actually. He sicked them on me and that went just swimmingly. Another time he possessed my family and turned them all into red eyed catatonics who if I approached them they'd open their mouths wide as a snakes and reveal their teeth and tongue (looked like the mouth of a freaking deep sea angler fish), horrifying.

The last time I dreamed about Sweetums though was the most interesting...

The dream started the same way it always did. The impending music, Sweetums lumbering into the light of the culdersac, but this time I didn't hide. I didn't even leave my room. In fact I just sat there, waiting, watching the door for Sweetums. And as the music got to it's usual loud state with his proximity he stopped in the door way and just stared at me. Me at him and him back at me. For the first time ever he spoke, in my Dad's voice... ""Well done. I'm proud of you."" Then he walked away.

I've never seen him since... 7 years of recurring nightmares at it ends with that.","1430438409"

Maybe this is semantics, but I think such a strong distinction is unnecessary. GR subsumes and includes everything SR contains and makes no distinction where a connection comes from, the formalism is identical. Curvature is curvature in the math even if it is sourced by proper acceleration. The concept of *generalized* relativity which includes all aspects of relativity is a perspective I've heard from other physicists many times.

For example, a frame with constant acceleration the curvature induces a nonzero vacuum expectation value and you get thermal radiation. All of this occurs on what is otherwise a true flat background and is intimately related to Hawking Radiation.","1430438412"

I'm happy with the AppRadio, but I was coming from a factory radio with no Bluetooth or any other features.


I think it's too early to tell if the glitches are Pioneer/Alpine issues or if it's on Apple's end. I have little respect for the software development skills of either Pioneer or Alpine, so I'm inclined to point the finger at them. Once OEMs start installing Carplay we should have a better idea.


Speaking of OEMs, once we see Carplay in factory systems I think Carplay will start to offer more apps and features. I don't know how Carplay apps are added to existing apps or are vetted by the App store, but they're being added at a snail's pace. Based on the lack of Carplay units on the road, it's hard to blame app developers for not making their apps Carplay compatible.


Unless you have a need (I need Bluetooth for hands free), I would suggest holding off for a few months to see how this plays out.","1430438415"

"GoTRPcommunity","t5_31ijt","Hello guys, I would like to establish the Kingdom of Sarnor on the rp at some point (whenever I get a free character slot), but it was recently on my mind and I thought it might be good to iron out some details before that happens. So, time for the history mumbo jumbo.

We assume that the Doom of Valyria occurred around 105 BC and directly after that commenced the Century of Blood that swept through Essos. During this time, the Kingdom of Sarnor was decimated by the Dothraki, almost completely slaughtered after the Field of Crows. The Tall Men were driven back to Saath and numbered only about 20,000 after all was said and done and the Century of Blood was over. We'll say it's been about 500 or so years since this point to where the rp is now. My point is to figure out a rough estimate of the current population of Sarnor (other Dothraki raids notwithstanding and can be calculated into the total when all is sorted). 

I've done three calculation for you mods to decide between.

* 5% Birth rate (A generous number and the least likely of the three, but I figured I'd throw it in) would leave the current population at 500,000 in the year 505AC
* 3% Birth rate (Average, more akin to the birthrate seen in the world today) would leave the current population at 300,000 in the year 505AC
* 1% Birth rate (A somewhat low number, but could be completely understandable if factoring other wars and raids into the figure) would leave the current population at 100,000 in the year 505AC

Thank you for reading this little bit! As I said before, these populations do not take into account various other raids or catastrophes that might have happened. Also, I understand this sub is about storytelling and not about hard numbers and the like, but I feel having a mod approved rough estimate of the population would only be a good thing for world building in a civilization that was once destroyed.

I like it when he's laid down and I'm squatted onto him, facing his body because then I can usually attend to him with my mouth and hands whilst he does that, haha.

&gt;Amy is a klutzy girly-girl who likes to party a lot and is flexible in being wooed by men. She is kind of spoiled due to her parents being rich and she once used to look down on the poor. She has a sense of justice and patriotism but gets frustrated a lot when she is in desperate and hard situations. She constantly gets guilt ridden when she does something wrong. She is also naive and falls for many things. Amy might also be bad at placing and losing things such as failing to hide her wallet in her pocket fully only to get it stolen by people like Bender. She is also rebellious against her parents in their many schemes such as their plot to destroy twelve percent of the Milky way to build a giant mini golf course.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","On a good day? Every few hours. On a bad day, pretty much non-stop to varying degrees.

It's a complex beast. There's a combination of ingrained responses and values that I'm actively working to overwrite, past hurts that don't really get erased by logical counterarguments, the standard battery of subclinical brainmess (self-esteem, anxiety, codependent tendencies etc.), trust issues, communication issues, jealousy, envy, fear, and a sea of unknowns and uncertainties about the future, my relationships and my own feelings, desires and hypothetical responses to new stuff I'll probably have to deal with sooner or later.

But at the end of the day, I chose this and I'm fucking going to make it work.

I've had to experiment with various responses and strategies. I tried to dial back my emotions and care level but it was erratic at best, and constantly fighting myself like that was exhausting.

I've tried opening up and being completely honest and communicative of my feelings and that was even worse, because there's way more stupid whiny petty hurtful shit in my head than anyone else should have to deal with, and I wound up regretting a lot of things I said and instantly wished I could take back. That's just not the version of me I want to present to my partner, or to the world in general.

At the moment I'm hovering around a slightly modified, hopefully more sustainable version of what you've described. I don't *deny* my emotional responses, but I do try to filter them, and force myself to take time to think my way through stuff before I say or do something I regret. Sometimes that means delayed responses or removing myself from situations if I'm not sure how I feel about them, and I don't always get it right, but I think it's helping. I'm working to keep pushing my boundaries and comfort zone, albeit gently, and to stay as outgoingly positive as I can without being insincere. Basically aiming for honest words, pleasant demeanour and trying not to make my problems anyone else's unless I have to. It's still a bit hit-and-miss, but I think I can get it right, and I know it's worth trying.","1430438427"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; People ought to be able to bitch and moan as much as they want.

If this is a 'Freedom of Speech' principle, I'm going to throw out a simple point.

People ought to be *able* but they should not ought to be *inclined.* 

'Bitching and moaning'? I think we can both tell from your simple use of terminology that it's just negativity. If it was people throwing compliments in earnest, randomly, I would consider the matter differently. But I do not see much reason in 'bitching and moaning' without seeking a *real* solution.

Bearing in mind I had only read those words as I've typed this. I'm not assuming anything of you.

&gt; The ought to be able to do that without people jumping down their throats calling them 'self entitled assholes'.

I didn't call them assholes. I'm quite careful with things like that.

I'd argued that it's self-entitled and currently I stand by it. I have provided reasons as to why I find that as the case.

&gt; It looks free because you don't pay anything to play it. But if people don't buy skins, if people don't buy champs, if people don't buy stuff, then the game can't exist.

For the record, I've spent a decent sum of money on the game. That shouldn't be relevant, but in the case that you were using a logical fallacy (argumentum ad hominem - ""argument against the man"") I'd like to refute it. In the case that you're making the point that it is not free, then I'd like to specify that ""Free-to-play"" refers to those who choose to play it that way.

You are right in saying that without payments, the game could not exist. Could Riot Games even exist if that were the case? Maybe, I don't know. But it is free to many people, and any new player who chooses to play now also has the choice to pay; they are not mutually inclusive options.

Same for any one player who does it now. The only time this changes is if we consider all or most players making this decision.

&gt; As such, we're entitled to say what we like about what Riot adds to the game.

You purchased what you purchased; your skins, your champions, your Rune Pages.

You do not gain entitlement through spending money. You do not gain possession of the game through spending money. You do not gain a louder voice by spending money.

Why would you? It is very ignorant to assume that Riot's on *your* or any other individual's payroll. That's why voting with your wallet is sound reasoning. Does it always get heard, though?

Of course not, because there are -- particularly in League of Legends' case, *millions* of other players making the same considerations but making different choices to you.

If you stopped paying right now, maybe they'll notice a digit or two go down. Do you think that if we both stopped paying right now, it would change their minds at all?

If I had spent £0 on this game, I would consider myself as entitled to talk about the game as I am now. The principle is that it is people's *choice* as to what they do with their money, and if they do not choose to purchase skins/chromas/Riot Points, then that is perfectly acceptable.

So, my overall point is that you *are* entitled to say what you'd like. But not only is that *not* sufficient reason to say what you'd like, but it is *not* because you 'bought' that right.

&gt; It's not being an asshole to say your mind.

Never said it was.

&gt; It's not being a douchebag to complain.

It could just be ignorance, or stupidity, or a temper, or a bad day. Could be plenty of things.

But if you think about it logically and you have a moment of self-awareness, you're not going to 'bitch' unless you thought it would change something. People 'bitch' everyday. To people they know can't resolve the situation.

Going to Reddit? Sure, that could make an impact; people do take in views from here from time to time.

But if someone is going to identify an opposing view as ""ridiculous"", then I'm inclined to identify such perspective as ignorant, in this case.

&gt; It's our right as the people who make the game what it is.

You have way too much ""consumer empowerment"" going through you right now.

&gt; And if Riot comes out with a product that I think is fucking stupid and overpriced, I'm gonna say ""Riot, that shit is stupid and overpriced. Heroes of the Storm has it for free. Make it the way I want it."".

In other words, you're self-entitled.

Which is fine. But I'd rather go about it some way like this.

""Riot, X as a concept has a lot of potential to work, and I honestly think you can pull it off quite well. But I don't think that it's cost-efficient for many people who play League to actually buy this. 

It offers Y, Z, Alpha and Beta, which is great, but there's quite a lot of room for improvement in either cost or features and I think that without it, I'm not going to find it an appropriate expense and I think that that'll be the case for a lot of potential customers, too. I mean, look at your skins and chroma packs; they do pretty well at these prices. I don't know how much work it takes for you to make X and if it *needs* to be that high, but if it can drop down in price, it'd be a much more appealing offer.""

Also, you're talking about another game whose skins can cost £10.00 by themselves the *majority* of the time. Only Ultimate skins are like that in League. 

If you want to keep trying to quantify between Blizzard and Riot Games, then might I point out the Pay-to-Play *business model* that World of Warcraft has?

*And* it has micro transactions?

Blizzard / Riot Games are apples and oranges, just like MMORPGs and MOBAs or a MOBA and another MOBA. Don't try to draw comparisons, because it's not going to stand very well.","1430438427"

and yet, people still want modding capabilities ingrained into the game. Since Mojang, the creator of a game that is owned by millions, said they were going to add modding ***half a decade ago***, but have yet to deliver, people looked to unofficial sources for their demands.

out of curiosity but how has Bader improved a lot? his striking is still not good and he relies way too much on his wrestling, his 2 big wins over OSP and Davis he didnt look all that good, he just outwrestled OSP which he cant do against the elite guys and vs Davis it was just bad stand up fight between 2 wrestlers which nobody won, the judges were just forced to pick a winner and 2 picked Bader","1430438429"

"vita","t5_2sjmv","If you're at the end of the game, you're most likely gonna need to do a another playthrough. Only a dozen or so of Rise's navigation lines are triggered during specific boss fights, and you're most likely leveled too high to pick up all navigation lines you missed. Here's some tips on how I got it:

* Play on Hard or higher difficulty. If you're over-leveled, you'll miss many of her lines.

* You will have to use all of the characters, there's no way around it. In your next playthrough, get to the top of each dungeon, exit, switch out all your characters, and start again from the bottom. Look for enemies that cause status ailments, and keep fighting them with every character until you've heard all the lines associated with that ailment.

* Don't guard or heal characters. Let them get knocked down and affected with status ailments. Each effect on each character has two or three lines associated with getting inflicted with each ailment.

* Don't level up your party's S. Links. Doing so will let characters help each other recover from effects. Rise has dozens of lines for characters recovering from ailments on their own.

* Do level up Rise's S. Link as fast as you can. The lines she says about enemies' weakness at the beginning of each battle count. She also has many lines for when she helps you in battle, including taking damage for you and recovering knocked out characters.

* You can try scanning every enemy you fight, but there's no clear consensus whether those lines count or not. I did it anyway.

I got the trophy in the Hollow Forest on my first playthrough, but I was actively trying to get it to pop. Some people get lucky and get it without trying, but I've heard of others doing three or more playthroughs and never getting it. Do everything you can to trigger lines, and you shouldn't have a problem.","1430438433"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","In 5th edition, your skills (perception, deception, investigation, etc) don't use a point system to increase. The bonuses to each skill is determined by two things: your ability score (strength, dexterity, intelligence, constitution, wisdom, charisma) and your proficiency bonus.

Your proficiency bonus scales up as you level, and what skills it's applied to depends on your class and I think your background.

Your ability scores are generated when you make your character, and can be done by what's called the point-buy system that is outlined in the player's handbook, but a quick google search should tell you how it works, as lots of systems, such as pathfinder, and even older versions of D&amp;D use it. Alternatively you can do it old school, and take 4 six sided die, roll them all, drop the lowest die, and add the rest together

The ""bonus"" from the ability is usually the only number you care about, not the actual score itself, and is determined by taking the score, dividing by two and subtracting 5. So a score of 12, is a bonus of +1, but a score of 8 is a bonus of -1 (note, always round down for this, so a score of 11 is a bonus of 0)

Now for each skill you take the appropriate ability score bonus associated with it (ex wisdom for perception) and the proficiency bonus if applicable and boom, you have your total skill bonus","1430438434"

(phew, back on a usable small-tablet keyboard / reddit app)

The only thing that's changed is the perception of those guys at the top, which is important for your regular joe - like the OP, clearly - who judges by how plausible someone looks. It's why Yahoo has Mayer as CEO, it's why a legion of US corporates are headed up by sharp-looking dudes in their 50's, and it's why Apple wouldn't have been the Apple it is now without Jobs. Bald, bug-eyed Ballmer with his sweat stains and strained nerd voice wasn't going to cut it as a frontman in this hyper-self-absorbed age however good his leadership skills were. And they *were* good despite his misses. 

Nadella has only just started putting his own stamp on the company and is currently riding high on Ballmer's legacy.

Edit : Also, I forgot about removal of desync and the introduction of ping, I'm from India (which means horrible packet loss but I blame that on my ISP from sucking ass) so my ping is always 150 - 200 ms even while using Singapore gateway, this will, to some extent allow me to test out how lockstep mode feels with high ping (which maybe others won't be able to do?) and whether desync is still the more viable option for players with high ping.

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","I just bottled my dry hopped saison yesterday! Granted, I've only tasted the hydro sample, but it tasted pretty bloody magnificent. Recipe:

    8.5# Belgian Pilsner
    3# Flaked Rye
    .5 oz Mosaic @ 30
    .5 oz Motueka @ 15
    1.5 oz Mosaic @ 30 min hop stand (started chiller 15 min into stand)
    1 oz Motueka @ 30 min hop stand
    1.5 oz Mosaic - Dry Hop 5 days
    1 oz Motueka - Dry Hop 5 days
    Wyeast 3711 (1L starter)     

ABV: 5.4% (OG = 1.048, FG = 1.007)

The sample was super tropical fruit - lots of pineapple and mango, with some earthiness and other exotic-tasting fruit that I can't place. I'm hoping that the yeast and rye spiciness will come through a bit more, but if not it will still be damn tasty.

It obviously depends on what you're going for, but unless you want a tropical fruit bomb, I'd use one of Citra, Galaxy, or Amarillo and pair it with hops that have complementary, but not necessarily similar flavor profiles (Nelson would be good). I actually used those three hops in an IPA, and it was just a muddled fruit punch flavor. My experience in using hops with similar flavor profiles is that you have to be damn good with your hop schedules to get them to play nice together instead of becoming muddled.

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","There is a 10 day free trial that even former players can take advantage of.  Just log into your account page and there should be a button in there.  It sounds like you are a former player that already bought the game and has since discontinued your subscription.  If that is the case, then you will have no restrictions on your account.  You can even take the time to earn some platinum to use to buy CREDD with and continue your subscription that way.

Here are some tips that are mainly for new players but should be helpful to returning players as well.

http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/3485dw/general_advice_for_a_noob/cqs849b

&gt; its nice to see new nexians, so for you the same advice as al, cause these are kind of FAQ for new players:

&gt; 1 go to pve server entity on NA or jabbit on EU (the pvp servers lack population, you will find more fun with us on pve)

&gt; 2 activate hold to cast in your combat menu, press escape&gt;combat&gt;input options&gt; hold to cast

&gt; 3 join the global channels, if you are on entity :

&gt;    exile side: /chjoin lfg
&gt;    dom side: /chjoin entitylfm

&gt; to talk write /1, ask anything there the community is very welcoming

&gt; 4 people tend not to use the looking for group tool, they tend to do premades so you will get faster queues if you make a group the old way, spamming in zone chat and global channels

&gt; 5 when questing the xp given are tied to the class of the quest, there are 5 classes

&gt; world story: gives the most exp, a must do quest Regional story: gives less than world story, do this ones too Zone story: gives a good chunk of exp but less than regional

&gt; task: gives the minimal xp, dont overstay in a place doing them, just do the other 3 classes of quest and move to other hubs

&gt; path quest: these dont give exp to level but to increase your path, you can come do this ones when you are level capped or do it for the sweet perks of your path for leveling (btw if you are maxed in your path these kind of quest will give xp instead)

&gt; 6 Moments of opportunity are the best dps enhancer in the game, to make one interrupt a mob when he is casting something, his hp bar will turn purple abd you will do 150% of damage (for interrupt, stun him or use abilities that say ""remove x interrupt armor""

&gt; 7 there is a lot of exp enhancers to make leveling fast and smooth (but the adventure is in the journey not the destination so if you want to feel the world and not rush it just dont use them)

&gt;    8% xp buff from guild
    8% xp from flask (you can buy it with renown if your guild has unlocked this perk)
    2% from authenticator
    5-10% from house (at lvl 15 you will get your own house, visit it once a day to get a buff for leveling, it can be 5% or 10% depending on the day)
    when log off leave your char into your plot, it will get rested xp (you can get more rested xp if you decorate your plot or even leave it in a fried plot who has the max decor buff)

&gt; 8 dodge a lot

&gt; 9 almost all in the UI is customizable, so you can move it to where you feel more comfortable, some people use forge UI as an addon for this, but there are addons out there for specific clases, cause well your interface changes a little between classes)

&gt; 10 there are a tons of usefull addons, i just use strikehardmeter for dps, latency meter for get a visual of the ping and LFG Board for getting groups (like the premade group finder on wow).

&gt; 11 when creating a char you can skip the first 3 levels by marking skip arkship, but if you are new i recommend not to skip it cause it will teach you some usefull things

&gt; 12 join a guild, this game its better with friends to play it and guilds give good perks

&gt; i think that cover the basic, good luck on nexus


Edit: I think I should mention that drop 5 [(Invasion:Nexus)](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/2015-03-12-wildstars-next-big-update-invasion-nexus/) is coming within the next two months.

I've had good luck with apple trees (craft an apple) combined with fern seeds from the fossils mod (they only grow under trees, but grow fast).  I did also make the trees artificially taller by planting them a few blocks up, and then filling in underneath with logs (I thinks it's prettier).

For my carnivores, I have pigs in with them.  Duncan could set up a little pig farm next to each pen with a chronotyper embedded in the wall to sort pigs into the enclosure.  Or just move some in with a lasso.

And of course, all of this would have been a lot easier if Duncan actually knew how to hand feed them!  Right click with an appropriate food, and it feeds and heals them (no need for potions).  He can use the Dinopedia to check what they eat.  Admittedly, I've had trouble doing this with full grown T-rexes, maybe because of their size.  But I've had no luck with feeders or tossing food on the ground.

"marvelstudios","t5_2uii8","In my foray into the professional world, I've come to realize that no one really knows wtf is going on at any given time. 

It's just my experience, but after watching companies run from the inside, I can say I wouldn't be shocked *in the slightest* that Marvel and Disney and DC and WB have no relevant research in this area. Quite a lot of the time, the decision makers go with ""common knowledge"" and ""their gut"" and don't even think of it in that manner. Hell, even if they did look for that kind of research, it's very likely they don't have it just based on the fact that they have always paid so much attention to marketing this stuff to boys. 

(For example, the medical field, and thus for things like dosage instructions on the back of medicine, for pretty much its entire existence ran on studies that were primarily made up of white men. It was only fairly recently that doctors - at least in the US - looked at things like diet recommendations and dosages and said ""hold up, why are we giving everyone the same instructions when there are very real differences to take into account here?"" That sort of thing happening in marketing as well isn't exactly farfetched.)

So, yes, ymmv, but as much as we'd all love these things to be logical - especially concerning business decisions, it's been my experience that it hardly ever is. ","1430438443"

When I was 16, I was about the same as you, I had a small chest even though I was 5'4"" and 155. I hated my body a lot. And it was not a fun time. Do your best to eat healthy, worry less about counting calories since 16 is a tricky age for controlling that. I'm not sure what you eat, but I know I had to watch my sugar and salt intake personally. Try getting involved in some sports or something active. And ironically, try not to worry about your body doing this. Try focussing on having fun if you're playing a sport and being healthy. Look at losing weight as a bonus. Taking care of yourself will make you feel 500% better, even if you don't see results. Don't worry about your body&lt;3

Come to terms with the fact that you may never develop certain parts. People's bodies vary a LOT, and some women simply don't have hips. And that's perfectly fine. I STILL don't have the bomb ass chest I dreamed of as a girl, but I play up the parts I do love. And even if you DO get those hips, if you're used to self-loathing, you'll just find something else you hate about your body. You gotta learn to love what you got and be grateful it's not as bad as it could be.

I know high school is a shitty time when you're surrounded by a lot of super skinny ladies, some of which have everything physically that you don't. But please understand that it's not just you, there are many other girls who didn't win that little lottery. And even the ones who did will get pervy stares from older men and be judged by their good looks. The grass isn't very green for either side. You've gotta learn to love who you are, because you're stuck with it. Be the best version of you that you can be.

This is however not a very nice surface area to integrate over, so we want to find a different surface area that is easier to integrate over. 

First, Stokes theorem is used to get an integral over the boundary of the spheresection, which is precisely the circle at z=1. Clearly, this is also the boundary of the disk at z=1, so we can use Stokes theorem again to get the integral over this disk, which is much easier to calculate.

First of all, the n in this case is (0,0,1), so we're left with just the z-part of the vector. Second, the area of a disk is easy to calculate, so the final calculation is made a lot easier as well.

To give some physical explanation for why this is allowed. We're calculating the flux through this surface. Look at the object created by also adding the disk. Every fieldline that goes into the object, also has to come out, and since the field is pointed upwards, every line that exits through the spheresection has to enter through the disk, so the flux through the disk and the flux through the spheresection are the same.","1430438446"

"Calgary","t5_2qn40","No. It's not so much an active dislike so much as disinterest. The texture doesn't bother me, I just find the flavourlessness undesirable.  Mild cheddar to me is like eating chocolate cake with the flavour magically removed. Why bother?  I found the paneer similarly bland. It was perfectly edible, but didn't make me desire to eat it. The seasonings applied were tasty, but could have been better applied to chicken, where they blended and complemented the flavour.  
I guess it was somewhat like eating cardboard tikka. good seasoning, but the heart of it wasn't something I desire to eat.  

I don't eat tofu for a couple reasons, but since it's a similar soft, mostly-flavourless blob that you just apply flavouring to, I imagine I would find it similarly undesirable.  (I eat meat, so I have no reason to turn to tofu, and I figure there are enough soy byproducts in so many other things these days that I'd just as well stay away from eating big chunks of soy. the only tofu I eat is in shelf-stable TVP ground form when backpacking, where it offers significant advantages over meat.)

Btw, you likely didn't fail him. It's very normal for pits to have prey drive and it's very normal for pits to ""turn on"" around his age. Turning on in pit bulls is becoming dog aggressive. 

My little bitch was at the dog park for 2-3 fucking hours, every single day, without fail from the day after her shots were done to about 9 months old. I took her to classes, I took her to stores, I took her everywhere. Didn't matter, little hot girl turned on at 9ish months and we had to stop dog park. She still has dog friends, but they're from her puppy stage and have established relationships. She gets on good with plenty of new dogs, but the 2% she wants to attack plus the 100% that she would never back down from and welcome a fight from meant no more dog park for the most part. 

You need to make sure that these boys are extremely clear on the fact that she's got extremely strong prey drive and also dog aggression. They need to verbally confirm that they understand that they cannot own another dog or pet while he's still alive with them. 

I think the fact you could go visit and also babysit is pretty cool. It's a unique opportunity that lessens the hurt of this decision. 

Lastly, I hate to judge you on appearances, but you seem like the kind of girl who's priorities in life are your social and night life. This is probably just about the worst breed to own for someone like that. 

Good luck with whatever you choose. ","1430438459"

&gt;__Indra's net__ (also called __Indra's jewels__ or __Indra's pearls__, from इंद्रजाल in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit)) is a [metaphor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphor) used to illustrate the concepts of [emptiness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunyata),  [dependent origination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratitya-samutpada),  and [interpenetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy#Huayan_and_Avatamsaka-sutra)  in [Buddhist philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_philosophy).

&gt;The *metaphor* of Indra's net was developed by the [Mahayana school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana) in the 3rd century scriptures of the [Avatamsaka Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatamsaka_Sutra) and later by the [Huayan school](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huayan_school) between the 6th and 8th centuries.

The eyes are the windows to the soul. The eyebrows are the drapes. Your eyes show what you're feeling on the inside, your eyebrows show your reaction to those feelings/ what you're feeling on the outside. So if you're in a situation you're being judged, just keep them flat and don't twitch or knit your eyebrows. They move a little closer together and ""knit"" when you are feeling anxious or judged, but if you keep them flat or slightly arched, you appear to NOT GIVE A FUCK GANGSTER AS FUCK LIKE OCEANS. 

BO me was actually talking about shaving them off. This would equate to *no emotions* being reflected off. So 0% judgement.

Just in case I'll explain though.

&gt; Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.

The quote is doubly ambiguous. Specifically this part

&gt; Four remained ... and one the white wolf could no longer sense.

The ""four"" can refer back to either the ""six"" or the ""five"" from the previous sentence. Already this opens the door for GW being alive. If Ghost is saying that 4 of 5 remain... then Lady is still the only dead one.

The ""one"" is also ambiguous - it may refer back to the ""four"", meaning that Ghost can't sense one of the four as you're assuming. It may also be an independent clause, meaning there is an additional one besides the four.

---

Your reasoning that Summer can't be sensed because 

&gt; powerful magic swirling about

is pretty lame. Not sure how that's supposed to convince me when the text clearly states that Ghost can sense Summer

&gt; On the other side the wind was colder still, **the wolf sensed.** That was where his brother was, **the grey brother who smelled of summer.**","1430438464"

The Nisha call (Adnan made sure to put Jay on the phone even though he didn't know Nisha) and short visit to Cathy's house seem like an attempt at an alibi. Adnan was back at school in time for track. Imo it all went too smoothly for it to have been unplanned.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Lol.  That's my comment you're talking about.  I'm a public defender.  Exposing lying cops is one of the favorite parts of my job.

Telling people they're probably shit out of luck is a pretty common response in the sub, but that's largely because there are a lot of posts that warrant that response.  I employ a similar approach with my clients:  I don't sugarcoat anything, and I focus on what we *can* do.  Sometimes this is quite a bit, other times it's not much.  

I do agree with you though that snark, derision, and telling people they're wrong, happen more than necessary. Lurkers seem to upvote based on entertainment value, so judgmental replies can sometimes rise to the top.  I can definitely be guilty of some snark, but I always attempt to include helpful questions or comments alongside.  And sometimes you have to dig a bit deeper or wait around for something genuinely helpful.

[Here's a good recent example](http://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/33oc2p/trespassing_charges_from_an_officer_for_crossing) where the top-rated comment tells the guy he's guilty, and then the guy comes along later on to say that he successfully fought the ticket.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/introduction). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

My one regret from TH7 was maxing it completely instead of moving on when my walls were done.  Once you get to TH9 the bottleneck to completely maxing for 99% of players is loot.

I was saving cards mainly for crafting/deck building seeing from your response I just need the high cards with the WWs, and the fact I can just farm the cards again I'll be dumping most of the cards.

The tournament I joined and am fluctuating between the low to mid 30s for ranking which is higher than I expected, so will be playing more of that. I lost about 20K in gold since I didn't see it cost money per search but it's so easy to come by I'm not worried.

That makes sense with Dr. Donut. There have been times I needed a certain field creature but they were either in the discard or deep in the deck. I'll start leveling him now. Then hopefully obtain Hunson at some point.

The data might still be there but it is unretrievable and has no purpose. In such a world there is no true love or kindness, evil or hate, there are just chemicals and hormones incentivizing and compelling us to act in certain ways. Some people believe this is the truth because they think science is rational, and there is no objective proof that there is something else.

My personal opinion is the double-slit experiment proves that science as understood by humans is still mysterious, subjective, and incomplete. The study of art and humanities (and psychedelics) have probed human experience and come up with explanations far more beautiful and terrible than what science alone can offer. What's the harm in believing in that we could be experiencing something much more magical than we know?

As a species, we should encourage the marriage of science and art instead of creating a false division between the two. We must explore our spiritual capacities, in addition to the scientific laws that bind our universe. Both can be true simultaneously.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","I was a melee player since release of melee. Yes I'm an old man. One thing I highly suggest is randoming! Random a lot! You can always focus on someone later. 

The characters are not the same and first attempts to play them as so can be frustrating. Randoming really allows you to explore the physics and tactics of a totally different game.  I feel as though it helped me find characters I liked much faster including ones I never thought I'd like. Being forced to try everyone really opens your eyes to the fact that a crazy amount of characters are viable in this game and a fresh meta. 

Honestly many of the fundamentals translate. Bairs are strong on almost everyone and pivoting into them really increases success. Paper scissors rock is definitely a major aspect. Forcing people into pressures decisions is where the greatest players shine. Mixing up approaches is crucial. Predictability is death no matter how fast you are. Empty hops and jabs are your friends. 

TLDR: Keep an open mind and try lots of different characters/tactics until it ""clicks"".","1430438482"

It doesn't help that the radical left has been getting progressively more and more radical as of late thanks to things like Tumblr and whatnot. In real life, amongst my friends and acquaintances, I would be considered pretty radical on a lot of issues, but in certain spaces here on reddit and other websites, I would very much be considered a moderate due to how far the left has moved.

Also, there's a small, but very vocal minority of people who identify as feminists or who are interested in social justice that use it as a way to bolster their own self-esteem by putting down anyone who isn't as radical as they are. A very holier-than-thou call-out culture, basically. When that's your first and main experience with feminism, it's not hard to imagine why someone would flinch at the thought of being lumped in with them and choose to identify with something else instead. I don't agree with it personally, since there's a lot more to feminism than the people bitching about nonsense on Tumblr, but I'm not surprised when people are turned off.

"news","t5_2qh3l","It doesn't say it, but it can be inferred from the numbers easily. It said that 52.4% of hate crimes were committed by whites, and 24.3% were black. Whites are 77% of the American population, blacks are 13.2%. Whites are underrepresented and blacks are overrepresented in the hate crime stats. This is pretty simple math.


There are 5814 offenders

52.4% is 3047 offenders rounding up to the next whole number

24.3% is 1412 offenders rounding up to the next whole number


There are 245,532,000 whites in America

There are 41,600,000 blacks in America


We can divide the total number of offenders by race into their respective population totals and get:

1 in every 80581 whites was charged with a hate crime in 2013

1 in every 29461 blacks was charged with a hate crime in 2013


This makes blacks 2.73 times more likely on a national level to be convicted of a hate crime than whites, per capita.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","Necromancy is one of those things that's been codified as 'evil' because that's just the typical fantasy archetype for it, but not without good reason. As the classic alignments go, 'Evil' is considered selfish, disrespectful, and dishonorable, and necromantic magic falls into a lot of those categories. Some of the chief reasons include the following:

* General respect for the bodies of the dead. Most societies value the symbolic gesture of putting their dead to rest (which is why a lot of the time when a person dies in war or execution in other countries, they go to great lengths to get the bodies sent back home), so even if the corpse is mindless, their relatives and friends wouldn't take kindly to it.
* It's considered a cheap and horrible form of psychological warfare. Imagine you're fighting a war, one of your close comrades-in-arms dies, and next thing you know they're raised as a shambling corpse trying to kill you. It might be effective but generally it'd be considered a pretty abhorrent thing to do to someone, both the person who died and their loved ones.
* Depending on the game and the setting, necromantic magic (and other similar kinds of dark magics) are innately corrupting, degrading either the caster's soul or body.
* On that note (and I think this is the big one), I believe under the standard PF setting, raising a corpse with necromancy anchors the soul to that body, trapping them in their shambling corpse until the undead body is slain (that's why in the Golarian setting, Pharasma, the goddess of death, abhors necromancy; because it's a perversion of the cycle and keeps souls from her realm). So the whole 'putting their soul to rest' shtick is quite literally freeing their soul from their body so they can peacefully go to the afterlife.

Obviously all this depends on the setting. It's generally codified that necromancy follows a lot of these conventions, but depending on the setting it may be considered socially acceptable, and the rules about corruption and soul-anchoring may not exist, so it's less abhorrent for the person who's body it was.

If the setting your playing in has all those conventions, however, there's not much you'll be able to do to convince other people what your doing isn't somewhat abhorrent. The act of raising dead bodies isn't going to be something you can really make anyone feel comfortable about, and all other kinds of necromantic magic is inherently about torture and suffering, so again that's not going to win you any friends.

From a player perspective, what you want to do is accept that's the case and run with it. Maybe your character is trying to prove a point that not all necromancers are evil while being ignorant to the social and technical pitfalls with it? Maybe he's just genuinely ignorant and doesn't understand why everyone looks down on him for it? Think about those things with the above info in mind.","1430438486"

So it may not be a full ""quantum computer"" by some peoples' definitions, but they do advertise that these 512 qubits *are* addressable, they do charge *ten million dollars* for the thing, and it does perform algorithms based in quantum information theory.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","You do have a valid point--I've always been a bit of a behind the scenes person. While I'm super bubbly and extraverted IRL, I'm not too big on bringing much attention to myself. I don't even have a Facebook because I just found it so weird over the years. 

Perhaps I kinda inadvertently set a standard without realizing it, and reading this made me reflect. I reached out to some people today after reading this last night and thinking things through. Some people are still jerks--but that's just who they are and I know to just stay away from them. Others did care. Again, my family and my boyfriend's (he's coming with) don't really, and that cuts real deep, but what are ya gonna do?

I do agree with the other commenter though as well. I think it's one thing to suggest something, as in ""Hey maybe we should do this small thing Saturday for my birthday"", but in my experience, I've known way too many people who, when they suggest such things, are very over the top and it just always came to me as tacky, especially (to me) if they haven't really achieved anything.","1430438488"

No. No, he doesn't.

And quit trying to deny that you're a white supremacist. It's just sad to watch you try. Why can't you be strong and proud, like you believe your great white race to be?

&gt;And when the media, politician, or celebrity spread ideas that are incorrect we should censor them too?

Um, yes? Obviously? I work in the media, and our producers are constantly fact-checking and ""censoring"" their content to be sure that it's factually correct before they air it. Are you fucking kidding me?


&gt;I'm pointing out that they have a line of reasoning to their beliefs. 

Yes, and so does ISIS. So did the Nazis.

&gt;You haven't actually demonstrated why the FBI crime statistics don't represent the actual criminality of races

I've never denied the statistics. I've denied the conclusions that white supremacists like yourself draw from those statistics.

&gt;I do know, and it isn't because poverty is creating the numbers

That is fucking hilarious. Of course it's not JUST poverty. It's Racism and Dominance and Poverty, combined.

&gt;it is telling that you can't even do your own homework to actual disprove the claims of these people who you are so inclined to censor and think are so vile

Why do you assume that I ""haven't done my homework""? You think I just came to these conclusions by pulling them out of my ass? I used to be a fucking white supremacist myself. I did the research. I found out that I was full of shit, and so were all the poisonous people filling my mind.

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","I don't think that every movie needs to pass the bechdel test (and to this point, some have proposed the mako mori test to address what some see as deficiencies in the bechdel test).  So long as we can agree that the Bechdel test isn't a test which demonstrates whether a movie should or should not be made, but which can be used to examine movies made in a year in aggregate- it seems like a useful tool to me.

Back when we were doing the advocacy exchange project, we had a subject on the portrayal of women in popular media, and the bechdel test [featured heavily in what I wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/1y3pvf/taep_mra_discussion_portrayal_of_women_in_popular/cfh4984).

I guess the TLDR is: my only criticisms of the bechdel test would be if it is proposed as an absolute metric for the worth of a movie, or presented as an infallible way to identify whether a movie depicted strong women, or if it was presented as the only way to determine if a movie treated gender fairly.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Its simply a test range nowhere in the film does it say that its some kind of gamma bomb test range. It could be radiation. The CLOUD DID NOTHING TO BRUCE PHYSICALLY it is a mental imprint of a horrible incident on him. The only exposure he had when he was a kid was the one he was born with. The mushroom cloud is simply an incident wherein everyone was evacuated and only the base was destroyed. The reason Bruce was able to withstand the Gamma Ray burst which would have killed anyone else was because of the regenerative trait he was born with that was passed on by his father. 

I think you have real issues understanding non-standard narrative devices. No one was exposed to anything in that blast other than possible radioactive drift, unless they made it out of the exclusion zone. Or it wasn't even radioactive. Mushroom clouds can be caused by all kinds of explosions. 

He needed to cure his son because he never intended for his son to be a part of the experiment and he had no idea what it would do to Bruce. In the end the passed down trait saved Bruce from a Gamma Ray burst that would have surely killed him. I have no problem with them figuring out a way to make it marginally more believable why Bruce would survive that Gamma Ray burst as it would melt any person exposed to it. In fact even his friend shouldn't have survived. 

You are wrong many people like the Hulk especially film enthusiasts. I understand if you just like straight forward comic films, Hulk was just different. ","1430438493"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have very vivid dreams every night, here are the two most common.

- I walk down the stairs into a dark basement. There is always a door at the bottom. It slowly creeks open and a giant hissing crocodile emerges. I try to scramble up the stairs and keep tripping and falling the whole way up. I finally get to the top and collapse and my legs wont work. I try to scream for help but nothing comes out, all while this croc slowly gets closer and closer. Eventually it gets to me and eats me.

- This one the context of the dream is always different except for 1 detail it always takes place in the mountains. I could be riding a bike, in the city in the middle of a car chase, or in a park with some girl I wanna bang. Then out of nowhere a giant meteorite impacts the side of a mountain nearby and huge chunk of the mountain gets blown off and flies towards me. It is always so vivid and real. So this chunk is massive and I know there is nothing I can do but just watch it fly towards me. Right before it impacts I wake up.

I forgot about a sleep paralysis dream I get. Not as common as the other 2, I get it maybe 3 times a year. I will be lying in bed and then I wake up (at least I think I do) but I cant move a single muscle. The only thing that functions is my eyes. Then a black cat with glowing eyes will jump up onto the foot of the bed start hissing at and screeching at me while it slowly crawls up my body towards my face. I will try and kick and scream but nothing works. Its much like the Crocodile dream except I can see and sense everything going on around me. my girlfriend has even been watching TV beside me while it happens and looked at me and asked ""whats wrong with me?"" while I stare into space not blinking or moving. And I can see her and hear her but cant respond. eventually the cat gets to my stomach, crouches low lets out a hiss and pounces at my throat. As its mid leap it just turns to smoke and disappears. The second it disappears I can move and scream, and I do every time.... The weird part is everything stays the same its like the only thing that was dream was the cat that was put into the real world that I see in front of me. ","1430438495"

The stab has a fairly longish cooldown, and a long range. Usually it is not the distance that is the problem, but the angle, and when it is the distance it is usually by only a step or two.

When you get a shield, get a non-minion blocked angle and just take a step or two closer so the stab can fire then back off again and stay back for at least 4 seconds. It doesn't take to many stabs to get them low enough that you can 'assassinate' them with your abilities.

Spike has a shorter range than stab and a longer cool down (8 ish seconds). If you see an opening to close to half range and minions are blocking the stab dart in, let abba do a spike from behind the safety of minions then run away before the enemy can run around to you.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","My only UFO experience was while standing over a hill overlooking my hometown with a few of my closest friends from high school; we were all just standing there, facing the mountain and talking.

Suddenly, a HUGE ball of light with a white hot center and green rim shot across the sky, starting from the top-right corner of our vision and passed over the mountain in front of us within a second, *maybe* a second and a half. The weird thing was that it lit up the top part of the mountain it was passing over... like, a lot of it. It was real bright.

We all just sorta sat there for a second until someone piped up... uh, did anyone else see that? Agreed on color, shape, momentum. Our skeptic said it had to be a missile test from the nearby military spot but that thing was flying relatively low to the ground which is super dangerous, the base is 30 miles away, and that thing was moving CRAZY QUICK. Like, at least 5x the speed of an airplane at the same relative distance.

I also had an ex -- born, raised and practicing Catholic, never really ventured into any philosophy or other religions -- who would fall into trance and speak in really esoteric terminology.

For some context, the video was about Verdun, a PC exclusive WW1 shooter.  It's especially crucial in times like these when a console gamer admits a PC would be good to have, to be nice and helpful to them, providing cost effective builds, and overall giving a good impression, instead he got the same old troll comment putting him down for owning a different system, even calling him a peasant even though, as far as I can tell, he's no where near that.  Imagine how quickly we could have had him take an interest in PC gaming!

Maybe the first comment made by 'green' was a bit of tounge and cheek joking, but his second comment was really un-nessecary.
We need to make sure we send the right message to others about who we are (e.g.  lessen the use of peasantry unless absolutely deserved), even apologising for someone's bad behaviour is good enough to ammend hard feelings.

It's not ""I thought Shirin's edit"". It's that the editors have repeatedly promised us of an uprising by the good people, and that the editors have deliberately made the good guys super-good, and the bad guys evil caricatures. There was plenty of film that could have made the core 6 likable or human, but they chose very actively to make them awful so that when Mike wins it will be more triumphant. The issue with that is that all of the episodes leading up to Mike's victory suck, because of the false hope manufactured by the storytelling. Compare to an actual good season like PI, where the Rupert boot wasn't handled as ""Don't worry, Rupert will pull through"", but as this incredible tragic fall of a hero.

Its like people on video game auctions. You have a stack of 50(say 2 gold each for a total of 100g) of an item, versus a stack of 200(1g each for a total of 200g) of an item. The latter is cheaper per unit, but you only need 50...So while I am paying a little more for less, I am overall paying less gold for what I need.

Same applies here. Hell, release them separately for 300 each, and release them also as a bundle where its buy 2 get 1 free kind thing. This makes the pack price 600, while individually costing 900 total.","1430438504"

For me personally, keeping long form journals to write whatever I am feeling is a great way to stay accountable. So has reading that other people are involved in this journey too.

Also as others have said, there is the issue of RC count.

Also, it's quite active in the spring when temperatures are mild.  The less correlated with demand, the more storage is needed and the more likely it is that you will have to export that power when storage is full.

This is what Aish.com has to say on the matter:

&gt;The story is told about a fellow who applies for a job at a prestigious investment banking firm. The interviewer looks at his resume and says, ""I see you went to Harvard Business School. Very nice. Tell me, what year did you graduate?""
The fellow says, ""1990.""
""1990. Did you ever take any courses with Professor Stevens?""
""Stevens? No.""
""Okay, how about Professor Phillips? He's one of the most popular professors at Harvard. Older fellow, grey hair. Did you meet him?""
""Nope, never heard of Phillips.""
""You went to the Harvard Business School and you don't know two of the most popular professors?! I don't get it. Did you attend Harvard or not?""
""Well, I guess I should be honest with you. I didn't actually go to Harvard. My roommate attended the Harvard Business School. He used to bring home all his notes and textbooks, and I read everything he brought home. So when he graduated, I figured I graduated, too.""
The interviewer was not impressed. And our ""graduate"" didn't get the job. (Or if he did, it's one of those firms that's out of business now...)
Why isn't it enough just to read the notes to be considered a Harvard graduate?
Because you need to hear the lectures. The professors add so much information that the notes simply don't present a full view of the subject. If you want to get a full understanding of a text, what's the best way to find out? Ask the experts: ""What's behind this? Please explain it.""
Information in the written form is, by definition, secondary and limited in scope. That's why the Oral Torah is 50 times the size of the Written Torah! (In actuality, the Oral Torah is infinite. It contains the totality of Torah, which – as the word of the infinite G-d – is by its very definition infinite.)","1430438512"

Once you allow someone to drive your vehicle, you are assuming liability if they are in an accident. (Which is why, for example, insurance companies can deny damages caused when a car is stolen.) 

If your vehicle was in an accident and your insurance company had to pay out either to you or the other vehicle/property that was damaged - regardless of who was driving - that is a claim on your policy. If the driver of your car wasn't at fault, hopefully there will be no surcharge. If he/she was at fault, you will lose any ""No Claim"" discounts you have and may also see a surcharge if the claim exceeds whatever threshold your company has set. ","1430438514"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Your observations are correct.  I do look for those subtle reinforcements because I don't want to see them.  I want to eliminate them off my list of things which are or are not possible.

I started having a thought about a year ago.   I came to the stunning realization that I'm the only thing in existence that can feel any way about me.   That didn't change that fact that outside influences had an effect on my feelings, but to really realize that was pretty important I think.  Even when others judge you, it's your feelings that make you feel what you feel. 

Also, that feeling you described about feeling ""bad"", and ""Not worthy"", those are bang on.   Because I've realized that I feel very uncomfortable around innocence.   Around babies/children, dogs, really kind people, family....etc.  I am naturally attracted to dark things, those things interest me more than positive light things, and that's supposed to be bad and negative.    My idea of heaven is not white and bright things and perfectly clean clothing, it's carnivals and fun houses, and fast cars and tunnels that lead to alternate dimensions and entertainment (basically Earth minus the shit I don't like)....etc.   I've always wondered if that is spiritual, or psychological, or if they are one and the same.  I've heard it's kind of common to be afraid of children, but I think it's weird.   I guess i'm into some stuff that most would consider kind of shameful, and I know that if they knew they'd feel differently about me.  Only my closest friend knows about one of them, and I am very fortunate that he is alright knowing it.  The way I feel, is beyond my control though...But one can feel like a dud, when comparing themselves to the status quo or general ideas about what constitutes a good soul, or a corrupt damaged one.  it's natural I guess.

The writer ""Zak"" bugged Eron to do an interview for an extended period. Eron is smart but incredibly naive - I assume this Zak guy assured him he'd write a fair article. Instead, he likely intended to trash him all along, while assuring LW he'd make her look good.

It was interesting that the Zak guy seemed to create a new twitter account to ask Eron for the interview. I googled it the other day and it seemed there was only one tweet (this is a separate account from his real twitter account).

Another interesting point in Eron's tumblr response was that he logged into his Facebook account on Zak's laptop to show him the chat logs with LW. So there's no excuse for Zak having overlooked the abuse and deceit Eron was subjected to.

This all tells me Zak is an SJW, an activist writer who intended all along to smear Eron. It's beyond my comprehension why Eron would agree to an interview after the three or four hit pieces SJW journalists did on him last Fall.","1430438522"

You don't mention if you have the Touch or Non-touch model.

I have a Non-touch with 1080p screen. I have yet to turn the brightness past 75%. In a semi-darkened room I rarely go above 50%. If your T450s cannot get bright I'd have Lenovo exchange it for one that works.

I have a T430, T420, T510 and a T61. The only one of these that has a terrible screen is the T420.

The only thing which locked you into specific specilisations rather than choosing what you want was the reveal that you only choose three trait lines to specialise in. It ended up having nothing to do with elite specialisations.

Honestly, when you look at the proposed trait lines, they are seem similar to elite specialisations anyway - longbows will build Marksmanship, Traps and Shortbows will build Skirmishing, Spirits will take Nature Magic etc. Locking down the staff to the Druid trait line seems like less of a limitation when you consider than most players running an existing weapon are heavily encouraged to trait that weapon anyway.","1430438525"

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","I came out to my parents when I was 20 and for the next 10 years or so, we had off and on contact. I didn't go searching for a parental figure, but looking back, I realize that I related to many of my managers as parental figures. [I'm an engineer working in product development organizations.] Frankly, many of those managers helped me grow up. Sometimes I was sort of ""adopted"" a bit by my partner's parents as well.

Now I am in my 50's and a manager. I wouldn't say I play a ""parental"" role in some people's lives, but I am on the mentor side more often than on the ""being mentored"" side.

One thing I have noticed throughout my career is that there are a lot of people, straight and gay, who seem to be seeking parental approval (as I did) in vain. Unfortunately, having a messed up relationship with your parents is not exclusive to being gay/lesbian, but it sure seems more common amongst us.","1430438526"

The thing is that Iran is merely a signatory, and the United States hasn't signed that UN Convention at all-- so both sides use their status to suggest they can act abnormally.

Hello! Your post has been automatically removed because I believe it is a tweak release post that uses a Cydia screenshot. If it isn't, please disregard the rest of this message and contact the moderators to get your post approved.

Cydia screenshots aren't very informative when it comes to release posts because it usually tells people nothing other than the name of the tweak and repo it is hosted on. It doesn't give us any screenshots, description about the tweak, or its price and thus doesn't help people decide if it is a tweak they would find useful. You're welcome to repost this, but please follow these two steps first:

1. Check to see if somebody else hasn't already posted it. If they have, then there's no need for you to post it.
2. Check out our [wiki page on making good posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/wiki/greatposts)
3. Post a link to the Cydia depiction, a [link to the package](http://redd.it/19ppxl), a tweet made by the developer, or an article or YouTube video about the tweak

Thanks for understanding!

Totally agreed with this one. I would love to see classic characters make a return, even if that means going back to the traditional martial arts roots, I would appreciate it.



&gt;Make Gohan a strong character

Everybody seems to be complaining about this recently. 
Thing is, just because a character can't bench press a planet, it doesn't mean that character isn't ""strong"".
 
I've also heard comments about Gohan being ""useless"", which isn't true.
Gohan can become a witty character that outsmarts the enemy instead of bare brawling them to death.

I hope so too! With all the transformations we currently have, I don't see a reason for another one. But then again, this IS a new series, so I wouldn't be surprised if we get something sooner or later.

today turned from a splurge into a full blown binge day. I honestly cannot express how ashamed I feel right now to write this. I stole food from the common fridge. I feel terrible, physically and mentally. Actually I think I'm having a panic attack now. I've suddenly plunged into darkness, why the hell did I do this to myself?? I've gone over 4000 calories for sure and the sugar content must be through the roof. I'm bloated and what's worse: that hopeless depressive feeling has overwhelmed me. It's 1 am in the morning and I should be asleep.

Geezus fucking Christ what's happening, why??? This is like the end of March when I binged at home, except I did it the last day at halls of residence.
I'm at a loss for what to do.

One side of me thinks that the IF thing I was doing pushed me into a slightly starving cycle. Will never try IF that way again.","1430438530"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I am sorry to be the baron of bad news, but you seem buttered, so allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies, and are more than just ice king on the cake. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite.
So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality.
I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go.
Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn't take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It's clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the fax, instead of making a half-harded effort.

In some dreams, I tell my SO that I cheated, she is devastated, I'm feeling like I deserve to die. Then, I wake up and continue to feel awful and guilty about the dream and how convinced I was of what's happening.

I don't know why these happen. I never have cheated on anyone, and I don't plan to. I think it stems from a distrust of myself, distrust of self control, and fear of how I would react to myself if I were to cheat on someone.

I rarely dream, but when I do, it is incredibly convincing. Since I dream so little, this dream makes up a solid 5-10% of my dreams and I always wake up believing it happened, and not realizing it was a dream for a few minutes.","1430438533"

For curiosity's sake though, and keeping in mind that they have the verizon modem/router and a 16 port gigabit switch...

You're saying to setup the verizon as modem only, plug it into a 3 port business class router that supports vlan, use a port on that router to go out to the 16 port switch for the business wired network.

Then, inside the router, configure a vlan just for wireless. Just want to make sure I'm understanding correctly. Thanks!","1430438538"

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","That's an interesting Theory. Since I'm an engineer and not a theoretical particle physicist, I enjoy working with tangible objects instead of weird little matter bugs. So that kind of theoretical drive is too beyond my understanding to offer a comment to the affirmative or negative. However, it sounds plausible. If a particle was spun (enough to provide a measurable, useful change in space-time) and shot by a compact particle accelerator (or it could drift into it, who am I to judge a lazy particle?) into an energy uptake system on the other side, I can see that working. This field change would need to be modulated to provide more efficient  ""forward"" travel through space-time. Modulated or given an ""anti-spin"" (as I see it it my head) to cause a (to me) a necessary opposite shift in space time at the other end. Where a higher point mass might cause a contraction of space time on one end, and a higher ""anti""mass would cause an expansion. My use of anti doesn't mean I'm necessarily suggesting spinning an anti particle, because I don't know much about antimatter and the like and their properties. I just mean ""do the opposite on the other end"".

It's might be possible that doing the same thing to something else might produce expansion. It's also possible that a different method is the only way of doing that and the uptake system could power that too. Who knows. 

But yeah I really like your input. I might contact you about your opinions while I do these articles. I'd also like to get drunk and have a conversation about this stuff with you. I believe that would be a good time. My brain hurts less when I think about things like this from a very specific view point for too long. It's not that it's necessarily hard, just that I start picturing (or trying to) 4th dimensional effects when my brain is so firmly rooted in flatland.

Not to mention the few times my parents have been away she was immediately filled with separation anxiety, so it would be best if I could leave her where she is now.  Parents treat her fairly, they don't yell, they may be pretty strict at times but I don't think that necessitates removing her.

I understand what you are saying, and I thank you for your kind words and wise thoughts.  I think my little sister will be just fine if she stays with my parents. In time, she will start to clash with them in her teen years and I will be there for her.

What I need to focus on right now is me. Like it says in the OP, should I be trying to move out by the end of the school year or a month before? It looks like moving out a month before would be optimal because the social worker is talking with me *now* and getting out a month ahead of the summer vacation rush would cut down on competition for places to rent and possibly a part-time job to supplement the Youth Agreement.

First, the crops which get cut will be the least important ones.  Almonds are getting a lot of flak, but they're high price products and will continue being produced.  Rice and alfalfa (which can be grown in a ton of places, and are very water intensive) are the low hanging fruit for what farmers may stop producing.

Second, the commodity price of vegetables is a pretty small chunk of overall food costs.  Much more of the food budget of Americans goes into meat, packaging, transportation, and marketing than does commodity vegetables.

Third, there are substitution effects.  California produces a lot of vegetables, but lots of vegetables get grown in other places too.  For instance, green beans are primarily produced in slightly colder climates.  It's quite possible that people will eat fewer of the vegetables California specializes in, and more of some other vegetables, when the price changes.","1430438546"

&gt;Devices that combined telephony and [computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing) were first conceptualized by [Theodore Paraskevakos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Paraskevakos) in 1971 and patented in 1974, and were offered for sale beginning in 1993. He was the first to introduce the concepts of intelligence, [data processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing) and [visual display screens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_display_screen) into telephones which gave rise to the ""smartphone."" In 1971, Paraskevakos, working with [Boeing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing) in [Huntsville, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntsville,_Alabama), demonstrated a [transmitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmitter) and [receiver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_(radio\)) that provided additional ways to communicate with remote equipment, however it did not yet have general purpose [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDA) applications in a wireless device typical of smartphones. They were installed at Peoples' Telephone Company in [Leesburg, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leesburg,_Alabama) and were demonstrated to several telephone companies. The original and historic working models are still in the possession of Paraskevakos.

Really? Actually the government can and did. So again you're wrong. No person can force another to take out a mortgage though. 

As to your last point I said *you* absolve people of their responsibility. If you enter into a 30 year contract without taking the time to understand the risks involved, or hire someone who can explain it to you, then you are taking on a level of risk you should be willing to accept. You're saying it's not these peoples fault.  Well who else is at fault for getting a mortgage they can't afford? Who else decided to buy a house with no money down on an ARM? When you buy a house you can't afford, just like anything else, you run the risk of losing your home. Period.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Except that this assumes our goals are opposite and our voices equal.

The tension you describe requires us to be in constant balance of forces.  If one group or voice becomes the stronger, and using that strength reinforces itself, then it becomes impossible for the tension to be maintained.

That view has a certain appeal, the ideal of symmetry is elegant and if achieved, powerful.

But it is also fragile.

At present it is best to imagine that the rope in the middle, that which we pull back and forth in our tug of war, has begun to fray.

As that takes place we separate, and worse yet, we stagnate.

Should that rope that binds us together snap entirely, we end up at war within our own nation, the very end that democracy seeks to avoid.  Whether through violent civil revolt, or the militarization of domestic police forces, the peace we sought to maintain is broken.

That's why it's impossible to get anything done.  That centre place of compromise grows thin and weak, it won't support the kind of work that needs to be done.

It also makes us vulnerable to outside changes.

The tension between workers and employers for example is a careful balance.  Introducing the concept of climate change, and the necessity of action on that front adds another rope to the pull on neither of those sides.  Workers fear for their livelihoods, and employers fear for their profits, so both pull against the greater good, attempting to strain enough to move the mountain that is reality.

In essence, this only works for the most limited of scenarios.  Perhaps it might work to encourage the poorest to pull against the richest.  But there is no centre point or common ground where reality is concerned.  It is what it is, and no amount of politics or voting or compromise will change that.

So at times reality will loom on that fringe, and we must all decide to abandon our previous arguments and tensions and move to safe ground.  If not, the floods will raise the water over our heads, and our tug of war will see only floating corpses still clinging to a now slack rope.

We have to be willing and able to vote according to our good conscience, our true wisdom and our intellects, not only according to our momentary benefit. ","1430438548"

"mac","t5_2qh4u","It does not perform like a quad core. Hyperthreading greatly reduces time spent switching between threads. It basically eliminates any performance penalty from running 2 processing threads on 1 available core because of this, but those two threads still only get 1/2 of the CPU's attention each.

4 physical cores will double your performance (100% improvement) if all of them are busy. Hyperthreading increases performance from 0% to 30% depending on what you are doing.

That's not bad at all, and when you have only 2 cores you are quite likely to multitask and take advantage of Hyperthreading compared to the same tasks on a hyperthreaded 4 core CPU.

So this is one of the many factors that improve this CPU's performance compared to an older processor (or an AMD processor) but it unfortunately is not the same as having 4 cores-- ever ","1430438550"

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","DPS means nothing in Planetside 2 unless you could guarantee that every single shot hits the target. Thus, we use TTK, and that doesn't factor in 99% of the time when flying either.

The reason Tomcats are hated is the fact that 'they take no skill to use', which, while being rather generic, is also correct. Keeping a lock while under fire causes you to die quicker, as you just have to keep it in the general area, rather than matching the manoeuvres performed by the enemy, which has the side effect of dodging enemy fire.

If you want to use a secondary other than afterburner tanks, go with the Coyotes. While they do little damage, they damage the enemy while your primary is reloading, enabling you to keep up the damage as much as possible. People will respect you far more, and will be willing to teach you and fly with you if you use Coyotes rather than Tomcats.

As for dying a lot, I really hate saying this, but get used to it. It's only been recently I've been able to begin taking on enemy aircraft in a 1v1 and win, but against any pilot who has been flying longer than me, they will easily kill me (hence why I run stealth for ambushes and getaways). It's just the way it is. 'Softening' the blow of death through Tomcats really doesn't help much, because once you get good with the nosegun/Coyotes, it's scary what you can do. But with the Tomcats your flight style never changes, you never learn anything because you're always flying the exact same way: to keep the lock. 

If you want to become better whatsoever, ditch the Tomcats. It's nothing but a crutch.","1430438555"

C'est ce que j'explique depuis quelques temps déjà. Pour moi entre Android et Apple, il ni y'en a pas un qui soit mieux que l'autre. Seulement l'un plus adapté aux besoins d'une personne que l'autre. 

iOS est tellement plus facile d'accès en terme de design, d'uniformité dans ses applications etc qu'Android. Mais en même temps c'est au prix d'une certaine limitation des liberté de son utilisation (et j'intègre là dedans les limitations pour pouvoir publier certaines applications). 

Mais oui par contre Android est plus ouvert, on trouve une plus grande variété de fonctionnalité via les applications disponibles mais parfois au prix de quelques risques de sécurité pour l'utilisateur. 

J'ai beau être utilisateur Android, si quelqu'un qui n'est pas technophile me demande un conseil sur l'os, si le prix est pas le point essentiel je lui conseillerais un iPhone sans hésité. Android correspond plus à mes attentes/besoins perso qu'iOS, mais c'est pas pour autant que c'est le cas de tout le monde.","1430438555"

"AskVet","t5_2sx1m","There is a huge difference between giving a shot to a person and to an animal.  First, humans have very small Subcutaneous space, as such the only injects that are given that way are generally insulin.  Give a person an injection between the skin and muscle with your average 25  or 22 gauge needle and you are asking to be punched in the face.  Human vaccines are given into a muscle as we tend to have large muscle bellies than a cat.

Prep for subcutaneous shots are also very different.  Try to tent my skin and I will punch you.  Don't tent a cats skin and you will either hit a muscle, a blood vessel or a nerve. Two of which can result in you getting bit if the person restraining isn't ready for it.  

So no, injections sound the same, but can be different depending on the species.  RN's are excellent at poking people, but without instructions shouldn't be poking any other species.

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","Well; nice try assad's or iranian general or russian FSB. But i'd pick a variant of :

1°) consolidate heavily current positions. Train and integrate more the NDF before they end up as a free companies just looking for themselves. Oh and also let the tiger forces do their fuckin job alone if you want them to succeed.

2°) convince the russians or iranians to send an actual peace keeping mission. Large scale; with an actual trained modern army and lots of armor/air power. That can stand in the middle and defend themselves but disciplined enough. We're talking about tens of thousands of men. And/or an UN mission. They need trainers too to reform the SAA from scratch. There's a russian base in tartus. Perfect bridge head/staging point. That would even give an excuse to putin to train &amp; test &amp; show off his army against jihadis nobody cares much to leave in charge anywhere. Ru firepower would also probably convince the non-us-backed saudi to keep their no flight zone away from the actual russian military. Outright external intervention in his favor is probably his main chance at making it without killing half the country one by one.

3°) convince the western states (&gt;turkey) to keep standing aside (easy to negociate with stuff like ""end of the torture program for real with inspections"" ""the last remaining chemical weapons"" ""they will actually send in troops and not just missile everything to glass from the coast"" and ""i won't touch the kurds in the north"" and that could actually happen). Althought Sultan Erdogan 1st might be more a bit more hard to convince, he seems to have his own ideas on the question.

4°) reiterate the amnesty offer / ask anyone willing to have an actual future to negociate in a cease fire. That implies signing a real peace and probably some area partially autonomous :\ And not shabibas avenging themselves on the population now matter how tempting it is.

5°) push the crazy jihadis out with the ru military. ISIS is on their way out anyway, might as well carve their entire syrian territory with ru military.

6°) planify rebuilding the country. They could probably get international help to deal with the rebuilding, the destroyed/badly damaged infra and millions of refugees/displaced citizens. That's also a very easy way to endear themselves back a bit to the pro rebel syrians.","1430438557"

The problem with ""alternate"" woods like this, though, is that as companies jump on them as cheaper/more readily available, they're going to end up over-harvesting them just like they did with the ""old"" stuff. Luckily there are better environmental protections in place, but many countries where exotic woods grow also unfortunately suffer from lots of government corruption; it's *very* easy for unscrupulous wood vendors to grease the palms of the politicians and policy makers in a lot of those countries, which has historically been an issue with woods like ebony. Not only do *we* have to want sustainably harvested lumber, but we have to convince those other countries that it's in their best interest to responsibly harvest their own lumber. Because many of those countries have a high rate of poverty, they're more inclined to take bribes and look the other way, in many cases simply because they're just trying to survive.

It's a much more complicated issue than ""just don't cut too much down"". It makes navigating the waters of exotic lumber pretty tricky, especially if one wants to avoid questionably-harvested wood yet still use exotic timbers.","1430438558"

Not yet, apparently, if Florida's recovery is any indication.

But as has been pointed out, FEMA's new guidelines are BRUTAL in some areas, and can even restrict how much work is done on a property (50% of the appraised value) if the property is deemed in a flood zone. That aside, I read one news story of a commercial owner that saw a jump of insurance rates from $3500 a year to $50,000 (I think it was the Gulf coast).

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I was a generally sad child. But I don't feel like my problems stemmed from that. Years ago I decided that I wanted to join the army. It sounded like a good idea. Wrong. I'm not sure what it was that first triggered my major depression episodes, but it happened. I started falling apart. I had a rough experience. The army shuns the weak, both mental and physical. I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two ""guards"" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.","1430438561"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not the previous commenter, but I'll give it a shot.  Presumably, these ancient Jewish judicial codes (if they had any validity) were ordered by God.  I would think any rule against gay sex then would be just as applicable now.  Honestly, for most thinking people, there needs to be an actual reason for a change in the laws (especially those mandated by God), but I can't see why any rule against gay sex then would be less applicable now.  Seriously, why would god say that homosexuals should be executed?  Why was that okay back then, but not now?

As for ""Hate the sin. Love the sinner"", it's like saying ""I still love you, but I hate a thing that you do that is (likely) closely tied with a major part of your identity.""  There's no denying that many people have used the Bible to justify hatred against gays.  And look at 1 Timothy 1:10.  It literally compares homosexuals to murderers and slavers.

"scotus","t5_2rfsw","&gt;I suspect that the counter argument is that monogamous marriage limits that possibility since it lowers the number of people with the influence to force such a marriage.

 I was thinking specifically of arranged marriages, (although to be fair I didn't specify) so I'm not sure that holds up.  The coercion doesn't have to come from someone actually involved in the marriage

&gt;Another argument would be that polygamy is much harder to untangle if and when it does go bad.

I don't buy that either, but I can see why others might - you can say that it makes for somewhat more complicated divorce proceedings, but I think that the threat of complicated divorce proceedings aren't high on an abuser's list of potential threats.  Loss of economic support, loss of access to children, loss of social status - all of these are equally possible in monogamous and polygamous marriages.","1430438565"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;All that that shows is that saving humanity is preferable is preferable to not saving it. Assuming that that's not an option, prolonging the inevitable is seen as preferable to going quietly into the night.

But... then that's just straight up evil. It's the deliberate and premeditated murder of another human being(s) without even the dubious 'justification' of saving everyone else. Acknowledging that but excusing it through a utilitarian point of view opens up moral relativism, which is the ethics equivalent of saying 'well that's just *your* opinion.'

&gt;This is essential what OP wants to debate; not so much the morality of sacrificing a child from a utilitarian perspective (because any utilitarian worthy of the name is obviously going to argue that it's morally obligatory) but rather whether utilitarianism itself is moral.

And there's the rub. Utilitarianism is effectively the promotion of the necessary or lesser evil, which is *still evil.* It's a plainly amoral philosophy, and OP knows that or he wouldn't have said ""I know this is a utilitarian argument but..."" That  ""but"" let's you know he's about to dismiss the problems with utilitarianism. Which means he knows it's wrong but doesn't care because *results* and you can't really argue against that.","1430438565"

Listening to his spiel, even if he did care about relegation matches, he would maybe give you the benefit and say Kiwi had a huge power rating after his relegation performances, but him and his overall team historically are quite in the gutter still.

What would matter to Thoorin is if his short term power ranking boost continued into the next split, and helped his team improve their standings.

"homeautomation","t5_2s8wn","Having spent another couple of days with OpenHAB I'm satisfied that it was the right way to go.

We want to have Android and iOS as the standard platforms for accessing and controlling house stuff. Kodi apps (Kore, Yatse, etc) for the media, OpenHAB for automation. Since every project (and its users) is different in significant ways, flexibility in the UI design turns out to be quite important.

With Domoticz and I was initially excited by the potential of the Lua scripting but OpenHAB has so many appealing bindings (plugins) available - bluetooth, networkhealth, TV interfaces, XBMC/Kodi...

Integrating with network monitoring apps like Cacti is important to me. OpenHAB will write its persistence data to RRDs if you want and I expect those will be pretty easy to make visible to Cacti. I have no idea how I'd get the graph data out of Domoticz short of scraping the database or manually exporting the graphs (in CSV?).

I'm still coming to terms with OpenHAB's use of Java and Xtend. The last time I did any serious work in Java was in 2002. It's matured quite a bit since (lambda syntax, whee!), so the learning curve for serious scripting is still steep.

There are a couple of tricks I've learned so far for OpenHAB UI configuration:

* Don't use Groups in the Sitemap (except as summary values). It's really tempting but just don't. Explicit is better.

* Don't bother with the Setpoint elements. They're currently very slow and user-unfriendly. Using a Selection with a mapping argument listing every possible value is actually so much more user-friendly.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","He hasn't had a solid year since the Vezina push in 12-13 where he had a. 924 Sv%. I'd imagine the Sharks will look to draft a goalie soon, probably higher up, considering they don't have any blue chip goalie prospects, and are pretty thin there. Maybe they go after Ilya Samsonov. There's no real chance Dubnyk leaves Minnesota for San Jose, so the only free agent they could go after that would make sense would be Niece himself, but I'd imagine there might be some difficulty since they don't seem confident enough in Nemo to give him a long term deal and a bridge deal may not be enough to keep him. Perhaps they sign and trade, or look for another option via trade. Bernier or Reimer could be available. There's a chance either Hammond or Anderson leave Ottawa, depending on how the situation develops with them and Lehner. Buffalo trades goalies all the time; maybe Lindback makes a comeback and they flip him for the rebuild. That's a bit of a long shot, but he showed promise at the end of the season with them. Maybe Vancouver moves Markstrom if he continues his rebound. Maybe with Gillies joining the Flames they look to move Ramo. There's even a chance they could go after prospects like Kristers Gudlevskis, Zachary Fucale or Malcolm Subban. I'm just saying they have options, but they will likely have to give up something to get a goalie here if theyre not drafting one. ","1430438572"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt; My question here is what do I do?

Had a good chuckle with the responses here. They're absolutely right of course, but you have to wonder what the responses would have been had the genders been reversed - you being a girl with him going down on you constantly, but you refusing to give him a blowjob. I'd imagine folks left &amp; right would tell you that it's your body, your choice. That you don't have to do it if you're not comfortable with it. That if he can't accept that, he'd be a jerk for forcing it on you, and that he can just walk off a cliff, and stuff of that nature.

.

There was one similar post a few months back with just this scenario. Didn't end well, but the nature of the responses were more or less expected.

.

In your case, I'd start by apologizing for being selfish, and that you're absolutely willing to go for it. Tell her you're willing to do it, but slowly. Step by step. You want to give her the best possible experience possible, so you want to do it right the first time. Then follow up on it. You don't have to go full face in, start by going down while she's wearing thin pants. Then for the next session, let her wear yogapants and such. After you get used to it, change it to underwear.

If they, with all of their educated employees , get it wrong, then they aren't worth much as an investment Bank are they? A loud public declaration like this is betting that they will be right, and will be able to claim kudos in the investment world for predicting the trend.

"Celica","t5_2te55","Yeah... unfortunately ST205s aren't available here yet. However, since the rule is 25 years from manufacture date it's not going to be TOO long of a wait. The first ones go back to late '93 IIRC, so that translates into being legal in late 2018.

That being said there ARE a handful(I've heard 15 at this point) that made it here under dubious legality. They do sometimes come up for sale. However, you do run the risk of the feds taking notice and taking the car if you're unlucky. Personally I'm not willing to run that risk, but some are. Expect them to be quite expensive if/when they are sold.

Other things to note are that parts specific to the ST205, specifically brakes and suspension, are going to be almost completely ridiculously difficult to obtain. Engine parts shouldn't be -too- hard to find if needed, but you may have to order from overseas at some points, or at least a specialist shop that stocks parts for people who have swapped to 3rd and 4th-gen 3SGTEs.

My solution? I'm picking up a very clean '165 next week that will eventually have the entire '205 drivetrain swapped over. There's something about the fourth-gen bodystyle that just does it for me.","1430438581"
"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;""It was playful banter, nothing sexual. I told her i was seperated (dont know why)""

*Seriously* OP? You don't know why you told someone you were flirting with that you were single? You say you don't want to tell your wife because it will hurt her and you don't want to do that. If that's true, and you really do love her, then you need to sit her down and seriously work on getting into counselling (or at the very least talking together) about fixing whatever it is that you feel is wrong with your marriage. Don't make excuses like ""oh well, we just never followed through"". You need to put *effort* in if you want to make it work.


Now, if what you *really* want is to screw around on Tinder then stop telling yourself it's just innocent banter, stop telling yourself there's nothing wrong with what you're doing. Tell your wife the truth and break it off because you aren't do her a favor by staying with her if you're going to be cheating (physically OR emotionally). I get the feeling that this is NOT what you want, and if that's the case you need to stop doing this shit and start being honest with your wife, starting with this (because it's going to be a lot worse if that chick actually does tell her)

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","The beauty of CB is the flexibility of the weapon. Have a hammer bro? Go for tail. Have a GS? Go for head to KO. Have both? Go for feet and get trips. You can go for big hits and KOs or you can stay in in sns mode forever with a status CB. Fill whatever role the team needs and you'll be guaranteed better clear times and more broken parts. I try not to overlap because CB is very prone to tripping, but with good positioning, you can easily share a head with hammer if you really need the KO. 

Also a word of caution with GPs, while there are people with the requisite skill, I tend to not use them online unless I'm in a bad spot. It's fine to try to style on the monster solo, but if I miss the GP online, I'll get hit, be in axe mode when I get out, and get hit by a follow up attack because Im too slow. Definitely carted to this many times. Most of the time after you get a GP, you should be looking to evade the next attack since monsters get so aggressive in g rank. Thus, you probably shouldn't have been there in the first place. I try to combo such that it takes me through and past the monster. For example, there's an opening head on, X+A to dash in -&gt; charge A-&gt; X+A-&gt;X+A -&gt; R to charge shield-&gt; evade forward. That should take you all the way through the monster and a good distance behind him. The side evades are great for this too. Where you finish your combo is just as important as when you start and the CB has great tools for this to make up for it's lower walk and sheath speed.

For diet. You should start tracking your calories with the MyFitnessPal app. It will get you set up and tell you how many calories to eat to lose your chosen ammount of weight. It's a paint by numbers set up that uses the simple math of calories in vs calories out to ensure weight loss.

"WarSnipersClash","t5_35jew","Ive been a part of about 40 farm-wars now, and only twice did my clan not get what they wanted. One was a japanese clan who we had no way of communicating with, and the other was a clan from Spain who agreed to the deal, but switched back at the last minute.

Still 38/40 is a 95% success rate. I've never understood Jr's issues with getting compliance, as I've never had an issue with it. Even in Jr2, I am the one who created the clan, so I was there for the first war, and our enemy was more than happy to comply. But seems it's has really gone downhill since I left. 

Of course, I cannot speak for all the clans, just for my own personal experience from being in 2.0, 2.5, the one war in Jr2, leading farm wars in my old clan ""Templar Knights"", and succesfully helping 2.4 and 2.6 get compliance from Korean clans.","1430438589"

"GrandTheftAutoV_PC","t5_3206b","It's specifically how often you are sitting up in the sky playing Clouds Simulator 2015 that kills it for me. If I accept an invite, and find out the heist is full, I am typically forced to find a new lobby and spend the next 30-60 seconds staring into the abyss. Why? Why can't I just jump back into the lobby I was originally in?

The only solution to playing this game with *any* form of expediency is to only play in invite-only sessions. If you want to do heists with your friends, just invite them to the session and when each mission is finished you just jump back together almost instantly. But to be quite honest, this is how the online should be from the start, not just for solo/invite only sessions.","1430438589"

Last night there were 3 people at freeweights, and 3 people on shoulder day. 

One guy asked me to share my 7kg DBs which was ok, because he was actually using them first, but also using an incline bench at the smith machine. In the end I used 8kgs because impatient.

Then later when I was using the other incline bench, halfway through my set this other guy non-verbally asked to use the bench, to which I indicated that I was still using it. He then ask ""can share?"". The other guy still had his stuff at the other incline bench. I said ""try lor"", but I kinda knew that I'd be rather inconvenienced by it because I don't take long breaks between sets.

Halfway through 2nd guy's first set, the first guy removed his stuff from other incline bench. So I went and got the other incline bench and used it.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I am glad that this group notices this.

When I see this article, I sigh because it sucks this guy or group may owe this much in taxes.  I feel sick.  It is organized theft from the government and no one is really pissed about it.  And it actually kind of goes to the absurdity of our progressive personal income tax system.  Pseudo percentage based tax system.


But there are a couple of big issues with taxes.

   *  First, everyone and even some dumb rich people advocate for ... higher taxes on the rich.    Why is this bad?  See my second point.
    * Second, where do taxes go?  They go to the biggest pyramid scheming, mega-corporation, trillion dollar budget, war machine that is our US government.     The US federal government and its reckless spending has reached astronomical heights with zero accountability.    It is kind of shocking and people want to tax more  and give the government more money.

Really, people just want to tax the rich.  That is the goal.  It doesn't matter where the money is going.  They want the rich to have less.  Which is a pretty dumb line of thinking.  Just because you tax the rich doesn't mean you automatically gain.  If you tax Soros 7 billion, doesn't mean you get 50k in your pocket.  It is really a dumb line of thinking and completely irrational.  I hate when people on the ""left"" advocate for higher taxes and don't really say why.  Some might get into the debt and social security costs and all of that, but my response to that is, well what about government spending?  Why don't we NOT spend 600 billion on defense?

All that to say, I don't get mad that people evade taxes.  We should all get pissed that the government machine will take parts of your wealth.  And we don't know what Soros and these rich guys will do with the money.  They were pretty successful, they will probably invest it in another successful firm or project.

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","&gt;In that case, why are there incursions?

I think it's because the gradual death of the multiverse via the murders of the Molecule Men is destabilizing reality.

&gt;And if Doom had been able to kill at least a thousand Molecule Men, shouldn't there be at least a thousand universes that survive?

Killing the Molecule Men doesn't save the universes I thought, I thought it killed everything in that universe

&gt;Steve says that Tony knew about it all from the beginning. How does he know this? How did Tony know?

I don't think it's that Tony knew about the origin of the incursions and all that, I thought it meant Tony knew that it was likely they would never be able to stop the incursions

&gt;And when the incursion is imminent, they're preparing for escape as if there was no hope of survival. But isn't it that between 616 and 1610, one of those universes will survive the last incursion?

I think they were basically just preparing for the worst.  After all, the one Earth they fought that actually put up a fight, they got their asses kicked until Dr. Strange went crazy (The Great Society)","1430438594"

The way you act, the vibe you have (that will be determined by how you think and emotuons you have in your body) the way the interactions are. How fun they are.  Is more of a bonus than your appearance. Also girls like a realy wide range of appearances. Some like pudgy tummies  more than abs. Some like clean shaven some like full beards some like long as beards or twisty tiled mustaches. a percentage of girls like most every appearance so don't reject yourself before she does. You and people may think you look average but you may be a 10, physically, in her eyes. You never know. 


But also don't worry about looks. It is  only one of many facets in girls attraction. If you have everything thigswafyolo420 said, and an awesome life style (once your older). You could blow someone who only has look going for him out of the watter.

Katya and Jaidynn have been genuinely friendly to everyone. But I don't think they put anyone else first. And with Jaidynn it seemed as if more people were bringing her up.

Fame was supportive of Katya and is really sweet. However I wouldn't say she was very congenial during the spoof challenge, mostly towards Pearl.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","+ Tx fees are part of Bitcoin as always, if you are willing to wait a few confirmations more then usual, you can even forego those, since many miners dont care and still process 0 fee transactions. I also see no reason why tx fees will rise anytime in the future, the opposite is the case with rising competition among miners.  
+ Regulation of Bitcoin will happen but only in the sense and scope that already covers all transactions in the legal economy of any jurisdiction. BTC is like digital cash. They can only force you to give up your BTC or transact according to their rules as long as you stay within their ""white"" economy. If you want to hide your BTC, buy stuff the government doesnt want you to or give money to people they dont like, there is nothing they can do to hinder you.   
+ Thats the beauty of Bitcoin: all transactions are visible but nobody knows to whom those txs belong, until you come out and tell them that they belong to you. I you want to stay anonymous, just use one of the many mixers or mixing protocols on top of Bitcoin to completely obfuscate your transactions and no 3 letter agancy can track your finances, as tried and failed by the FBI during the Silk Road 1 bust and their inability to track BTCs in Silk Roads tumbler.

The kid just sat there with a blank look on his face all day, every day. We're going over the human body and digestion one day and teacher decides to throw Danny an easy question out to boost him up a bit. She asks him how we get liquid into our bodies.  Danny sits there with a blank look and says ""I don't know"". She prompts him again by asking how he gets liquid into his body when he's thirsty. Danny replies, ""I don't know."" She is amazingly frustrated by this point and goes as far to ask ""Danny, how do you get water into your body when you're thirsty?"" and he replies, ""I don't know. Through your skin, maybe?""

She freaks out and loses her shit. He's sitting there looking dazed as always and Mrs. Teacher charges to the back of the room and grabs his arm. She pulls him out of his seat and drags him to the front of the classroom where there was a sink.  The water gets turned on and she shoves his arm into the stream and keeps yelling at him ""Through the skin?? THROUGH THE SKIN!?  How are you feeling now? Are you getting full? Are you getting enough water? YOU DRINK WATER WITH YOUR MOUTH!""

Not from experience.  They tend to have the exact system UKIP is supporting.  When I got my first French tax forms it's all in either French, French, or French.  You pay for other people to do that shit for you if you can't do it.

Somewhat even more bizarrely is the food packaging which generally has several languages on it, but they still often omit English despite it being the prevalent second language across Europe.

The exception is there was an English speaking notaire, but it's not a state sanctioned thing and there's no guarantee of it, rather one of their notaires happens to speak English too - but you have to be prepared to wait longer for an appointment.  No English speaking notaire, then you find somebody to accompany you.  The bank has an English speaking service, but again, the state isn't paying for it.

As far as the state is concerned they expect you to learn, and if you need help it's either you pay or you throw yourself at someone's mercy and hope they do you a solid.

We have the world's most popular second language, the language of international business, science, even airwaves, and an exported  culture that means it is everywhere.  There's no reason why we should be paying for translators.  And now with smartphone technology it's getting easier and easier still.

A council shouldn't be translating all its docs into 30 different languages running at 7 figure costs, and certainly not if it means that person is less likely to integrate into the wider community.","1430438606"

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","Couple things. First, ""E-commerce site"" says pretty much nothing. Amazon is an e-commerce site; so is etsy or ebay or NewEgg. They're vastly different, enterprise-grade challenges.

Second, $5k in the LA area is not that much money. You have to figure that ""Knows what they're doing"" *starts* about a $50 an hour and ideally goes for around double that. For agencies -the walls which talent is hidden behind- easily goes for 50%-100%+ *that* amount. A $5k budget won't even show up on their radar. 

The best way to save money, or to operate with a $5k budget, is to construct a ""fill in the blank"" website. This is the usual route of WordPress plus pick a theme which suits you then tweak and launch. Alternatively, of course, you could look for overseas talent at places like odesk. 

For what it's worth, I regularly talk to business owners in the LA area and technical talent is always the hardest to find. While a pile of resumes is just a craigslist ad away, finding business grade developers is another story, for which there are only a handful. 

I would recommend attending some of the numerous developer/designer gatherings which occur in the LA area and meeting them. You have to consider that developers in demand are choosy about their clients -they generally don't respond to craigslist- so it helps to shake hands in person and convince them you would be an awesome client.

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","In FE 9 more or less everyone is useable do to bexp and weapon forges. So you can go through the game and just use who ever you like with no problems. There is the big 5 though which is Marcia, Titania, Oscar, Jill and Kieran who are the best units in FE9 for the most part. I will say Zihark is pretty cool, but he isn't to great in the scheme of things in FE9. Worst unit though would probably be Rolf though if you don't count Bastian and Lucia.

Just use them to patch up the units your using or get some going. Though in FE9 people like saving all of them for the last chapter to make sure they get the transfers they want for RD. PoR isn't a hard game at all and you wont need to use them.

Yeah only 1 support between a pair per chapter. 

Depends. Statistically units will be stronger if they get to 20 unpromoted. Though promoting early isn't to bad in a lot of cases. Healers are staffed locked and have pretty terrible exp gains so they will level up slowly which makes 20 unpromoted take a long time. There is also the promo bonuses which can cover for the lost of a few levels in some cases. Also the move boost that units get is pretty great and may warrant an early promotion on that alone. But it is your playstyle and you can promote whenever you feel like it.","1430438607"

"chiliadmystery","t5_2yljs","Yeah, it looks like this is the root script that triggers all other scripts upon 100% completion.  What I can see is that the ambient_Ufos script gets loaded, which starts ambient zones get loaded two UFOs (assuming the fort one and the FIB camp one).  Those scripts show the UFOs, and do things like ensure that when you get close in a vehicle, a force is applied to push you away.  It also makes sure the special ""evil death ray"" audio (as they call it) gets played.

It also seems that this triggers UFO_EYE, which is the special script that has a conditional ambient zone for the 3rd UFO, the one above the mountain.  That has it's own script because it only triggers when you get close enough, and in the right conditions.

There is no ambient zone or script for the sunken UFO as it seems to be just a model and nothing more.

As for Scandrick, I'm probably the one taking the hardest line on him. I just don't agree with holding out when you have four years left on your contract.

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","Yeah, it comes with 10 of them in yellow. It also a cool synth because it teaches you to let go - did a patch, had fun with it, and then you reset everything to make something new. Because of this it actually encourages experimentation. 

Its inability to store patches is also its main drawback as it makes for a poor stage synth - you can only use it for one sound during your performance. Even though I've seen many big name artists use original ones on stage many people people ""grow out"" of them and move on to more advanced digital or digitally controlled synths. 

Here are some actually some cool tips for it, which also show additional capabilities of the thing: https://youtu.be/jglbXy2tN20?list=PL2Y43eupOAVWhx_1j_VdvpYArHulB0c7m

Here is an official Korg demo that shows that it also can sound smooth: https://youtu.be/fSnzCWA_JWI

Another thing to mention: You seem fairly new to this synth game. So I just wanted to point out that many times synths are being paired with reverb and delay, just like in the video you found. It gives them more body and spaciousness. If you'll find your synth sounding ""stale"" and you use an amp you can also get a Zoom MS-70CDR pedal which features decent emulations of many popular effects.

Just don't get fixed on effects pedals and shit. A proper synth can actually fake many of them. Or more like a good synth programmer can. Just focus on learning synthesis and you will achieve great results. Don't worry if you can get good or memorable sounds out of your synth at first - it will come with experience. And don't think you've reached the limits of the synth - there is always more.

PS: As an example of a latter statement, I got my hands on one of them Volca Keys synths and to me it seemed more like a toy - a very simple and limited synth. I thought: not much can be done with it. And then: https://youtu.be/0WpZZjy8MkU, https://youtu.be/__C4pICe83U and https://youtu.be/GYLRtWk9wgE.","1430438611"

"allthingsprotoss","t5_2tkqb","G1 - You don't scout the spire. You don't go up to *at least* 6 gates initially after expanding (7-10 if you're not teching at all; normally you'd go up to at least 6-8 if you're focusing on tech, or 8-10 if you're making a whole bunch of stalkers). You don't do a poke to force units upon seeing nothing but drones early on and your blink is very late because of opened stargate. Normally, I expand off of 3 gate + forge with 6-8 sentries when I do this build, no stargate. You can do a stargate opener, but the proxy makes it harder to defend against mutas too. You need to scout and have a response to mutas, be it phoenixes or a gateway attack with blink behind it.


G3 - You're trying to do a weird blink all in, expect... you're actually not doing an all in at all. That's too many gates if you're going to take a third. You should take quick third if you're not doing an all in and you just want to go blink sentry. What I do is go zealot, go up to 3 gates while making sentries nonstop, double gas at natural, forge, then move out once warp gate finished to take a third with a whole bunch of sentries and +1 attack behind it. You make a cannon, then add 3+ gates and a twillight council. You can go up to 7-10 gates if you want more blink stalkers, or stay on 6 gates and add a robo, then go up to 8 gates after you move out and then 10 gates later. Watch this vod if you want to see the build in more detail, I stole it from top pros like herO and Rain, but this is basically the same. http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/sc2-strategy/481008-french-pvz-guide


By the way, I think you need storm earlier against zerg. You're playing a turtle style with non late game units, which isn't that good. I recommend attacking more often to see if you can snipe their 4th and stuff, relying on force fields and recall to stay safe. Then constantly send hallucinated phoenixes and if you see roach hydra + hive tech, tech to storm asap imo.","1430438615"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Basically if they flick instantaneously and get a headshot, and *return* their aim to where they were originally, ya gots a hacker.

And I'm talking instantaneous. Like, they're aiming somewhere, flick immediately and lock onto to someone's head in 1 frame, shoot, and return their aim in the next frame. If a sniper takes even a measureable amount of time to flick onto target, they're probably legit, solely because most hacks aren't programmed with a delay between flicking and landing a headshot.

And the spectate system in TF2 is really weird. You'll see a sniper aim very obviously below or above someone's head, but they'll get a headshot. From my understanding, this is because the server doesn't show you exactly where people are aiming when scoped, but show you a rough approximation. 

Lag does come into play as well. If you see someone shoot where the target *used* to be, and they score a headshot, they're lagging a bit. (this is actually how people regularly headshot you around corners).","1430438615"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; Honestly, I have never heard any say it.

I believe you that you haven't heard it, although I have definitely heard it.  And among the general public this is said almost constantly.  If you're looking for me to go combing through 30+ years of various politicians' speeches and remarks, I'll just be honest: I'm not doing that for the sake of a random internet discussion.  If you think it's worth digging, be my guest. [**EDIT**: although see my comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/34ffo5/what_one_sentence_can_someone_say_to_make_you/cqulldd) for a couple of examples that I found without trouble.]  The point is that is that it's not as if people haven't heard this message.  That message is there.  MY point is that addressing these things you list, just by themselves, are not *enough*.  And it's far more complicated than ""don't have kids.""  Birth control is a pretty significant factor, and on that score it's not even as simple as ""don't have sex."" 

Maybe you've gotten the impression that liberals are a-okay with all those problems.  They're not, at all.  The difference is that (some) liberals recognize them as symptoms of broader issues.  And many of those broader issues are the result of long term policies which were put in place or are maintained out of racism.  That's the ""legacy"" people are always going on about.  So what's wrong with addressing those problems, too?  My concern here is that you seem to be saying those other things don't exist.
 
Now, our disagreement *should be* over how to address these systemic issues.  As a conservative, I'm sure you're against government programs that attempt to tackle poverty (and depending on the program, I might be too).  But I should think that you'd support means of ensuring more sensible sentencing, of reforming police departments whose behavior lead to eruptions like Baltimore and Ferguson and so on, etc.  ","1430438617"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","Despite what many think, the story of Civil War isn't about secret identities. Few key Marvel characters actually maintain a strict secret identity in the modern era. Many, like Cap, abandoned them years ago. The story *is* about the changing views of the audience, traditional superhero characters and stories versus modern tastes and sensibilities.

Prior to the Standford incident, superheroes were largely unofficially recognized by local, state, or federal government. Vigilantism is technically illegal, especially in a manner most superheroes (be they Marvel or DC) carry themselves. And they also commit crimes like assault, battery, and even criminal confinement.

We the audience and many people in the stories accept this as part of superheroics. Cops let the behavior slide because it is seen as a benefit to society. But the Stanford incident changed perception of this behavior in the Marvel U.

Tony understood the changing political climate and predicted that the populace would not tolerate traditional superheroics any longer. His support and leadership of the Registration Act was the logical evolution of heroes in this new world. It would allow heroes to do what they do best, but in an official capacity the people they claim to want to protect approve of. It was a necessary change that had to happen.

Cap, however, stood against it as a matter of personal rights and freedoms being attacked. That traditional ways were working just fine and one incident should not change this. His realization and surrender at the end of the story is rooted in how he finally realized that he was wrong. That he and his supporters were being rather selfish in their war.

Tony fought for change and the desires of the people. Cap and his team were fighting against change for their own selfish views and wants. The needs of the many versus the needs of the few.

Of course, the resulting infighting and chaos proved to be the end goal of the Skrull faction who wanted to weaken the bonds of the superhero community in order to successfully invade and conquer Earth. But this hardly changes the personal views of characters like Tony and Steve.","1430438617"

Why? Because if this situation were reversed - women CEOs being paid 68c on the dollar compared to their male counterparts, everybody would be yapping on about gender inequality and how it's still unfair that they get paid less. I'm baffled.

Edit: The point of this post was to show Reddit's dichotomy, I have no idea if the claim being made in the original article is any more valid or invalid than the reverse claim that women make 77c on the dollar.  It certainly seems that the sample size of women is much smaller (obviously due to the lack of female CEOs) which could mean that outliers are influencing the average more, but again, my point was to show how hypocritical the top comment was.","1430438617"

It's one of my favorite archetypes, though, simply because of how satisfying it is to spam Rank 8s and then use Number 62's effect to gain 200x all the Rank on board.

**So here is Episode 2 of Shitty MAL Reviews**!

**Review #1: [Mekakucity Actors](http://myanimelist.net/anime/21603/Mekakucity_Actors) (TV)**

&gt; Ah, Mekakucity Actors (or Kagerou Project). I will try my best not to spoil anything.
&gt; 
&gt; To be honest, it took me multiple tries to actually get past the first couple minutes of the first episode. From that I saw a cliche shut-in talking to his computer bug. But then I actually kept watching.
&gt; 
&gt; I struggled through the first five episodes. I found the characters unoriginal and boring. But then a certain side-story-flashback-thing occupied episode six and seven. I was like, ""Oh, it's that anime!"" And then episode eight happened. At first I was so, and I mean SOOOOOO, confused. But then I thought about it a bit, and it wasn't that confusing anymore.
&gt; 
&gt; **Story: 9**

&gt; The story gets a 9 because it was original-er than I expected, and I didn't have low expectations. The reason it didn't get a 10 is because it was so rushed and confusing.
&gt; 
&gt; **Art: 9**

&gt; The art also deserves a 10, but the reason it didn't get it was because it's kind of a particular art style. It's like, you like it or you hate it.
&gt; 
&gt; **Sound: 10**

&gt; The music was awesome. The voice actors were impressive. (Marry's scream at the end!)
&gt; 
&gt; **Character: 10**

&gt; While in the beginning the characters seemed stereotypical and boring, by the last episode, I was impressed with the amount of development each one's personality had.
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I did really enjoy this anime.
&gt; 
&gt;Sayonara,

**Review #2: [Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei](http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei) (TV)**



&gt; its just a bull shit
&gt; the whole anime (dropped at ep 15)
&gt; 
&gt; **plot 210**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 1.the mc - bla bla bla iam weak iam weak cause i cant move a wooden block!
&gt; its doesnt even matter that i can cancle people magic(without super tec like every normal ""magician""), can fly (no one can),

&gt; 2.the mc is the best enginer in the world (heard about something that cannot figure out how to do in 20 years, makes it possible in half a day)

&gt; 3.to obvius that he would always win they didnt even try to make the battle looks like he have no chance (not like u have some battles most of the anime its usless talk)

&gt; 4.80% of the episods they just explain u wats happend but no one rly care about it its just to booring honestly (i watched (Zetsuen no Tempest) and this anime is perfect and its have a conversation about 3 episodes in a row,but Zetsuen no Tempest have an idea of something real u can imagining it by ur self u ur self can think about it and say its rly are a nice idea but...).
&gt; in this magic anime the whole idea is a shit and they every f*cking episode trying to explain u wats happened he used magic left then down and he knokout him like that then some imaginary magic power interfere with some electricity vibrathion and he got knok out the whole anime and always the same
&gt; the mc heard about flying magic (they said all the sienciest in the world trying to figure it out for years)
&gt; he goes home make some shit and in the evening he can fly GG plot best plot ever
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **characters 210**
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; u the main characters is the super boy and his sister
&gt; the story foces only them to show us how perfect they are as long as i saw till ep 15 u got nothing new about them u just can see more and more how much they are good and perfect and every one else suck...
&gt; the other characters side are just noisence u also didnt rly get their story and they are relevent only to show as the differences between the mc and their power the mc always win agains them he always the best in every way...
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; **music 810**
&gt; 
&gt; i dont rly care about the sound so that just fine
&gt; 
&gt; **animation 810**
&gt; 
&gt; the animation style is also normal
&gt; nothing special
&gt; 
&gt; **enjoyment 310**
&gt; 
&gt; honestly i just make my self watch it
&gt; 
&gt; **total 310**
&gt; 
&gt; so if u wanna anime that only talk 90% then the mc make some ""magic"" and win in instant go a head its for u... the only reason i didnt droped that earlier is cause i tough maybe it would go better but i tought so on ep 4 then in 10 and i got sick of it and dropped it at ep 15
&gt; 
&gt; btw why is that tag as romance as long as i saw ep 15 i onlly saw sister complex with her brother if that a romance so oh shit nigga wtf?

I'm going to assume you've never seen any of their discussions with Milo Yiannopolous (sp?) or the GG guy who wanted to sue Blockbot? Both of those, by the way, directly contradict your assertion. So does the blog post that they wrote about GG - https://popehat.com/2014/10/26/ten-short-rants-about-gamergate/

The really funny part of this is that you argue just like a Gamergater- or a Republican yelling about Benghazi.

"HyruleWarriors","t5_30t9v","Amiibos are physical figurines that you can [buy from retail stores](https://www.nintendo.com/amiibo).

On the title screen of Hyrule Warriors, you can place an Amiibo on the bottom-left corner of your Wii U Game Pad to receive a free gift. You can scan up to 5 Amiibos per day.

* Link Amiibo / Toon Link Amiibo: Unlocks Link’s Spinner weapon. Subsequent uses will give you a Link weapon with 3+ stars.
* Zelda Amiibo: Gives you a Zelda weapon with 3+ stars.
* Sheik Amiibo: Gives you a Sheik weapon with 3+ stars.
* Ganondorf Amiibo: Unknown as of this date, but presumably, it should give you a Ganondorf weapon with 3+ stars.
* Other Amiibos: Gives you Rupees, Materials, or a random weapon.

Normally, the Zelda-related Amiibos will grant you a rank 3 weapon for that specific character. However, Amiibos cannot grant you weapons you have not unlocked. For example, if you have a Sheik Amiibo, and you’ve only unlocked Sheik’s rank 2 weapon (Typhoon Harp), you will only receive Typhoon Harps from your Sheik Amiibo. You must unlock Sheik’s rank 3 weapon (Triforce Harp) from the Adventure Map before your Sheik Amiibo can give you Triforce Harps.

And if you haven’t unlocked Zelda, Sheik, or Ganondorf as characters, their corresponding Amiibos will give you a random prize as if they were a normal Amiibo.

You receive an ingame Medal for scanning 100 Amiibos called the Amiibo Warriors Medal.","1430438619"

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","I drive an R53 MINI Cooper S that I bought when it was 9 years old, well maintained, low mileage, paid cash. Not entirely the most economical decision as they have middle of the road reliability and middle of the road fuel economy, but as a car enthusiast it would pain me to drive something like a Honda Fit. The MINI represents a nice balance between driver's car and economy car considering the supercharger, brilliant steering feel, racing competitiveness, and passable fuel efficiency. I also work on my own car and like to tinker, so the car is relatively cheap to maintain and relatively cheap to modify for a bit more power. In the end, I couldn't be happier even though I spent a few extra bucks, but recognize that this was a worthwhile trade off for me whereas it may not have been for others with different skill sets and interests.

That said, I have always driven enthusiast cars bought used that were well maintained. I usually drive them for a year or so and then sell them. I typically break even on the sale price and generally spend very little money on depreciation for this reason. This has worked pretty well for me, but I admittedly have a little bit of an eye for these things.","1430438620"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","If you have a Microcenter nearby, you can get a $40 discount on a mobo if you buy a 4690K at the same time.  The MSI Z97 PC Mate is a great choice for single GPU (the 4x second slot will do Crossfire, it's not ideal, but it cannot do SLI) - very good capability for the price, particularly after the $40 off.  That would shave $60 off your build.

I'd also consider a cheap liquid cooler instead of a fan unit - you can pick up 120mm/140mm units for around $40 AR fairly frequently.  If you're not overclocking and want to save, the stock cooler will probably be fine, if you're overclocking it might be nice to move up.","1430438624"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Well according to [this polling data](http://www.gallup.com/poll/164618/desire-children-norm.aspx), the desire to have kids hasn't changed all that much in recent years.  I'd wager most people's anecdotal experience skews their perception of how many people wanted kids from their youth.

Remember, when you (or anyone) was growing up, you were almost wholly surrounded by people who wanted to be surrounded by kids.  You didn't see many of the people that didn't want kids because they did not want to be around you.  That can create a false perception that a disproportionate amount of people want to have kids eventually.

When you reach adulthood, you see all the people that don't want kids because they aren't actively avoiding you anymore.  That could account for some of the perceived change.

I have a stuffed animal that I talk to. In a way, this stuffed animal has always been a surrogate parent. It's one of the few things I've always had from my childhood. This animal I think, embodies the things that I never had. I also sometimes go into character in games with characters that represent the ways I've suffered. Either they have no parents, or abusive parents, or they have some kind of physical scars to represent the abuse they suffered at the hands of their guardians, or their only friend is an animal or they talk to animals better than people. Since one of my main problems is eye-related (from the fact I never had eye surgery as a child because my parents are so cheap - its called amplyopia and stigmatism as well as I have a lot of floaters from the stress- imagine lots of different sized grains always floating in front of your vision) one of my characters is half-blind...it sort of helps me embody it I think.

I should add that they may want to throw a shower once baby is born to meet your little person since you're a decent distance away. Maybe slide it into casual conversation that

Most asphalt roads don't have concrete underneath, BOC (Bituminous over concrete) is actually kinda rare, and nearly always a retrofit to an in place concrete road in need to work, as it is far cheaper than a full reconstruct or concrete overlay.  Decisions on pavement structure are actually super complicated.  Anyway the base of most roadways is aggregate, aggregate is actuality a really strong material in thick enough layers.  

Another repair that can be used is mud jacking.  A hole is drilled through the pavement down to the cavity under the pavement.  Grout is pumped into the voids repairing the structure.  The pavement can then be patched and a overlay to improve the ride.  

Pavement repair in general is actually pretty complicated and constantly evolving field.  

Pavements are not really my field, but I studied it enough in school and work with pavement engineers (I deal with getting the cars arround on the pavement), so I've picked up a few things.  ","1430438631"

I don't take the time often, but when I do it's well worth it.  I have heard good things about coconut oil for hair but have never tried it myself.  

I have heard of hair texture changing as you age, but going from straight to curly must be a huge adjustment.  My sister's is doing that a bit; she's gone from straight to increasing waviness in the past 3 or 4 years (she's 35 now) even though she's let it get longer and longer.

Tell that to [Rutherford and his famous gold foil experiment.](http://www.markaerialwaller.com/images/fixed/RUTHERFORD_0002.jpg)  Literally on a tabletop.

Tell that to Thomas Young, [who conducted the experiment now known as the double-slit experiment.](http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/302l/lectures/node151.html)  Here's an interesting sentence from that website: 
&gt;It is interesting to note that **when Young first presented his findings to the Royal Society of London he was ridiculed**. His work only achieved widespread acceptance when it was confirmed, and greatly extended, by the French physicists Augustin Fresnel and Francois Argo in the 1820s.

It is not guilt tripping or taking for granted to be our obligation. That's only if we want to interpret it that way.

The point is to realize that we are all small players under a bigger power. Even if we have beef with each other, it will be against our interests to not align and at least provide some minimal support. Normal rules of reciprocating revenge does make sense here. Normally, when someone is bad towards us, we will be bad towards them. But that's only for a game with equal players. Now is a game with skewed players, so the reciprocating revenge rules should be suspended or applied less.

Even if it doesn't instantaneously benefit us, an unexpected support will benefit us more because it won't cost us anything, it will generate positive value for someone else who have some set of interests aligned with us, so that we might get a return somewhere down the line. With more of these exchange, we might establish a symbiotic group relationship that will make us both stronger and equalize the game for us.","1430438638"

&gt;in all of the stupid news video, you don't see any penetration, just the implication of penetration, so there is more evidence to it not being rape.

More broadly, talking about averages with a set like salaries is only useful at the collective level, and largely meaningless at the level of individuals.

Try this on: The average salary in MLS is higher than the J-League, but the average J-league player earns more than the average MLS player.

Can that be true?

Yes, and I think it actually *is* true. DPs in MLS skew the average up, so while the average in MLS might be higher than the J-League, the median in the J-League might be higher than MLS.

Is a statement, you probably disagree.

In a debate it'd be my job to convince you. By stating my opinion I am not convincing you unless you share my perspective, as stated I didn't share it. I wanted his sources which allowed him to come to his conclusion so I can re-evaluate myself.

The danger of having to do your own research based on the opinions of others is your own inherent bias effecting how you respond to it. The evidence which convinced them should help convince or at the very least self-question.

Another danger is my opinion, a part of me, something which Google knows about so if the thing is up for debate I will receive sources I WANT, not the sources I should find.

And finally, the reason I prefer getting a source is the additional depth. We have opinions on facts, regardless of their absoluteness we all have different opinions many of which are far too long on complex to type out, by posting the sources and further reading if a replier is truly interested in debate they can see my expanded viewpoint easily with a well researched backing to better explain why I feel this way.

For example.

I believe 9/11 was an inside job.

Now firstly, if you Googled that you'd get a miriad of different websites claiming different things with different sources and more importantly a casm of differing definitions of inside job and to the extent and level. Now you could find backing up, but you're opinion wouldn't change because of the variety and your own personal bias which already knows such a thing exsists.

Now if I where to state my opinion in-depth with facts and sources backing up that exact position you'd get a better picture of my perspective allowing you to participate in a debate in which we can convey our own conclusions and the underlying evidence behind them. Hopefully with one of us changing their perspective.

If you did your own personal research you'd find plenty of sources but highly doubt you'd come to the same conclusion and certainly wouldn't change your perspective.

SO I want you to discredit my first statement about Britain rebuilding an empire. You can't provide your source and you must research mine.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","OK..sry I have to make my reply quick because I have company coming.

**1st point: I agree. MLS players are not valued a high as others and the global market reflects that. What I took from the Twitter post was less about global market value, and more about how much money a team was willing/allowed to invest in players.
**
That's really what drives the global market too right? As Barca, Real Madrid, Man U, Bayern, etc. battle it out for a GREAT player, his price will rise. 

So if a MLS team was willing/allowed to invest more money into its players, they could have more players with a higher perceived value (like what if the All-Star team was a team). The hope being that this would improve their overall quality and depth. 

**Tangent**: I'm not against this, I do worry that it would unbalance the teams and make the league less enjoyable overall, but that's just based on my personal viewing preference. But it would help in some of these international competitions...

**2nd point**: Yes. Higher salaries like those of CEOs and DPs will always naturally skew a figure higher when talking about Averages and it should always be questioned when someone presents you with such a figure. ","1430438644"

If you take it out of the *gay marriage* context, I think you will understand and maybe even appreciate Catholic sentiment.  As an example, the Parliament of England by [Act of Supremacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Supremacy) declared Henry VIII head of the Church of England.  I think most people probably already know the story, and how it was just a ploy to allow Henry to annul his marriage with Catherine so he could marry Anne Boleyn.  *Saint* Thomas More was canonized (at least partly) because he would not take the Oath of Supremacy, believing Parliament had no jurisdiction over issues which were God's alone.  More said,  ""no temporal man may be the head of the spirituality."" He was beheaded.  The significance is that secular authority has no power over spiritual authority.","1430438650"

Sadly, living at home doesn't free me from socially conservative parents. Since I rather they not find out while I am living with them (and before I am financially stable), I was leaning more towards just doing the therapy part where we talk to someone so we could get that letter of recommendation for the hormones. Plus, I am part time so not much money coming in when I am hoping to go back to school this year or next. 

As with above, hair removal treatment will have to wait until I am able to move out.

Already neck deep in an female-identified online personality - haven't been male at all online unless I need to be - mainly for online courses I paid for. Strangely, I don't remember being treated like shit; although I rarely speak and mostly go solo in MMOs.

My voice, as we talked about in the smaller response, I will have to work on. I am still looking for a style - mainly because I dunno what would be in the middle of princess and tomboy.

Lastly, I love the analogy you made! I originally thought the girl I am was already out, but to go along with your analogy she was probably  just half way down the tower.

Thank you for the luck! \^^

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","&gt; how is it that the German car manufacturers there have been so slow to go electric?

They probably know the German market.

My first guess is the population density in Germany compared to the US. It's 226 per km² or 583 per square mile in contrast to 34.2 per km² (88.6 per square mile) in the US. As a consequence, most people live in urban environments, ie. flats. It's hard to put solar on your roof when you don't own the roof. Charging at home becomes a problem when your car has no fixed parking space.

My second guess is the vacation culture. Our annual vacations are kind of a big deal here where tons of people drive down to Italy, or Spain in the summer. Many of them use their own car. This is important for them, so range anxiety might be higher than in the US.

My third guess is an established car nut culture. There was once a test of car dealers with researchers pretending to be potential buyers asking for hybrids or electric cars. In the better cases, the sales men were ignorant. In the worst cases, they spread lies and falsehoods. Also, journalists in established magazine like Auto Motor Sport are sometimes skeptical about electric cars, to put it mildly.

Finally, from my personal point of view, the Model S may look awesome from the outside, but the interior is a bit too much like a US car, and these do not have have a very good reputation here.

So, hybrids are currently a better bet for car makers. ","1430438651"

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","It's not a strawman at all, you just don't seem to have actually thought out where your line of reasoning can lead or how it's related. You can claim there's 'obviously a difference' all you want, you are still using the same line of reasoning to completely invalidate what someone has to say based on some arbitrary checklist. The only kind of person who really doesn't need a say in this is someone who doesn't play games. This is a gaming-only problem. They can have a say if they want but it's going to be completely uninformed (unless they inexplicably read gaming sites/magazines despite not playing games). Anyone who plays games though should have every bit the same chance as anyone else in gaming to have their opinion judged by its merits and not because they don't meet arbitrary standards of being a 'modding community member'. 

Edit: I should clarify, I'm not saying being someone who plays games means you will undoubtedly be informed of the situation but at least concerns about it would be valid compared to concerns from someone who has absolutely zero stake in it because they don't play games and the situation is not posed to present any change to any systems outside of games.

&gt; Or things like ""mods always have been free and should be free!"" which is likely because they themselves don't want to pay for them. 

Which is a valid opinion. The fact that you're treating it like it's not is pretty disturbing. Almost as disturbing as implying that not rating or donating makes them 'not part of the community'. 

&gt;As for Valve's reasoning for pursuing this possibility, neither you nor I know that, and to credit it to the dude that clicked the ""download"" link on a couple pages on Nexus Mods seems overly generous in my opinion.

Economics 101. If it didn't look like a viable and highly profitable venture then a company like Valve wouldn't be touching it. Seeing the number of downloads and attaching a dollar sign to it is the catalyst for things like paid mods happening. You think their exorbitantly high cut was just to cover server and hosting costs? Hell no, they saw great potential for profit because modding is a populous and thriving community. ","1430438652"

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","&gt; Meanwhile the young kids going to school are learning a million and a half ProTools shortcuts only to google their idols online and find they mix everything on tape because it ""sounds better"".  
  
Can confirm. Currently working on PT certifications at school. I feel like I'm paying a shit load of money just to learn stupid key commands.

That being said, I'm in the minority of people at my school who are digital fans. Everyone gets all googley eyes over the tape machines and old analog gear.  
  
&gt;""There's no fucking difference between your LA-2 and a plugin. Engineers have modeled WAY more complicated shit than that. Get over yourself""  
  
This pleases me to no end. I have no problem saying it. The teachers at my school were confused and shocked when I told them I refuse to do my projects on an MTR-90 when I can use a PT-HD rig. I know how to use a tape machine, cool...I will probably NEVER use one in the real world, especially considering all the studios I've seen here use ProTools, so I need to practice with what I'm going to use.   
I've never understood the old school analog hype (vinyl included).

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I'm not sure whether morality plots nicely along a continuum, i'd say it's very complicated. Even if you reject intention and only consider outcomes.
I think what you mean is that the amount of suffering could be plotted along a continuum, but this gets quite complicated as we all can struggle at times when deciding which harm is worse than others.
Took me a while to understand your last sentence. You're saying that not only should [we] make the choice to eat the best thing possible at present, but we can also seek the best.
Yep that's fair, I didn't mean to imply that your framework didn't support constant improvement, I only meant to point out that it's unlikely in this economy (dominated by capitalism) that say grain production will ever evolve to be farmed veganically if we stop eating it all together and get our calories form say honey (ignore the details of the simplification).

But I think my point still stands that under your framework you are obliged to find and locate the best minimal set (can include variety as long as they are of the same level) of nutritionally complete calorie sources and only consume that.

Doesn't really seem that practical as each local[e] will have a different set depending on which crops they can grow etc. There will also be differing opinions about what's healthy.
That's why veganism isn't just a philosophy, political statement, but also comes with guidelines to make it easy to follow practically.
We simply can't have a cohesive baseline under your framework, imagine how much dissent there would be at a potluck. :P","1430438657"

"ReefTank","t5_2smmh","I got this sump as part of a good deal for a few tanks and stands from a friend who couldn't keep them anymore.  

It has got a small protein skimmer (big enough for my tank) built in.  I'm torn between setting up a 37g reef using this sump tank (If I can ever find a replacement tank that fits this stand…) and just getting one of the 29g biocubes where everything is contained in the back of the tank.

Obviously the biocube sounds a lot easier, but I don't mind some extra work.  Hell, I already own the sump tank, so I'd really like to use it because I know they aren't exactly cheap and I don't want to waste it.  Of course I could just save it for when I have room for a bigger tank...  

My options for my first reef tank are pretty much the following:

1) buy new glass, a pump, bio media, and plumbing for the sump.  (I'd love a bigger tank but a 29-40g would be about all I can fit in my apartment.)

or

2) just go for the 29g biocube where all of the filtration is built in.

It will cost close to the same to go either way.  I just can't decide if it's worth trying to make what I already have work or just doing with something entirely different.

I'll admit I'm very new to saltwater and reef keeping.  I've always been a freshwater guy.  Will i significantly benefit from using the sump in my setup if I'm willing to put in the work to make sure everything is proper?","1430438658"

Sure, you can get away with less, but it's not safe if there's a significant difference in wear.

As for where, I always get my tires from Discount Tire. They have a good selection, can get others they don't have in stock, and you can get a final price without any surprise add ons. In my area, they have four tires in stock that size, one of the brands being a Kumho for $50 each.","1430438659"

"awakened","t5_2ubdb","&gt; On the other hand I would like to point out an aspect about this story and its relation to time. Does it have to refer to the state of beings way back then?

Joseph Campbell exposed me to this very idea: that the Garden exists not *out there* in some past geographical location, but within each and everyone of us. And though the Bible narrative tells us we are forever expelled, I believe this is a test, and if we can overcome the fear of losing these meaningless labels, we can return to the Garden anytime and experience a state of pure Being. This is what being present is all about. The Power of Now is there for all of us to grasp, at will, if only with a little practice :)

And your point about children is spot on. I have two of my own and watching them grow and develop has really helped me understand some fundamentals. For instance, the illusion of time. My oldest is five and if I tell her to wait fifteen minutes, she just barely understands what that means. Every two minutes she asks me, ""Is it time yet?"" Time--or clock time, at least--is learned. Which means it doesn't ""exist"" in any meaningful way. Same with all these labels! My youngest pulls hair, hits, pinches, and laughs her little face off. She isn't concerned with ""right"" or ""wrong,"" she's simply testing out cause and effect. 

&gt; We put this grid over nature, and then we label each square so that we can tell ourselves that we know something about it.

I still think there is a purpose and need for this. The problem arises when we forget that the grid isn't real, just a tool for navigating and manipulating Reality. They are useful but not necessary, and they certainly aren't rigid or concrete. Even so, there are patterns in the dance of matter and energy, of ever-shifting forms, and we have the ability to pick out these patterns, analyze and learn from them, and in this the human animal--however you define it--is unique.

I'm 15 years old, I try to collect amiibo as best as I can, I'm not a NiB collector as I like to spend time with my little brother training (Note: Smash is the only game we play) them with my little brother up to level 50 and put them on our own amiibo tournaments. It's a hobby we both share. Sadly, because of Nintendo and it's attitude for Amiibo, I nor my brother are able to get amiibo we most want, Ike being one that my brothers want and Shulk the one I want (My dick friend bought a $30 Shulk from Amazon fully knowing that I wanted him and couldn't get him, he gloated about it for a week and is now gloating about his greninja). All the amiibo I have I bought with my own money (I used to work in a pizzaria shop because my father was good friends with the owner but they recently closed so I dont have a job anymore) I got extremely lucky with my unicorns (they were hidden behind some skylanders in Walmart), my parents are Mexican so they don't give a damn about my obsession with amiibo, heck they don't care about my hobbies, they also will NOT buy me anything that is video game related, I had to save up for everything(me and my sister together saved up for a Wii U). I was lucky with Captain Falcon, he was super cheap ($15) on Amazon and I bought him without my dad's permission. He got pissed but not too pissed. Either way, I just spent my last 60 dollars on wave 4 for me and my brother, didn't have enough for Charizard or Wario that was money I saved up for splatoon but both me and my brother wanted the new wave. Again, my chances of winning is slim but in the rare case you pick me, my brother would like the Ike and give the WFT to someone who really wants it. Again I really appreciate you for doing this giveaway, it always gives me a bit of hope in my heart.

&gt;I add another channel which is just the score, adding more power to the sound. This replicates the IMAX mix, the way Nolan wanted. The score overpowers some of the dialogue though, so I say proceed with caution if you like the script. 

I saw the movie in a true IMAX experience at the Henry Ford in Michigan. I couldn't understand half the dialogue and it really bothered me. For example when TARS makes his first joke during launch. Some of the theater laughed and I thought I missed something. This happened a lot during loud portions of the movie. I bought the Bluray and on my sound bar I heard so much great dialogue. A lot of other people told me the same so  thought maybe my theater screwed up the sound levels somehow. Now I read your post. 

Why would Nolan want me to see it in the theater, but not hear the dialogue?

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","The same reason why people aren't overreacting to Mariota's 2 INTs. I guess teams think each QB's performances were all about the kind of system they were in.

We saw Foles run a similar system as Mariota/Oregon in the NFL and finish with only 2 INTs one season, but the next season his INT count was much higher. Teams know that if they run a spread system similar to what Mariota was in, they probably aren't going to see his insane TD-INT ratio because NFL defenses have rapidly evolved.

Now take a look at Winston. Teams know what to expect from him because he was in a true pro system, and he finished with 25 TDs to 18 INTs. Which means teams are probably expecting roughly the same kind of performance in his rookie NFL season. If he does have 25-18 again, that would put him in a very similar range as the rookie seasons of Luck, Wilson, and Dalton - all three of which led their teams to playoff appearances.","1430438662"

Also, kind of disappointed with how Quicksilver was outed. Bit lame.

Besides these two things I quite enjoyed it, though I think it's inferior to the first.

Oh, also why the fuck was Stellan Skarsgard even in the film? I feel like they cut out a few scenes.

From your post, it sounds like you are thinking about this relationship as a potential permanent partnership rather than as something more casual/just for fun. The scary thing about that is that means you're a ways away from your goal in the relationship--a long-term commitment. If it doesn't feel like you're progressing toward that goal, that can make you question the relationship. Your relationship might seem stagnant right now. It sounds like the two of you have reached a point where you are very emotionally intimate, so that part of your relationship isn't developing much over time anymore. Because you're in an open-ended LDR, your relationship also isn't developing much physically or in terms of practical commitments (""after I finish school, we'll move together to city X,"" etc.).

Do you think that is what the problem is, or am I way off base? (Be honest.)","1430438665"

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","I believe one prominent reason that horror movies tend to be ""bad"" is that it's difficult to get characters into the desired scary situations in a believable way. 


I think horror, moreso than most other genres, is subject to more intense scrutiny in terms of the audiences willingness to suspend disbelief.  ""Cops wouldn't do that,"" ""I wouldn't do that,"" ""yeah going alone is a great idea,"" and other thoughts like these are common reactions to typical horror flicks because writers have to come up with ways of getting people into strange circumstances. 


That, and the fact that they have a more easily achievable albeit ""cheap"" way of giving audiences the indented thrills. You can't get tears without some serious emotional connection to the story, but you can ""scare"" the shit out of someone at ANY time with fast cuts and loud noises.

Get a bike with heated grips. Be prepared to buy both winter and summer gear. Wear your gear at all times, no exceptions. If you don't have your M1 license already, take the MSF course. As for a bike, I can't recommend a Honda NC700x enough. It was designed from the ground up for commuting. You can never get comfortable/complacent on a bike.

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","&gt; Your response to my point that Christianity has done good things as well as bad things was the point out bad things Christianity has done.  In other words, you just repeated the same argument again without addressing my criticism.

The fact that Christianity has done good as well as bad is of little relevance here. This particular law is an example of one of the bad things Christianity has done because it is a transparent attempt to make it as difficult as possible for a woman to exercise her right to bodily autonomy. 

&gt; You suggest that Satanism is a sincere religion.  You might have a point here, though I doubt their very specific alleged belief that waiting periods are against their region for abortions is sincere.

I assure you the members are very sincere. The third tenet of The Satanic Temple is ""One's body is inviolable, subject to one's own will alone"". This is taken very seriously. When the state imposes completely unnecessary obstacles to obtaining a legal abortion for the sole purpose of discouraging the free exercise of that right, with no other basis than the personal beliefs of the Christian majority in the state, it is a gross violation of her religious belief of the inviolability of her bodily autonomy. The Satanic Temple is not a stunt, it is not a vehicle for shock value, it is not a mockery of religion like some other organizations are. It is a religion with principles that are held dear by its members. ","1430438674"

&gt;Minor point, but what you've just described is a very extreme situation. Trans people that 'sensitive' are definitely in the minority. 

Really?  It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.  It's not some cosmetic thing, they're doing it to make the pain go away because they've determined that the pain comes from not looking and dressing a certain way.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","Unfortunately, all of my friends who play Smash either have the 3ds version or don't play competitively. Or both. So I have to resort to online, but even then, I can't find one. It won't make anything different, I already KNOW what I have to work on and idk why people keep telling me to watch for what I should work on. I'd LOVE to get better at my neutral game with spot dodges or whatever needs to be done, but time doesn't work for me. At all. 

I'll give you an example. Before Smash 4, I never shielded. Like, ever. I just rolled. However, someone told me that shielding is a good option for defense, and so I just did so all the time because it was a press of a button. However, this now leads me to a shielding habit and I get grabbed a lot(I'm also not good at perfect shielding because that requires reaction time and I'm not very good at that). So now I have to learn to spot dodge correctly. 

I already know about observing opponent habits but the problem is this: characters with options. Like legit I don't know what to do against Falcon because he can dash grab, dash attack, shff Nair, shff dair, feint side b, or empty hop grab. Its ridiculously hard and right now I'm stuck gambling that I can make the right decision.","1430438679"

He wasn't had his moments his rookie season but wasn't that great. Celtics fans can only hope for a scenario where Danny cashes in on his chips and do a complete turn around (like 2007). Maybe that's why we get excited when our team is in this mediocrity state where we have lots of assets as well as young promising players. I personally think our contending team will only have smart and thomas (as a role player off the bench). Everyone else is a trade chip with those picks. 

Also, you guys have a really exciting team. I really wish we could get Noel though haha. It would be awesome to get a hometown guy playing for boston. The people here would love him. Embiid could be a beast of a two way player if he stays healthy","1430438679"

Sometimes it's almost like Bale is punished for being so much better an athlete than most that people forget that even speed and strength aside he has freakish natural ability. Not as good in tight spaces as Hazard or at close control dribbling as Neymar 

But combine that with the fact that he's 80% (to pick an arbitrary figure) as good as them at those aspects of play (which is still better than the vast majority of players) and add in his freakish athletic ability and he can be just as if not much more effective, dangerous and useful when in good form.

Art is the reason everyone assumes hell is on fire, heaven is in the clouds, angels are people with white eagle wings, god has a long white beard, adam and eve ate an apple, etc. Sometimes common depictions just sort of get in the way of things.

Is it a teacher position?  Again so few early childhood educators are men that it's highly probable to get an all female staff.  You shouldn't take this job because of the pedo-hystiria, not the sexism of the admin.

Her comments in isolation are meaningless.  The simple fact of all female staff is not.  You don't get all female staffs outside of nursing and child care with out significant amounts of sexism.

"rupaulsdragrace","t5_2t3or","Urgh... it's hard for me, because I am wondering if my vote for Miss Fame may be my inner-stan influencing the vote. 

On one side, Miss Fame was supportive through Katya's struggles, got Violet out of her shell in episode 5, was very kind and complimentary about other contestants... never lowered herself to rudeness and never meant harm.

On the other hand, Max and Jaidynn were absolute *sweethearts* as well!

I think if I included stuff outside the season, I'd throw my vote with Miss Fame. If I restricted myself to things only said on the season itself, it would be either Max (for building people up) or Jaidynn (for being forever friendly).

Katya also... but the only thing that makes me a *lil* bit hesitant with Katya is that she does tend to kiki with bitchiness and does sometimes come across a bit as Ginger Minj's background vocalist when she's being cunty.","1430438695"

"skyrimdadjokes","t5_31ugn","*Here's the Urban Dictionary definition of* [***tsundere***](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tsundere) : 

---

&gt;Tsundere is a slang born on the Internet, and it is a word to describe the nature of female anime or game characters. Tsundere is a word combining two words, ""Tsun Tsun"" and ""Dere Dere"". Both terms describe attitudes of a person. ""Tsun Tsun"" is used for cold/blunt/curt attitude, while ""Dere Dere"" is used when a person becomes [spoony](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=spoony) in front of his/her lover.

&gt;(Definition is from the game "" Tsuyokisu Cool×Sweet "")


---

_Therefore, ""Tsundere"" is a female character who is usually cold, but she becomes spoony on her lover. Or, she is cold to the main character at first, but she becomes lovestruck later._

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","While it depends on the world you are playing, from what I understand in Golarion necromancy pulls souls out of Phrarasma's boneyard before they can be judged. When an undead dies, its soul is destroyed.

The problem is the lesser god Groetus who hangs out above the boneyard. When the last soul is judged, Groetus descends on the boneyard which starts the end times. Pharasma keeps away Groetus by feeding him the souls of atheists. 

So every time you raise the dead you bring the world one step closer to a permanent end. That is why creating undead is evil. 

In general resurrection spells bring the soul back to life and usually is treated as it wasn't the soul's time yet. A resurrected character's soul still goes to the boneyard when it dies.

There are such things as non-undead necromancy. Essentially necromancy spells that don't deal with creating undead deal with the forces of life and death. Stuff like blindness/deafness, bestow curse and disrupt undead are under necromancy. Usually necromancy involves negative energy as well and as long as you aren't using it to heal the undead I don't see a problem with it.

Kind of like how people always say ""there are stress cards in Basic"", you must have had it so easy with that stress card"". When we NEVER had stress cards. Maybe they tried it out for a limited time, but beyond that, they don't even have stress cards.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Now this was a recurring dream I had when I was. It usually happens about once a year, and for the life of me can't really explain why but I'll do my best.

I start out in what seems to be the Amazon, like the trees and rivers. But they are Islands similar to the floating ones in Avatar. (I was having these dreams before the films but they are the closest thing visually) .Except the river is very straight, canal like. I'm floating down it as it gets faster and faster. I'm joined but random people I can't recognise, but they are floating down with me. There is no visible floating device. The river is straight but the trees and vines turn around me. Soon this ride takes me off the edge into the longest drop I ever seen. Its an almost perfect circle down, I can see other straight rivers entering from the sides. I fall down, I keep falling for a while. Then fade I to black, when I wake up, I'm wet and I'm down a street. The but there is only 3 houses I see, I'm encapsulated in a box, the blue walls go all around with room to spare. I get out of the gutter and walk to the first house in front of me. I peer through the window. There is a family inside, all happy, like Christmas dinner time. But not, one of the older children turn to look at the window and they see me. She screams, the while family looks over and they start panicking. I get worried and jump back, looking around. There is a mirror just floating between the house. I stand in front of it and look. I can't describe what I see, but it brings me to tears instantly. I cry desperately to this mirror, sobbing into my limbs (sometimes hands, othertimes tentacles, once wood). I sit down on the curb outside these 3 houses still crying where the youngest child comes over to me and puts a hand on my shoulder. At this point, it feels like the camera ending as I can see the child resting the hand on the thing and I pan up into the darkness where I wake up.

I don't know why I have this dream, it happened once to twice a year for majority of my life, not had it for 2 years but it sticks with me still.","1430438700"

-----

&gt; I associate pedantry with bad arguments.

I like how holding you to YOUR OWN WORDS all of a sudden become ""pedantry"". I associate intellectual dishonesty with bad arguments.

&gt; You don't understand what ""associated"" means?

as·so·ci·ate, verb, 1. connect (someone or something) with something else in one's mind. I ASSOCIATE weakly failed passive aggressive attempts to discount an argument by discounting the arguer with an ad hominem fallacy

&gt; I associate a weak vocabulary with bad arguments.

Ah, again. That's yet ANOTHER example of ad hominem. ""This is a bad argument because you can't speak well."" The argument and the vocabulary are not related to each other. OOPS! I like how you denied using a logical fallacy, only to IMMEDIATELY use it again. Well done, you fucking dummy, you just succeeded in putting ""I don't actually know what the fuck I'm talking about"" in bold.

&gt; Why do you hate children so much?

Are you fucking kidding me with that? I ""hate"" children because I say cutting parts of their body off without permission or medical necessity is wrong? Wow. THAT's logical.

&gt; ... easier for boys to keep clean, or avoid infections?

Hey, have you heard of this new thing called soap? It's apparently amazing at keeping things clean. No need to amputate body parts anymore. It's great! Oh, and have you also heard of this other new thing called ""medicine""? Like, if you get sick, you can take something and get better! No need to amputate! Wow! Modern medicine rules! It's way better than bronze age medicine, which is what you're advocating.

&gt; peace of mind that comes with knowing they have the penis that women prefer?

Hmm. The penis version of Pascal's Wager. Way to go. I like how you're advocating cutting up someone's body without permission based on the hypothetical assumption that a hypothetical mate would hypothetically prefer it. Sure sounds like rock solid reasoning and not emotionally charged cultural bias. Oh wait, no it doesn't. That's a retarded fucking argument and you're an idiot for making it.

cosmetic surgeries are performed on infants every day.

&gt; Yeah, TO FIX FUCKING PROBLEMS. Mutations. Abnormalities. Broken bits. The foreskin is NOT any of those things. Unles, of course, you're so thurougly brainwashed by your culture that you can't think clearly for yourself. Then it's a bad thing, because a bronze age man said so.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I think people eat more and less healthily when they smoke because lots of people time their toking very poorly. For example, people smoke in the evening, after dinner. Now you get the munchies, so you eat again. And because you're stoned, you're not likely to eat something healthy but instead have whatever is convenient(junk food). 


I've alleviated this issue with myself by smoking while I cook dinner. I eat a relatively healthy meal right as the munchies kick in, and I am good for the rest of the night. If you time your smoking with your meals, I expect it will be less of a problem. And planning ahead to have healthy snacks around could also help. Have some fruit or something instead of doritos.

So my argument would still be that winning a ring this year doesn't influence his legacy a huge deal. He's already got a great legacy and in the conversation for ""best big ever"".

Outside it's not so much an issue, you can easily stand so the smoke won't get near you. There are times when you don't notice someone lighting up or you have to walk by them (like on a sidewalk) to get where you're going and then you'll be screwed because it's either walk past them and potentially get a couple of breaths of smoke or just stop. 

But in a car, even with the window open, or in the house next to the stove fan, will still cause issues. Plus the stuff (cigarettes) stinks like ass hole.

No you have been doing that. I don't think you can even begin discussing the notion of rational basis until you have a clear understanding of what marriage is. I don't even think it is the right way to think about the problem to begin with.

The only thing I have said on the matter is that I don't think the legislative difficulties imposed by polygamy are a big deal.

---------------

&gt; Fortunately, the law is judged from the standard of a reasonable person. 

And this is the belief of reasonable people.

&gt; Believing that a gay couple getting married ""damages the dignity of their marriages"" is a subjective rather than objective belief. 

And believing that marriage grants any kind of dignity is also a subjective determination.

Reasonable gay people believe they are being denied dignity, and reasonable straight people believe that granting gay marriage damages their dignity.","1430438705"

"emergencymedicine","t5_2u002","Hey hey, as a final year medical student I can confirm that shadowing isn't really something that is done here per se, but there are opportunities down the line to get involved in emergency medicine.

Depending on which medical school you apply to, they will offer a variety of placements, some of which will be in various areas including emergency. That being said, I fell in love with emergency med within the first few years of my degree, but as a medical student we're really good at falling for almost every different type of specialty. I can guarantee that you will change your mind at least 5 times within your first semester at uni. As Mick_kerr's comment, try and enjoy your moment; get involved in the placement you're in. 

If you're also undertaking rural terms, they can provide a really good hands on approach to working in a rural ED, where bulk interesting patients present. 

Medical schools can also offer elective terms in the later years where you might be able to arrange with a particular department in any state to take a term (approx 6-8 weeks) with them. This is normally only later on in the degrees (years 5-6 in undergrad or years 3-4 in postgrad)

Or, you know, it could be because they don't have million dollar ad campaigns and aren't featured on blogs and websites on a weekly basis. Or the player simply doesn't care about or follow gaming blogs and news beyond whatever game their friend showed them.

Sure, there are people that don't like 'indie' games... Which I don't understand as a blanket statement since 'indie' is not a genre... but that doesn't mean *most* people don't like them. But yes, it's true that some people just want awesome 3d graphics that are gritty and real and guns and blood and anything but something that might be seen as 'cartoony' or 'for kids'. 

&gt;The gaming population would be better off with higher quality titles that a lot of people already own as opposed to a shitload of crappy indie titles nobody even want to own.

First off, it's your *opinion* that higher production values equate to *higher quality* games. I strongly disagree, as AAA game design is largely redundant and uninspired. Secondly, you're assuming/projecting that these indie games are crappy and that *most people* don't like them.

Overall, I just simply disagree with you. Giving away a game that's been out for over a year - that everyone already knows about - that has already been purchased by the people who are actually interested - is simply not-enticing. Nor does it really help the developer in any meaningful way aside from getting that cut that Sony gives to developers/publishers of the games on the IGC.

Whereas, giving away a handful of indie games that are lesser known gives us an opportunity to discover something we didn't even know about that might actually pleasantly surprise us. When a game does appeal to people, this causes them to start telling their friends about this lesser-known title, garnering more interest... which could, very likely, result in a lot more actual purchases after their IGC month because the word-of-mouth recommendations are slowly spreading out to those never knew about it. This helps these struggling developers (and usually actually go to the developers themselves) far more than the AAA publishers.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; But the difference? Players in other sports aren't going on reddit and reading posts about themselves (if you want to use basketball players who are 18ish in the NBA). 

Teams like TSM ban their players from reading reddit for a reason. If social media isn't helping you, if your fanbase is nonexistent, don't bother logging into twitter or facebook to view death threats and people calling you trash. 

&gt;They have years and years of professional experience around them, trainers and players and coaches and all of these people that, should someone actually get down from what they're saying, there's an entire support staff around them. Sports psychologists and everything.

MOst LCS teams are already at this level though! LXGG, specifically, is on a team with Seraph, who had terrible nerve issues and issues facing the community. People still have the same tools to deal with these problems. 

&gt;That player isn't in your living room hearing you say it. This player could be on reddit reading it.

Lol people in Philly chant ""EAGLES"" when the Phillies aren't doing good. Live crowd fans can be just as brutal as reddit. 

&gt;You're making my point.

Not really. I'm pointing out that while people shouldn't say it, that it is going to happen and realistically, players need to learn how to deal with it. Without doing that, players are going to constantly cave to trolls and pressure. 

And don't think that the community alone brings about this pressure, management can as well. Don't deceive yourself into LXGG not thinking this wouldn't happen. Don't believe some naive fairy-tale land where subjectively low skilled players like LXGG are entirely under the illusion that they are WX reincarnated and they will entirely change the meta of League as we know it.

CRUSHED made soaphax mad, made a video (""look atchu man, all u do is gamble""), and made it private because he is the CRUSHED

~~So i ask for Help while in a Classic Duel Server, and he is what happens.
He Doesn't Help, He Randoms and Spawn kills, if he gets hit He Fountain Chugs. (This was Within Vals Classic Duel Server) All in All, he randomed roughly 60 or so times, With around 50-55 of those being spawn kills.
He is NOT what the Community is to be. Randoming and Spawn killing in a CLASSIC duel server (Apparently he doesn't understand what that is despite Multiple explanations). Even another player of the Server (Who was friend of CRUSHED) said ""Your the one being the dick. He asked for help, Not Randoming and spawn killing.""
Worse over all this, He acted as though it was my fault for asking for help. As though He had no choice in it and that No matter the 50-55 Randoms he did, it wasn't his fault for Randoming, NO. It was MY fault. All because i asked for help, and then requested him to stop spawn killing and randoming a near Countless amount of times, and then he expected me to have to change MY class and how I want to play, so HE doesn't Random or Spawn kill ME.
Tell me how much sense this makes like it sounds to me
A Player asks you for help, So what do you do?
Spawn Kill him 50+ Times, literally just allowing enough time to spawn and then killing him, and doing this Over Four Dozen Times. AND then, You blame HIM for causing all of this, When he has asked you to stop. Since the Second or Third Random/Spawn Kill. And your at 50+ Spawn Kills at this point. NO, its HIS fault for not changing HIS class because HE asked for you to stop, but didn't change his class, its HIS fault.
Victim Blaming in 101. Its THEIR fault for requesting help, Requesting for you to stop, and its THEIR fault because they didn't have you stop.~~

My main remaining concern though is that the dinosaurs have some level of physicality in their interactions with characters. The original did this great, through limited use of CGI and lots of practical effects. The up close interactions the characters had with the raptors (and other dinosaurs) were so believable. The focus in the trailers on the larger dinosaurs makes me very concerned about this.","1430438712"

Here's a cool dumb story. I was doing a Viking combat display for the National Maritime Museum in Sydney. Threw my shield at my opponent, who responded by reaching out and hitting my now exposed, unarmoured hand, and severed my left index finger. I was then taken into a nearby corporate lobby where I bled copiously over expensive Italian leather couches, then on to RPA hospital where I was the first sword related injury in over 100 years. Only part of the incident I remember is looking at where my finger was now hanging by a single tendon, seeing the bone and spurting blood, and saying,

""That'll need stitches"".

My next clear memory is of sitting in the A+E waiting room oh the RPA with a bunch of other fully armed and armoured Vikings. Finger was surgically reattached and I retain about 90% functionality, but have a cool scar and a unique story.","1430438713"

"DentalSchool","t5_2siqo","I have seen a lot of these ""chance me"" posts on SDN and I really don't think anyone can offer a definitive answer either way.  That being said, I have been where you are and have benefitted a great deal from the advice and perspectives of others who were there before me.  So based on my experience applying, doing a lot of reading about applying, and speaking with others, a few points come to mind for you.  

Firstly, your experience is great.  A lot of applicants focus on research or clinical experience and you have both.  It sounds like you have this aspect of your application down.  You will have great stories for your app essays and be able to earnestly describe your interest in dentistry to interviewers.

Secondly, your GPA isn't amazing, but it also isn't bad.  It certainly won't disqualify you, given your experience.  I have heard anecdotally that schools prioritize GPA above experience.  Perhaps a great GPA can even outweigh a lack of experience because it shows that you can handle the academic rigor of dental school.  

Which, brings me to my last point: On the other hand, since your GPA is not amazing, you need to show that you have mastered the basic science curriculum that is the foundation of what you will learn in dental school.  Unfortunately, your only option (other than taking more classes and raising your GPA) is to dominate the DAT.  

Your DAT score needs to improve.  

Some schools have a cutoff where they will not accept an applicant with scored in any section under 17.  Your chances are not great right now.  You might get interviews, you may even get in, but the standards for admission to dental school are against you. 

But that's okay!!!  Because you can improve your chances. So don't rule yourself out, just do some serious soul searching, dig deep down and find the will to come back and dominate the DAT.  The fact that you rushed through the last section is indicative to me that you weren't prepared.  Ask yourself what this path and career means to you and if it means enough, then use your willpower to sacrifice and study hard.  

Make a plan.  Remove all distractions and obligations. Take 6 weeks off and study every single day.  Grab some exercise and see a friend or SO now and again, but make it your life's mission to succeed on the DAT.  

I believe that you want to become a dentist.  I believe that you will make the choices you need to get there.  I believe in you. 

Now go get it!!! :)","1430438714"

"science","t5_mouw","My partner researches MS blood rheology and genomics so credit to her for this info:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), in which lymphocytic infiltration causes destruction of myelin and axons. During the initial stages, inflammation is temporary and the myelin sheath is able to regenerate, resulting in transient episodes of neurological disability. 

While the cause of MS is yet be established, there are proposed theories, which include genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, microbiological infections, and immunological lack of tolerance, leading to the development of the chronic inflammatory features of MS. 

Hypotheses on possible infections are supported by the association of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) with increased risk of developing MS (Levin et al., 2003). Lang and colleagues (2002) proposed cross-reactivity of T-cell receptors (TCR) to DRB1*1501-restricted myelin basic protein (MBP) and DRB5*0101-restricted EBV peptide as the mechanism behind the increased risk. In addition to possible molecular mimicry, EBV infected B-cells have been found in the meninges and post-mortem brains of MS patients and not in other neurological inflammatory diseases (Serafini et al., 2007). 

The pathological processes of MS encompass inflammation, demyelination, remyelination, oligodendrocyte depletion, astrocytosis, neuron and axon degeneration, which ultimately result in the formation of sclerotic plaque in the CNS (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

Migration of autoreactive lymphocytes across the blood brain barrier (BBB) is believed to initiate the disease process, though research attempts to identify whether the BBB is dysfunctional prior to immunocellular infiltration. Altered haemorheology, leading to ischemic injury of the cerebral microvasculature, has been proposed as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction (Ballabh, Braun, &amp; Nedergaard, 2004). The extravasation of the T lymphocytes is achieved through the interaction of tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interferon γ (INF-γ) with endothelial adhesion molecules LFA-1 and VLA-4 (Engelhardt, 2006). Th17 lymphocytes may then secrete IL-17, under macrophage mediated IL-23 control, which together with lymphocytic IL-22 disrupts the BBB, allowing T lymphocyte, B lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). While the antigenic target not fully established, it is likely the MBP and the myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). Moreover, an autoimmune response against the αB crystalline chaperone proteins prevents physiological suppression of cerebral inflammation (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008) and autoantibodies against neurofascin-155 and neurofascin-186, which are important for cell migration and adhesion in the CNS, mediate axonal injury (Mathey et al., 2007).

The accumulation of inflammatory cells and pro-inflammatory mediators exacerbate the immune response through the recruitment of naive microglia. Microglia are then activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and bind to the myelin-oligodendrocyte complex, previously opsonised with Fc fragments of antibodies and complement molecules. Microglial phagocytosis of the myelin sheath occurs upon surface-bound TNFα signal transduction (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008). Pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) accumulate in the CNS further contributing to myelin and axon damage (Ortiz et al., 2014). While action potentials may depolarise demyelinated axon regions, conduction of these impulses occurs at reduced speeds (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

In progressive MS, demyelination coexists with diffuse neurodegeneration associated with the build-up of insoluble tau (Bartosik-Psujek &amp; Archelos, 2004). B lymphocyte infiltrates accumulate in the meninges, leading to intrathecal antibody production (Compston &amp; Coles, 2008).

Ambulance calls in saying they have this type of trauma (we will use a traumatic 3/4 amputation of the left arm in a roll over accident as an example). We get 5-10 minutes notice that the patient is coming. So we call everyone. Lab (who does the blood type &amp; screen), X-ray, trauma surgeon, etc.

Patient shows up and we're all waiting for him. If EMS crews didn't get an IV, we have to establish IV access. Either way, we still need to draw the blood for the lab to test to get a blood type. Do we wait for the results to come back? Hell no. This guy is literally bleeding all over the damn place or did so at the scene of the accident.

At this point, depending how bad the patients injury and blood loss is, we just start infusing the 2 units of universal donor blood that lab brought with them, along with fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and normal saline. 

5 min is a long time when you're bleeding to death. ","1430438720"

I actually have huge respect for what you do and thank you for what you're able to do for those people in your care; some situations would require much more self-discipline than I have myself.

I am a Molecular Biology and Applied Maths double major, so I definitely am part of the STEM crowd, but I don't actually feel the way I was impersonating. The only opinion I have that is slightly STEM-circlejerky is that psychology isn't a science in the same way that physics or biology is. I personally admit that biology isn't as hardcore as physics, so it just kinda rubs me the wrong way when psych majors want to consider themselves hard scientists, yet when you compare the courses of study, psych is simply not as rigorous.

Yeah, that's probably a bigoted view I'm guilty of holding, but I'm proud of the work I put into my degrees and when someone suggests that they are my equal when they haven't put in as much work as I have, I get worked up.

Anyways, I hope my comments didn't bother you too much because they weren't  sincere! Keep fighting the good fight for those in your care, I'm sure you're a very positive influence in their lives!","1430438721"

This idea has somewhat changed over time, but in general anime and animated series in the West are viewed as for children, despite their target audiences.

 My point is that rape isn't a gender issue and it isn't oppression either.
 I've never had to see a gynecologist so I can't speak on how easy it is to get an appointment but I can't agine it being any more difficult than scheduling any other Dr appointment.
 Roe vs wade may get challenges but its still the law of the land, healthcare in general is expensive so I don't see how that is oppression either. As far as birth control goes there's plenty of inexpensive options and really no excuse since the primary purpose of vaginal intercourse is reproduction, people who are unwilling or unable to raise a child should practice abstinence rather than expecting the rest of society to pay for their birth control so they can have all the sex they like without consequence. If you're having sex you take on the possibility of a pregnancy it's not an accident I don't understand why people want to relieve themselves of responsibility for their actions.

Maybe I'm not recalling correctly on the domestic violence thing I do recall clearly seeing that women are the purpotratirs more often than men and they also tend to use weapons like knives, so I'd say men get hurt worse than women do.

Well women are generally way more emotional than men are so PMS or not you never know how much of what they're saying is truth and how much is exaggeration and drama.

Mansplain is a word made up to silence opposing views when men try to have a say in gender discussions, within the feminist movement men are constantly marginalized and dismissed, because equality. I'm coming into a female dominated apace to offer a different point of view. See you can class men dismiss women because of their gender but that is bullshit women get just as much respect as men do bases on what they're saying. If a woman is spouting crap that is incorrect or irrational then of course shell be dismissed the same as any man doing the same.

I was talking historically in response to the notion that women couldn't so things men could, it worked both ways and it wasn't just women who were forced into certain roles but that never gets brought up because if it was the case for men and women then you can't use it as proof of women being oppressed in the past. If histrionic has gendered connotations I'm not aware of it.

What I've learned from your post - women are somehow oppressed in the first world yet you can't give a single example of it, what you have given is issues that both men and women deal with being appropriated as affecting women only or  affecting women worse and complaining because society is supporting women with free/cheap birth control and healthcare.","1430438728"

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","I'll add some quick recommendations so I can send you into the world of snails:

* Mizon All in One Black Snail Repair Cream - *slightly more moisturizing than the Mizon All In One Cream, but still not enough*
* COSRX Snail Essence - *Great essence to check out, 96% snail mucin filtrate*
* COSRX Snail Cream - *~~Higher snail mucus percentage than Mizon's cream,~~ non-irritating for sensitive skin, overall better*

-- Overall, I think the COSRX Snail Cream would be a great place to start and would probably help the most with hyperpigmentation out of all the other snail creams out there. As for dull skin, I would try out some sort of exfoliation such as Mizon 8% AHA Serum, COSRX AHA Whitehead Power Liquid or Cure Aqua Gel. Vitamin C serums would probably also help with both hyperpigmentation and dull skin so that's definitely worth a look over.","1430438728"
"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt; It doesn't work like that. If they would label her as enemy or have any negative thoughts about her (like even ""I don't like her make-up""), they would be knocked down.

Well, Cherish is screwed, petty teenager that she is. You've still got Gray Boy as being effectively immune, as well as probably Mannequin and maybe Night Hag - Mannequin doesn't actually need air so I'm not sure exactly what stripping away oxygen in his blood would do, and Night Hag isn't human. Siberian also may or may not be effected - I don't know what she does when Manton is sleeping, and I don't know if he would even be hit. King might be able to pass on the effect to a pawn - his power was able to do it with Gray Boy's loops, so it works on pretty abstract types of ""harm."" Crawler's thoughts would be more ""play with me!"" than any sort of ill will towards her, and Bonesaw's would be along the lines of ""you're so cool! I can't wait to look inside your head!"" but I don't know how abstract you want to get with what her power defines as ""ill will."" Given Gray Boy's effective immunity, it doesn't really matter.

&gt;Siberian can be decomposed, since her power protects only against physical things. And he doesn't need line of sight.

She's immune to non-physical stuff like distorted time and, more importantly, Tatsuya has to identify the design of something before he can decompose it. That would cost him a precious second or two and would let the Hack Jobs teleport in to flip his powers off. Teleportation is instant, so his senses and reaction times shouldn't be able to stop it before it shuts him down.

&gt;Well, it may work, though Berserker gains resistance even if something doesn't kill him. God Hand is like fusion between powers of Crawler and Grey Boy.

The loop resetting should reset whatever resistance he gains, if it's a physical thing, or someone could simply go after Illya.

&gt;No, she is not. Saber is fast enough to essentaily be a teleporter for them. And how she reacts to GB is arguable.

Yeah, she sort of is screwed once Avalon is over, because she has no way to take down all of the 9000. If they wanted to, the Gray Boys could simply surround her in time loops while Avalon is up and that would be that. The loops are impassible to anyone but Gray Boy, so Saber's luck or instincts won't help her to escape them if she's already surrounded.

&gt;Cherish rather wont be able to find him, since he is not human anymore and even if she could, he can just turn into spirit and run away.

The bodies of Servants seem to operate the same way the bodies of normal humans do, for the most part, end even if they don't work exactly the same, she can sense case 53s and other not-quite-humans as well. I don't see why she wouldn't be able to sense him. Turning into spirit and running away is a valid plan, but then she would just search him down again.

&gt; If there is any way, Mitsuru takes it. Also OP haven't specified, that it has to be a head-on fight.

He's not specified as getting any prep, and they start in the same city. Unless the 9000 don't know they're in a fight for some odd reason, the Cherishes can work to hunt him down or Shatterbird can simply destroy the city and take him out that way.

&gt;Alessi's stand doesn't have to him opponent, but his/her shadow to work. And even if Siberian may be able to ignore it, Gray Boy cannot, since he has no protection from abilities, that turn time backwards.

Personally, I would argue that Gray Boy's ability to reset to a specific point in his own timeline would protect him from age reversal just as well as it would from any other power, but even if we assume it doesn't there's no way Alessi is going to take out every member fast enough to stop one of them from retaliating, especially given that he can't take out the Siberians.

&gt; Here is Kojou's wiki. He has some hax abilities like Grey Boy-like regen (that also allows him to turn things/people backwards in time), spatial erasure, obliterating several hundreds of kilometers with lighting and shields, that can resist even reality warping.

Looking at those familiars, just from the wiki I'll agree they could probably win if he pulled them out. The big threat to him would be Gray Boy putting him in a loop before he could summon one, as the looping would keep him from completing his chant.

For example, the Cubs currently have ~3 SS in their system (Castro, Russell, and Baez).  The general consensus is that Baez will play 2B and Castro will eventually be traded so Russell can play SS.

However, the team doesn't have many pitching prospects so why not trade Baez for a top pitching prospect?  If anything, Baez has lost value since last year due to his extreme struggles at the MLB level (very high strikeout rate).  Trading him while he is still a prospect keeps his high value at the time and brings back another relevant future piece in return.","1430438735"

&gt; No longer does the term &amp;quot;Socialist&amp;quot; carry the same stigma it once did - in part because self-identified socialists are few and far between.

&gt; A number of other socialists appeared on the ballot over the years, in the Socialist Labor or Socialist Workers&amp;#039; parties - and, of course, there have been regular candidates running as Communists.

&gt; So when Bernie Sanders, avowed socialist, announces his presidential bid on Thursday, he will not have a large pool of Socialists from which to draw support.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","But Pitt becoming famous is due to him having great looks. If he was ugly, then he would have been passed over for many of the roles he landed. Being pretty is a large reason actors land roles.   If they are horrible actors they are still going land jobs but not as many. Brad Pitt partially became famous for his role in legends of the fall and all the girls absolutely dawned over him and he landed a lot of roles because of women's reaction to him.

The Sex trade has been around longer the Christians have believed Jesus and the bible. This not going to change males are biologically programmed, with some exceptions, to be physically attracted to women at a very animalistic nature. Society as a whole has tried to change this few 100s of years but you can't get around it. Women wearing low tops, short short, yoga pants etc are playing on this primal male Sex drive. They are using it to their advantage to get ahead or gain something. Men use their own privledges to get ahead.   If some give a waitress a bigger tip based on their look that their issue.

Do I judge people? Ofcourse I do, but I realize that I'm judging someone and try to change my perception or reaction. You nor I have any right to complain or bitch about how someone else lives their lives. And if u do feel you have the right to do this then you should be okay when some interrupt your life or ability to make a living based solely based on their judgment of you.

Women are playing a game with men and it's one they choose to play by accepting these roles or jobs or lifestyle. You can disagree with this choices and live your life differently but by now means are you living a more worthy, or more important life then them. ","1430438736"

&gt; No longer does the term &amp;quot;Socialist&amp;quot; carry the same stigma it once did - in part because self-identified socialists are few and far between.

&gt; A number of other socialists appeared on the ballot over the years, in the Socialist Labor or Socialist Workers&amp;#039; parties - and, of course, there have been regular candidates running as Communists.

&gt; So when Bernie Sanders, avowed socialist, announces his presidential bid on Thursday, he will not have a large pool of Socialists from which to draw support.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","Choose a crafting class that can support the Disciples of War or Disciples of Magic classes that you're leveling. If you're leveling a tank or post-level 25 dragoon, an Armorer makes most of your armor. If bard, monk, or ninja, leatherworker for the armor. If a caster, weaver. The ""problem"" with this advice, however, is that your crafter will have to be almost the same level as your combat class to make level appropriate armor. Without the list of useful crafting skills listed by /u/Erik_Highwind it may be hard to HQ the gear

Also consider which classes make your weapons. Carpenter for dragoon, bard and whitemage; blacksmith for tank and ninja weapons, plus some monk and dragoon ones; goldsmith for blackmage weapons (and almost all accessories beyond lvl 29); leatherworker for some monk weapons; alchemist for some whitemage weapons and summoner, scholar books. I may have missed a few, you could browse the recipe book on ffxivcrafting.com to understand what each class makes.

Note that the above advice is not necessary for people who are leveling their first combat class. You get some gear every five levels. But it's nice, especially if you can make high quality gear. Firstly, HQ gear has slightly higher stats. Secondly, it spiritbonds faster. When gear is 100% spiritbonded, you can convert it into materia, which is bought and sold actively on the market board, occasionally for ridiculous prices. I'd hazard a guess that once you begin converting gear from the lvl 30-45 range, you'll start getting the occasional gem that sells well. 

You could also choose to level a class that gets most support from the gatherer class you're leveling. Miners provide most of the materials for armorers, blacksmiths and gold smiths, while botanists supply carpenters, alchemists, culinarians, weavers. A fisher is more fun for world exploration than supplying mats. When I was leveling crafters and had to buy materials from the market board, I hated it when I was forced to buy overpriced things, or stacks of 99. This is where self sufficiency in material gathering is a plus. 

The most significant boost to crafting xp comes from tradecraft courier leves, where you usually pick up the leve in a hub city, then turn in the crafted item in another area. If you HQ the item you get double the xp. I believe you'll need to do about 10 of these to advance five levels, so stock up on material accordingly. ","1430438739"

You are actually fine. With your own knee, it's a thousand times easier to have normal gait. The most important things to do is keep your muscles strong, and STRETCH. If your residuum's hamstrings start getting contractures your gait will look like crap. Next, would be comfort of your socket and suspension. If it hurts to walk and you're always trying to avoid a certain area, it won't look normal. It also will look terrible if you keep slipping out the socket. The rest can be adjustable by a good prosthetist, and can be trained quite easily.

TL/DR; I thought you said AK; with your own knee, it's very easy to walk normally with no one ever knowing.","1430438743"

A couple years ago, I bought the 1.0 CE with hopes of playing on the PC I had at the time. However, since the PC wasn't mine, I found myself returning it before I installed. Fast-forward to ARR Beta 3, where I grabbed a PS3 CE copy and finally made it to Eorzea. Shortly after sorting out the PS3 install, I registered the 1.0 codes for all my bonus goodies.

I'm on PS4 now but want to go PC before 3.0. If I get a suitable gaming rig, is there a way to get ARR on it without extra expense? I'll be buying the 3.0 CE soon and don't want to double-buy ARR if I don't have to.

Searching here and on Google led to answers about PC to console switches, and Steam store stuff, but nothing like this (I think).

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","OSRS from what I hear is pretty god awful. They have a track record of being a bunch of childish pricks, there was an instance of a charity event being flooded with hate from OSRS in chat. That was a livesteam though, Twitch is kind of a cesspool anyway so that's a low blow on them though, I guess?

The PK community is mostly where OSRS went though, and we've seen how aggressive people can get over PVP. 

Anyway, RS3's community's still pretty shitty too but that's mostly shown out of at least a genuine concern. The most annoying thing I see about the community is their stupidity regarding MTX. Being against MTX is totally fine but some people just are dense as shit and refuse to accept being even slightly wrong, then you've just got people who are way too zealous and refuse to want to work with Jagex and instead go for a very ""NO MTX WHAT SO EVER GET RID OF IT NOWWWWWWW"" sort of approach. 

But even those people, they're not assholes really, even the people who really aren't level headed and really have no idea what they're talking about (which is by no means all of them) are really just looking out for what they believe is best for the game anyway. . . 

So compare that to what I've said about OSRS . . . 

Obviously RS3' got my vote. 

_____

Being a skiller on RS3? Easier or harder . . . Mm. I guess harder, depends? OSRS doesn't have dungeoneering, dungeoneering requires you to either pay people to let you leech or for you to participate in combat so if we consider that? I guess RS3's way harder, especially with 120 dungeoneering.

Overall I tend to think of, content wise anyway, OSRS v. RS3 like this, RS3 intends to add more and more updates, OSRS will add very sparse, polled updates. RS3 is already years ahead of OSRS content by it's very nature. . . RS3's going to not necessarily be harder or easier as much as it will be more expansive.

We've got [runespan](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Runespan) for runecrafting and you can make some good money on [vis wax](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Vis_wax) so I guess maybe it'd be easier to do it on RS3? The main thing I'm really not sure about is prices for OSRS, this is a huge deal for buyable skills and largely will dictate just how hard things are. Tl;dr not really sure but I'd suggest RS3 anyway.

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","I tried to withhold my judgment until the end.  I listened to the whole podcast over the Christmas break with SO and we had been told to listen to it by a friend who was hooked while it was still ongoing.  That friend laid out the evidence of a false conviction and was in the innocent camp when they recommended so I had that in the back of my mind - the whole - there is this serial killer that is the one that actually did it story.

By the end, I was scratching my head.  I thought there was some huge exculpatory piece of evidence coming and I never heard it.  From how SK and Rabia described the prosecution and CG, I expected something much, much more than what was presented. Still, I was pretty sure he was actually guilty but the case was weak.  I was particularly interested in the cell data as I worked in RF and cell planning for many years.  After looking at the actual maps and reading the actual testimony, it is clear that the prosecution did not claim what Serial or the innocent camp said that they claims (being consistent with is not saying is it 100% proof the call was from LP).  Once I read the testimony, I concluded that everything AW testified to was correct.

After reading over the actual transcripts, I am firmly in the guilty camp.  I don't think it was a moment of passion, I think it was premeditated murder over Adnan's pride being hurt.  I think he is a complete liar and lacks and remorse for the crime so he deserves to spend the rest of his life in jail.  I actually feel bad for the people in the innocent camp at this point as they are blind to the manipulation.  I can see the 'fresh from listening' crew still thinking innocent (or not enough to convict), but it is hard to fathom how anyone that has read the transcripts or read this sub for month or longer could still think that.","1430438745"

I've never broken ranks before, I've never had to, after Getty's mess, we had Klein, who was willing to do what needed to be done and weather the outrage. 
But we don't have another Klein right now, just people who put ambition over responsibility. 

I don't actually want any other party in power, but the PC's have to remember to represent us, not themselves. They're completely off the rails and need to be scared back on track. In Alberta, and in Ottawa too. 

The WR would just be co-opted and ultimately strengthen the PC's, the Alberta party might as well not exist as it gets no traction in the shadow of the pc/wr's (too bad, because they're actually fairly reasonable), I'd wipe my ass with a ballot before I'd ever vote for the thieving Liberals, so that leaves me with the NDP, which makes me nervous, they have a history of ravaging provinces and are generally ridiculous. 

But we DO need to play chicken with the PC's or they will never change. 

This is a situation of driving home the point that a home needs to be renovated by tossing a moltov in the living room.

I'm not asking for them to drop everything and help me immediately, I just want a little more transparency.  

Another thing is that they ripped open the ceiling to get to the pipes, so if those pipes decide to burst on us again and neither me nor my roommate are home we don't have any ""wall"" to at least catch some of that water.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;but i hesitate to call it ""hate"" since ""hate"" implies malice (to me).  

Past examples through history of what is called ""hate"", specifically to ethnic or religious minorities, have not relied on active malice. It is determined more by actions and attitudes inevitably based on treating these groups unequally.

Limiting it to active malice would let someone who supported Jim Crow laws out of callous indifference off the hook. The is a certain type of person out there who will treat these groups like that and not even consider them human enough to warrant a strong emotional response.

I also don't think anything is gained from holding back from identifying hate for what it is.

He hated the ending right?  Generally when something has a really bad ending, you give it a score lower than you usually give it (had it ended better).

Even after the show ended poorly, he was considering giving it an 8.

Yes I guess you can be distracted about fancy art and what not. But the last thing that sticks in your mind is the ending. To give something an 8 and then have a completely thought process that manages to bring down your score in half is really odd, *especially* after the poor ending. 

It makes me think that he was likely over analyzing/nitpicking.

I know not everyone uses the MAL scale, but 4 is most obviously a bad score (on a scale of 10).","1430438748"

The real trick is knowing what to make of all the info received I.e. how to analyze and what it means. It's not really that hard actually, just can be a lot of material to figure out.

The most important part of the DD process,  and this is just my opinion, will be the phase after these intial questions,  the follow up questions.  Baaically after finding out some things,  knowing what to ask next to probe further is crucial, to determine if and how much risk there really is.

Finally, I should probably say from experience depending on the size of the transaction a lot of sellers will baulk at such a rigorous list of questions as above.  Which you cant really blame them if for example its a $10k deal, the time spent to get that all together wouldn't be worth it.

Anyone interested in some more basic DD on websites ans startups to see some actual examples, you can see at a site of mine www.digisect.com.

If you're a fan of Hyperion gear (I am, but not ""Old"" Hyperion), ""Company Man"" is outstanding. 

""Money is Power"" only works until you spend it (or die), so it helps to have ammo regen COMs (or Moxxtails) and skills like ""Jack's Cache"" from the left tree to save your money. 

I really want an Omni-Cannon to see how it works with ""Compound Interest"", a decked-out ""Company Man"", and ""Sponsored By..."" with a Maliwan weapon.

If you ignore the 57% (I use a windripper, so phy dmg doesn't matter to me) then you're doing 45.3% MORE dmg (109/75) compared to before. The base area of the skill also appears to be larger than current lvl 1 RoA on live servers. There's also some changes to Inc. AoE (+20% inc at lvl 1) gem, and to Conc Eff gem (40% more dmg, 25% LESS aoe) These things combined, I'd say it's a very nice buff.

For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the /æ/ sound, as in land, with a vowel close to [ɛ], so that land would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of lend. RP is sometimes known as the Queen's English, but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II has changed her pronunciation over the past 50 years, no longer using an [ɛ]-like vowel in words like land.","1430438754"

For example, Robert Bates was a reserve sheriff deputy in Oklahoma who shot Eric Harris in the back. Bates wasn't a member of the union, he was a volunteer and a donor to the department.

The issue also isn't cops not getting fired, it's a pervasive attitude within the criminal justice system. Prosecutors do not need the union's permission to investigate criminal complaints against police. The failed indictments in New York and Ferguson last fall had nothing to do with unions. Police abuse of power is criminal, they should be going to jail not getting fired.","1430438755"

In the almost 90 days that I worked there, 18 people were fired or quit, including the one guy that got thrown in jail. some of them didn't work there for longer than a week. the guy that was hired the day before me didn't last beyond lunch break.

This was for a variety of reasons: Scheduling was always a bit fucky; we were almost always behind schedule. A couple of times my friend and I stayed there working until 8 PM (after starting at 6 AM and supposing to get out at 3 PM) just so we didn't fall ABSOLUTELY, COMPLETELY behind (which really just meant our manager would have been breathing down our neck until things got fixed and threats of firing us). Things broke all the time, the shop was always 50% new guys which meant hardly anyone knew what was going on, drama all the time, the company was undergoing acquisition from a larger corporation, the actual work was demanding physical labor...

But the general manager brought donuts in for us nearly every time we had to work on Saturday. We worked a lot of Saturdays. He even brought in a bunch of food and grilled lunch for us one day. He was a great guy, he was just a pretty bad manager. But the donuts made those Saturdays a little less shitty.","1430438755"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Everytime he plays Bjergsen? In Bjergsen's first NA LCS finals, he destroyed Bjergsen. Hai died like three times total in that final. The second finals, Bjersen did better overall but Hai did great with his Zed too. In regular series, he has always done just fine against Bjergsen except in this split where Bjergsen was clearly better because well he is a better player but he also got way more resources in mid than Hai did.

Dade season 4? Hai never died 1v1 but yes Dade won that matchup but thats like saying Bjergsen got destroyed by POE so he sucks. It happens. As for Xpeke in S3, again Hai did just fine in lane but Xpeke took over late game with his Kassadin. As Hai admitted, C9 made a huge mistake because they thought they could counter Kassadin despite it being a super strong champion that everyone was banning. That said, in that series, Hai was actually the one that mechanically outplayed Xpeke and got a 1v1 kill with his Fizz.

Hai is not weak mechanically, its how C9 plays. They just dont pressure mid and prefers to focus elsewhere because Hai used to be self sufficient. He would compensate for it by putting pressure all around the map at the expense of his lane. But now with most teams getting pretty good at vision game Hai cannot roam as effectively anymore, and with his team not adapting to pressure more in mid lane relative to how much pressure his opponents are getting, Hai has essentially been a sitting duck this split.

Anyways, just because some reddit guys like you says Hai sucks doesnt make it so. I would trust what pros like Shiphtur, Voyboy, and even Bjergsen says about Hai.","1430438757"

When I first got kicked out I was bitter at UCSD, feeling like they could have been more understanding and all that, but I've since gotten over those feelings. I realize that as administrators they just thought that I wasn't taking school seriously; it's not like they were out to get me for no reason.  

Plus, I think it doesn't matter what university or college a person attends as long as they make the most of their experience there.

The chances of your family disowning you for being a vegan is incredibly less likely than if you were gay. Being gay also isn't a choice. Being vegan is. Which means that I don't believe it's fair to give the comparison to coming out of the closet.



If you feel bad about the meat industry, then go vegan. Like I said, you *will* face criticism, humiliation, taunting, and so forth. But every social cause has had that issue. Women could've sat down and shut up whilst men ran the world, but feminism would never have gotten its reach. Women would've been stuck in the household unlikely to ever get a job beyond possibly that of a secretary position.



~~Black Americans could've kept their lips shut and sat at the back of the bus, but they would've continued to be put down if they didn't speak up.~~



If you believe in something, truly believe in it, you need to stand up and fight for it. You don't need to tell everyone you're vegan at every possible interaction (I only bring it up when it's relevant), but to say you hate the system but not to fight against it is both hypocritical and cowardly.



And yeah, they're curious because it seems unusual. You're so used to eating meat. Why stop eating it and why now of all times? You've got to talk to them about it first to see if they'll be supportive or not. If they're not, then you can always go vegan or vegetarian when you have control over your own life.

She spontaneously called in for work that day (It was 5 am at the time) and sat in the parking lot of the birth center all day until 2pm when the boy was born. And of course she told me this, so it was in the back of my mind the entire time. (She wanted to come in and wait in the waiting room. No? I had no idea what was going to happen. Those sound proof doors are good but...things like the shower and stuff are on the other side. All I need would be for her to see me, run down the hall and engage.)

In addition, we had a video chat with my mother in law with this baby at the gender reveal baby shower, and she posted some stupid picture she found, on facebook for all her friends to see, before I even got home from the shower (not a picture of our cake or anything, since there weren't any pictures yet...).

"law","t5_2qh9k","&gt; Tennessee accepts New York marriages as legitimate and the new york married couple has all the rights and privileges of a Tennessee marriage when in the state of Tennessee.

Yes, this is correct. That is the point that Roberts was attempting to make. So long as the New York marriage was legal at the time it was formalized in New York, Tennessee accepts it as legal when the couple moves to the state and affords the couple all the rights of marriage in Tennessee.

But Roberts asked why a gay couple (who were married New York) are treated differently from a straight couple (who were married New York) upon moving to Tennessee. Think of this hypothetical:

You are a Tennessee employer who is reviewing marriage licenses for the purpose of spousal health insurance. There is a new employee, Adam, who is married to Taylor. They recently moved from New York.

The marriage license is legitimate, so why should you treat it differently if Adam is married to Taylor Swift versus Taylor Lautner? By denying health insurance to Taylor Lautner, you are effectively retroactively applying Tennessee marriage laws to a New York couple. That is improper under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

&gt; This is why marriage sinks to the least common denominator. 

Marriage has always flowed to the lowest common denominator. That is why Las Vegas became a mecca for quickie, drunk marriages. There is no requirements about waiting periods or blood tests or counseling.

It is also why Scalia and Roberts hinted that they could rule against Question 1 but rule in favor of Question. It would create an exception that swallows the rule.

&gt; If California were to institute a single party initiated no-fault divorce without residence requirements that ignored pre-nups, then every marriage across the country would now be subject to that ""free divorce."" 

This forum shopping already occurs in divorce cases though. That is why there is a whole cottage industry dedicated to choice-of-law questions with respect the divorce. One real world example is Katie Holmes divorcing Tom Cruise:

&gt; When Katie Holmes filed for divorce from Tom Cruise, she made a strategic move by choosing to file in New York rather than California.

&gt; New York is a good state to file in for parents who are looking for sole legal custody of their child—as Holmes is, according to TMZ. California is more likely to offer shared custody. (However, filing for divorce could be bad for Cruise since he has been trying to avoid the high tax rates in the city.)

http://laist.com/2012/06/30/katie_holmes_tom_cruise.php

&gt; So this notion that there is any kind of guarantee that ones marital rights will be protected outside of the state is a legal fiction. 

But it is a legal fiction that has been consistently applied to all straight couples getting married. Suddenly when gay couples could get married too, states dedicated to stop the uniform applicable of the legal fiction. Such an abrupt change in state behavior signals a discriminatory purpose to the courts. (It was the basis for ""Windsor"" where the federal government had accepted any and all state marriages, but suddenly changed this practice when same sex marriage started.)","1430438759"

""How long are you supposed to wait until you should get tested I believe it's two weeks, but I'm nervous wondering if that's too early?""
First off let's address this, there a lot of different types of HIV tests. The first which detects HIV the earliest post exposure is an HIV RNA test. This test has a high false readings rates which is why its seldomly ever used. The second earliest is a 4th generation HIV test which are very accurate now and have around a 90% success rate at 2 weeks post exposure(I recommend this test to ease your mind due to its early test time and high success rate.) The most common are 3rd generation HIV tests which are nearly 100% accurate at 6 weeks post exposure. None of these numbers are at 100% for 2 reasons, one to address possible failures in the test itself and two to address people who seroconvert later than others. Everyone who isn't heavily immuno-compromised will be detectable at 8 weeks on a third generation test, but I still follow CDC recommendations of follow up testing at 3 months to further confirm earlier tests. Note that this follow up test does not mean you will be HIV positive at 3 months you most surely will not as this is just a safety measure to get rid of those pesky .0000001% chances of test failures(which are mainly just statistical backlash anyways.)
TL;DR on testing etiquette: RNA test don't do it, 2nd generation do it at 2week post exposure, 3rd generation test at 6 weeks and always test again at 3 months.
http://www.rnceus.com/fl2hiv/test2.html
source for information above and keep in mind the gaps in stats are to incorporate people who have compromised immune systems such as people on chemo, late stages of cancer, and heavy drug users. The windows of testing are large to make sure that no one slips by due to any matter as it would be negligent to otherwise considering the severity of HIV.

Next on the list the risk:
The average per risk of condomless sex from topping a male who is infected with HIV is .03%. Yes it really is that low, HIV's ability to infect is very low as it infects a very specific and hard to find cell that it has to just bump into aswell as considering that HIV is extremely fragile. The virus dies near instantly upon exposure to oxygen and the viral amount needed to infect is roughly 2 million units of HIV(to put this into perspective the highest HIV amount the largest mosquito can carry from feeding off an AIDS infected patient is roughly 1,000 units which is near a full ounce of HIV infected blood from the highest concentration naturally possible. You can begin to see why HIV has a low infection rate and this isn't even taking into consideration the effect that the mucous membrane plays in your urethra in preventing HIV from passing into your body.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV/AIDS
I feel like I have rambled enough.
You chances of contracting HIV are very low just test at the above recommendations and test again at 3 months for guidelines sake and in the future take care of yourself, know the risks, be careful, and remember that sex is only a small part of your life that could ruin the rest of it.","1430438760"

I've also seen some variety of loadmaster position, but I'm not sure what that looks like in combat.

Regarding the all-or-nothing Firespray situation, who says everything is handled by the pilot? Why can't more than one person help? Remember that this is a narrative game that easily handles semi-flexible time flow, so you don't need to rigorously adhere to deckplans or other matters that are not outright stated. Even if you insist on one crewmember controlling everything, who's to say that the rest of the party can't be backseat drivers? They can make their rolls to come up with suggestions to manage the comms, angle shields, and use other systems, leaving to pilot to only have to input their requests and then focus on their own actions. The pilot should be literally limited to one maneuver and one action, but rather can only himself complete that many tasks; there's nothing saying he can't be doing other things in a round like inputing the actions of the rest of the party. If you still can't get it working, maybe it's time for a new ship so that everyone can participate.

"religion","t5_2qh39","Could you please show me where in the TORAH this is taught? Teshuva is outlined multiple times, and it involves atonement for sin. For example, see Leviticus 5:5-6, Leviticus 5:15-16, Leviticus 6:4-6.

Teshuva is turning back to YHWH, making restitution to remove the guilt, and then offering sacrifice to atone for the sin.

Lev 17:11: ""For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.""

&gt; It is THE BLOOD that maketh an atonement.

You can make restitution with your fellow man, and repay what you owe, or have transgressed in, but this does not bring atonement. Recompensation covers the GUILT of your offense against your FELLOW MAN. Atonement covers the CONDEMNATION unto death that YHWH has judged you with. You must be forgiven on both accounts. Recompensation is not teshuva. You must also be forgiven by YHWH himself.

Could you show me where in the Torah atonement is made without a life being given for your own? Sin brings death. When you sin, you are worthy of death, and blood must be shed, this is a Torah principle, and it is immutable. How do you gain atonement without temple sacrifice? If you cannot prove your position from the TORAH, then it is invalid. Isaiah 8:20 says:

""To the torah and to the testimony: if they speak not according to this word it is because there is NO LIGHT IN THEM.""","1430438763"

""TRP has resonated with a lot of guys. I don't advocate it as a cult, and I pick and choose what I find is true, false, or unproven (in my eyes).""

As I said before, I don't tend to read reasonable things like this here very often(maybe it's me).

""I advise you to look past the language of absolutes and see if there is any truth or useful information for your life. I found a lot of interesting stuff in the sidebar. ""

There are some truths and valuable nuggets of information in just about every group, but some groups are so shifty/seemingly unethical at large that you tend to stay away. For every guy like you seem to be, in this /r there are a whole bunch of guys who just flat out give the impression they have very little regard for women, and certainly don't see them as people to be treated with respect, ad the justification is that she secretly likes all that shit, cuz instincts and evo psyche.

I mean, read this from a recent thread: ""Women cock block out of instinct because they're jealous, petty creatures for the most part."" That, in essence is why people hate RP so much. Most people(including myself) would still have major issues with what RP teaches, but wouldn't hate it quite so much if so many of it's members weren't so damn mean-spirited and opportunistic.

""I think part of it is that a lot of men refuse to believe the stove is hot and have to be burned a few times for the idea to stick. Maybe you've just had good relationships that have never ended badly for you.""

Oh buddy let me tell ya, I have. And you and I both know how utterly horrible it can be, especially if you were in love at the time. I get how bad things can get, but I still recognize that it's an issue with either myself, or the specific women I was involved with. No matter how tempting it might be when I feel bitter to make general declarations about the supposed nature of women, I couldn't do that and still be logical.

Besides, this last paragraph could as easily be used by women(and has), to make general claims about men and how they're this way and that, because the particular woman just had issues with particular men. 

I don't see how either case makes sense.

Picrd is a key character, fitting into the archetypal role of the wise old man.  (If you don't know about archetypes, its interesting.  I suggest at least a glance at Jungian archetypes)

In your dream, you start in a cave, in the dark, captured by ogres who represent violence, barbarism.  You had given in to fate.  But it seemed like Picard, representing leadership and strength, gave you hope.  He was human, like you.  Your hope turned to disgust when he proposed intimacy.

What other associations do you have with Picard?  Think about your outer world as well.  Like the people you know or places you've been.  Anything that comes to you when you think about Picard (or even star trek since they are directly related)

So the Witcher 2 didnt even come close to 80 or even 10% of just cutscenes.   I suppose if you rushed through it and did nothing but main story quests you would tend to spend more time in them or if you consider dialog cutscenes?   If anything I would bet Witcher 3 is going to have way more cutscenes than previous titles.  However in a 50hr straight playthrough its probably still only a few hours at most total. 

Just trying to be honest and say it doesn't sound like your type of game.  Chances are it will win several GOTY awards especially in the RPG categories.   So its going to be an amazing game but that doesn't have to mean its your type of game.  ","1430438765"

Almost no lies are truly flat on the course, and of course don't forget about rough and hazards. Certainly not least, is short game/approach.

Well, because it hasn't been done exactly right. 

Selling Skyrim mods (per installation) is a thoroughly bad idea. A lot of mods depend on other mods. So, either mods that are used in other mods would have to be free and copylefted (so their creators get nothing) or there should be a whole system in the workshop that tracks mod dependencies and makes you buy/install all required mods. But all of that would require extensive curation which Valve did not want to do.

Without a system to track all of this, payment model that Valve chose is simply incompatible with how mods are actually made currently, and it would be impossible to make that system make sense. ","1430438768"

That being said, if that's the route we're going to imitate, I'd prefer to just do it for real then. Make an actual non-profit IT licensing body in each state, or nationally, and have them come up with standardized licenses.

I'll say that I was more aggressive than I'm used to when it comes to 'debate'. I felt like pressing my point forward, instead of just trying to contradict OP. It's a nice perspective to have, I think; to be paying Riot for what they've given you in experience and a quality time in League of Legends. It's one worth sharing, no?

So in the case that you wanted to kick me in the head because I sounded like (pardon the French) a twat, I don't necessarily blame you. I probably could've sounded a lot more disciplined. With that said, I don't necessarily want to. This is /r/leagueoflegends, after all; I'm not an alien and I don't want to present myself like one.

As far as whether it's worth it... I'd say it all depends on how cheap you can get it, and what your significant other/children situation is.  IIRC the TD trestolone base I used was priced at ~$80 for 3g TD solution, so $26/1g.  It'd be real nice to get some bulk powder, and make your own TD solution, if you can get it cheap enough... I talked a source down to $36 a gram shipped and that's nowhere near where it needs to be, to be cost-effective.  Compare that to the popular source of pre-prepared trestolone acetate in GSO, which I believe sells at $36/1g on sale, $50/1g not on sale.  GSO compared to TD comes out to be about even if you figure the TD solution is absorbing at 50% at best, which is the unsupported-in-data impression I have.

And I was always worried about not getting it on my girlfriend, and washing up before bed.  That was the worst part about the TD stuff for me, by far.","1430438771"

This is going to be tricky. Blueberries, like most fruits, ferment out pretty dry.

To get anything close to as sweet as Wild Blue you'd really have to backsweeten the beer, which is easy if you can force carbonate but trickier if you have to bottle condition, since you'll probably need to use an unfermentable sweetener.","1430438776"

The ingame description is ""Perception represents a character's senses as well as their instinctive ability to pick up on details. In interactions, it can be used to catch someone in a lie, to make an observant comment about their appearance, or to notice something happening in the background.

Now as for the open shower, this is very similar to the baby sitter scenario. The only difference is it's the parents who take their kids to the showers to see the naked adults and there's no crime involved.

This is totally different when kids see other kids their age naked. Adults are authoritative figures to kids that's why I think they're more vulnerable.","1430438777"

Some shoppers are confused because they are accustomed to getting their food from one part of the store, e.g. Chinese express, Italian express, the deli, etc. and would go to the booths and enjoy their food there, however now they see that there is a restaurant and may be confused. These customers are more than welcome to enjoy their food inside the restaurant, but we are still in a sort of a transitioning stage as you can see by /u/ScottWalkerSucks post.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","So, in Golarion there's this path of souls... or a river of souls... some large contiguous body of all of the dead souls from forever. And they lead to Pharasma's place in the multiverse. (The Boneyard? Something like that.) And she's... processing them? Look, this stuff is complicated, just bear with me.

So Pharasma has a line of souls going for a long damned time. Lots of dead people, apparently. And on the other end of the line is a thing. I dunno what it's called, but it's bad. It's a bad thing. Really, it's The Bad Thing. When The Bad Thing gets to the front of the line and into The Boneyard the universe ends. Or maybe all life as we know it is extinguished, or the Abyss crashed into the Astral Plane. I forget exactly, but it's bad for everyone. Like, multi-versally bad.

Okay, so Pharasma-souls-souls-souls-souls-The Bad Thing. So what? Well, raising the dead pulls a soul out of line. The more dead you raise, the more souls (or soul energy, or what have you) you pull out of line. Since the souls are pretty literally staving off the heat death of the Universe pulling them out of line is bad.

Creating undead makes everyone (in the truly universal sense of the word) that much closer to planar catastrophy, up to and possibly including having every molecule in your body exploding outwards simultaneously at the speed of light and the frogurt being cursed. That's bad. Like... hastening the end times is actually, objectively, evil. Capital Evil even. The gods themselves have so spoken.

In not-Golarion? The disrespect and desecration thing. Possibly because a god says so.

&gt;I'd like to focus more on the necromancy side of things...

&gt;Does anyone have any suggestions of cool things I can pull off without being cast out of society (again)?

Aside from energy drain? Not really. Necromancy is kind of a creepy school. Hope the first part of this was helpful at least.","1430438778"

I am going to assume for these calculations you are 25 years old. If you are lightly active around the house all day, then you burn about 2200 calories per day. If you limit those calories to 1700 per day (a 500 calorie deficit), then you will lose 1 lb per week. If you want to lose 2 lbs per week, you will need to cut back further to 1200 calories per day.

Of those 1700 calories, you will want to make sure that you get an adequate amount of protein and fat since they will make you feel more full than sugary carbohydrates.

Right now, you are eating a lot of rice and bread which is mostly carbohydrates, and the fruit you are eating (the dates and banana) are sugary compared to, for example, an apple or berries.

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Well there is also a real systemic, Intel and Nvidia love even in the Linux community for instance which im very close to. Linux people won't buy AMD at all really even though there are some potential advantages coming when comparing the Nvidia on Linux. To go into more detail, the AMD driver on Linux is going through a massive transformation from the ground up, they wrote a new kernel driver, they are even giving more open source code to the community, all of this is great and is stuff the Linux community loves. 

We are talking about 20 million systems just for Ubuntu, Id say 50 million would be a good round number of systems that use Linux in general so there is a market there. This is a market that AMD barely gets any business at all right now. If they have some sort of good will for the work they are doing and market it a bit they could get a good chunk of Nvidia's market share there. Actually if they wanted market share overnight and there wasn't any legal reason not to, if they completely open sourced their entire GPU stack they would be instantly seen as a Linux friendly company and overnight would be the number 1 choice. This is just for Linux and although a small group in the grand worldwide scheme of things its still a dedicated passionate group of people who do repay loyalty with sales. 

&gt; (Complaining about no longer present heat issues)

It is a legitimate concern and AMD should debunk that with better marketing. 

&gt; Even just giving out some swag every once and a while, being personable, etc. would probably go a long way

A proven solid tactic but it works only as long as you target it correctly. If you have a relationship with a youtuber for instance Pewdiepie or Totalbiscuit him just mentioning the type of GPU he is using can drive sales up a bit. So giving out cards to people can be hugely powerful. Out to the public id say it could give some impact but it depends on how its done. For lets say a pcmasterrace one it would have to be a competition and it would have to be something a little bit weird, like the master race man logo thing but do a comic strip or something and the best 5 get the newest most expensive card and t-shirts. That would get a lot of interest and good will. 

&gt; I also have to agree on your point about the Steve Jobs style.

It also depends on how you do it too. A lot of gaming press releases tend to be boring affairs. You would need something spectacular, something that would literally make people go ""wow AMD how the fuck did you do this?"". So you can do that with product innovation sure but id say if it were me, id announce a previously unannounced game that would be available that day at their press even. So a AAA game, something that would cause waves, or more than 1 even. But the crowd and everyone must not have a clue beforehand. You could even announce Linux support too and it would cause that crowd too to make some waves. Its all about getting mass shock and awe. 

If I were the guy, selling AMD products I would want the gaming public to think I was a magician, id want them to be talking about the conferences for weeks afterwards on all of those podcast style shows about gaming. And when I have an event I would make sure people wouldn't miss it even if someone offered you sex with jennifer lawrence.

You have a computer, and there is a ton of free info out there (Stanford, MIT, and more all have free courses). So try it out. If you have an iPhone or an android phone, try writing an app you think would be useful. Teach yourself.

Hunting down information and methods for doing things is something you'll have to do regularly in programming, so doing it yourself before you're in school is a great way to build those skills.

The reason this is important is if you plan to get a job programming, a lot of places will expect examples of work you've done. From simple stuff like utilities you write to big projects. If you want to work for yourself instead, you need to be the one driving yourself to be at the keyboard programming.","1430438782"

"FFRecordKeeper","t5_3779b","Just a minor nitpick. I think you mean **Mental** Break, not **Magic** Break. Mental Break reduces a target's Magic Def/Resistance, whereas Magic Break reduces their Magic Attack.

I'm no expert in the JP meta, having only started JP last week, but I seem to recall that while Power and Magic Break are two of the most useful Break skills in the game, however Mental and Armor Break generally are not. If you use Vanille, you are freeing up an ability slot on Tidus in your example, to equip another more useful skill such as Dark Buster/Power Break, given that skill slots seem to be something of a premium in the game.

In that sense, Vanille's SB can help a mage-heavy team deal more damage, since it is multi-target. What makes it less appealing is I don't know if Deshell/Deprotega has a 100% status affliction rate, and how long the debuff would last for. For example, if you only run 1 mage, and afflict 3 enemies with it (think FFVI Imperial Camp elite), how long would it take for you to effectively get the most out of that SB? She'd also be great if you run a team utilizing Summoners, or a multi-target Black Magic.

Also, how potent is Garnet's all-Attack buff? I can somewhat agree with her being top, since dropping the ability to use Holy, to buff up to 4 other physical attackers is a good trade-off for DPS.","1430438783"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","Hm. What if instead of giving forcefield HP, make it a ""number of hits"" thing, like Phoenix's egg in Dota (or even the Changeling in SC2, sorta. in the sense that one hit will kill it regardless of damage).

To kill the forcefields, you have to hit it with n attacks, but the damage those attacks dealt wouldn't factor in at all. 

That would also introduce counter-forcefield *strategy* on top of the existing *tactics*, since you could make units that fire more quickly to counter the forcefields.

""Hm, he's going Stalker-Sentry, so I should really get lots of Marauders, but Marines do way better against force fields due to their attack speed...""

Of course, that last bit^ won't hold true in LotV as much, since Marauders will have a double-attack, but.. just an idea. Not sure if it's a good one.

Personally I'm in favor of reworking forcefields so that they're... not forcefields, but rather, regions in which your units would take say, DOUBLE damage (it would need to be significant). They might need to nerf mana cost/cooldown too if they made it like this. I think that would keep them as a viable means to control and zone your opponent, but get rid of the whole ""I have 5 sentries so you are never getting up this ramp, ever.""","1430438788"

She's a great mix of defensive play and offensive play. A lot of her aerial and smashes space and combo well, and some customs (Super Speed) make her an easy character to approach with.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Well, first off, how the sport works:

Two guys compete for up to 12 rounds of 3 minutes each.  They're only allowed to punch (no kicks, knees, elbows, or wrestling holds) and can only hit above the belt.  They're given points by several judges based on how well they performed in each round - mostly landing punches or defending well.

You either win by the judges' points after 12 rounds, or by knocking the other guy down so that he can't get up in a 10-count, or by the referee or the other guy's team deciding that the guy can't safely fight anymore.

So now, as for this fight's importance.  Mayweather is considered by most to be the best boxer in the world - several titles, currently undefeated in his professional career.  Pacquio (who is Filipino) is also considered one of the best in the world - several titles over a long career.  But these two fighters have never gone against each other - ever since 2009, people have been hoping they'd fight, but they never managed to agree on payment, drug testing, etc until now.

So now you've got an undefeated champion going up against a guy who's been considered either the second-best boxer on earth or considered ""maybe even better than Mayweather, but he hasn't gotten to prove it yet.""

So if you're in a Filipino house, stick with the people and cheer for Manny Pacquiao.  He's the underdog in the odds, but not by too big a margin.  I'm hoping for a good fight.","1430438791"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","First, you are selfish.  You want oral sex but don't want to give it.  Simple as that.  If this confuses you, how about ""You want to be cooked for, but don't want to cook.""

The fix is really simple and there's basically only 2 outcomes:

1) You perform oral sex on your awesome girlfriend of nearly 2 years.  She orgasms.  You continue to do this for the rest of the relationship.  In return, you also receive fellatio.  

2) You refuse to give your awesome girlfriend of 2 years the oral sex that she wants and she refuses to give you the oral sex you want in return.  Nobody's happy.  Eventually either you decide that choice #1 seems to make sense or you mutually break up.

As for this:

&gt; If this was a deal breaker for her why is this only being brought up now?

It was, you missed it.  She said that's primarily how she orgasms and you ignored it.  She said she was trying to be subtle and you missed it.  (She is, now, trying to be not-subtle.  It's an improvement in sexual communication.)  Lastly, you said this ""Maybe I would come around to it in the future.""  While she reacted as though you just said ""Nope, never."" it's possible she paid more attention to the phrasing than her response suggests.  Meaning, she may have been hoping you would come around to it.

In general though, you're probably going to want to learn how to do this and either not hate it or actually enjoy it.","1430438794"

People like sharing their joy with others. They're not ""made up for karma"", they're fashioned to portray that joy for others to join in. Upvoting is simply one way reddit allows you to express that.

The key bit of the guidance is that you are led to certain specific paths (which prayers really help with) rather than allowing the mind to go wherever it may.

Some people may use the Bechdel test in such arguments, but that's not at all inherent to what was originally a lesbian joke in a light-hearted comic strip. In a broader but more serious context, the Bechdel test is simply used to illustrate the pervasiveness of imbalances in media representation that relegate women to secondary roles.

That doesn't claim to evaluate the worth of a film (as if the Bechdel test *should* separate classics and pornos into distinct categories), nor does it claim to propose an alternative to a free-market model where people consume what they want and produce what sells. It's merely a simply way to illustrate a prevalence of a certain kind of male-centric perspectives in media.","1430438796"

---

&gt;__Human immunodeficiency virus infection__ and __acquired immune deficiency syndrome__ (__HIV/AIDS__) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the [human immunodeficiency virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV) (HIV).    Following initial infection, a person may experience a brief period of [influenza-like illness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza-like_illness). This is typically followed by a prolonged period without symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more and more with the immune system, making the person much more susceptible to common infections like [tuberculosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuberculosis), as well as [opportunistic infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_infection) and [tumors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumors) that do not usually affect people who have working immune systems. The late symptoms of the infection are referred to as __AIDS__. This stage is often complicated by an infection of the lung known as [pneumocystis pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumocystis_pneumonia), [severe weight loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cachexia), a type of cancer known as [Kaposi's sarcoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaposi%27s_sarcoma), or other [AIDS-defining conditions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS-defining_clinical_condition).

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","As silly as awards feel, and as much as the humble Airmen often don't care about (and may even resist) formal recognition, it is important to understand how important awards can be in a long-term career.  As we move into the new EPR system where only 15% can be 4s or 5s, it will be those awards that set you apart (or don't) from other Airmen.  If you ever want to do special duties, those awards will set you apart.  If you ever want to make SMSgt, those awards will set you apart.

And awards build awards.  You get coined, then you win a monthly, then you win a quarterly, then you win a yearly, and then these other awards come up and your supervisor already knows you're competitive AND has the package over half done from writing your previous awards.  Roll with it and good things can come of it.  Remember this when you're a supervisor too.  Your Airmen that don't know will need someone to look out for them, and of course, it isn't uncommon to use subordinate awards as one-of-many metrics to measure NCOs and SNCOs.  A SNCO who can show a pile of awards their subordinates have received is clearly doing something right  for their people.","1430438798"

I didn't sleep well last night, but I did get a nap in today, woot.  I was so out of it this morning.. I bid on an ebay auction and didn't realize I had won for several hours later.  The item is by a brand called iiJin, which I had never heard of before.  After research, I discovered it's a Korean brand that seems to be famous for its interesting shoe designs.  If you're interested, check out [their site.](http://www.iijin.com/online-shop/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=product&amp;id=1&amp;sid=23)  I bought a non-shoe item via ebay, but I would so rock [these](http://www.iijin.com/online-shop/index.php?lang=en&amp;page=productDetail&amp;id=1&amp;tid=0&amp;psid=714) if they weren't so pricey and out of stock.","1430438800"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You are absolutely correct, we have no way of knowing; that relationship could have ended for any number of reasons, his fault, her fault, or nobodies.  But many relationships do end after the birth of a child and the new parents being unable to adjust to the new dynamic, particularly with new fathers having issues of not feeling respected, valued or important.  Considering the lack of understanding shown in the original post at age 30, I'm doubtful OP was more understanding in his lower 20s, and I'm sure there are plenty of mistakes to learn from.

This seems pretty classic stressed out new mom and frustrated father not communicating and taking out their frustration by sniping at each other.  Yeah, mom shouldn't be taking every opportunity to belittle dad, but dad telling new (probably exhausted) mom to back off because she isn't doing anything around the house is the opposite of helping.

&gt; Me: (goes back to bed after taking son to school)
&gt; Her: Are you going to wake up now? You got shitty with me about going to bed last night, are you going to sleep all day?
&gt; Me: I'm awake, my stomach hurts, I didn't think my sleep schedule was a democratic process.
&gt; Her: Well there are still dishes from last night that need to be done!
&gt; Me: You need to lay off, you haven't done anything but laundry for months, I made dinner last night, and took the trash out this morning, etc etc, I don't give you shit about it
&gt; Her: Well I want to vacuum today so you need to get up. (storms off)

The above exchange shows two people who seem to have no respect for what the other is doing and one of them is going to have to make the first move for a while in appreciating the other and not making the situation worse.  Since OP is the one here asking for help, and has gone through a new child before, he is probably best choice for making that first move.","1430438800"

If they say no, ask for their supervisor or higher up. If they insist they do no have have such a person, ask who else you can speak to. Or insist they do, and maybe repeat the original script.

Then continue with whomever you get transfered to. You may go in circles. Write down the names of the people you speak to. Be polite. You may go around more than once, and you don't want them to hang up

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","I was born in North Van. 

My parents went to Carson Graham together in highschool. My Dad was born in Chilliwack but moved around a bit as his Dad was in the army. They ended up in North Van, and when his parents split his mom rented places all over the North Shore. His family history is pretty predominantly Canadian going back a few generations to settlers in Ontario and Quebec.

My Mom was born in Winnipeg, shortly after her parents immigrated here from the UK. They moved around a ton while my Grandad looked for work (Quebec, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC). They eventually bought a house of Capilano Road in 1973, and moved out that same house 2012. They still live in North Van.

My folks left North Van in 1989, they could afford to buy a house in North Van or my Dad could finish his Master's Degree but not both. They did however stay within a couple hours of Vancouver to stay close to family.

I lived in North Van for exactly 2 years of my life (1987-1989), I grew up just outside of Vancouver, spent university on Vancouver Island, and moved back to Burnaby for 1 year in 2010. When I was offered 2 jobs (1 in downtown Vancouver, and one on Vancouver Island) I jumped ship because they paid the same but my quality of living would be shit in Vancouver, and I'd never be able to afford a house. Do I regret it? A little, I'd love to live there, but this way I'll be able to buy a house one day.","1430438803"

The Canadian gave more presence to the eathy notes of this one and subdued the others somewhat

**Palate**: salt, some caramel, more salt

What happened? I was looking forward to earthy lemony caramel... 

**Finish**: Lemon followed by salt, after letting it open (30+minutes) a touch of the earthiness I was hoping for earlier

This is not the dram I was looking for.... Great start with the nose, but all that salt afterwards... I won't be buying this one again. **50**/100","1430438807"

I'm not saying live a 2 hr bus ride away, but even living just not ""in walking distance to school"" can be a big money saver. Also think about getting a job if you can! I know a lot of degrees are hella demanding (shoutout to the 3rd year engineering kids who have 7 courses/semester!) time-wise, but if you think you can manage it, look into it! Schools offer a lot of part-time job options for students and they're great about accommodating your schedule and being ok with you being gone during breaks and the like.

If you're going to get so drunk that you offer to sleep with me when you probably would not have casual sex otherwise, that's on you, not me. How am I to always know whether you're too impaired to make a decision for yourself?

Obviously I'm not going to fuck someone who's so intoxicated they aren't equal participants (i.e passed out, not fully aware of surroundings, acting erratically etc), but if a girl is actively seducing me, it sure as hell isn't rape.

The only issue you might have going back to the 2TB backup is programs. Most programs installed to the 4TB will also make registry changes on the SSD's installation. If you then not from the 2TB drive then those registry values won't exist and programs that depend on those values won't run.

My suggestion, after the SSD is up and running, wipe the 2TB drive, make an image of your SSD, and store it on the 2TB or 4TB drive. Then, if the SSD dies or the OS gets hosed you can just restore that image. Periodically remake the image so it doesn't fall to far behind.

Also, sign up for DropBox or GoogleDrive and save your important documents in the cloud. They will be automatically synched so you have an off-site, professionally-managed backup of critical documents.","1430438808"

I was placed on academic probation and was seeing a counselor for suicidal tendencies and self harm. This was a drastic change from high school, where I was rank #2 out of my entire class and had full ride scholarship offers. I was able to make positive changes very slowly and eventually improved my grades. I had to retake a lot of courses of course but I still graduated on time by taking summer courses. I remember feeling as if I had ruined my entire life already so why now remove myself from the equation? Please believe me when I say your life isn't ruined. You'll be able to pay these bills off.

Yet they still have infinitely more knowledge about what it is like to play this game than you and you call them casuals. They complain because (news flash!) Survivor is a difficult game and you shouldn't be able to continually circumvent the hunger and discomfort. It isn't Lets Make a Deal after all. Your S2 comparison is flawed in the fact that production approached the castaways, not the other way around, for that rice exchange since they were actually concerned for their long term health.

How do you quantify craft by the way? Genuinely curious here. I know people think that the new Star Trek reboot is amazingly well done. I disagree. I think it is a shitshow. Am I wrong and they are right? Or is it the other way around? Maybe it's entirely subjective like flavors of soda and what seasons of Survivor are ""good"".

"Clojure","t5_2qkej","Laziness is great. Building up seqs recursively with `lazy-seq` can be super elegant - I recently wrote code to fetch a lazy sequence of items from a list key in [Redis](http://redis.io), transparently fetching in batches, for when the size of the whole list may exceed memory on the client which is pretty nifty. Clojure's lazy seq stuff made the code pretty clean and a breeze to write.

However, I wish I spent more time really studying it and deeply understanding things like head retention and memoization earlier when I was getting started, which I've been bitten by many times (many of our datasets are larger than available memory). If you incorrectly handle a large lazy seq, things will explode and youll run out of memory.

The vast majority of Clojure's core functions return lazy seqs (when applicable); it's usually called out on [clojuredocs.org](http://clojuredocs.org) (e.g., see [map](http://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map)), and I've spent a surprising amount of time digging through [clojure's core.clj](https://github.com/clojure/clojure/blob/master/src/clj/clojure/core.clj) to verify details for myself.

I've only been bitten once or twice by things not evaluating when I expected them to, eg.

    (let [foo (range 10)]
      (map fn-with-side-effects foo) ; Won't run! Need `doall` or `doseq`
      :baz)

Again, head retention is super important to watch out for. A naive example:

    (def huge-coll (range 1e10))
    (println (count huge-coll))
    ; Uh oh! huge-coll is lazy, but since we used `def` its head is
    ; retained and taking up tons of memory","1430438813"

If I remember it correctly they attended a kind of town-hall style meeting for people who were worried about Muslims in Britain. What surprised me was a young gay man stood up and said he supported UKIP as Muslims disliked gay people, and he thought their position on immigration would limit homophobia from the Muslim community.

This scene definitely happened - I'm just unsure if it's from the exact programme I mentioned above. But whichever programme it came from, I was shocked by this attitude on so many levels.  But maybe it can shed some light on why your mother intends to vote UKIP - a misunderstanding of the country's original problems and an incorrect understanding of what the party stands for and would achieve.","1430438814"

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","The paper might be bad, but they should have said nothing about gender.  They could have said that the paper was methodologically weak and ideologically biased.

Since the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition, the reviewer probably could have said that getting some input from men would be valuable.  Just as a paper about gender differences authored only by men might benefit from the reverse advice.

The speculation about stamina and work hours was inappropriate and barely related to the peer review.

EDIT: I'm now putting it together that the paper was about gender differences in the PhD to postdoc transition.  So I suppose the snippets might be relevant to the submitted study, and not just a commentary on the gender of the authors.  If the study concluded that there was sexism in academia, it makes sense that alternative explanations should have been investigated.  So I'm going to say it sounds bad, but perhaps not as bad in context.  I'll reserve judgement.","1430438820"

There is too much chance that flukes, minor tilt, or cheese strategies confounded the overall results. Which is to say, TSM didn't necessarily win based off of luck or cheese, but WE might have won off luck or tilt(although spirit was impressive as hell), given there was only 1 series that featured a total of 5 possible games. 

Thoorin did a great summary on the whole situation on his youtube channel. Because he was willing to say TSM did show great skill (probably the best in the west), but globally it didn't set them up to be a top 3 team in the world based on such a small sample and inferior rule set for how the matches went.

At 8:46 a.m., Gray was unloaded to be placed in leg irons, police citing Gray was ""irate"". Another stop, recorded by a private camera, shows the van stopped at a grocery store. At 8:59 a.m., a second prisoner was placed in the vehicle while officers checked on Gray's condition, and 27 minutes later the van makes its final stop so paramedics can transport an unconscious Gray to the hospital.[17] He was taken to the University of Maryland R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center, in a coma.

As such, it does draw attention to a real tendency in movies. however, the implication that this is misogyny is a bit of a leap.

There are many factors at play. Gender roles absolutely result in some of those factors. however it's not simply anti-woman. It's restrictive assumptions and expectations placed on both men and women.

I ranted about this at great length here: http://www.reddit.com/r/FeMRADebates/comments/2uu7pp/genre_responsibility_empathy_value_and_women_in/

Then there's also the fact that, in movies intended for male audiences, the focus is most often on male characters.

"asianamerican","t5_2rfyw","I should clarify my point.  I agree with you when you say that ethnic tribalism is something to consider.  But you seem to have been arguing that ethnic tribalism is good and *should* be the only thing to consider.  I am not just arguing that class is a factor, but that class should be *the* most important factor in solidarity and pan-ethnic struggle.  

For example, it doesn't make any sense at all for low-wage South Asian workers to ally themselves with the South-Asian-lead business councils and lobbyist groups--their interests are entirely opposite.  It does make sense, however, for them to ally with Latino immigrants, for example.  

Likewise, back in the '60s, it *should* have made sense for White and Black workers in midwestern industrial cities to ally with one another--but too many White workers were held back because of their racial tribalism and White supremacist attitudes, and everybody was weakened because of it.  On other other, during this same time period, many Black and White people in the ghettos of Chicago successfully organized alongside one another to address issues of poverty and police violence, and forged an incredibly powerful alliance.

All in all, I would argue that economic dynamics are hugely influential in impacting how social and political dynamics play out.  As such, organizing with class in mind can and should be a way to cut across racial lines and fight for a better world.","1430438830"

My point was that the Phillies are hobbled by the gambles that they took giving big contracts to guys like Howard, Utley, and Lee, who are all making a ton of money and barely playing quad A level ball (if playing at all), but who can't be moved.  As a result of the choices the front office made to keep those few players with the organization, it's going to be a long road to rebuild back to a competitive level.  While it's a different scenario, it comes down to the same principle - it's very to risk all of your resources - whether those resources are financial or player skill - just to make sure you land one or two guys, particularly when you're then left with insufficient resources to let you surround those guys with sufficient complimentarily skilled players to make the whole thing succeed.

Move to Los Angeles. Volunteer for indie projects. Network. Give up gaming for reading screenplays. Collaborate. Produce something. Keep producing.

The friends I have that are in guilds spend nearly every waking hour living and breathing movies, and they don't make much money at all. They do have hobbies (such as comics), but they fall by the wayside. Their hobbies seem to become watching movies. Making movies has become their hobby. If you can't give up gaming, then you're probably not that serious about it. Remember, you can always come back to your hobbies if things don't work out.

Like you said, Breaking Bad was rejected by several networks, and Vince was an established writer. There really aren't that many screen writers in Hollywood, so it's a tough proposition. Vince gave the best advice I can think of; you need persistence, but you also need talent and luck. Hone your craft, write a large stack of screenplays, and then decide if its for you.

First, its not at all clear that good things (economic growth, poverty reduction, real wage increases, whatever) will happen if people and businesses get more economic freedom.

This isn't to say that free markets never work, only that in some markets and in some conditions, they don't.

Second, liberty is a really ambiguous idea.  Does my right to vote matter if there are no roads to get to polling stations?  Is my right to ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" meaningful if I'm unemployed and can only afford to live in a crime-ridden neighborhood?

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Is it that big a deal that it was suggested they bring on the opposite gender to help remove bias from a study on gender differences? I mean it makes sense to me.

It's not like they were doing a paper on the migration patterns of exotic birds or anything, it was specifically related to gender and therefore there is a strong likelihood that the results could contain bias if only one of the genders is actually doing the study. Getting a male author could eliminate that problem.

I do find it kind of ironic that the women were told they were biased and so they instantly complained they were victims of sexism. To me that is just a clear indication that they were indeed biased, like they were looking for it (called confirmation bias). It's a research study! They should be scientists first and women second, science is about being objective and looking at facts not about what you want to be the case.","1430438836"

"ClashOfClans","t5_2usfk","It doesn't need to be a unique solution. Let me give you a really simple example of why this is a brute force method. Human error is irrelevant. X + Y = 150, brute force on this is guess and test every combination of X and Y that makes the equation true. There isn't a unique key and the simple algorithm is choose a value for X, then 150 - X = Y. For a base, you just choose an attack comp, see how it does, then choose a new comp if you don't think it is going to lead to a possible solution. You just have to choose random values for more than one variable (i.e. deployment, troop/spell loadout, etc). 

&gt;Often times after spending 30 minutes trying to figure out a base you are forced to give up and move on to the next target.

If we are talking about free, unlimited sandboxing, 30 minutes is far less than the amount of time I would expect people to put into practicing on a base. A good base I would imagine would take a few hours. A great base I would imagine would take a more sizable chunk of time. If they are giving up after 30 minutes, they aren't really taking advantage of the tool and aren't really determined to find a 2/3 star strategy. Nothing is forcing you to give up and move on.

&gt;I'd prefer more multiplayer variety in an online game... but I'd take anything that actually adds more actual gameplay.

Agreed, although I don't think there's a way without hurting the multiplayer aspect, although....

&gt;I believe most have this notion because of the unfair advantage created by cheats. Had the game been originally designed with practice attacks I think people would see it very differently. Getting more use and game time out of your 3 hour army build can be designed in a way that is positive for the gamer.

That's a good point and it might be more widely accepted if they had implemented in the beginning. At least not including traps and CC in a sandbox attack would at least help make it so there was something still unexpected in the base. I would be surprised though if the developers never thought of the idea for a practice attack mode and just didn't find an effective way of balancing it","1430438837"

"asianamerican","t5_2rfyw","&gt; Fonseca says...  it was a moment to vent frustration over what they see as economic injustice... They profit off of us, he says, but they give nothing back.

First of all, the idea that wanton destruction of people's businesses, property, and livelihoods can be reduced to ""vent[ing]"" is as disgusting as it is laughable. Most immigrant small businesses operate on incredibly slim margins, and it isn't unheard of for much smaller crises than riots to force many to close their doors. In the LA riots of 1992, less than a quarter of Korea Town's businesses ever opened up again, to say nothing of the emotional damage suffered by the people who lived there. Calling rioting ""vent[ing]"" is supremely reductive and frankly disrespectful to the people who invested their lives and the lives of their families to make their businesses possible and sustainable.

Secondly, I wonder how familiar the person being quoted is with the actual inner operations of Asian American small businesses. I wonder if he is aware that the majority of Asian American small business owners don't even take a salary and most of their employees are family members who don't get paid either. They literally pay the rent, utilities, and operating costs of their businesses, and pay the rent and utilities of their home, using whatever is left to pay for food and gas, and saving what small amount they can in order to pay for their children's education and very likely neglecting their own retirement.

There's a reason why Asian small businesses seem so insular: it's because they are literally family businesses wherein the ""employees"" accept law-breaking hours, get paid in food and shelter, and literally live and work under the same roofs.","1430438837"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Here are my thoughts on how EMDrive works that I posted on another thread.

&gt;I've experimented with a similar idea using objects instead of electromagnetic radiation.

&gt;The law of conservation is not being broken, instead what is happening is that the ""equal and opposite reaction"" is happening at different time intervals.

&gt;What is essentially happening is that when the microwaves hit a wall, they push the device in that direction, and the reflected microwave then goes towards the cavity that is V shaped. This cavity causes the reflection to be only partially cancelled, and as it continues bouncing around it gets cancelled completely over time.

&gt;It takes small incremental steps, but with the billions of microwaves being reflected, it appears to be a continuous movement.

&gt;Try an experiment at home, get on a computer chair and lift your legs up. Now without touching the floor try moving the chair by kicking. Your chair will move due to friction, but if you notice, it will move forward then back. This device basically just slows down the ""going back"" part. So, if you keep going forward faster than the chair wanting to go back, you can create movement in vaccuum/space.

The question is really what's the feminist argument *for* the Bechdel Test? Does it really illustrate anything useful about an individual movie or movies in general?

Numerous tests can be devised, the Mako Mori test, the is violence by women against men played for laughs test, but they all oversimplify.

Regi was Chaox's close friend and Dyrus was his best friend, but Chaox and Regi kept getting in disputes which put strain on them from time to time, as well as Chaox underperforming and steadily getting worse. Regi did what they had to do, and a mixture of the strain on their relationship, chaox being hurt from regi benching him, neither one of them wanting to particularly come forward to the other and how close they once were just made for one of those situations that people tend to stop talking all together.

There is probably no 'bad blood' now. They more than likley dont talk now through having very little to talk about as well as no reason to start talking again. Chaox was hurt, Regi was also hurt, both just pushed passed it the way they deal with things and I guess never looked back.

Its a shame because if Chaox didnt take a break after getting benched hed have gotten on another team no bother (because Xpecial made him look amazing, and any team woulda picked him up) and hed have gotten more of a chance to work on his performance. Instead he took the break, and lost all chance for competative experience, and decided tocome back to the competative scene after so long, fell behind on meta shifts, and became 'rusty' so to speak, and now ks pretty much doomed to challanger series of whatever region he is in.

Stark now has a history of driving Audis. He's a billionaire, he wants to drive audis all the time, no problem.
the one with hawkeye and romanov was the one too far.

Banner has the *most legitimate reason ever* to want to unwind. Full size headphones are more immersive. beats is a popular brand. put on beats.
Its not like they were name dropped like trans4mers.

The entire point is that the richest countries help out. If we were a net recipient of EU funding we wouldn't be having a conservation about whether the EU is right for us because we'd want to be in it so we could move to Germany.

But because countries are only wealthy in general and often include areas of much larger deprivation sometimes net contributors benefit from those kinds of programmes. It's embarrassing really that there are even areas so deprived in Britain that the EU has even needed to designate some of them as convergence zones.

If your every-day life is balanced and normal, there may be emotional depth and chaos that is not easily expressed in real life. People are relieved when they watch horror movies and emotional movies like you're describing, because it puts them in a spot to be vulnerable and emotional while still being safe at home or in a theater.

Never heard this before, but it sounds so true. When I think of it, my real life sounds so dull and emotionless compared to movies - not in a bad way, just that... not many bad things happen, super deep emotional moments happen rarely too. These movies sort of help me experience the more extreme range of emotions that real life doesn't always give opportunities to experience.","1430438845"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","GIF is a ""normal"" image format like many others including JPG, TIFF and PNG.  GIF was probably the most common format on the early web.  It works best where there are large areas of the same colour and its limit of 256 colours tends not to be an issue for maps.  It's a lossless format so all those hard edges common in maps reproduce correctly whereas JPG, designed more for real-world images, tends to leave artifacts.  GIF is also very old and simple so browser support is assured.

PNG was the successor format to GIF, pushed by issues around patents that have since expired.  It has better compression and other advantages but I suspect Google went with GIF for its maps early on when browser support for PNG was not quite good enough.

For all those webmasters out there hosting sites displaying logos and similar artwork with only a few solid colours as JPG files, that's probably the wrong thing to do; PNG or GIF is a better choice.  Leave JPG for photographic images.  Even at quite high quality settings (and large file sizes) JPG can mess up the clean edges common in logos.","1430438845"

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","We're 25. She definitely has some sort of block where she thinks I am out of her league (she has said as much, ""you're out of my league,"" and not in a fun-compliments kind of way). I don't mean this in an actually-narcissistic way, but I think at the start of our relationship she was sort of enthralled by me, because to strangers I apparently come across as very aloof and certain of myself (so she says), and I am more ""conventionally attractive"" than her (aka more feminine, she's more like an outdoorsy tomboy and doesn't get attention about her appearance). She'll talk about sex in a distant clinical way if I bring it up, but she gets really, really embarrassed by *sexual talk* if you get what I mean. And, our talks about sex are always initiated by me as she has nothing to contribute about it. She has a really deep issue with shame surrounding being turned on or having desire, and as such has no fantasies or anything to share with me. Of course, she also refuses to go to any kind of therapy. Ironically, I am the one who was raised Catholic where she was raised Atheist! (Obviously I didn't stick with *that*!) I hope for her sake that if we do split up she can find some sexual nirvana with someone else, but as it sits now I really do think it's either not there, or locked away so tightly she'd need genuine sex therapy to coax it out. But, to her credit we have had some really good, really healing conversations recently where she has appeared to understand my angle better. Doesn't mean it is actually changing at all in practice.

&gt;Do you feel like you guys can have really hard conversations without blowing up?

It's like playing minesweeper. Sometimes it'll go well, sometimes she'll say really snide underhanded hurtful things and then be like ""oh I just meant x"" and claim I'm invalidating her feelings if I get angry about it and ~boom~. Not that I'm perfect, I do get defensive. Actually, a lot of our sex problems started in conjunction with us fighting *a lot* because she used to blow up at me over tiny things (like, buying the wrong brand of pasta sauce...) but that doesn't happen anymore. She is still a generally high-strung person but she doesn't snap passive-aggressively these days. I'm not painting a very flattering picture of her here, but we barely fight because I told her I would break up with her on two separate occasions if she didn't cut it out, and we worked on ways for us both to create a less tense environment when there is a problem. Nonetheless, I think in light of all these sex problems I just feel... exhausted. Like, we worked so hard on the fighting thing, and the sex thing insidiously crept up at the same time, and now the fighting thing feels *fixed*, like okay she can get bitchy but it's a normal level (I think) and we communicate so much better. But then there's this now. It's like there's always something else to struggle with. EDIT: Additionally it also makes me feel like a crazy evil nag, because this marks Incident #3 of abcde telling her girlfriend ""this might end our relationship""! She's said to me ""you don't love me for who I am"" and ""I've changed so much for you."" Is she... wrong? Maybe not! And that feels pretty awful. Of course, what she changed was tbh kind of abusive behaviour!

*Further developed* is an excellent way to put it. I have thought long and hard about sex, I have written, read, watched and fantasized about porn, I have fooled around with people casually. I thought that would be okay, that she could just blossom *with* me, I'd never had *good* sex either at the time and it only seemed logical that people take a while to be comfortable. I have learned my lesson. I don't think I'd ever date someone sexually inexperienced again, either, and if I did, it would not be monogamously, and I would keep an eye out for these kinds of hang-ups. 

That discussion tool sounds fantastic. Whatever happens I'll probably try to incorporate something like that into my next healthy relationship. Did she receive it well?","1430438845"

 * 50g of Fat

 * 35g of Protein

 * 9.5g of Carbs

**Servings:**

 * 2 people

**Prep Time:**

 * 15 minutes

**Cook Time:**

 * 1 hour

**Ingredients:**

 * 1 spaghetti squash

 * 4 sausage links

 * 2 tbsp coconut oil

 * 1/2 red bell pepper

 * 1/2 green bell pepper

 * 1 egg

 * 2 oz white cheddar cheese

 * 2 tbsp parmesan

 * 1 tsp basil

 * 1 tsp crushed red pepper

 * 1/2 tsp garlic powder

 * 1 tsp salt

 * 1/2 tsp pepper

 * 1 tbsp fresh parsley

**Instructions:**

 * First, we’re going to prepare our spaghetti squash. Preheat the oven to 375°F.

 * Wash and slice (this is a laborious process) the squash horizontally into 1 inch rings. Lay them out on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and sprinkle with olive oil, salt and pepper.

 * Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes.

 * While it’s baking, let’s prepare the add ins. Cook your sausage links in a pan oiled with coconut oil on a medium-high heat until they’re brown on all sides (about 10 minutes). Whether or not they’re fully cooked, take the off the heat and let them rest for a minute.

 * While they’re resting, add some chopped peppers onto the pan to become tender.

 * While the peppers are cooking, slice your sausages into about ½ inch pieces and then add them to cook and marinade with the peppers.

 * At this point, add all the spices you’d like! We added salt, pepper, garlic powder, crushed red pepper, and basil.

 * When the bake time for the squash is up, you should notice the tops of each squash ring are darker and more saturated looking. This means the strands are loose enough to “spaghettify”.

 * Using a fork, tug away at the insides of the squash from it’s flesh. You should end of with little mounds of what looks just like spaghetti!

 * Throw in all the spaghetti squash to the pan and toss to combine. Let all the flavors incorporate.

 * Add in chunks of about 2 oz of white cheddar cheese. Stir to help melt them. Lower the heat to medium-low and let simmer covered for a few minutes.

 * Lastly, turn the heat off and crack an egg into the mix. Make sure to keep stirring and tossing the mix to not let much of the egg cook all at once. Stirring often will ensure the mix is creamy and fully covered instead of a large piece of fried egg in a corner.

 * Spoon a heaping helping into a plate and garnish with fresh, chopped parsley and Parmesan cheese. Enjoy your Low-Carbonara!

I understand a lot of what you're saying. There is some bad advice on this subreddit that could be easily solved by going to the sidebar or directly to this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/SWResources/comments/igh87/concerned_but_dont_know_what_to_say_here_are_some/ .

A lot of the people coming here are well intentioned but reddit tends to favor those with loud voices and angry messages so those often rub off onto others. 

While I can't really point you in a good direction for the defaults, you can find some very kind and supportive subreddits deep down in this website. One of my personal favorites at the moment is /r/TheChurchOfRogers which is based on kindness to others as if they were our neighbors (based on the show Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Maybe browsing there can give you these better and safer feelings.

Reddit is unfortunately a site taken over by the opinions of about 4000 people. If you ever look at the controversial tab of a subreddit or even scrolling far enough down, you'll find those hidden treasures of good comments. I hope you will find those same kinds of good comments under this post as well.

Never be afraid to reply OP. I'll be expecting that orange envelope. ","1430438848"

Lo exhibía como un jovencito prodigio futuro heredero, pero seguía controlándolo todo, sin dejar nada del mando, ni permitir ninguna herencia, algo así como hace Isabel IIª de Granbretaña e Irlanda del Norte (el Reino Unido) con su hijo Carlitos el orejón. Así que comenzó a enfrentarse a él y éste lo defenestró. El único que entendió a Fraga fue Asnar, que lo envió al exilio gallego a que jugase al dominó con los viejos como Presidente de la Junta(plata) de Galicia. No has indicado el otro punto crucial en su vida: su divorcio, algo que le hizo entrar en contradicción completamente con su línea de pensamiento anterior.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","In terms of general strength of the species:  
No Balrog was ever described as being killed without the killer also perishing in the fight: Glorfindel, Ecthelion and Gandalf all died doing so. Two of the greatest First Age warriors and a Maiar. The only other time I can find any were killed was in the War of Wrath where it is merely written that ""The Balrogs were destroyed.""  
Dragons on the other hand seem to be capable of being killed by much lesser fighters. Glaurung was killed by Turin who survived-ish doing so, Ancalagon ""mightiest of the dragon-host"" was slain by Earendil who similarly survived. Then of course Bard slaying Smaug. None of these fighters are similar in prowess to Ecthelion or Glorfindel.  
So I'd say in terms of relative power that Balrogs are stronger than dragons, and Smaug is a much weaker dragon than many others. Another point would be dragons' need for rest, Glaurung is killed while sleeping, Smaug is sleeping in the first encounter with Bilbo, so I think they do fatigue, whereas Durin's Bane is capable of fighting for 10 days straight.  
However, Smaug does have the power of flight which could give him the advantage in larger battlefields, and as said Durin's Bane in the movie only has weapons of fire (although I can see no proof the whip is fiery in the books.)  
I think Durin's Bane would take the first round due to the confinement.  
Second round could be even, Smaug can take to the skies, but equally can't really do a huge amount to DB without getting close as breathing fire won't do much, I think fatigue might decide this in favour of DB.  
Third round's a tad ambiguous, Moria's a big place. 21st Hall with it's confinement would be similar to Erebor, Balrog win. The Bridge of Khazad-Dum and I think Smaug could do enough to collapse the bridge underneath DB, which I think you'd probably count as a win for Smaug, DB won't die certainly, but he's not gonna be fighting back.

Smaug wins the bonus round, anyone voiced by Bendict Cumberbatch is gonna win. Book-wise the ability to control darkness would be a pretty cool thing for DB to pull out though.

I'm a giver, sometimes to a fault.

It's one of those ""well wouldn't anyone do it because we are all human and that's what humans do?"" things, but apparently not. It sounds like you might be similar.

It's hard to remember that, yes, some people are horrifically self-centered, but the reality is that most people are good but they just don't pick up on the little things, especially if they're not a giver by nature.

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","He was in favor of modders making money for their work. He said that valve's system wasn't good though.

So you are spending $100 if you are using a bunch of piddly paid mods not worth their salt. Where as before it was free and you could experiment. I know I wouldn't use any of the mods I currently use if they were paid. Hell I wouldn't have gotten skyrim and I wouldn't get any Bethesda games in general if mods had a pay wall. 

Bethesda make big worlds but they are always so flat and you have to shove so many mods into them and unless you experience that, which TB hasn't, you just don't understand the largest issue with paid mods.

Yours is definitely one style of leadership and a style that works every day. Les's style at LSU is obviously a different one. 

Just analyzing Les's style, it clearly works with many guys, as several players LSU puts on these lists completely turn their college careers around, some even becoming captains. With others, it never worked (as noted by some Texans fans in here who drafted two of them). No strategy works with 100% of people 100% of the time. 

At the end of the day, players continue committing to LSU and they send more underclassmen to the league than anybody, so whatever they are doing, for the most part, it seems to be working.

Of course there isn't, I'm not trying to say there is. I'm honestly having a hard time finding the right words to state what I mean. There's absolutely nothing wrong with being autistic. 

&gt;It's my understanding that people transition because they have suicidal thoughts and literally cannot live outside of the gender role they're transitioning to.

Yes, absolutely many of them do. But some do so because they just feel more comfortable as the opposite gender. And many do feel suicidal thoughts about it, but they don't necessarily have *physical pain* when they hear their birth pronouns.

We have a few anecdotal instances of [woolly mammoth meat,](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2725/prehistoric-its-whats-for-dinner) that was frozen in tundra being eaten, but I can't vouch for their veracity.

I've not done any research on bacteria and viruses that can survive a hard, cold vacuum - but those would be the culprits in making something inedible after billions of years.

Enemy troop movement in the caves suggest a eminent attack. Platoons poor out of the warpgate and move straight for your Interlink.You rally troops to intercept the enemy and prepare to defend the base .You bring even pop to the fight and since you're defending you have the upper hand. Wave after wave of enemy forces smash off your troops making no progress .While defending the base you notice your NTU/ resources levels are low. Enemy infiltrators have installed a virus and destroyed all the turrets causing NTU levels to drop fast. The enemy couldn't break threw the defense so they decided to starve us of resource so the base would lose power and to go neutral giving the attackers a much needed advantage.After you notice the NTU drain you send 2 squads back to the warpgate with air and armor defense for a ant run.2 mins left before the NTU runs out and the loadstars are in the air with the ants in back.The armor and air left the warp gate mins before ,and are clearing out the enemy armor and air in and around the NTU silo. As the loadstars fly over the base  you make the call for friendly  emp's to go off to clear the way for the ants,and with seconds left the NTU silo is refiling and the base is safe, or so you thought. While you were planning your NTU run the enemy planned a max crash and sent 4 infiltrators into your basement to setup routers, and now  the enemy is 50 strong in your gen with 25 maxes standing next to your blown up generator .","1430438859"

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","I don't contribute that much to the mods I use. I comment on the thread on the features I like, and report game breaking bugs I haven't seen reported before. I certainly don't think I'm in any way entitled to have mods for free, and appreciate the work modders put in to their mods for no tangible benefit.

The reason I was worried about this was because there's a long history of sharing assets for free, and profit being made on mods could put an end to that. If I bought the COK mod for Warband would Floris get a cut, as COK was built on Floris? Would the guys who made Brytenwalda get a say in the monetization on all the mods that built on them?

What about IP seperate from the modded game? Non-profit stuff generally get a free pass, but could the Game of Thrones mod for Crusader Kings have been made if the modding scene was monetized?","1430438862"

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","At twelve I was watching whatever I could get my grubby paws on, but it was all mainstream. It didn't have to be extreme for me to realise that I was consuming imagery that was intentionally produced in a certain way, defined by peculiar traits and portraying sex as something polished, brutish and alien which I couldn't relate to in any meaningful sense. Amateur videos were much more interesting to me but curiously less arousing at that age, because I hadn't yet made the full connection between emotion and sex. My arousal depended entirely upon the visual, and I had no past experience to draw feelings from when I masturbated. So I knew from the beginning that my association with sex through porn was abstract and divorced from reality. What i really wanted was amateur porn of genuine teenagers my age having sensual, awkward sex of the kind I imagined, which of course didn't exist. I craved educational porn, I suppose, but what was available most easily was porn involving leggy blonde women of indeterminate age getting fucked mercilessly by brutish men who even then I felt disgusted looking at, performing the same litany of acts and positions over and over again. I remember thinking many times ""is this it?"" and ""where's the loving and the cuddling?"" It's interesting that I managed to distance myself from it as much as I did, considering how much I was watching. I was always thinking to myself ""could I ever do that to a girl?"" ""Is that really what I will be expected to do?"" ""How can that possibly be enjoyable?"" etc, questions like that. It turned me off, and yet I doubted my own feelings because this stuff seemed like it was everywhere. ""Surely, it must be me that's weird for not liking the idea of anal sex"" and stuff like this.

One side affect of porn that's affected me is the third person perspective. When you're having sex, you can't see the same angles that you can see in porn, and it made me realise how much I had begun to rely on those angles and those movements that porn focuses on. Together with the death grip problem, and finding that I was trying to replicate the feeling of masturbation through PIV, it made it difficult to come and I think that's when I first started to understand the negative effects of watching years of pornography from beginning of my sexually active life.

Good luck, you may fail numerous times but each time you get back up and start again you will be a little bit more determined. The thing to remember is, you are armed against it now. You understand the effects and that is a shield in itself.","1430438864"

Section 5. [**Book It!**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Hut#Book_It.21) of article  [**Pizza Hut**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza%20Hut): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;Pizza Hut has been a sponsor of the ""Book It!"" reading incentive program for children since the program's launch in 1984.  Students who read books according to the goal set by the classroom teacher, in any given month from October through March, are rewarded with a Pizza Hut certificate good for one free, one-topping Personal Pan Pizza. Some psychologists have criticized the program on the grounds that it may lead to [overjustification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect) and reduce children's intrinsic interest in reading.  However, a study of the program found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.  The program's 25th anniversary was in 2009. The Book It! program in Australia ceased in 2002 when Pizza Hut in Australia was removing its dine-in stores as Australians opted for take away pizza instead of dine-in.

Some companies have a policy not to notify candidates they've been rejected or provide feedback of any kind to avoid potential discrimination suits. It's shitty, but it's more a shitty company thing and not necessarily a shitty recruiter thing.

&gt;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjoRlV0eYIIxdERscDZtaFpULVNZaGZKcG5NWTdIRHc#gid=0

&gt;To give some more common examples for your reference:

    case 78:
        wPtr(1, (A_0) + 12);
        strcpy("""", getElemPtr(0, (A_0) + 32, 32), 32);

        break;

&gt;This one will either hide or show Chop's doghouse, bowl, and other props in Franks' backyard.

&gt;And to give an example of a multi-switch:

    case 76:
        wPtr(1, (A_0) + 12);
        strcpy(""TrevorsTrailer"", getElemPtr(0, (A_0) + 32, 32), 32);

        wPtr(0, (A_0) + 132);

Overall, the Pats are tied for third in getting the most talent (by Total CareerAV) out of our drafts, despite being the most successful franchise in the league in this period.  This is a combination of BB being able to accumulate picks (via lopsided trades) and being above average (9th out of 32) at getting CareerAV for our pick value.  

The only reason this graph makes us look bad is small sample size including our two worst drafts (2007, 2008).","1430438875"

"wow","t5_2qio8","A few things;

* Gear doesn't matter at your current level, it matters at a 100
* Switching to Arms or Fury might be a better idea once you reach a 100 or are finding it hard to tank without people getting up your butt about mistakes. Being a damage dealer in a group setting is a lot less pressure because you aren't expected to know much of anything
* Join a social guild that has a raid team and see if they will let you learn the ropes. At end game there are a number of different types of guilds; strictly social ones that don't raid, social ones that have raid teams, casual raiding guilds that raid norm/heroic, semi hardcore guilds that raid heroic and dabble in mythic and progression guilds that are focused on clearing mythic. My advice is to try and get into a social or casual raiding guild as they explore more elements of the game and are often friendlier. 
* Each dungeon and raid boss has a loot table with various drops that will vary from kill to kill. In dungeons and looking for raid, all loot is personal. In raids at the norm/heroic/mythic level there is an option to have that loot on master looter or personal, with most choosing the first option.
* Once you hit a 100 there are a few ways to gear; you can randomly queue for pvp battlegrounds which will award you honor which you can the spend at a vendor to buy 620 ilvl gear. You can queue for normal dungeons at level 100 when your ilvl is below 610, once it is above that, you can queue for heroic dungeons which drop 630 gear. I think that the best path for you would be to enter some random pvp battlegrounds for that honor gear I mentioned, until your ilvl is above 610. From there, queue up for heroic dungeons to farm 630 gear. Above that, there is the Looking For Raid option which allows you experience the Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry raids and they drop epic gear.

Out of the all of the above, the finding the right guild is probably going to be the most challenging. I suggest joining a social guild at the moment, and once youre at a 100 and at a decent ilvl 650 +, looking at finding a guild on your server that is raiding at a casual level. The best way to do this is to look on the guild recruitment forums or realm forum on the blizz website.

Good luck! Hit me up with your battletag if you want to have some help in game.  ","1430438878"

I remember when I used to think they were the ""hottest.""  That's when I believed there was such a thing as ""most attractive.""  There isn't.  Everyone has flaws.  There is what you're attracted to, and what you're turned off by.  The reason I was even attracted to them in the first place was because of their presence in the mass media.  There were always hot blonde bimbos running around on TV being featured as ""the best,"" or hottest.


The more you narrow your attraction criteria in an arbitrary, irrational manner, the less opportunities you have.

Actually receiving interest from 7-8 brunette hipster chicks is doing better than 95% of the male population.

Also, as you pointed out: ""party"" chicks are so dumb that any decent human being would want to ship them to a desert island after spending 5 minutes with them.","1430438880"

In that case T1 is an odd diagnosis.

From **[labtestsonline](http://labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/diabetes-auto/tab/test#what)**:

&gt;If no diabetes-related autoantibodies are present, then it is unlikely that the diabetes is type 1. 

The insulin dosage is not high, more like T1 levels, but I'll let the T1s comment on that. The goal of 160 is a bit loose, especially if your post-prandial test is not at your peak time.

What are your typical carb loads in meals?

PS.

&gt;I don't recall the results and they were never sent to me,

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Don't blame Telstra - Ziggy stated 15 years ago that Telstra's copper was ""5 minutes to midnight"" (his words). That's why they started rolling out HFC, which got canned when the NBN deals were brokered.

Now the NBN has been scrapped, and we're left with a network that Telstra has been doing minimal maintenance on for the last 15 years, due to a planned obsolescence.

Abbott has then gone ahead and balanced Australia's future on this dying network. Oh, and did I mention they sued TPG for rolling out it's own fibre once they canned FTTH NBN? In the end, it's the government that's fucked the network, not Telstra.

I WAS paying $230/mth for 10/10mbps business grade connection to my home in the Sydney CBD, 300m from the nearest exchange.

Marriage law has changed a multitude of times just over the history of our nation alone.

I feel that the issue is not paid mods in and of itself, **the issue is that they did it with Skyrim**.

&amp;nbsp;

Skyrim is nearly synonymous with modding in PC gaming circles. When you say you're going to play Skyrim a common response is ""With what mods?"". As Skyrim gets older, more and better mods come out, and this solidifies itself more and more. When people play Skyrim on PC they are expecting a modded, customizable experience rather than just the base game. When people are getting into downloading mods for the first time, it's usually with Skyrim.

&amp;nbsp;

Then comes the Paid Workshop. Suddenly what players got for free and already had an expectation of, now must be paid for. To many, it felt like content was being removed from a game years after launch and then put behind another paywall. 

Yes, they did only pay for the base game. However because Skyrim's launch was *years ago* the mods have become ingrained into many people's experiences with the game, emotionally identical and expected. Skyrim Steam Workshop is the place many first-time-mod-consumers go, and for them to see that some mods require payment gives them a wrong and jaded view of the entire rest of the modding scene.

&amp;nbsp;

Another factor in this is fear and worry as a player. Like many others, I never finished the Skyrim main story. I have it downloaded on my PC right now; I play it every now and then. I felt apprehension not knowing if I'd be locked out of the mods I already downloaded when I next started up the game. I also felt that I should play it immediately and 'finish' it before more mods become paid for and I lose access to them. This rushed experience is of course not complementary to the game.

&amp;nbsp;

In conclusion, I feel that a game this old and this ingrained in the mod scene was a bad game to start with. I feel that an example of a better introduction of the Paid Workshop would be with the next Elder Scrolls. No expectations, no (real or perceived) removal of content, and mods can be bigger and better with the knowledge of financial security.","1430438884"

And we don't expect you to know our states. I know Europeans hate hearing this but since most of your countries are smaller than our states, we generally don't view them as very important (Especially since many states have larger populations and economies than many European Nations).

I can't wait to hear this, especially since I love what he did with Bronson's Baby Blue.  
  
&gt; A$AP Rocky admits he’s only skimmed Kendrick Lamar’s To Pimp a Butterfly: “I got about two songs I liked.”  
  
This kinda upsets me. I mean, to each their own, but I was hoping Rocky would be a fan of a hip-hop album so highly acclaimed by nearly everyone. Then again, he said in an interview that he doesn't care about reviews. I was just hoping he'd be a fan.","1430438885"

In HW, you can tap TLoZ amiibos (Link, Zelda, Shiek, Ganondorf) at the title menu once a day to receive weapons for that character. In some cases, they can drop upgraded weapons (I got a Triforce Spinner from my Zelda Amiibo the first time I used it, but since then it's been lots of rapiers).

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","&gt; The relation between power and sourcing extends beyond official and corporate provision of day-to-day news to shaping the supply of “experts”...In this way bias may be structured, and the supply of experts may be skewed in the direction desired by the...“the market.”  As Henry Kissinger has pointed out, in this “age of the expert,” the “constituency” of the expert is “those who have a vested interest in commonly held opinions; elaborating and defining its consensus at a high level has, after all, made him an expert.”  It is therefore appropriate that this restructuring has taken place to allow the commonly held opinions (meaning those that are functional for elite interests) to continue to prevail.

When you are driving in one, it doesn't matter if you're going 5mph down main street or 201 around the track... because you know that you are in a marvel of human genius and luxury.

While probably not all of them are driving the father's porsche, I can assure you without visiting the links that not a single one of them ended up in jail, and I can even risk saying that the majority didn't even pay a fine or bail, being condemned to voluntary work, of which they do not work because they or their parents pay someone to testify and say that the guy is working.

"ClickerHeroes","t5_32820","Let's say your run lasts an entire day, DR will take you about 30 zones further at best. It's a decent little bonus but definitely not something you should rely on. When it's available go ahead and hit 8-6-9, but I wouldn't go 15 minutes without using any skills just for an extra 10% DPS (that'll take you less than one zone further - health increases by 15% every zone).

The strategy for a deep run depends a lot on whether you're gonna use an autoclicker or not. Either way, I never saw two people saying the same things about skills, I think everyone has their own way of managing skills depending on many factors.

I don't even know how *I* manage skills, I just ""feel"" it. Looking at the screen, my current DPS, cooldowns, etc., I just (kinda) know what to use, but I'm totally unable to explain it.","1430438894"

My $.02 
My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was ""free"", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).
Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt; Contrary to Israeli daydreaming, there are is no legal difference between major settlements bordering Jerusalem or deep in the West Bank. Leaving aside even the law, no Palestinian government will ever agree to allowing the entirety of what Israel sees as the ""major settlement blocs"" standing as part of a two-state solution because it makes territorial contiguity and connection of the major Palestinian cities of East Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and Ramallah impossible.

Out of curiosity, what did you think of Bibi's [""let the settlers become Palestinians""](http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/pa-settlers-can-become-palestinian-citizens-1.276727) idea? In short: the Israelis living in the small cities of Gush Etzion, Aa'ale Adumim, and Ariel (what the Israelis refer to as ""major settlement blocs"") would be given the choice to become a Palestinian citizen or go back to Israel.

**debate** [*dih-beyt*] **noun** a discussion, as of a public question in an assembly, involving opposing viewpoints. 

*-Dictionary.com*

I am not arguing against a bike’s legal right to be on the road. If you actually think that then you did not read my last few comments. Here, I will say it again. Bikes have a legal right to traverse the roads.

Bikes cause traffic! Get that one fact through your thick skull. That is what I was arguing and you failed to comprehend that. Several comments later you finally realize this fact and then the argument was over. The debate had ended and I had proven my point. You agreed to my viewpoint by saying

 &gt; I never said shit about cyclists not causing traffic.

Which is a sort of lie because our previous argument was how cars have to navigate around cyclists to pass, and that causes traffic jams. You did “*say shit*” because you kept refusing to admit that this act of slowing down, waiting for a clearing, and then passing, takes time can cause a massive buildup of traffic. Whatever the reason, you admitted that Cyclists do in fact cause traffic jams. So this debate is over. 

The link you provided is the first actual piece of argument material you have presented thus far. Good job. I’m actually very proud of you. Things like this are a key part of a healthy debate (Which I stated earlier is what our conversation is). However, the article you provided seems very biased in their study because it is a website dedicated to cyclists. I will agree that there is data supporting both our viewpoints (even yours!). The fact of the matter is Bikes do cause traffic jams. To what degree is arguable and will vary depending on location. We cannot argue data like this because it will lead nowhere. 

For example. I could show an anti-vaxer loads of evidence why vaccines are good yet they would not believe me. These arguments can get nowhere because the anti-vaxer can summon up their own study that supports their ideas. Thus no ground is made. You in this case are the anti-vaxer.

Maybe it is different in different places but where I live. Cyclists create big traffic jams that are an inconvenience. I don’t like traffic jams. So I don’t like cyclists. You are a cyclist. So I don’t like you. (I feel like I am repeating myself). You cannot really argue my points. They are all 100% fact. That’s like arguing the sky isn't blue or that cats don’t have fur.

Have a nice day. I do not wish to continue this debate for it is over. If you have a problem with this statement 

**“Cyclists on the road can create traffic jams”**

then you are to far gone and I cannot speak with you. I will end this debate with a quote from George Carlin. 

*“Never argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.”*

p.s Sorry for calling you an idiot, think of it as pay back for your prior “name call” of me.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I believe the answer is yes. I am not an economist and this is an amateur opinion.

 Here's how I came to that conclusion:

Lets talk about rent. Lets say that we think people aren't living in good conditions, too many people have to live in crappy homes and we want to help them afford better homes. So we just hand out cash. To everybody. What happens? Are there suddenly more homes for people to move into?

No. The number of homes is the same. And the landlords, they realize that everybody has more money, so they can raise their rent. So rent goes up. Now we're back in the same situation we were in before. People still can't afford rent, and giving them money wont help because landlords will just raise the rent.

That was a very crappy example, but it serves to show the point. Strip away all the nonsense in the situation I described: we aren't actually handing out money to people.

The point remains: if we increase the amount of money people get, sellers of goods and services will just raise their rent to compensate. It seems to me that if more money is being circulated, but the supply of goods doesn't increase, all that happens is you get inflation.

Now, there is the possibility that the increase in money will create a higher supply of goods. In the rent example from above, maybe some people will decide to create new housing to rent. But I don't think that the amount by which supply will increase will offset the effect of inflation. I am guessing inflation will win out.

In order to stay with a sub 4.4 40 running WR, a CB needs elite speed and agility (hips). If he has this, most teams are willing to ignore poor tackling ability.

I'm basically trying to say that while they may be braking up their winning roster I do think rekkles is much better than steelback and yellowstar and rekkles were a dominant bot lane. If fnatic wants to play better internationally I think its the right risk to take because bot lane was their weakest point.","1430438899"

Same with Germany and Ireland. Those were areas that were far away from major trade routes, devoid of any unique resources, the weather was awful and not conducive to their way of life. 

If, however, those areas were pleasant to live in (and if they were there wouldn't have been wave after wave of people migrating into Imperial territories, leading to Hadrian building a wall for instance) chances are if Egypt, Israel, Carthage, The Greek Kingdoms, and Gaul all fell to Rome then so would the Scots, Irish and Germans...If the Romans wanted to live in those countries.

"Baking","t5_2qx1h","I have done a lot of testing with stevia. One of the surprising properties is stevia is more hygroscopic than sugar so I found some baked goods are better and more moist with a little stevia mixed in. 

The downsides of stevia is the bitterness and it sucks with texture. The Splenda mix works way better for texture. 

You can try what you want, but I sell my baked goods so I need consistency  which means lots of testing. 

If you are baking, you are also using a lot of fat so I wouldn't worry about calories as much. However, I would say you could substitute up to 1/3 of the sugar with stevia (not the baking mix, but regular stevia) with minimal negatives and possibly more moist than sugar alone.","1430438905"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","hes not talking out of his ass, new cleaver promotes more less skill ceiling champs to be played, and nerfs further champs like Zed or Talon since they cant sit on brutalizer and get a cleaver when they need it. Phage is hella useless and the build path is awkward for every assassin.

Now we will have Gragas/ Sejuani etc (0 skill no brain champs) vs Vi/ Wukong etc which is the same but less tanky and more POINT CLICK cc which makes the game even more annoying to play since not even good reflexes qss save you (hello knockups on every new champ).

I guess Reddit rather have Kassadin midlane than LeBlanc because LeBlanc 'oneshots you' and kassadin does not (see SK vs FNC post-match thread where people cried about Fox oneshotting Steelback with 6 items nashor and 5 drakes).

The thing is this champs take 0 iq to play, 0 decision making and 0 mechanics, every player in the game above gold can get higher ranks just by saying in chat 'pls pick me sej i have all champs' since it gives an advantadge to the team.

He is right, he might not be as polite as le reddit fedoras want, but he is completely right.

And Riot is now buffing Shyvana, Trundle, already buffed Dr. Mundo, Ryze and every champ that can use the new cleaver properly (hello Darius + his ult changes) that make no sense whatsoever, 5.5 was the worst patch that Riot has ever made.

* Make sure the clients are domain joined
* Try setting up a WINS server and pushing that setting out with your DHCP server
* Set up an old computer as a Linux Samba server.  Don't need to create any shares on it, but set the OS Level to something stupid high, like 70.

"okc","t5_2r053","I really know nothing about the home ownership scene, I rent, personally.

I can tell you a bit of my opinion on the crime. I've been an OK resident for five years about? I live in the NW quadrant of the city currently, and I'd say it's fine. Edmond and Bethany seem really good too.  Oklahoma city does have some weird stuff. I think some of the high crime rates have to do with a few things: lack of funding for social programs, really harsh crime policies, drug problems, and poverty levels. OKC in particular sits as a major trafficking platform because of the highways. Oklahoma has really harsh crime punishment, and as a fun fact, our incarceration rate for women is twice the national average, and half of oklahoma prisoners are incarcerated for nonviolent and property offenses. We also have about as many slot machines per capita as Nevada. (Does that tie into crime? I have no idea. I just thought about it.) And as far as gang violence goes, I know there are a few, but every large city has em. I've never actually really heard anything about gangs except some coworker talking about it being in the NW 122nd and Pennsylvania Ave. area.

I've lived Edmond, South Side, NW (asian district, plaza district), and in the past **five** years, my and my SO's direct experiences with crime:  
* Saw a fight break out with some homeless dudes next to the shelter.  
* My car was robbed once while I was at the mall, but I accidentally left the doors unlocked, so it was my own fault.  
* My car windows (and several on the street) were shot out back when I lived southside, and the car was egged.  
* Saw a dude get shot in the neck (knew it was a bad neighborhood) by some other dudes he was arguing with late one evening.  
* If you want to count it, I get approached by bozos at the gas station a lot for money.  

I would never say like I've really felt the majority of the city is unsafe. Southside can be a little rough, East side can be rough. I don't know many people who live in those quadrants though. I've heard stories about violent crimes that involve late nights, homeless populations, or occur on the east/south side. I've lived here five years, and I don't think anyone I know would say they think OKC is unsafe. I really like OKC a lot!

Furthermore, this is as war has always been - it's not about ""who's right"" it's about ""who's resources we want to grab"" - so Britain and the five eyes and you, who will trip over himself to have the last word, can eat a barrel of dicks.

But that didn't stop them from calling me everyday for 2 weeks!

Flash forward a few years to when my original POS got rear ended and totaled :( I was on the market for a Civic, so we decided to drop by that dealership. We asked the salesman what they had for under $8k (didn't specify any type of vehicle), and they quickly told us they didn't have any. Never mind the fact that we drove by several of them on our way on! The $8k just wasn't worth it to them.

Went to a dealer across town, and dropped $13k on an awesome Civic. I made damn sure to tell the first place all about the sale they lost. Jerks.

It's good way to start.  You won't feel much power, but you'll learn the wind window and figure out your line management when launching and landing. It's really best to do all that before jumping onto anything 2m+ that will have real juice in the right winds.

btw, 2-line kites are measured by their width across the canopy, and 4-liners are measured by their sq. area.  So the snapshot is 1.4 meters across, but is only a 0.7 sq meter in 4-line terms.

"poker","t5_2qhix","I would bet if I knew villain made looser calls to 3-bets. Here's a [sample range](http://i.imgur.com/U1afe2K.png) of what villain could have if we knows he calls with hands like KQs and small pocket pairs. There are some combos removed because we have QQ and there's an ace on the flop, but 30 out of 74 combos in this sample range include an ace or have flopped a set. No matter what we bet, we're not getting those hands to fold. So 40% of the time, he will be calling or raising us. Given that betting half pot is usually a very weak bet size, we could bet 3/5 pot, as this size gives us more fold equity and only has to work 37.5% of the time for us to break even. If he folds all his non-aces and non-sets, which make up 60% of his range, then betting is a profitable play. We could check however, as we have 55% equity against this range. I favor betting, because checking allows villain to bet with almost all his range on the turn, and unless we turn a Q, we probably have to fold.

Edit: If we check back and villain bets the turn, we can call and hope it goes check-check on the river, but if he bets again, we're in a tough spot without a read. It comes down to your knowledge of villain's game and villain's perception of you. To call a turn bet and be able to call down on most rivers, then we need to know how often villain would bluff in this spot. We're crushed by all his value hands, so we would be calling down with a bluff-catcher. Calling the turn and folding the river would likely be more spewy than betting the flop, and to call down the turn, we kind of need to call the river as well (the spewiest line possible), which is why we can't call the turn without a read. Therefore, betting is the best option.","1430438914"

""So?""
""So for fuck's sake, get it out of your fucking head that you will have any chance against him! You can't take this fight! It's been 4 years since you went to train on the East Coast, you're soft, there are no real fighters out where you've been!"" He's begun hyperventilating at this point. He doesn't even get this worked up when he coaches me, something is not right. ""What else is the problem?""
""What do you fucking mean the other problem? The problem is you'll lose!"" He's lying, he keeps pacing and playing with his watch.
""Why are you so against it?"" He stops pacing and looks at me. The look on his face is something I have never seen before and never will see again. His face showed a feeling of loss, depression, like something had broken inside of him. Sighing he sat down on the locker room bench across from me. Elbows on the knees of his sweatpants, his hands clasped in front of his face as if praying to god. Another long sigh and he starts his story.
""I wasn't always a boxing trainer. I used to work with monsters. Underground fighters all over the world would come to learn how to kill someone in a ring.""
This was a side of him I had seen before many matches ago. A side that had seen hell and created its demons.
""I found him while traveling the slums of India looking for fighters. I was looking for desperate men, the kind who have nothing and don't care, the kind that don't treat people like human beings. I wasn't looking for a kid. But I found one. A kid who had eyes that had seen things that no one should see.""
""How did you know he was going to be a fighter?""
""He came up to me and asked for change. One of the other trainers, Ed thought it would be funny to kick him in the face. Ed kicked out, the kid saw it, swayed to his inside and threw an uppercut that crushed Ed's balls. Ed went down and we were left there stunned. Without missing a beat, the kid started going through his pockets, rifling for valuables and money. When he was done he stood up and smiled at us and asked 'Change?'.""
""So you took him in and trained him?""
He nodded, ""I took a young boy, an innocent boy which fate had screwed over. And I raised him to fight, to win, to kill...He is my sin, and now the only reason he wants this fight is so he can prove that he's the best. Not you, or anyone else I've trained. I am begging you,"" He looked up at me, staring at me with teary eyes, ""don't fight him, you won't just lose the fight. You'll most likely die.

Let's deal with just one of these cases: survivorship.  Our laws deal with survivorship in a marraige assuming 1survivor.  A person can elect when starting social security to have dual survivorship so the SS is paid at a lower rate but is paid for the life of the person and the spouse.  

With plural marriage I could marry perhaps a woman and her daughter, claim SS with survivorship and expect both them to receive my check after I die for the length of both lives.  

This is a loophole that would have to be addressed; perhaps with a step down table reducing the amount further for each additional spouse, but whatever the answer, there is a bigger change of law required to adjudicate the variations possible with plural marraige.  ","1430438917"

So they've got him on breaking the libo order, underage drinking, dui, and grand theft auto. The investigation found he was one of at least 9 Marines who were breaking the libo order that weekend. 

Group punishment sucks, and I've seen it abused at Corry. Capt Cooper and MGySgt Flynn are distinguished examples. Going through here as a JCACr now, I think the students don't know how easy they've got it. Try four months secured to base in cammies, with GySgt Eyre as your Platoon Commander. 

The current punishment seems fitting. I don't know what else could be as effective for a group of entry level students. There is/was a blatant and shared disregard for TECOM CGs libo policy. 

But Marines prefer bitching. So I'll join in.

The lower the charge and temperature, the faster it can be charged without damage. There is also wear leveling between cells.  
 
Fast charging doesn't reduce overall battery life by much overall because of this. It's just opportunistic. If you had a dumb charger with that much wattage, yes, it would damage the battery, but the way this works, not so much.

&gt; I will echo what others have suggested.

&gt; My $.02 

&gt; My wife (who was my girlfriend at the time) explicitly asked me NOT to get her a diamond ring, after watching some special on diamonds. (Side note, diamond engagement ring is NOT a tradition, it's a result of a very successful marketing campaign by DeBeers, who essentially owns a monopoly on diamond production/distribution around the world. Diamonds have no innate value, they are not a rare stone at all, the supply is just artificially restricted. If diamond market was ""free"", the value of diamond is estimated to be about $5/karat).

&gt; Maybe let her watch a documentary on diamond, and present her with a spectacular sapphire ring. A much more beautiful rare stone can be had for $2-3k. 

&gt; My wife constantly gets complements on her sapphire btw.

You do see the occasional french backpacker here when you're out on the piss but other than that, it's slim pickings really. Of course there are meetups, as people have mentioned, and there is the alliance française, but as a 21 year old dude i feel a bit out of place... from what I've seen, these sorts of things are mostly enjoyed by middle aged women. 

So, to study, I mostly read. I read novels and the news for at least an hour or two every day. I would strongly recommend 'liking' some french news outlets on Facebook. tv5monde is great because it's a 24 hour news channel that you can stream. I also listen to a lot of music in French and it can be great to help you learn! Gainsbourg, Brel, Hardy, Dutronc... there is so much great francophone music.

Parental relationships should not stay in a dominance mode. It's not that you're disrespecting them, you're just not agreeing with them. You can treat them the way you'd treat any other family member you disagree with. Your relationship with your parents is your own, and only you know them and can judge their moods, etc. But it's important to remember that they're not really authorities on anything, not even you. Arguments can only really exist if both people have it. I am not pretending it's easy, but you can simply agree to disagree. Usually that means ignoring anything they say that pisses you off, but that's something you often have to do with family. Getting heated is the cue to end the conversation and walk away. Interacting with your parents as an independent adult can range from no interaction at all to creepy. You're not smarter than your parents, but they aren't smarter than you, just older. You have different lives because you've had different experiences. 

Even if they won't try, peace can be found through understanding. Your understanding of them. Pretending to believe what they believe will fail, but accepting that they do in fact believe it will help you. Your job isn't to argue them out, or reason them in to any new beliefs. You just need to accept that they do believe crazy things and that those crazy beliefs will influence their behaviors. 

Ask them questions. Why is it so important to them that you do certain things? Why do they believe what they believe? Don't make it a confrontation, try to let it stay a conversation. Keep it clear that you are trying to have the exchange as an adult, not as their daughter. 

YMMV on this advice. ","1430438924"

Of course. I think there'd be a lot less objection, if sodomite relationships were given some legal recognition not using the word ""marriage"".

'historical grudges' was, at the provincial level, a superficial ploy to seize land and wealth and political power. Mao may have believed his own ideals but the practical reality was that this allowed for Communist cadre to completely usurp local holdings with the promise that they would soon be the ones who were the community leaders, builders, and bankers

why do you think corruption is so systemic to the Chinese system? if people were really about grudges and wealth inequality then fuck me, you'd think China would at least be reasonably equitable but it's a far sight from what you'd call an egalitarian society. my great grandparents died in labor camps and my mother's side lost a fuckload of land and holdings during the revolt. and you can bet your ass that those holdings were not redistributed fairly to the community and you can bet your ass that my great grandparents weren't thrown in labor camps for ideology so much as their community standing

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Basically I ran with a crew of a few guys that got themselves into shit over and over again, after they got two different camps raided and destroyed in the span of two weeks I decided to branch out. (An example was that the leader of the group, Juicy, was threatening Spartan before I knew him to pick me up from the coast after I died)

The server was relatively small and the owner was a cool guy, I was on the coast and he moved a Military offroad to me (Which I dubbed Sasha) and told me they were having a BBQ in the bottom left of the map, they brought two Urals full of food and guns. Set up barricades, and set up some campfires.

I drove over there and some ass took potshots at us as I drove near to the point and I just gunned it there. While there I met someone who was typing in a convincingly russian manner. He told me that there were a couple of stray tents that people abandoned long ago near his base. After the BBQ we were driving out of town and someone popped out with a rifle and took shots at us.

This russian guy hopped out of the car, and with a M16 in burst fire put so many rounds into the bandit so quickly I thought he had a M249. Bandaged, got back in his car, and lead us to the base near gorka.

Turns out that that guy was Spartan using an alias, and for the next couple of weeks I operated with him looting, hoarding, looting, hoarding. Fucking about, the norm. And eventually I logged on one day and all my shit was fucked except my car.

After I got hit a few times I got on with an alias and met Spartan near Novy and I told him that someone was burning me and that shit was fucked. Spartan and I ended up using aliases and basing up west of Pobeda dam, while at the prep for another BBQ one of the guys from Juicy’s group told the moderator about how they “stole some kids stuff, and killed him five times playing it off as accidents and bandits” 

After that we weren't bothered as the server pretty much died, but after people who I had been friends with for a couple of months stabbed me in the back and felt no remorse left me with some trust issues and Spartan was the only people I could trust. We fell out of contact for about nine months until I started playing War Thunder and contacted him again. We've been playing together since.

TL:DR friends stabbed me in the back, Spartan stood with me through it all, and I know I can trust him.

This all happened around 2013 starting in September so my memory is a bit foggy about it all, but that's the gyst of it.","1430438926"

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","I don't know what you're seeing to get it, but I don't believe that YouTube actually has 60FPS videos of 1440p footage. Searching '1440p 60FPS' [only turns up these results](http://i.imgur.com/wIt7X3Q.png):

  - First result: 4K footage. Only 30 FPS.
  - 2nd, 3rd result: title claims 1440p 60 FPS, and that's probably what they were recording at. YouTube's quality options only go up to 1080p 60FPS however.
  - 4th and 5th result: title also claims to be 1440p 60 FPS, but unlike the previous ones, they are available at 1440p. Only 30 FPS however.

As far as I know, anything above 1080p will not support 60 FPS on YouTube's end; they will downgrade your footage to either 1080p 60 FPS, or 30 FPS.","1430438927"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","First off, only you have all the requisite information to make the right call here.  I can only give you my opinion.

That being said, it sound like she's in a fairly constant state of comfort testing.  You've demonstrated the Alpha Attraction qualities, she's seeking the Beta Comfort qualities that let her know if she can trust you.

As the first child of three, she'll probably shoulder responsibility fairly well.  This is also evidenced by her willingness and aptitude at fulfilling domestic duties.

She doesn't spend as much time as she should cultivating her own self esteem; she relies on validation from others - you, specifically - to fill this void.  This is most women, so it's not a deal breaker.  I get this from the info about her room and bathroom - the household areas that most represent her - being a mess, and the info about not taking care of her body and health.  Possessions provide part of this external validation, as well.  But materialism is a primarily feminine quality, so once again, not a deal breaker.

You've (apparently very bluntly) told her that if she doesn't get her act straight, you're out.  This is a failure of the comfort test, but can be a passing score for shit testing.  Although I'm generally against bluntly stating the truth to women - implication is your friend - it can work with some, and with her being a firstborn it's more likely to work with her.

You've really got to figure out where her head is at to know how to proceed.

I'd start building up the comfort if I were you.  Gauge her response to this.  You seem like you're being honest with yourself, so as long as you're willing to bear the pain if you build comfort - making yourself more vulnerable - and it still doesn't work out, I think this is the best course.

*edited to add*: With all this, I can't condone pursuing a monogamous LTR.  You're 25, you've got a decade before you should really be pursuing the stasis of a family dynamic.  But you know your own head, and I don't, so there it is.","1430438929"

Piece of advice for the future: when trying to understand a group of people or viewpoint that is different from your own experience, don't argue or dismiss what the group is saying. Instead, recognize your own experience as being different and LISTEN.

Seriously, this right here is why I engage so few men in these conversations, because I know it's just going to turn into a cross-examination of the female experience, or men looking for a pat on the back for not partaking in the behavior I so often see. I get that this often happens because men simply *don't see* a lot of what women experience, or *don't see* it through a female lens. When they don't understand a described situation, because they have never been in a position where said situation would be threatening, a lot men will argue or dismiss the situation as not being a real concern.

It's great that you don't think women belong in the kitchen! I wish more people didn't. But protesting ""I'm a man and I don't do that!"" isn't helping the discussion. It honestly comes across as argumentative or derailing. /u/oliviathecf is explaining her experience. Your saying, ""I don't do that!"" doesn't contradict her experience, or the experiences of many, many women. 

You are but one drop in the ocean, just like the rest of us. You sound like a good raindrop, one of many who respect women, but how many raindrops *don't?* Collectively, how big are their waves?

If you have genuine questions, ask them! 

If a women shares an experience that you haven't had, don't debate! Ask to learn more about it and try to understand her point of view.

And above all, LISTEN.","1430438930"

"news","t5_2qh3l","I said parents are on the entitlement train, not schools.

You are trying to create an argument that parents, because they pay taxes, etc., should be able to violate the school's attendance policy. And anyone like me, who feels otherwise, is compared to Nazis.

Let me explain something to you. School policies are put into place not by administrators, but by school boards. School boards consist of elected citizens, much like the Legislative Branch of the United States government. These citizens are elected by their peers, to decide on and implement policies, with the best interests of their constituents. 

If this father, or any parent, has a problem with the policies of their elected officials, they can't simply violate those policies. They have to suck it up, and play along, with the hope that one day, they can get elected to the school board, or get one or more of their friends elected.

 I don't like having a speed limit on the highway, but the officials that have been elected in my area have deemed that to be the safest option. Paying taxes does not allow me to drive 100mph.

This attitude is commonly known as entitlement.","1430438931"

If someone were to say that they don't want dogs and referred to one of any number of the vicious dog attacks that occur every day as their reasoning, I suspect that a few of us here (myself included) would see a problem with that logic.

I guess I just don't see the point in posts like these, other than to say ""See!? Look! Kids are **evil!**"". But kids aren't generally evil, and so this isn't a good reason to be child-free, IMO.","1430438931"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; The Celts were pretty savage and did their fair share of raping and pillaging before the Romans came. Does that mean that they had it coming first?

Sure. That was how things were done back then. It sucks, and it's uncivilized by modern standards, but that was what happened in that part of the world at that point in history.

&gt;Rome wasn't a democracy, it's not like the Roman civilians who were butchered decided to invade Britain.

They decided to live there as part of that empire. Let's put it this way: when you're watching a horror movie where the victims built their house on top of a Native American burial ground, do you really feel that bad for them? Or do you think ""morons built their house on a haunted graveyard, so fuck 'em""? 

Revenge isn't pretty, but it's understood by most cultures. If you didn't want to be slaughtered by Celts, you shouldn't have fucked with Celts. I feel the same way about the people who were killed in Slave revolts in the South, or in Haiti.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I'd go back to your boss and tell him that you did some research and realized that you were in way over your head.

The current environment is a mess, what you are proposing is complicated and you don't really have the expertise to do it right.  If it fails, you'll take the blame and be responsible for fixing it and it doesn't sound like you are getting paid any extra.  It's a recipe for disaster and the only blame in this situation lies with your boss.

If you do go down this path, what you want is the *simplest* solution possible.  I'd forget about virtualization and just install multiple roles on one install of Server 2012.  Raid 1 is good (I'd get 4 disks and do Raid 1+0 personally). I'd go ahead and order a hard drive to serve as a hot spare.  It's not strictly necessary but it will buy you some time to replace a failed HDD and reduce the risk that you'll lose data.

You'll need to set the SQL server to back up to file and you'll need another job to clean up the old backups.  I'd use something like Acronis TrueImage to create a full backup image of your server (maybe monthly?) and keep your files sync'd to the cloud.  You'll need to make sure that the backup image somehow gets stored at an offsite location.  Storing the backups on the same server on a different disk does not protect against viruses, malicious actions or physical destruction.

A simple router should be able to handle DHCP and 5 PCs plus a server.  I don't have any recommendations, but I'd look for something that's at the high end of the consumer line.

Forget all about standardized printing - just install the printer on all 5 PCs.

Price out 5 new PCs for the office, make sure they have SSDs.  They may cost a little extra, but it's guaranteed to make everyone happy with performance.  They should probably be Windows 8.1 at this point, but make sure that any software needed for the business will run on it.  If you've got the budget, back up at least the files on those PCs as well.

Retire the other domains and get down to a single domain (you can use dcpromo to take over from the old server and retire it but honestly this is a more advanced task).  Put the new PCs in the single domain and assign permissions to the share and PCs using those accounts.

As for Office and Outlook - use Office365.  It's pretty cheap and you won't need an Exchange server.

If you've followed the above advice, you'll have a relatively simple environment that can be brought back from nearly any disaster.","1430438937"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had a teacher tell me I would ""fail at life,"" that I was ""a detestable little shit"" and some other legitimately upsetting shit because I didn't enjoy the book we were reading (well, to be fair, I was kind of a little shit as well, but it was uncalled for). I left class and went to the park to read in the sun, and came back for my next class.

The vice-principal was this wannabe hardass who had buzzed his hair and bleached it, which gave him the weird appearance of Eminem wearing a suit. He sneaks up behind me as I'm walking down the hall and bellows ""Going somewhere?"" before dragging me down to his office.

He sits me down in his chair and starts this whole intimidation routine, telling me that I have potentially ruined my entire high school career (I'm in grade 9 at this point, by the way), that I'm probably going to be expelled and have to go to a reformatory school, and then he starts interrogating me on my drug use and family situation; basically just going bizarrely over the line considering all I did was skip class.

I told him what she said and he didn't back off; started saying shit like ""I'm sure you misinterpreted that, there's no way she said that, did anybody hear her say that?"" When I told him that the entire class of around 30 kids had heard it, his face turned white and he just told me to go to my next class.

That teacher didn't look me in the eye for the rest of the year, never asked me a single question and didn't do anything regarding my piss-poor attendance. I passed the class with a 65 or 70, though I definitely should have failed.

In all honesty, from that point on, I was more interested in manipulating the teachers that treated me like shit instead of actually putting effort into their classes. I scraped by several of my classes with a 51% using blackmail after they snapped and said something shitty about me.

I dropped out of standard high school in grade 12 and went to an alternative school to finish up. When I got my university acceptance letters, I definitely went back to my old high school - both to thank the teachers who believed in me and helped me, and to show the teachers who acted like dicks to me how wrong they were about me. It might seem petty, but it felt pretty good telling that bitch who told me I would fail at life that I absolutely wouldn't. I also called her a sallow, reptilian bitch before leaving.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Newsboy/flat caps, cowboy hats, fedoras, berets and panamas. There are all kinds of hats out there. If you poll MFA you won't find too many venturing outside ballcaps and beanies. Ball caps provide little sun protection which is one of the only utilitarian reasons to wear a hat. They're ubiquitous, draw little attention, usually carry some kind of slogan and work nicely as the graphic T or Dad jeans of headwear.  Beanies are great for keeping your head warm when it's cold. Why limit yourself to only 2 forms of headwear?  If you look at how people are dressed in NYC or other major cities you'll find a lot of variety in headwear, a lot of it worn very well.

"depression","t5_2qqqf","I'm in the exact same boat... Everyday I wake up with such a depressive mindset. I have absolutely no drive and I have no reason to get up in the mornings. I have no friends, no job and I only attend college 3 times a week. 

Sometimes I have a sudden spurdge of happiness. Usually when I'm in a good mood I have my drive back, I want to do things. I want to make sure that I grasp onto my future and make a name for myself before its too late. I come up with all these plans on how I'm going to do this then booom depression hits me before I execute anything then it's back to being a depressive cu*t again. 



It's so hard to actually have drive when you have nothing to motivate you. I have 0 irk friends. My days consist of talking to people online who really have no real impact on my real life. 
I just can't handle it. My life right now is going nowhere, every day gets worse and worse, my grandparents who are basically my parents. They mean they world to me and it's so sad when I see them I know the time is getting closer and closer, their health is going down hill every day and it puts tears in my eyes. I'm typing this with tears running all over me. 
This post has gone out of hand. This is my feelings talking. I'm sorry if I've missed the objective of this post. I just needed somewhere to throw my emotions 

Thank you I wish all the best for you xxx","1430438938"

There was this one such class clown (Kid A) who broke his arm and had it in a cast. One day, he had it resting on top of the desk. Another class clown (Kid B) threw a paper airplane toward Kid A's direction from the other side of the classroom. The teacher turned around and saw the airplane and got mad at Kid A for throwing it, despite the fact that it was flying towards him. Kid A, and the rest of the class, tried to defend him by saying that he didn't throw it; his arm was on the desk because he was resting it there, not because he threw it. She didn't believe any of us and thought we were all fucking with her, so she started ranting about pass incidents. She blamed us for the paperwork she lost and said she found our tests in the recycling, and that one of us must have done it. I think she got mad because we were all denying it and trying to cover for one another. So in the end she called us all little shits, and then told Kid A to leave the classroom to go to the detention room. Kid A didn't want to leave because he didn't do anything wrong, so she had to phone the school security officer to escort him out. I think she's still teaching there.

1) It is a small business run off (don't laugh too hard) Excel workbooks.  I have copies.  Customer phone numbers, purchase dates, etc. - all regular business records directly saved.  What I had that was obviously suspect or wrong I document scanned with my phone and copied with a scanner/printer.  Redundancy :)  I was a great employee for reasons like that lol.

3) I was planning on showing up early tomorrow to photograph, but now that I'm home I realize she may be planning on showing up early because she wants to put on this whole front for the sales rep.  I'm going to head back tonight to photograph and grab my phone charger.  Then everything will be out except my candy bowl and a few business cards - I cleaned out the mini fridge today and everything.

4) I never had the documentation - NBoss has a LOT of things sent directly to her other store... cuz managing the day-to-day there doesn't mean she won't also micromanage me over the phone.  Or at least try really hard to do both... in reality, nothing gets done unless I can do it or I spend three days reminding her.

As far as the IRS goes: I have form... umm... it's not in front of me but I think it's SS-8 pretty much filled out with supporting documentation (paychecks - actual paper copies cuz I e-deposited - that say ""wage + commission"" or ""salary + commisson"" and a bunch of other stuff)...

but I that form is supposed to be the one you fill out if you're not sure if you're a contractor or employee according to their website.  And I couldn't figure out if there was a different way to just straight up report her?  

She dropped the form on me two weeks before the tax deadline, and I made sure my taxes aren't overdue, and figured I'd just wait until after tax season since it was looking like I might actually have to call them?

Thank you for the reassurance.

I did not get that in writing when it originally happened.  I did tape the phone call where I confronted her about it a couple days ago, in which I mentioned that she had told me that.  She tries to evade for a bit, then says she'll evaluate it on a case by case basis, then after I say it sounds like a scam she blows up, then melts down, and finally says ""Well then they all have warranties, why is this even an issue? They all have warranties!  Can we move on already?!?""  

She called me back five minutes later to ask, ""What brought all this on?"" and says ""This is none of your business.  You won't get in trouble for this; I will.""

I should trust people less, I guess... ","1430438944"

Fortune 500 wise the first female CEO was in 1972 for the [Washington Post](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_women%27s_firsts).

&gt;Shareholders like to see women CEOs

Do you have any evidence to support that?  Because I highly highly doubt that.  As shareholds only care about the stock price going up, they care less who is the CEO and care more about performance.

&gt;Well, if there were a lot more women CEOs, suddenly that rare value proposition (wow! a woman CEO!) becomes a lot less valuable (meh, she's just another CEO). If she's not as valuable to the company, they would strongly consider paying her less. IE, more women CEOS=this pay gap closes.

What makes you think the pay gap will close here especially when women tend to out perform men when it comes to making money for a business?  If anything companies will pick up on this and that pay women more than men.

"gloving","t5_2sy2d","There's a lot of programming options, yes, but they're all incredibly easy to use! You don't have to edit everything at once. Maybe you just want to change your color set, or maybe you want to switch from Tilt Function to Speed Function. You can access these features separately and quickly. You can program any feature in under 30 seconds.

Out of the box, the default modes are freaking dope too, so even if you don't want to program at first, you can still get the full Element experience. Then just program it piece by piece as you get more curious :)

Full disclosure, I am on the Emazing marketing team, but I really want to educate the community and help everyone figure these things out! Lots of new technology to sift through here. Ultimately these things are just going to be so so awesome for gloving.","1430438947"

For instance, when you buy a $20 DVD, part of the money you're paying goes towards the salaries of the cashier, the store janitors, etc. So, if those people get paid more, stores have to charge more to cover the extra labor costs. But if you double their pay, the DVD won't cost $40, maybe it will cost $25. That's because part of that money also goes to the factory in China that produced the physical disc, and the actors who produced the movie. They are not tied to the minimum wage, so the amount of money they receive shouldn't increase.","1430438952"

In my home state, there is a bikini coffee shop (actually there are multiple). You guessed it, only women work there... in bikini's, year round. They're also not forced to work there. They applied for that job. I understand jobs are difficult to get sometimes, especially ones you enjoy or want to pursue, so you settle for a while or for the long run. But you still get a say. I'm a woman who has never worked at Hooters, and I've had plenty of other jobs. I chose not to. Being degraded is losing your self-respect, your dignity or being humiliated.

**Nose**: alcohol, rotting fruit (cherry or strawberry), some caramel hiding in behind

well that is a bit off putting...

**Palate**: alcohol, weird fruit notes - not in a good way, like rotting apples in the fall

**Finish**: lingering, all of that rotting apple *not* goodness sticking around

**60**/100

revisit with press - 1/2tsp water to 1oz

**Nose**: pears, caramel, brine, light peat

**Palate**: peat, indistinguishable fruit

**Finish**: funky ash, plum

Overall, very improved with the press! Still not a great dram, not one I would want regularly, but much better than what it was.

For other AP champions, consider taking the Butcher and Arcane Blade masteries to deal more damage to minions. Other than that, it really does just come down to practicing in custom games or play norms where your goal is to *only* CS while avoiding harass and unfavorable trades. CSing in PvP will become second-nature the more you practice in PvE or a game without any distractions.

[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/204xyb/learn_to_cs_like_a_challenger_with_elyndar_a/) is a guide you should check out.

And there's nothing stopping them from doing so.  Since the society you live in is defined by the network of relationships you have with other specific people, and isn't some abstraction that exists ""out there"", all you have to do is choose with whom and on what bases to form relations with others.  If you want to reengineer the entire external world to match your preferences, though, you're SOL -- no matter how much you *want* the external world to conform to your vision of an ideal society, it will never actually be possible to bring this about.

&gt; When you reject the universal you crater into subjectivism.

But subjectivism is a correct description of reality.  Ideals and values exist only in the minds of human beings; they can be useful tools for building one's own particular life, but attempting to universalize them will create only unnecessary conflict and wholly avoidable misery.","1430438964"

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","Brumbek handled himself very poorly here. He steered the conversation towards talking about harassment to the point it devolved into it being the spotlight after the hour mark. Good job on TB's part for at least trying to moderate it early on by saying this was irrelevant to the topic at hand and calling out Polygon for invoking the same method for their article's headline, but the SMIM author definitely led everyone by the nose. Very disappointed that they missed out on discussing the 25%-75% split because of this.

First, you don't get to categorize all modders as either being neutral or fully supportive of this plan. Acting as if it was only the players that were complaining about having paid mods was disingenuous and only served to help the next point.

Do not start labeling people as ""not part of the community"" because of criteria #1, #2, #3, etc. There was a lot of ""external activity"", as you call it, because this was an issue that would have far reaching ramifications on the gaming industry. As Robin brought up, the backlash was inevitable given the current climate of paid content acting as a crutch for the base game and how easily it could be exploited by publishers and development companies.

The attitude towards these peoples' opinions was disgusting, Brumbek. Calling people ""terrorists"" is a good way of alienating someone who may have been on your side to begin with. Weigh the merits of the points people bring up before knocking them down without consideration. If you let extremists color your perception of an argument, then yes, this same backlash will happen again because more and more people will become fed up having not been listened to.

There was also a lot of flip-flopping on Brumbek's part throughout the interview, mostly in regards to Valve, along with a lot of fake humbleness, though I'll just chalk it up to natural artist pride. As a modder, though, I've lost a great deal of respect for him.

Robin and TB on the other hand did decent work. Thanks for the interview guys.","1430438964"

Do you think it's possible that's the reason why Water White is such a deplorable person and as George said, 'a bigger monster than anyone in Westeros' is *because* Walt isn't pure adulterated evil? What I mean is that, in way, I look at someone like Walt as worse than a Joffrey because we know that Walt is capable of being a good person.  For someone to 'break bad' in a way, is almost more 'evil' than someone whose heart and soul are dark and evil from the get-go.  It's like, we don't expect any better from Joffrey whereas Walt has sunk to personal lows far below whatever moral lines he had set for himself prior to the show.  I hope that makes sense.

"religion","t5_2qh39","&gt;This cannot be the case. After all, one of the offerings brought by a sinner was the korban minchah, which was made up of flour.1 We also find in the Torah that both incense2 and monetary donations3 served to atone for the people.4 It should be noted that nowhere in the Torah is it stated that atonement can be found only through sacrifice, never mind blood sacrifice.5
In Temple times, an important part of atonement was normally a sacrifice brought to the Temple. But where does that leave us today, with no Temple and no possibility to sacrifice? Let us look to the Torah for a precedent.
In the book of Jonah, the people of Nineveh had sinned and G‑d was going to punish them. When Jonah showed them the error of their ways, they fasted and prayed, and were forgiven. The same thing happened in the book of Esther. Living in Persia between the first and second Temples, they fasted, regretted their sins and were forgiven. These historical examples clearly show that when there is no Temple, sincere teshuvah (repentance) is all that G‑d demands

Weed was my solution, but it was giving me terrible anhedonia and was making me slow and out of it and anti-social even towards my best friends.

Assuming Ronia is his primary team, he needs to counter the things she's bad at: skill binds (Andromeda leads pack 80% and so does this fine), Fire or Dark absorbs/binds (Andromeda has nothing to worry about here), needing heavy damage every single turn (Andromeda is NOT good at this).

It would take me 7-15hrs per boat depending on how well the previous technician before me did their job. That was what I did, and I did it well, any free time I had would be spent making an extra workshop for engineering purposes (made custom shelves, put in new equipment, empty out the old electrionics to make room, etc). Anyways, I got the same shit from my supervisor, ""Oh, we don't see you all that much maybe increase your communication skills...""

"prisonarchitect","t5_2tk55","Are there areas of your prison that do have uniforms and only part of it isn't getting them? Are your janitors leaving laundry baskets with clean or dirty uniforms in them in areas your workers aren't permitted to? I previously had a problem where I would build my main prison, and then I'd build a smaller area for the protective custody prisoners, including their own laundry area. However, all the delivered uniforms would go to my main area's laundry room (it seems uniform deliveries always go to the first laundry you build) leaving none for the protective area. I would end up having to zone the area that wasn't getting uniforms to shared so that the workers from the main laundry area could go put uniforms on the beds. Since then, when I'm building, I always make sure to leave new areas un-zoned until a worker or janitor comes in and puts uniforms on all the beds (and hopefully leaves behind a laundry basket with some extras in it) so that uniforms stay evenly distributed.","1430438975"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","&gt; A better question is why the hell didn't voldemort put a horcrux in a grain of sand?

I won't touch the rest of the question, but this I'll cover. Most of Voldemort's choices can be summed up with ""V is an insane megalomaniac"". Why did he use historical artifacts instead of pebbles? Megalomania; he thought the containers of his soul deserved to be amazing instead of common nothings. Why did he hide them in tombs and dungeons and his followers' houses instead of going in secret to Guam or dropping them into the ocean? Megalomania and paranoia; he wanted to capture anyone looking for them to find out who else knew, along with wanting them to be in places that seemed majestic enough to be worthy of hiding his soul, also he wanted to be able to check up on them if the mood struck him.

Now, since I generally find it entertaining to think of reasons beyond ""he's crazy and/or an idiot"" for why people do seemingly foolish things, let's speculate. Maybe horcruxes cannot be made out of things that don't have an emotional connection to the maker? These are fragments of his soul after all, it would make sense on a mystic level that you can't just enchant any old thing and call it a day. All of the horcruxes are emotionally significant to Voldemort - the locket, cup, and diadem are legacies of the first place he ever called home, the ring is a tie to his wizarding family, Nagini is a favoured pet as well as a tie to his Parseltongue heritage, the diary is (assuming he actually wrote in it) a record of his innermost secrets, and Harry is the other half of the prophesy. As for why he didn't chuck 'em in the ocean, maybe the magic requires that the user act as if the items are precious, and not merely something that needs to be hidden? Who knows, high level magic is high level magic.","1430438976"

The original comment was linguistically ignorant and ethnocentric so someone called them out on it. That's not getting butthurt for having a different opinion, it's called being an intelligent critical-thinker. We ridicule climate change deniers because they are ignorant about science. Well guess what? Linguistics is a science so if you're going to be ignorant about it you can expect to be ridiculed.


The sole purpose of language is to use words to communicate ideas, and African American Vernacular English works as sufficiently as any other language. You can understand the meaning of the statement ""it do be cold"", therefore the words are conveying the idea properly. If you are asserting that they are not proper, then you will have to come up with a better definition of language than the entire scientific community that studies linguistics. 


If you want to assert that you prefer the King's English, that's fine. But don't act like other languages are inferior because that's pure fallacy and not supported by any evidence whatsoever. And please refrain from calling something a fallacy just because you don't like it. It's fucking ignorant. ","1430438976"

The highest capacity battery pack available at the moment that I know of is the Tesla S battery pack at 85kW. Assuming the 85kW could power the engine(which it can't), it would last approximately 45 minutes.

This doesn't take into consideration many, many other factors such as the safety of having a battery powered car run out of juice at 10,000 feet.

&gt; Identity Crisis is a good starting example. In an effort to plan for any member of his own Justice League turning evil he begins to monitor them. Ra's al Ghul and Alexander Luthor gain access and use the monitoring technology to their own benefit to which Bruce has planned for that very event and turns it around again. Demonstrating that his contingency plans have contingency plans of their own specifying individuals garnering access to his initial plans.
&gt; Another anecdotal would be when Martian Manhunter disguised himself as a Japanese woman named Hino Rei and Batman immediately recognized her as being Martian because ""that is the alias of Sailor Mars."" (so amongst all his other training he binge watches television, cute though it may be, that is f***king stupid.)

you're right, those do sound like cheap deus ex machina moments. IDK, maybe if i read them myself then I'd appreciate how it's written, and I wouldn't think it seemed cheap. but as presented, i agree with you.

while you're right that movies are subjective to a large degree, at the same time the themes I mentioned are explicitly stated in many movies. the nolan trilogy, for example.

&gt;I myself, well, I don't read Batman to see a peak human condition operating better than I ever possibly could(I see this as, frankly easy to do, we all did this when playing super heroes as children)

I get your point. It's valid, and I ofcourse can't tell you you're wrong (nor do I think you are) But at the same time, the reason super heroes don't exist is because no human could do what batman does (dress up in a costume, solo fight criminals without any lethal weapons, and live) ANY story about them requires our suspension of disbelief to even tell it. If we were to hold batman to the standards of what's possible in the real world, then he might as well not exist.

how i see it: if all batman did was solve crimes, what would make him any different then a cop? Why would he be so much more beloved then any other cop character we see on tv? I think the reason he's considered a superhero is because he does impossible things (for a normal person) in his case, it's not lifting a mountain or flying ftl, it's having more self-discipline and determination than any of us could. that's WHY he's one of the best fighters in the world. that's WHY he strikes fear into the hearts of criminals. that's WHY he has a contingency plan for every superhero's possible corruption (notwithstanding the bad examples you justifiably have a problem with)

The fact that I can still see the lines of edges of the sod make me believe the sod wasn't installed properly anyway.

Sod is mostly dead. Final answer. 

You could try reseeding to fill in the bare spots if you dont want to tear it all up but im not sure when the best time for you to do that is. You may also have a problem with your soil which would may have cause the sod to die in the first place and could prevent seed from germinating in the future.

[Hardly a credible source.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bell_Curve#Criticisms)

&gt; There's virtually no disagreement about these facts except in some circles in the social sciences. Genes are highly predictive of personality, intelligence, social outcomes, and behaviours.

Interesting that you're citing sources from the 1980s and 1990s--when the human genome hadn't even been mapped yet--as your proof that genes predict ""social outcomes"" and ""behavior.""  Of course that's nonsense, and such a link hasn't been remotely proven.  Even now we don't have a clear understanding of which genes would cause personality traits such as impulsivity.  Also, with the exception of the Bell Curve none of your sources are arguing that biology alone is determinative.

Again, nobody in the modern social sciences says that biology doesn't play a factor.  But the idea that *only* biology plays a factor has been thoroughly disproven and discredited.","1430438981"

In the second case most definitely he could be extradited. Freedom of the Press only applies for what you do on American soil. Depending on the country a request for extradition for a ""treason"" offence would either be close to absolutely certain (for close allies) or a massive political hot potato (for no so close allies / outright enemies).

Slasher Duo win because they're backed by horror movie tropes, so as long as I can survive ~12 hours (a night and some change) I'll have nothing left to fight (other than the slashers, so I have to make it look like I'm only a tertiary character, or they'll kill me because horror movie.)

My second pick is the Aliens, because 4 for 1 stealth fighters is a steal. I'm a little worried that the Predator has his built in nuke, though, so this is going to be a road trip. Good luck everybody else!

Edit: After reading /u/Reilic 's educational piece on the wheezing General, I think I've got to pick the same strategy. Dropping the Aliens, picking up Grievous. Not only does he have lightsabers (and may be able to block blaster fire with them) but he has a high powered blaster pistol of his own. Not much out there that can stand up to plasma fire.","1430438985"

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","For any device that uses a single 18650, such as the IPV Mini 2, Sigelei 50W V2 and Mini, etc, using the onboard charging is A-OK. What you want to avoid is using the on-board charging for any device that uses two or more 18650 batteries. 

When you've got multiple battery cells in a device, both cells have to be charged at an equal rate in order to be charged safely -- this is called load balancing. Most multi-cell devices on the market are bad at load balancing, which can lead to cells being charged unevenly. Best-case scenario this just means one battery is charged sooner than the other, but worst-case scenario this can cause the fuller cell to discharge into the other, causing the cells to overload and catastrophically fail.","1430438985"

I was always anti-war and pro-drug legalization, against police abuse and in favor of free markets. I stayed the same on the issues, I simply came to realize that the Democrat leadership were insincere, and that men like Ron Paul and Patrick Buchanan really meant it.

We agree about the demographics, that is why the main issue I disagree with other Republicans on is immigration. We need to find a way to have softer borders and better treated immigrants. We can't have a welfare state for everyone on earth who wants to move here, but people who can fill a job that Americans can't or won't ought to be welcome. 

Our Washington insiders live in a crowded place, but much of the west is empty and rural. Maybe we can make a compromise: immigrate to North Dakota with ease, but immigrate to NYC with a *lot* more difficulty.

Bottom line: Racism ought not be a Republican issue, and we need to remove racial and other ""identity"" politics and put the focus on the issues (where I sincerely think most people agree).","1430438988"

Then later that evening, they sent me another email saying that a teacher had opened up a spot in her studio if I was still interested, so that is how I squeaked into a piano minor. I auditioned right before my last three semesters of college, so I really had to get in that semester or else I wouldn't be getting a minor at all, but if you have more leeway, definitely take more time to prepare.

Another thing you could do is ask if any of the masters students teach. Depending on their skill level, that might be enough to keep you busy for a while or at least it could help you better prep for an audition.","1430438990"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In Germany, there are three types of school that someone can go to once they hit a certain age (like 5th grade): Gymnasium, Realschule, Hauptschule. 


Gymnasium normally leads to college because they are taking college prep like coujrses and finish by taking arbitur which is like their version of ACT/SAT.  


Realschule is the next step down and these students typically find a job right after school like an apprenticeship. It is not normal for someone to go to college out of Realschule. 


Hauptschule is the lowest level and a lot of immigrants are at this level. If you go to hauptschule, you are pretty much going to be doing an apprenticeship out of school or work low paying jobs. People out of hauptschule are generally never going to college. 


When the time comes to decide who goes where, the student's teacher decides which school a child is capable of going. This decision is discussed with the parents during a meeting.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","  Thats what society has bred.   its has bred the Not-men. No one knows what it is, is it half man/ half women? is it asexual? Does it have some type of new sex hormone that we have yet to discover?

 I agree.  But then how come women want to play the roles of what use to be men, then complain about how todays men can not rationalize their own emotions and do not know what kind of work it takes to be in a relationship.  

  Because they are not men. Men arent out going to war, and working in shipyards all day any more, fighting off the corrupt unions, and trying to deal with the mafia extorting their business or wages. Doing what ever it takes to protect their family from outlaws, mafias, corrupt officials.   
The majority of Men are not dealing with emotional shamming any more. Such as, having to go to war and kill, working all fucking day, 7 days a week, just to be told  your not a man.   So no responsibility is bred.  Thus, they are not building any character.. 

   If they are not building character.. how are they going to have character in a relationship with a women?  The worst emotional shamming most men go through now is, "" I got killed in halo"", or my teacher gave me a ""c"", or that ""a girl at the bar didnt want to dance with me"". My simple point, ""men"" in the western world, are not experiencing important character building situations; that men all through out history have had to deal with.  
 But women still are dealing with the same Character building.. being objectified ect..  

Thats why more women are going to school, becoming educated, and are more mature in a relationships.  If us men, do not get are shit together.  Women are going to realize they do not need men, lock us in cages, and just use us for breeeding bahahaha.

With what the world is coming to.. 100 years from now we will be so "" progressive"" and just  be asexual beings that remove are genitals and breed through a needle and a jar","1430438991"

It has the aims of making the manager's life easy, for example, which means keeping low quality staff and not pushing for efficiency if it annoys the staff below them. It has the self interest that means that no manager will ever suggest an idea that makes them redundant and it has the crucial lack of competition which allows all of these things to go unpunished. Where a private company goes bust, a public service gets extra cash to 'rescue' it.

Look at East Coast mainline. National express paid £175m a year for the franchise plus the cost of numerous upgrade projects. They couldn't make a profit, and dropped out (to much vitriolic abuse about proftieering and so on).

A public company takes over, and pays roughly the same amount (adjusted for inflation) but without paying for upgrades, and is lauded as a huge success.","1430438992"

His laning phase is terrible now.  His Q can't harass over minions any more, and his low range and low damage AAs put him in range of enemy harass.  So he'll use a ton of mana CSing with Q to avoid harass while letting the enemy mostly free-farm, and he still has typical low mobility problems (needs to stay near tower).  This makes it very easy for him to get bullied.  

But worse is the fact that his late game has been heavily reduced.  Frozen Heart is much weaker without 20% CDR, and so he loses a lot of ""free"" tankiness.  And his mana ratios have uniformally been reduced by 2%.

So he scales worse on mana, meaning a lot of the midgame power of tear/ROA is reduced and he no longer builds as tanky.  So he's a low ranged, more fragile burster that now needs his passive up to burst and can actually miss.  

I don't think Ryze adds much besides damage to a team now, and I think he is weaker at every point in the game.  I was optimistic that his passive would keep him strong, but in practice I don't think it is enough.  I think he'll need to see some numbers changed in order to be viable.  ","1430438992"

"dating","t5_2qhb1","I don't understand your entire comment.

The first part:
&gt;More often than not, it boils down to: eat healthy, exercise regularly, be a gentleman.

seems to be (to me) to say, ""100% reasonable lifestyle preferences that ANYONE can follow.""  But then you add ""Now, read past that.""  Why?  Why read past that?  Why not take it literally?

I mean, imagine her preference read: ""prefer a guy who brushes his teeth before we meet.""  Would you brush your teeth before you meet?

Likewise, if it says, ""prefers a guy who exercises regularly"" would you exercise regularly before you meet?  (I would.)

That is an entirely different department from things like money, height, physical attractiveness, and so forth - things you can't change.

And what YOU fail to realize is that -5 pounds of natural fat (or a gain of similar amounts of muscle) on almost any man will not make as much a difference as +4 inches in height.   But when a profile essentially asks for the former but not the latter, they're asking for something that is within YOUR power.   Anyone can lose 5 pounds of fat or do exercise and gain muscle.  Anyone.","1430438995"

"Robocraft","t5_2ygr4","&gt; respawn times are too long, don't want to wait 90 seconds.

This is the first iteration of their new game mode. They never knew if the respawn timer was too long or not. Now that the system getting some actual testing, they can find out if it's good enough or not. Personally, the timer is JUST long enough for slower bots to get across the map and do some damage while the team is incapacitated.

&gt; rewards are too low, getting 100,000 rp for 20 minutes isn't enough

I can get 100,000 RP in 2 games, no premium, in about the same amount of time, in T10 (this is if I don't screw up, or the team doesn't die in 30 seconds). 30 seconds to get into a match (loading and pre-game timer), about 5 minutes for a match, and then another 30 seconds to get into a new one. It sounds about right. --- And yes, I know that adds up to about 11 minutes, not 20, but you have to take in the new damage model into account, which I can't accurately do yet (and I main plasma). And having about 10 games in T10 with the new damage model doesn't give me enough experience with it to give me an average of what I get in games.","1430438998"

  1) Know who your personal heroes are and articulate why, 
  2) to lots of people who have 'done it', especially different people with conflicting stories of 'how to get there',
  3) Be aware of self-native bias when you listen to their tails,

Who gets to decide what laws should be legislated if not the majority? 

To argue your point, you have to argue that democracy is fundamentally flawed. Otherwise, we can talk about the morality of nudity and what society might look like if it was allowed, but that's a whole different thing than saying it should be legal.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","My character is Kassie (may recognize my username lol). She was born in skyrim, which explains her Nordic blood, but her family moved to Hammerfell when she was too small to remember. Unfortunately, when she was a bit older, but not old enough to be on her own; her parents were killed by bandits. She swore on her life she would never kill an innocent soul, as she knew the pain that was felt by the ones left behind. Alone, scared, and too young. She stayed in Hammerfell for a few years to gather up enough gold to travel east, back to the land she was born in. She had hopes of finding distant relatives somewhere in skyrim. With her bad and unfortunate luck, she was stopped by a group of guards who accused her of murder. She was at the wrong place at the wrong time and was sent to Helgen. She believed she was destined to go back to Sovngarde to be with her long-gone parents. You can imagine the events that happened there.

Months later, after escaping Helgen and finding her true powers, she took a trip to Windhelm, having heard of its wonderous scenery, curiosity got the best of her. As she roamed the streets, she met a lonely and poorly man named Angrenor. She saw that he was struggling and offered him a gold piece. Day by day, she would give him gold. The man always offered her a story of his days as a soldier, she would listen. Mara got the best of her, and weeks later they married, residing in Lakeview Manor where they raise their two kids- Sofie and Samuel. 

Love story aside, she joined the Imperials, believing that the stormcloaks were nothing but a rebellious group. She believed in the Imperials and knew skyrim deserved better. The war still rages on outside, but she stops at nothing to protect her own family and home. She helps a person in need, keeping to her promise she made so long ago. She was born a Nord and was destined to go back to her homeland, where her destiny would be fulfilled as Dragonborn.","1430439008"

"GTAV","t5_2rjys","I would say avoid full suspension altogether. I bought a Kona Stinky a few years ago, and returned it 3 days later (not fun hauling a 38 lb bike up a strack). You wanna go hardtail, but it can still offer an incredibly smooth ride depending on how you adjust the fork.   

If you're looking for a decent ride in that pricerange, I'd recommend Bikesdirect.com. It may seem a little too good to be true, but for the price, you're not gonna find a better deal anywhere (some assembly required though, but it's not too bad). I'd take a look at [this] (http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/29point1-29er-bikes.htm) or [this] (http://www.bikesdirect.com/products/gravity/650b-27.5-bikes-g275-g1.htm) depending on what you're looking for.

I'd also encourage you to go to your local bike shop to see if they could help size you for a bike. It's useful info to have for buying online, and who knows - they might be able to cut you a deal depending on who you talk to (and where I live, my lbs also sells used bicycles at pretty insane discounts).

I imagine that this would be like us having pet dogs and teaching them to be obedient, but why go through the trouble of teaching our species to learn physics, math, and writing?

Maybe they would like to provide the best possible living arrangement for us and install some form of simulation where we can live in peace with other life forms like us because that is what makes our species the happiest. 

What if they determine that humanity is happiest when there are still discoveries and advancements to be made, thus providing hope to each and every one of our existences.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","	“Attention passengers, Flight 231: New York to Chicago will begin boarding momentarily. Please have your tickets ready to be checked upon boarding.”
	Chad looked up. He had been preoccupied with the internet porn he was watching on his phone. He fumbled the phone into his back pocket and grabbed his bag. He got in line behind ten other people waiting to have their tickets scanned. 
	Chad was nervous. He began tapping his foot, looking from side to side while trying to seem as unsuspicious as possible. He couldn’t shake the feeling that he was failing terribly.
	A minute later he was standing in front of the attendant, handing his ticket over as he tried to strike a pose that said anything other than I have a bomb in my bag. It worked; he ended up looking as if he was trying to hide an erection.
	“Sir?”
	“Sorry?” Chad replied, in a voice that sounded as if Hulk Hogan had a vice grip around his testicles.
	“Sir, you can have your ticket back,” the attendant repeated, bending forward slightly to get the ticket closer to Chad’s hand.
	“OH! Uh, thanks.” Chad took the ticket boarded the plane, shaking, but not visibly so.
Nigel watched the other passengers from the relative comfort of his seat. He was in no hurry to board; he might as well wait until everyone else has gotten on. When one’s own demise is soon at hand one tends to find an amazing new capacity for patients. 
As the last of the other passengers trickled passed the attendant Nigel got up. As he handed over his ticket the attendant asked, “What’s that ticking sound?”
“Oh, that’s just my watch, love.”
The attendant looked down at his wrist and noticed the absence of a watch, and any other time-keeping device for that matter. As she looked up at Nigel he gave her a wink and pursed his lips together to emulate a kiss. As she struggled between feelings of disgust and complete apathy towards the situation, the attendant handed back his ticket and sighed, “Have a nice flight sir. Thank you for flying Conair.”
Nigel walked down the aisle of the plane and noticed that he was sitting next to the bloke with the erection. As Nigel sat down Chad looked up and said “Hello,” but then looked embarrassed and quickly looked down to stare very intently at his shoes. Nigel sat down without comment and shoved his bag under the seat in front of him.
Flight 231 had a total of 37 minutes of uninterrupted air time before all hell broke loose. 29 minutes in Nigel went to the bathroom at the rear of the plane. Chad thought it was odd that he brought his bag to the bathroom with him, but was too nervous about what he was about to do to give it much more thought.  30 minutes in Nigel had closed the bathroom door, unzipped his bag, and pulled out the four sticks of dynamite he had hooked up to an old-fashion alarm clock. How he managed to get it past security is anyone’s guess.
At the same time Chad was reciting a mantra he had learned to overcome stage fright, or at least, Chad thought it was a mantra. Really, a list of ingredients to curry broth and a self-help mantra are pretty much the same when you don’t speak Hindi. 
32 minutes into the flight Chad pulled himself into the aisle with his bag in hand as Nigel walked out of the bathroom with his TNT held high. AT the same time both hijackers said, or rather Nigel said and Chad squealed, “Attention ladies and gentlemen! I have a bo….”
Chad turned around at the sound of an echo and noticed Nigel standing at the back of the plane. He then took notice of what Nigel was holding and promptly let out a tiny scream. 
“What!?” An elderly man in the front row asked, “What did they say?”
“I think they said they got a bong, Marty.”
“Oh, well that’s nice.” Marty quickly fell asleep and died. So, technically, Nigel and Chad were only responsible for the deaths of 87 people.
“You daft wanker, am I being punked?” Nigel shouted. “Did Clarisse put you up to this? If she did I swear to you that you’ll regret ever stepping foot on this plane.”
“N…No…?” Chad asked, for the revelation that they was now a second bomb on the plane robbed Chad of any confidence in the reality of the situation. “I….”
34 minutes into one of the flight attendants actually noticed the TNT in Nigel’s hand and began to scream. By the time minute 35 rolled along the entire cabin of the airplane was screaming. Nigel rushed at Chad and tried to grab his bag away. “Give me that bag you filthy American. The EEP will not be made a fool of by some two bit, wannabe hijacker!”
“Uh…” Chad tried to say. Unfortunately a very large, very angry looking man stood up front the back row and began to make his way towards Nigel and Chad. 
“UH!UH!” Chad grunted, darting his eyes back and forth between Nigel and the very big man. 
36 minutes into the flight Nigel found his left right should being crushed in a vice-grip very much like the vice-grip of Hulk Hogan. He was subsequently thrown backwards toward the rear cabin and landed in the aisle is a thud. As Nigel struggled to get up he noticed that the clock had fallen off the sticks of TNT. He wasn’t sure what that meant.
The very big man proceeded to grab Chad by the shoulders and lift him into the ceiling with great force. Unfortunately for everyone involved, ceilings, being solid things, don’t have very much room with which to accommodate new heads. This ceiling-head dilemma was resolved with a puncture in said ceiling and a loose of cabin-pressure.
Chad, his head, and his bomb bag were sucked out of the airplane and ended up in one of the jet-intakes. As the bomb came into contact with the jet engine it exploded and… well, I’m sure you can imagine the rest.

There are many things the bible specifically prohibits that you do not bother yourself with. One of the  most egregious examples is from the New Testament, words attributed to Jesus himself, where he speaks out against divorce. 

Most Christians have no trouble at all with divorce. But because they are massive hypocrites and because their religion has warped any sense of morality they may have possessed, they do rail against equal rights for gay people. Out of bigotry. Out of hate. They then pretend that they are not being immoral because they lyingly claim to follow the bible.

And I am supposed to respect these Pharisees? ","1430439012"

Data was already their #1 business. To think they didn't do it for that is absurd. As much as I love Google, they're in it for collecting data.

They only OS's for smartphones were Blackberry (proprietary), Windows Mobile, and Symbian. Yes, it was kind of annoying to support both. But, the purpose of Android wasn't to unify development. The purpose was to make sure Google was the core of it.

No booth, not selling anything. We at no point ever during development asked anyone to promote us, asked anyone to interview us or advertise us. We accepted interviews and invites to things we thought would be fun. It was far more attention than we ever thought we would have gotten, but either way we thought we may as well keep working on it until we're forced not to (then we were forced not to).

In 1998 A&amp;M knocked a much better KState team out of the NCG.  And it happened a few other times as well just in the Big12.

It is always a possibility.  

Right now, a Big12 team will almost have to go undefeated to be a lock into the playoffs. 

However, the problem (in this scenario) comes with an 11-1 TCU team not having a final quality opponent to play and getting leapfrogged on the last week by a team that won a CCG.  

This is the problem with the Big12 scenario in my opinion: You play less games overall and don't have a final week boost going into the last rankings.

It's not like we're not having 1/infinity or after-infinity because it's so absurd or ridiculous - The concept is not any weirder than squareroots of negative numbers. If there was a reason to have after-infinity, all we would have to do is to define it, like we defined imaginary numbers that sure as hell will never be found in our empiric world. 

We don't have after-infinity because mathematic conventions say that it doesn't exist, because we don't need it and because it's not part of the mathematical system that has evolved over the times. 

Yes, the concept of something ""after infinity"" can only ever be contemplated in a theoretical concept, but no, that's not the reason why it doesn't exist in math.","1430439017"

"49ers","t5_2rebv","Cornerbacks:

* 1- Kevin Johnson (Wake Forest) - - Long, fast, fluid and aggressive. His guy was always covered. 
* 2- Marcus Peters (Washington) - - Looks great on tape, the edge he uses to get in opponent's heads eventually got him kicked off the team. 
* 3- Byron Jones  (UConn) - - Great size and incredible athleticism. Always the best player on the field at Connecticut. 
 
 
Wide Receivers: 
 
* 1- Devante Parker (Louisville) - - Can take the top of a defense and go up and get jump balls on deep throws and in the red zone. 
* 2- Kevin White (West Virginia) - - A little raw, but wows with burst and looks like a new Larry Fitzgerald. (*Bears 7th*)
* 3- Amari Cooper (Alabama) - - Polished and ready for the NFL. Think new Anquan Boldin. (*Raiders 4th*)
 
  
Edge Rushers (OLB): 
 
* 1- Owamagbe Odighizuwa (UCLA) - - The only thing better than his play on the field is his name, pronounced ""o-WAH-mah-bay  o-DIGGY-zoo-wah""
* 2- Alvin ""Bud"" Dupree (Kentucky) - - Maybe a little small for the 49ers, but great burst, power and speed. 
* 3- Randy Gregory (Nebraska) - - Neck and neck with Dupree for sack potential. 
 
 
Defensive Line: 
 
* 1- Leonard Williams (USC) - - Out of reach as a top 3 pick, but a new Justin Smith. (*Jets 6th*)
* 2- Danny Shelton (Washington) - - Huge, run-stuffing nose tackle that can also rush the QB from inside. 
* 3- Henry Anderson (Stanford) - - A much, much better option at DE than other, highly touted Pac-12 linemen. 
  
 
Inside Linebacker: 
 
* 1- Stephone Anthony (Clemson) - - Great size and speed for the position. Can do almost everything Willis did.
* 2- Shaq Thompson (Washington) - - Tweener ILB/Safety size, but hard hitting and smart. Think new Kam Chancellor. ","1430439017"

We're building 5 gen aircraft and Iran is still flying planes they it before the revolution. U.S. Missiles send things to the far reaches of the solar system, Iran can't compete in that regard. 

[AIM-54 Phoenix (Iran)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-54_Phoenix)

speed: mach 5

operational range: 190 k,


[AIM-120  (US)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM-120_AMRAAM) 

speed: mach 4

operational range: 

AIM-120A/B: 55–75 km 
• AIM-120C-5: &gt;105 km 
• AIM-120D (C-8): &gt;180 km 

&gt; I think the proper course is to first make the country hardened with anti air systems, then work from there, but if you're country is protected, I dunno what this Air Force is for, other than aggression?

Seems about right, but you also have to keep in mind our borders can be threatened from abroad too. Right now Saudi Arabia or Turkey could establish a NFZ with ease (although they wouldn't) and Iran would have little in the way of countering that. Sure Iranian pilots are probably of better quality, but there is only so much better training will take you, at some point the technology disparity is too great. 

&gt; Even if things improve you don't want u.s planes because they will always see Israeli craft as friend and cannot fire on them, just asks Saudis and turkey.

can you expand on this a bit more? ","1430439019"

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I'm only 17 but believe me, I've felt just like you have many a time. Honestly, the fact that nothing is meaningful when you strip it down can be the shittest thing in the world. But it's too easy to let things get you down. From my limited perspective, I feel a lot of people are naturally unhappy. If you have a choice - and most of the time you do, even if it's small - then make that effort to make the most of something. Do whatever works best for you, but it'll be your own lessons which stick most permanently. 

What's worked for me is writing something between a log and a memoir, everyday. Yep, I guess it's a diary, but you can make it more than that: a release, somewhere to count your blessings (I hate that phrase feel free to stick another here), a place to look inwards on yourself, somewhere you can evaluate your day or past few days, or record your thoughts or memories; whatever. It doesn't have to be this, but it's something which has worked for me. Not sure if this is relevant but I never set out for this to become all these things - your solutions often come indirectly. 

Don't think ahead too much. Do, of course, but if it's getting you down then cut it down a little. Don't ignore it or suppress it, but don't indulge in it either. 
What you should indulge in is what you don't know. Don't like your life? Your view of your life is so much smaller to all the possibilities it could be. Look at your boundaries and question them. And this doesn't have to be something for as extravagant as a holiday or anything like that - identify what few things bring comfort. 

Of course it's easier said than done, and I'm sorry for all the cliches (I promise they're all accidental) but you're not going to know until you know. Could you have imagined yourself as you are 2 years ago? See another 2 years on from now ... you'll be surprised. And 2 years is nothing.

Going with 5.36% so that way the borrower is paying me back $21 a year. There's a lot of rounding going on here but here is what it looks like for the most part.



Account | Debit | Credit
---|---|----
Cash | 21 | 
Interest Revenue |  | 5
Note Receivable | | 16

The $5 in revenue isn't created, but comes from the borrower. If you're talking about the person saving their money in the bank, it works on more or less the same principle. Lets say 2% interest a year on deposits.

Account | Debit | Credit
---|---|----
Deposit | 2 | 
Interest Revenue |  | 2

There's no currency being created here, but there is credit created. The bank doesn't ""literally"" create currency anywhere in the process.

"SWORDS","t5_2qt1p","I'm not arguing with you that modern steel is not better. I'm arguing that just because modern steel is better doesn't make older stuff absolutely shit. 

&gt; But if both persons were equally trained, the person who has a sword made out of modern steel would destroy the person who has steel from 500 years ago.

No it wouldn't. If both are equally skilled, luck and a hundred other factors will have bigger influence on the outcome than the quality of the steel. If we are talking about using the sword over the course of many battles, then maybe you have a point. Modern steel will hold up better, swords do break from damages over time. In just one fight that probably last a few minutes tops? It wouldn't make a difference. How do you imagine it's going to play out in your mind? The modern steel sword cutting through traditional sword like butter or shatter it into pieces? Seriously, I think you are way overestimating how much better modern steel is for the purpose of sword fighting. In addition, all sword art I've come across teaches to deflect and redirect rather than fully arrest the entire force of an incoming blow when defending, this makes it even less likely that the toughness of the steel will be put to direct contest against each other in a sword fight.

I'm not saying go psycho-obsessive, but I always wondered what happens if the designated big and littles just don't click. Do they get different ones?

I managed to tense up during a showing of Alien even though I'd seen it a hundred times at home.

It's just unfortunate that the moviegoing masses have no sense of decorum any more, and that the lack of awareness (or lack of giving a shit about anybody else) translates across all age groups. I've had a row of seniors who wouldn't shut up, i've had teenagers fucking around on their phones and people in their 30s trying to pick fights because someone didn't sit down fast enough *before* the lights had even gone down for the previews.

"leafs","t5_2r8hf","Okay time for a thought experiment.  Would you trade #2 and #9 overall picks for a 22 year old Kessel over again?  Most of us wouldn't I don't think.

Now, would you trade #2 and #9 overall for a Kessel who is now **28** years old if we had been able to throw in Komisarek as a salary dump?  Because your proposal has Carolina doing almost exactly that.  (Fleury was picked #7, and the #5 this year is considered equivalent to #2 in 2010.)

I still find it impossible to imagine they would bite on that.  That's almost the same deal Burke did, but for a player who's 6 years older, does the Semin cap dump really make up that much value?

Also here's something I find funny: early this season before the tank began there was lots of speculation (in the media, and also here) that the Leafs might look to trade Kadri and/or Gardiner for E. Staal because Carolina would be looking to rebuild.  But now we're thinking they will do the exact opposite and trade their two best prospects for a 28 year old.

Francis said they might be willing to drop down a bit, but that's not the same as saying they'd be willing to get older.  Most likely it's because there's a large group of prospects in the 4-10 who scouts see as very close, so they would consider dropping down to say #8 and get an extra pick out of it.","1430439026"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","That's actually untrue and so is that riot is doing 'something for us'. It's a free to play game, the business model relies on the customer loving the product, they aren't just doing everything as a cash grab but they also aren't doing us any favors. If you want chromas, you will buy them. It's not a ploy for cheap money, the cost of developing the skin has nothing to do with its final price, the price is set at a level where it matches the value it has to the player, because their business model has buying as a choice (and they want it to be a choice that feels appropriate to the content's perceived value). 

basically it's just as wrong to say chromas are a cash grab as it is to say chromas are a favor from riot. ","1430439029"

Within a few months, it got so cold that the atmosphere literally froze all around the earth, down to a 10 foot deep liquid oxygen/frozen nitrogen snow.  The few people that remained survived by heating pockets of these gases and creating breathable areas enclosed in strong tarps/balloons.

I know people freak out about ""the end of the world"" but short of something catastrophic like being ejected from the solar system or being nailed by an unstoppable comet, the human race will have a hard time dying off completely.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","&gt; Or is it based off location?

I think more correctly, it might be based off of age more than anything else. When I was 21, I didn't want kids. I'm now 25 and still don't want them. In comparison, I have coworkers and friends who are in their early 30's who have their first kids. Also some people who are around 35-38 who have kids who are like 5-6 years old. 

But, there are unique situations. My one friend is 24 and married and just started working with me. We were casually talking about how he wants to buy a new car and his wife legitimately said that if they want to do this seriously, they need to plan for one that is able to have a kid inside it. In comparison, I have friends who who in their late 30's who are extremely single and aren't even fathoming the concept of children.

As a lot of people have already said, your surrounds generally dictate your thoughts on this. If I went back to my homework, I'm sure that I'd be popping out kids. A lot of people I went to high school started having kids when they were 18. Now, I live in a city which has more working 20-somethings, so we're all focused on living our lives and our careers over something like kids. ","1430439032"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hang on. Why are we taking theology lessons from an ewok? ","1430439033"
"news","t5_2qh3l","For the sake of making sure people don't feel the need to walk on eggshells.  For example, I am a white woman.  If I'm called 'white,' the color of my skin, most, myself included, aren't offended.  However, some white, black, asian, etc persons ARE super sensitive and wait in the grass like a snake to decry offense over even the most minute and unintentional verbal mis-step such as calling a white person 'white' or an black person 'black.'

I read a lot of articles, since the special made me do a 180 on my view of Jenner, but he mentions that he is not so easy to offend, but he knows he isn't the example of the 'community' of trans people and didn't want people to be offended when they called Jenner a 'he' for the time being, especially in the interview.

I'm rather certain he'd *prefer* 'she' or 'her' but, knowing the media is still puzzled over pronouns and the whole gender issue, Jenner was aware many would still call her a 'he' or 'him' and, knowing that did not affect their own self identity, she was cognizant enough to know many in the community seem to be far less stable and could be set off even if it was a comment against Jenner that they took vicariously as an attack on them via Jenner.

It all sounds super crazy insane, but honestly, think about it, all of us are spoiled.  Its like she said, we wake up and go on with life, the majority of us, with little to no discord over whom we are or the person in the mirror.  Its unavoidable that Jenner lived 65 years in the physical body of a male and same goes for many trans people so, when a trans person I used to talk to at the clinic I worked at began to explain the issues surrounding pronouns, I at first felt they were being a brat, but, put into context, its like a white person saying racism is over.

You aren't dealing with their lot of life and all that comes with it.  So to pass judgement on their wishes to be called as they identify when we have no perspective ourselves is kinda out of line.  When it was put into such a context, i realized how unfair I was being and actually gained from those conversations.  I applaud Jenner, however, for doing that so the media did not receive blowback for any pronouns they very well may not have meant to be derogatory or negative.","1430439034"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Art History degree holder here. I have not closely studied obesity in ancient cultures, but I have studied depictions of fertility. To my understanding, the Venus of Willendorf is pretty widely accepted as a fertility figurine. Across many societies, ideal women are depicted with large breasts (ability to nourish a child) wide hips and large belly (to carry a child) prominent pelvic/""V"" shaped area.

Prehistorically, ""Attractiveness"" of a woman was determined by her ability to reproduce ","1430439035"
"nba","t5_2qo4s","the opponent can't force you to do anything. If they sag off you or take off the right side, you still have the decision of whether or not to shoot it/ go left. 

The difference is that when you intentionally foul at the end of the game, you can only foul the player with the ball. The offensive team has the ability to control who shoots the free throws, and therefore can control their own destiny.
When you hack-a-player, you remove any control that an offensive team has whatsoever. You punish them for even daring to play a bad FT shooter, even if that player is only in there for defense.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I appreciate your criticism but it *was* a consideration.  

I'm aware it could be a long time before POS changes come into effect but the two main reasons for not moving back to c5 were the scores of capital ships we'd have to move, and having to set up dozens of POSes when they were only going to be removed anyway. It was certainly the lesser of the two objections but it was still a good one. 

And of course, the capital ships problem was recently taken care of :)

Edit: I did also say ""TDSIN moving to a c5 any time soon hadn't even been considered yet."" Which I think is required for context to your quoted section.

"opieandanthony","t5_2se0w","To that drivel? God no. I catch some cringe clips of OqieRaqio here but Todd and Jayde is a bridge too far. 

That is the scuttlebutt on the New York radio messageboards. I saw them after Erock's Meatballs interview got linked at one. 

WPLJ does something called the ""Summer BlastOff!"" where they do a bunch of events to get listeners and retain what they got. That is typically when people get the axe there, May and June, and they try to get people hyped for a new show at that time.  

Everybody thinks Jayde is gunning for Todd and could co-host with somebody already on the show, Annie, who is basically Jayde's more masculine Sam Roberts. 

The only question is if Todd gets shit-canned and bought out this summer or NEXT summer. Everybody over there thinks Todd is getting the boot and deserves it. They were Scott and Todd fans, not Opie and for a lot of those people, Todd is their Opie. They're pissed that Todd threw out the talent of the duo, Scott Shannon, and are thrilled that Todd is bombing and Scott Shannon is on a top 5 talk show on WCBS. As they should be. Fuck Todd Pettengill. ","1430439038"

"nrl","t5_2qn90","It matters because I'm too lazy to look up each player and their specific heritage. I don't know who in the New Zealand team is a Maori and who isn't. Maori's and Polynesians can look very similar and I can't tell the difference between those pretty similar looking racial groups at a glance. 

Just like in the Australian team, I assumed Will Chambers was indigenous when he could easily have been an islander. 

In this instance whether you look 'white' is a relatively accurate distinction between the non-indigenous players and indigenous players in the Australian and New Zealand test squad.

At that point as long as you're keeping the streak going the 3rd match is of a bit less consequence; I think that's where the great champs shine, because you could probably leave your 2* Hawkeye at a low r2 and he'll still be able to pull out wins consistently - but with better scores due to his lower lvl.","1430439039"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","It isn't even the quality of mods that is a concern for me, but how much more difficult it is to properly troubleshoot what mods are causing CTDs compared to mod organizer on Steamworks. 

It is a lot easier to handle what mods overwrite each other without having to reinstall them in a specific order and deactivate them without risk of leaving remnants of it in the game directory.

Even simple texture mods that shouldn't be an issue can be buggy and crash the game, or mess up saves to the point where even removing them isn't going to reverse it's effects. 

I just have a lot of skepticism about the ability to ensure a headache free experience that people would expect of paid mods. Even mods made with the official game and DLCs in mind can have issues, so the only way a mod might become stable enough across all systems regardless of what mod list they have would be for them to be universally used to the point where they are considered official DLC.

I've spent hours trying to narrow down what specific actions and then what mods were causing CTDs. Something I'm more than willing to endure for free content, but certainly not for paid. Once something is put behind a paywall it's seen as less of an experimentation. I'd hesitate to even really call them mods at that point, and just call them DLCs so I'd expect them to work seamlessly with other third party developed DLCs just as I don't expect official DLCs to break one another.","1430439041"

THE RIGHT: a black criminal ran from the police and had an injury some time during the arrest. He also had a prior spinal injury and was trying to hurt himself inside the police vehicle. So rioters are using this as an excuse to rob stores and destroy things. Lack of family structure and liberal policies are to blame.

THE CENTER: someone died in police custody. Certain people are upset and a protest then turned riot occured. Millions in damage. 7 cops in the hospital. Hundreds of arrests. Nothing is accomplished.

"h1z1","t5_31a08","My issue has absolutely nothing to do with KOS. If I see someone with a backpack, weapon, and/or helmet equipped... I'm going to shoot at them. I'm a rabid PvPer who prefers open-PvP and full player looting. KOS doesn't bother me one bit.

My issue stems from this:

*John Smedley ✔@j_smedley*

*we're toning down guns and ammo you find btw. way too much out there.*

*1:44 PM - 2 Feb 2015*

*John Smedley ✔@j_smedley*

*we want it to be a survival game not a gun show.*

*1:45 PM - 2 Feb 2015*

 H1Z1 is still a gun and ammo show. Many players burn weapons into metal bars because there are so many. Personally, I don't even pick up any weapons from loot spots, anymore. They've become so common that passivity is the norm with regard to looting them. Ammo is everywhere. If anyone states otherwise, they aren't being honest. Figure out 3-4 loot routes, loop one or two, then bank. Go back out and hit the other loops. Rinse. Repeat. Ammo, ammo, and more ammo. 

Whether Jimmy likes it or not, he's one of the main faces of H1Z1, and since he's the combat guy, the criticism about anything related to it will be directed at him. I'd find it very, very hard to believe that he has zero input on the the loot frequency part of *his* work. It's clearly his preference. CS, eSports, BR... That's him. It's fine and all, but it also makes me worry about the sandbox nature of this game and if it will ever be realized. Sandboxes are not only about giving, giving, and giving. It's about ebs and flows, winning, losing, finding, not being able to find, et cetera. We don't have much of that in terms of depth. It's simply live, die, then easily more of everything. That's it.

I love guns in games. I love PvP (I'm still waiting for a no-zombie server). On the other hand, I was under the impression this game would be a little different than others when talking about being armed to the teeth pretty much at all times. The more Jimmy puts in, the more the vocals will be screaming for ""more, more, MORE!"". And with that, will come frequency. It can have a trickle down effect to other systems, too, since there isn't any scarcity. One being the player economy they want to have happen. That is a general loot system problem, though (dumb minimum loot quota they have); not just a gun and ammo one.","1430439044"

is the police force in baltimore a little corrupt? absolutely. are people profiled and arrested on a daily basis? once again, yes and its a pattern that needs to end if we can hope to fix poverty.

but i think these riots are only happening now because its coming after a mound of similar cases popping up in the news. and people saw ferguson as a very eye opening moment and are choosing to act similarly. the difference is baltimore is not a small, somewhat removed community. its a very large, very diverse city and a lot more people stand to get hurt or have their property destroyed.

&gt;Just b/c some scientists feel the need to use the word ""urine"" as part of their description of it, doesn't make it urine.

I think this Sums up all the reasons we are disagreeing. If you don't want to accept information from specified researchers and medical science I will never sway you otherwise. It clearly states that squirting and FE are different things and sometimes combine because of orgasmic incontince.  The Nomenclature is what it is. If I have to tell you how to use a dictionary[again] and look up the definition of urine and then explain to you why they use specific terms to describe specific things the there is no hope for us to reach a conscience. I believe it to be factual evidence based knowledge. You apparently believe factual evidence/diction to be subjective. I'm sorry but they aren't. If new research appears to the ladder it will sway my belief but until then it's pee/ urine/ human waste/ureatic acid processed by the kidneys/tinkle/ gross. If you need to think of it that way to make yourself more comfortable more power to you dude. It's still urine. That was the discussion. ","1430439047"

We had an excellent community also, everyone pretty much knew everyone somehow. Everyone (assuming the school specializes in something) has *atleast* 1 similar interest. ""Bullies"" or ""Jocks"" just didn't exist. 

Lots of people like to compare test statistics to show why charter schools are no better or worse than other public schools, but that means shit when your school specializes in something that isn't going to be on a standardized test anyways. 

It means something when the child doesn't hate going to school, can seriously focus on a subject that very much interests them, actually have a say in how the school functions, have small class sizes, and doesn't feel left out while also getting the standard curriculum required.

**Tl;Dr** - I think most charter schools are like this, it's just the culture that comes with most.

I am ultra consistent on pistol rounds, always a double or triple kill, sometimes a quad. Gun rounds I am far less consistent - this is because all the other players limit themselves by addadada spam on pistol rounds fucking with their accuracy, but they don't on gun rounds.

The satire Colbert used was more intelligent and his personality was far better. I find LWT to be very hit or miss. What I do like is that he tries to have both sides represented, but sometimes fails at it. For example he had an all black panel and every one of them agreed with the riots in Baltimore and one even said the mom shouldn't have disciplined her child. Then there was the episode with some anti vaxing old lady and while she blabbed about some statistics about autism no one even refuted her ideas, with the exception of another guest calling her dumb.

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","Do you have an autoexec.cfg? If not you should create one. How to do it you can see [here] (http://csgohelp.com/autoexec-qa/).  Important to note is that you have to write ""host_writeconfig"" at the very end of your autoexec. With this command your autoexec will have a higher priority than the regular config - your config gets basicly overwritten by the autoexec.cfg if you start the game.  

**So for practice:**  
I suggest you to create a new .cfg file - mine for example is ""practice_config.cfg"" . In this .cfg file I have all commands which I need for private practice sessions. The commands I use you can find [here] (http://pastebin.com/Udxx7HDF).  
Now I bind my ""practice_config.cfg"" to a key in my autoexec.cfg with the command   
-- bind ""END"" ""exec practice_config.cfg"" --  
Every time I press the ""end""- key on my keyboard the ""practice_config.cfg"" is executed in a private session. To create a private session you type for example ""map de_mirage"" in your console and you will automatically join a private session. Alternatively you can create private session under ""play"" --&gt; ""offline with bots"".

I find that callous and juvenile.

I enjoy reality videos of fights, freak outs, and whatever other drama as much as the next person.

However to take such delight in a circus of physical and emotional pain purely for your unempathetic voyeuristic pleasure just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

It's one thing to watch a Russian dash cam of simple reality unfolding, but to actively encourage a drunk woman to get rowdy in the hopes that she embarrases herself or the person she is raging against...just seems in poor taste.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","Honestly a lot of these dragon decks are just worse versions of decks that are already popular. Dragon paladin has potential because of consort and it's decent ability to heal/stall but the rest are just mediocre from my experience.

I tried to make a dragon handlock but it was just pointless, the deck is awesome as is and subbing out the mid/lategame stuff for dragons doesn't synchronize with the rest of the deck at all. Dragon warrior is the same way, its just a noticeably worse wallet warrior.

I think the big stuff for this expansion isn't going to be the dragons, it is going to the stuff that makes existing decks better. Thaurissan, quick shot, and solemn vigil come to mind. I think the biggest thing to come out of BRM is grim patron, he is the only card that actually spawned a completely new deck.

Edit: since a lot of people are replying with their success stories I'll phrase things this way. I think the current dragon decks are unrefined knockoffs of already popular decks. I think with some time people will find out what works and what doesn't and maybe go from there. Just from today's play testing alone I've started to reconsider how good I think drakonid crusher is for example. ","1430439061"

One that rolls around every month or so is both my parents dying and having to fight my abusive grandmother for custody of my sister in court. Things that involve death in the family happen infrequently. between 13-15ish, lots of dreams where I'm forced to turn tricks, or someone I know is, and those were horrible.

I'd recommend maxing out Smelters and Mines whenever you have the resources to spare, that should keep you supplied with plenty of coal.  The hit you take to wood and minerals from the Smelters will cease to be relevant eventually.  Smelters also produce Iron and Gold, which you'll always need, and eventually you can upgrade them to make Titanium, which will MASSIVELY boost your production of that if you've got a good supply of Smelters to start with.  

Once you unlock Geologists, they're very useful to have, especially when upgraded.  

If your coal production starts to exceed iron production, it'll be hard to make much steel, so that's when you should probably back off on the coal or build more Calciners.  ","1430439062"

 [**Abraham**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Abraham__ (/ˈeɪbrəˌhæm, -həm/ ([Hebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_language): אַבְרָהָם‎,  listen (help·info))), originally __Abram__, is the first of the three [biblical patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriarchs_(Bible\)). His story, told in chapters 11 through 25 of the [Book of Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis), plays a prominent role in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. 

&gt;The narrative revolves around the themes of posterity and land rights. Abraham was called by God to leave the house of his father [Terah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terah) and settle in a land which was already settled by the descendants of [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan_(biblical_figure\)); however, God promised it to Abraham and his progeny. Various candidates were put forward who might inherit the land after him, but all were dismissed except for [Isaac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac), Abraham's son by his half-sister [Sarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah). Abraham purchased the [Cave of the Patriarchs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Patriarchs) at [Hebron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebron) to be Sarah's grave when she died, thus establishing his right to that land. In the second generation, Abraham's heir Isaac was married to a woman from his own relatives, thus ruling the Canaanites out of any right to his inheritance. Abraham later married [Keturah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keturah) and had six more sons, but on his death, when he was buried beside Sarah, it was Isaac who received ""all Abraham's goods"", while the other sons received only ""gifts"". 

&gt;The Bible's internal chronology places Abraham around 2000 BCE.  Despite this, ""there is nothing specific in the Genesis stories that can be definitively related to known history in or around Canaan in the early second millennium B.C.E.""  As a result, ""it is now widely agreed that the so-called 'patriarchal/ancestral period' is a later literary construct, not a period in the actual history of the ancient world"" (Professor Paula McNutt).  The majority of scholars believe that the [Pentateuch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentateuch) was composed in the Persian period (roughly 520–320 BCE),  as a result of tensions between the Jewish landowners who had stayed in Judah during the [Babylonian captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity) and claimed Abraham as the ""father"" through whom they traced their right to the land, and the returning ""Priestly"" exiles who based their claim to dominance on [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses) and [the Exodus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Exodus) tradition.

I'll be pedantic here, but even if you lower the power, it's the unit itself that matters. The Baofengs simply have not been certified (by the FCC) to meet the requirements to transmit over FRS/GMRS frequencies.

Now that's of course not stopping anyone from using them. I just think that anyone buying one of these radios should know this. Better to know this than be surprised if they find the one random ham operator who decides to tell the FCC (which, while rare, [does happen](http://transition.fcc.gov/eb/AmateurActions/Welcome.html).

Honestly I don't like any of the Canucks logos whether its the V, the skate, the orca, or that ridiculously cartoonish Johnny Canuck. I find it hard to believe they can't hire some graphic designer to come up with something a little better. 

I really like the color scheme, it screams Vancouver, and think it fits the team better than any logo we've had ever did. The current/recent Canucks are typically not the style of team that could pull off the strong black/yellow jerseys of the early 90's imo. No idea WHAT would be better, thats for someone a lot more creative than me to decide, but man have we had a bad case of identity-crisis since our induction into the NHL. Sad. 

Just for reference, my personal favorite Logos/jerseys in the NHL are the Blackhawks (Best overall Jersey imo) Sabers (the one with the actual sabers, not the buffalo head) Montreal (not a HUGE fan of the toilet bowl but the overall jersey is unreal) St. Louis, Detroit, Toronto, Winnipeg (new one, not the old one), Philly, and Ottawa back before they changed to the 3D dude.

&gt;For those wondering if they’d been trolled by Wittman, pay attention to this response to a question about whether he had purposefully tried to catch Toronto off guard with Pierce as a stretch four. Specifically, take notice of the portion of Wittman’s response in which he says sometimes you have to “bite your tongue and not go for a win” in the interest of minutes.

&gt;“Well, I mean, it was tough during the regular year,” he said. “I think it really worked well against Toronto. And in the three games we played them in the regular season, we weren’t able to play Paul at four any of that stretch. The problem was during the regular season, I wanted to try to keep Paul at 25, 26 minutes a night just to make sure he was fresh getting to this point of the year in the playoffs.

&gt;“To be able to play him at 3 and 4 was going to be a stretch to get those minutes where I wanted to keep him. He played some 4 during the course of the year. I don’t have to worry about minutes, now. We don’t have back-to-back games. I can get him up into the thirties now and not worry about it. But during the regular season, I was making sure that, you know, as hard as it is, to sometimes bite your tongue and not go for a win because of minutes. But I wanted him fresh, and I think it’s worked out pretty good.”

3. Renly was going against all the laws and conventions of their society in doing so, whereas Stannis was in the right according to hundreds of years of tradition.

As for Chad Jackson I'd defend that pick.  The guy had really good hands and was good at getting open and had solid routes.  most saw him as a fringe first and he apparently interviewed well w/ belichick(but it was controversial overruling by Bill apparently). Hard to predict your WR would develop a hamstring issue in TC as a rookie and struggle to play through it after missing most of camp then tearing his ACL missing 07 camp.  Everything went wrong health wise for the guy and if you looked in 08 when he finally had a healthy training camp he lost so much athleticism.","1430439071"

I only have 1 other tattoo on the center of my back that I somewhat regret; a biohazard symbol comprised of the earth in the center with various elements making up the 6 outer curves of the symbol. (i.e. one is an ice cliff opposite a curling wave of water, ones a potleaf opposite a curl of flames, etc). Also done when I was young, I went the cheap route (drew it myself, paid 350) but the tatto artist's rendition of it is mediocre at best (shoulda spent closer to 1k IMO, considering its complexity) but I hope to one day cover it up with the same design, slightly larger and with a much better execution.

Anything I say in quotes means that the term doesn't technically exist in GW2. I'd say the closest to Feral is still D/D Ele.

No stealth though, unlike Feral. But you have a number of blast finishers so you can use one of those in an Engineer or Thief's smoke field and gain stealth from it.

Edit: As far as the combo points mechanic goes, that'd be Warrior. I wouldn't say Warrior is close to Feral though. ","1430439074"

&gt;Note that paying that $30/month still shows ads on my page

I don't see what's wrong with that. You don't like it, but a competitor can put up an advertisement right next to your store in the real world, too, or at least can advertise in your area. You could probably buy the space from them, which would cost you monthly.

&gt;Also they filter reviews from nearly anyone who isn't a heavy user of the site...that customer that just wanted to share how we helped her family through a hard time by making everything easy for her? Fuck her review...she is filtered out.

I call BS. I see reviews from people all the time who only have handful of reviews. If you never use the site, and you jump on one day to review someone, that's a mighty suspicious review, IMO. I've got no problem with them filtering those reviews. It is probably better that way.","1430439077"

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","No dia que as pessoas pararem de viver no ""lindo mundo da imaginação"", irão ver que por trás da dureza desse texto da Veja existem alguns pontos muito válidos. Enquanto os indicadores de educação não melhorarem, não tem governo de Luciana Genro que aumente realmente os salários dos professores. É um problema muito mais cultural do que de alocação de recursos. 

Quando comecei a estudar Química muita gente olhava horrizada para mim, uma vez que meu irmão gêmeo passou para Medicina e nós dois sempre tivemos desempenhos escolares muito similares e tiramos escores muito próximos no vestibular. Não conseguiam entender porque eu faria um curso para ""virar professor"" quando podia fazer medicina. De fato, eu mesmo não quero ser professor de Ensino Médio, quero fazer pesquisa e dar aulas em Ensino Superior, mas esse comportamento dos meus familiares e dos conhecidos apenas mostra como a própria cultura do brasileiro coloca o docente em uma categoria inferior. É um ciclo vicioso no sistema atual: a educação é ruim, o aluno mal-formado acha que é o sistema é bom o suficiente, os professores continuam a ganhar mal, os sindicatos promovem greves e, se ganham algo, conseguem aumentos pífios, a educação continua ruim e por aí vai.

Agora, quando tenta-se quebrar esse ciclo, arejar as escolas com idéias novas os primeiros a rejeitar são os próprios sindicatos! Não tem cabimento isso! Não se leva metodologias novas pq os professores são mal-pagos; os diretores de escola não podem ter cursos de formação em administração e economia escolar porque ""educação não pode ser monetarizada""; os alunos são violentos e cometem graves ameaças, mas não pode denunciá-los a secretaria de educação (ou polícia em casos extremos) porque isso traumatiza, etc. É um sistema falido!

I am from a very diverse place. The highest ethnicity is only 31% of the population. I grew up with a wide variety of cultures, which I base my opinions on. I also lived in a white upper middle class suburb in Arizona for three years, as well as a poor immigrant neighborhood in Boston for three years.

From what I have seen of black culture in America, the girls often go to college, the boys go to prison. Black boys are expected to act a certain way, or they are treated as almost traitors to their race. 

It bugs more way more than it should every time I hear someone say ""Oh, he's not really black"" or something similar.

One of my friends is from Angola, and he pointed out to me that the black people he met while living in San Francisco were always ghetto and uneducated, whereas the black population in Boston was much more diverse, probably due to the high number of immigrants from Haiti, Africa, etc. 

My best friend also said much of the same after moving to North Carolina. 

It seems to me that too many urban black kids have to deal with their poverty along with a ghetto culture that promotes being uneducated. 

If you want an example of what I'm talking about, as silly as it seems, watch this [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeaBYEzsZfg)

A lot of black kids deal with this.

Poor whites, rednecks in particular, also deal with this. In this regard, Asian culture is much superior (although it has its own problems.)","1430439080"

Successful people don't get there with 40 hours a week.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Honestly, I think you need to take some time and reevaluate your statement. Have you ever worked a high-level management position? I can tell you from everyone I've spoken with (even the people who claim to need less sleep) that it takes a toll on you. Now, while some people certainly thrive in such positions, these are public companies. You don't get to just dick around and get paid for it. Don't get me wrong, you might for a month of two, but you'll get fired so fast. 

People in top-level positions are generally knowledge workers. This means that they're not paid to do a thousand little things, but rather to make sure that the big things get done right. It also means managing other people.

What g_gggg said is 100% on point. If you're making six figures, you're getting paid to run a division without going to someone higher up every 5 minutes to ask for help. You're expected to produce results. If you're making 5 figures, you tend to get more oversight. That doesn't mean you don't work as hard, but often it means that you're doing a different type of work.

That being said, sure, there is a level of arbitrariness in many of these CEOs, but at the same time, they are all working their asses off to grow their companies. If you really have 'nofeels' and 'justdebate', try and look at the situation as critically as possible. Choose a CEO and try and learn about them and what they do. You'll quickly see that there is a lot more going on than meets the eye.","1430439088"

Being recognized for what you do is good because it motivates you to create a name for yourself, even if its as small as rescuing kittens.  My point was that trying to DO things makes you a better person, trying to LOOK better only makes you more vain.","1430439089"

Not only is the choice of which of the three seemingly arbitrary, but in the mix cases the point at which it changes will also be seemingly arbitrary. With counting people, it just happened that native numbers with native counters (hito/futa and ri, respectively) stops after 2, whereas counting general objects (３つ mittsu) or days (４日 yokka) stops at 10. 20 even gets special treatment sometimes, such as with ２０日 (hatsuka); more bizarrely, ２０歳 (hatachi) uses the native number (hata) and native, but *different than written*, counter (chi, another form of generic 'tsu' for higher numbers) pair, yet 1&amp;ndash;19 use normal numbers (ichi/ni/san/yon) and the ""age"" Chinese counter (sai).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","No it is not about equality, not when we've been turning a blind eye towards a system has been pushing down blacks. Yes there are other races who suffer police brutality, but there are so many statistics that show police, enforcers of the law, single out blacks more than any other race. 
The police arrest and imprison blacks without parole far more often than whites for similar non-violent cases. There are such high arrests in impoverished areas like Ferguson because the community needs cash and no big businesses are going to be willing to open up and pay taxes in poor areas. Police officers have gone on record saying that they aren't racist, but at night when they are patrolling and see a black man in a bad area that they are scared for their lives.  
People are rioting and peacefully protesting to address a system that is obviously broken. 
For so many of you jumping to say that we should strive for equality is ludicrous. These same people have yet to even accept that there is a massive race issue in America. Exclusive and specific chants like ""Black lives matter"" are addressing the inequalities. America forced a group of people from their country and enslaved them. We destroyed their identity and any connections to their history. And as they try to rebuild a new culture we mock their innovative names and hairstyles. We compare them to un-evolved monkeys every chance we get including now when they riot to open our eyes about the conditions we are closed off from because we have the privilege to type behind our keyboards and watch on tv as they bring fire to Baltimore. We built our country on their backs and refuse to include them in our narrative. So yes - it is about recognizing a struggle.

2) Mun transfer (~900m/s)
3) Mun circularisation (~250m/s)
4) Mun landing (~600m/s)

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I will just paste my comment above here since it seems like you haven't seen it. I think it's a pretty good response to what you said and why I think it's wrong and this move is a risky one.

I have no doubt that Rekkless is a way better player than Steelback will ever be and I know that Steelback is just a role player and he will never be a star.

However, that's the whole point about ruining Fnatic's team Dynamic. Yellowstar plays a heavy roaming style right now, because leaving Steelback and roaming around to help Febiven, setting up vision and even going top for ganks is not an issue. Steelback is not the main carry of the team so if he loses some farm in the process it is no problem.

Fnatic right now is also a Top and mid focused team. Huni and Febiven do most of the heavy lifting and they are the members who get more attention from Reignover.

Lastly, Fnatic loves to fight. They play a risky fighting style where at any point in the game they might start forcing team fights or skirmishes all around the map.

Now going back to Rekkless, he will demand more farm, he is so passive early game and does not want to come for fights and he wants jungler attention. I don't wanna make this already long comment any longer so I guess these points can help you understand why getting Rekkless is not really the smartest idea and why it might ruin their team dynamic.","1430439096"

Marriage has a long history in common law so you can't challenge the very idea of marriage itself.   It just doesn't work that way.  To do so would disenfranchise people already married.  Something SCOTUS has called a fundamental human right.


This isn't some opened ended hypothetical scenario.

I am all the days that you choose to ignore

I am a moth that just wants to share your light

I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night

I only stick with you because there are no others

You are all I need""



To me, this is a perfect summary of what it feels like obsessing over someone who doesn't reciprocate your feelings. And god....


""It's wrong, it's right, it's wrong, it's right""


On top of all this, the music. The little drum breaks, the ground bass line, the piano, vocal melody. I love it all so much.

Ultimately Duncan changed his diet to something healthier, like lean meats and vegetables. He started eating something almost like a cave man diet. Also, he started swimming and boxing in the summer during the off season. Not only did this result in weight loss, which makes it easier on his joints when he runs, it also increased his cardio and overall endurance. Timmy is a perfect example of someone who loves the game of basketball and wants to play it until he feels he no longer can contribute to his team.","1430439103"

And, even beyond manufacturing, the stronger every American business is the more truck drivers we need, and security guards, and custodians, and a hundred other low-barrier-of-entry jobs that cannot be outsourced.

And to be completely honest, I had just recently played a video game where a nuclear bomb was detonated (Call of Duty). And I never once considered the dream to be ""prophetic"". Never used the word, I mean. Maybe having a premonition is considered to be prophetic, but it's not the term I would use. All I know is that the dream / nightmare occurred and weeks later, I had the exact same experience without the devastation.

I forget where i read that, it was a vape site but it linked to the study. There are very little studies done on the subject. Tobacco smokers become heavily addicted to nicotine for life though, thanks to the help of the nicotine delivery system in cigs that make it much more addictive than it actually is.","1430439105"
"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","OK - I'm going to be 'that guy' and take some stick here. I'm going to cover myself in caveats in this paragraph, but there are going to be a lot of people disliking what I say in the second. Yes - the 'kink community' (IRL, on FetLife, and of course, here on Reddit) needs to support, and train, people in how to recognise and avoid abuse. Yes the community needs to recommend safety measures to take with new partners. Yes, the community needs to actively exclude anyone known to be abusive, including, obviously, those who ignore Safewords.  

But but but. We can't try to create a parallel system to our nations' legal systems. There's the impression given by the linked article that 'the community' needs to somehow invent ways to identify and prosecute 'creeps'. Well we can't. We can't invent kangaroo courts based on hearsay and rumour. The legal system exists for a purpose. It's been honed. It's been proven by trial and error. It's imperfect, but it does work, on the basis of a random selection of our peers judging all evidence, and finding it to be beyond reasonable doubt.  

The linked Salon article describes Maggie Mayhem telling an audience about her rape. If the experience was as described, then it was clearly, legally, rape. Take the kink out of this and what is still left? Assault. Rape. But the key thing missing from the description is whether the police and courts were involved. This story is nothing to do with kink as such. I hope, without knowing more of this story, that Maggie, and the court system, prosecuted this man, and that he was found guilty, and punished for his crime.

What we *can* do is train people in how to negotiate relationships. How to express consent and how to withdraw it. How to find partners they can trust. How to be safe on a first date.   
After all, meeting someone for the first time for kinky bondage play, is a very, very vulnerable high risk version of a normal first date, (and we would tell our daughters all sorts of safety advice if they were going on a non-kinky first date - or even, traditionally, open the door to the new boyfriend while casually holding the shotgun)

The kink community is *soooo* sex-positive (which is, nominally, lovely) that sometimes new subs seem to forget all the common-sense safety rules their parents taught them at their knee as children:  
1. Don't trust someone you've just met   
2. Don't go home alone with them before you know them better  
3. Don't go alone with someone who real name you don't even know!  
4. Tell someone where you're going  
5. Meet in public places first  
6. Don't go home with someone until you've seen how they interact with others, with their friends, with waiting-staff

This old-fashioned stuff somehow seems to get forgotten in the NRE excitement, when new subs are contacted online by potential abusers posing as experienced Doms.  Maybe I'm just too old, because I remember life before the World Wide Web, and maybe the next generation born won't have come across the 1993 cliche that [""On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog)","1430439105"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","It couldn't have came at a better time.  I finally got the proof that would save my marriage, the validation that I wasn't going crazy.  Maybe these pictures could even help stop the vandal that was ruining my life and wrecking my home. For months now, any time my wife would head out for another late shift he must have seen the car leaving the house.  Out at 6 in the evening, never to return before 5 am.  The bastard probably thought she was the only one that lives here.  I don't drive after the accident so I guess it's not obvious I'm even home.  My office is in the back and when she's gone I don't do much anyway.
Last night changed everything.  I got him dead to rights, I have photo proof and I can't wait for Katherine to get home.  I've sat up since 3 this morning going over the pictures making sure I've got him from every angle.  I fell asleep in my chair and he paid me no mind as I silently awoke to every picture on the mantle being thrown to the floor and shattered.  What kind of asshole comes in to a house just to tear it down?  It doesn't matter, I'll show her the evidence and we can put these past few months behind us, maybe get a better security system or move out of here altogether.  I think she'll be relieved just to know the truth.
I hear the garage door opening and I get my phone back out and open my gallery, readying my triumph.  As she unlocks the door to the garage I scan the pictures one last time.  Nothing but broken bottles and our Schnauzer Frankie pressed up against the wall with his tail between his legs, terrified.  In the last photo it appears that camera has been turned around and, unaware, there I am on screen with a thousand yard stare, lips moistened with brandy and a dead look in my eyes.  A competition of embarrassment and disappointment wash over me as I quietly put my phone away, preparing a bewildered apology for the state of the house.
The faraway look in her eyes betrays her fake smile as she says, ""You'll catch him next time, love.""","1430439107"

The river of dotted lights glowing as they traveled down stream of L'Avenue des Champs Elysées towards destinations unknown.  The lights moved passed a magnificent spires of metal, erected into the inky black night sky as tribute to the liberation of worthless people; they moved under a glorious arc designed in tribute to battles long ago won by the dead; the lights continued in a constant stream, without beginning, or end, as Renetta stared out into them—pondering how the world has been filled with so many lights which serve only to stare in awe at their grater’s accomplishments of the past.*  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                                     
With a silent sigh, her eyes shift focus as they caught her own reflection in the glass of her ceiling to floor windows in her luxury apartment.  Her eyes were beautiful, but full of melancholy and mourning—in her recent trip to New York she had only found a handful of beings of note, and fewer Quincy who would wish to follow her.  She bore down destruction upon the city of New York, attacking it with wave upon wave of destruction from untamed Hollow...but there were so few of consequence who would to fight in challenge of this, so few who stood up for anything, so few who were interesting enough to bother giving a second look—most just died, and there is nothing interesting about the dead.
                                                                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                              
*Renetta looked deep into her milk-chocolate coloured eyes, appreciating how beautiful they were before changing them to a strawberry-pink.  Enamored in her own reflection, in it's perfection was staring back into her eyes so lovingly, as if it was the only thing who would ever truly understand her, the only one who loved her as much as she did.*
                                                                                                                                                     
*During her induction and training under The Shadow, throughout the mind numbing, torturous pain she endured, there was only ever one who watched over her throughout it all.  The instructors looked upon her as they demanded more and more, the other 'students' looked to her as example, but it was only ever her Reflection which was always present in her life.  Her Reflection was the only one who's eyes were always upon her, and the only one who could match her every perfect movement or motion.*
                                                                                                                                                                                       
Renetta stood up from her windowed perch overlooking the streams of headlights racing around the city, the beauty of the city and it's many wonders had been lost on her for a number of hours—as she was entranced with her own reflection, staring into it as it stared back into her.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           *As her towering grandfather clock rung out the hour, on the hour, every hour, she found herself unable to escape her Reflection's gaze.  She was lost, lost in her Reflection—unsure if she was helpless to look away, or if she just did not want to...or both; at any rate it no longer mattered to her, this was the most content she had been in a long time.*                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                     
She could see her Reflection smile slightly, smile at her—amused at just how enamored and engrossed she was become.  Her Reflection reached up and pressed her hand against the glass, as though she wanted through, into Renetta's extortionately luxurious (bordering on gaudy) apartment in the City of Light.                                                                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                                 
Renetta had also pressed her hand against the glossy window, it began to warm to their touch against one another.  It was the warmest touch Renetta could remember having ever felt; it was the most soothing feeling she could presently imagine—and she had no desire to pull her hand away.                             
                                                                                                                                                                                         
It dawned on her as they smiled at one another, looking lovingly into each others eyes, and feeling the warmth of the window.  Her Reflection did not want into her apartment, or into her world—no more than she wanted into the reflection of her apparent on the other side—but rather only to be with one another, not being bound by the surface between them.

I mean half of them are going to be on crack by 7th grade."" Good news is she's retired so she can't be mean to students anymore. 

Then there was the time my mother came home and told me how one of her colleagues told her ""I swear I don't even mind Mexicans, but this girl I have smells like sour bean burritos. I mean do they even bathe in Mexico?"" She no longer works at the school and last I heard she works on the other side of the state. ","1430439110"

Getting theists to support their claims by using the Socratic method is not a form of claim-making. It's a way to get them to think about whether the claims they are making *make sense*. This question is designed to point out the problem with the origin of a deity. If a god always existed then why can't the same be true for the universe itself? If, however, it began to exist on its own, then why can't the same be true for the universe itself. Of course, the theist is free to say that there are an infinite number of gods that created each one in turn, and we're left with an infinite regress not much different than an endless cycle of big bangs and big crunches.

Asking where God came from is not positing that God has a creator nor is it making the claim that that god actually exists - it's just a way to challenge people to support otherwise unfounded claims.

&gt; Cities, like living things, evolve slowly over time. Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges.  Just as humans have tailbones and whales have pelvic bones, cities have  doors that open into a limb-breaking drop, segments of fences that anyone can walk around, and pipes that carry nothing at all.
&gt; 
&gt; Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren’t removed. They remain in the urban organism. And sometimes—even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose—they’re actually maintained. They get cleaned and polished and re-painted just because they’re there.

&gt; These urban vestiges  first  caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That’s when something clicked.

&gt; Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object.
&gt; 
&gt; People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria:

&gt; 1. Were they truly, completely useless?
2. Were they regularly maintained?

&gt; In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers. He called them, “Thomassons.”","1430439114"

Even the second line of the [wikipedia page for misogyny] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misogyny) says ""Misogyny can be manifested in numerous ways, including sexual discrimination, denigration of women, violence against women, and sexual objectification of women.""

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","You are not sugesting that the ""angry reaction"" have been voicless? It has been quite vocal. I do get what you wanted it to be but that was not what it was and it is very unfair to force a premise they did not operate within on them and then judge them based on what you wanted it to be. The people has indeed spoken, quite laudly, now it was the modders turn. 

Yes it does have defintion but let's be honest, no free marked is actually free in the purest sense. A free marked does not gaurantee you the right to sell something in someones store but it gives you the option to try and get it into the store.

It is hard to have this debate without touching on the main point, which is if you should be able to charge for your work.

This comes back to it not being a debate. It was them putting forth their point of view. TB has allready covered most of the oposing views in another video and he holds many of them himself. They did not describe people who disagreed with them as any of the above, that was reserved for people turning the debate into a shit fest. Unless, of course, I missed something. In case I did I would be very glad if you could what point in the video they say that everyone who disagree with us are psycopaths. I really do feel you have to do some hard work to somehow feel this was aimed at you.

In Nicks case I would also be slightly dismissive towards people  sending me death threats for wanting to get money for something I put years of work into. Especially if this attitude was not reflected in those he interact with in the community. That would make me feel like I was being unjustly attacked by outsiders, without that neccessarily being true.

Have you watched his, TB, previous video on the subject? The only thing he defended was the idea that you should be able to charge for your work if you want to. The rest he slammed, included the issues of noncompatible mods. 

That would also depend on the implimentation, but patreon, twitch and gom tv all lets you charge for content without any of it going under. Spotify charges so does netflix, people pay. 

I didnt intend to. I dont think a paywall is the solution, at least not a blanket paywall in which you put all the mods behind. Neither is TB for that mather. 

This is not a get rich quick scheme, most modders would not have a financial motive to charge for their work because the earning would be to slim. Not to mention that many do it to learn about game developing in which case you want as many as possible to try it. Many more still would not want to charge because they, like you, are purists. There would be some competition sure, but fighting over change is hardly worth it. 

Yes as they should have been, like TB said, towards what Valve sugested. I was against that as well, still am. I just suport the notion that if you worked on something you should have the option to get paid for it.

Inevitable actually:D This is not one of those old norse myths where man is slave to the fates. Modding will in all likelyhood not be a huge cash cow for 99% of the involved modder, and in many cases it will be better for game companys to let modders make their games more attractive to a larger audience without them baring that audience from entry by charging for the mod as well as the game. It is far from inevitable that all games will charge huge sums for all mods. That only happens if people actually buy it and if you do you have nobody to blame but yourself.

However, if Snapchat could set up two different wifis, then:  (1) the main wifi could be used for anything, and (2) the specific Snap wifi could allow all snaps to go to a central on-site server that distributes them at periodic intervals, or whatever would be necessary to reduce the load on that server or outgoing signal.","1430439120"

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","I hope all those repairs weren't specifically for the noise. Sounds to me like you installed a bad wheel bearing or more likely, your tires are abnormally worn causing an awful noise while driving. Very easy to figure this out though, but requires a lift. 

Put it up in the air, get the vehicle up to speed with the traction control/ abs off, if the noise is gone there is a solid chance that its tires or maybe the component in question is not loaded enough. At this point I'd rotate the tires and see if it changes at all, though an experienced mechanic will know by the noise and how the tires look if they are the cause.

If the noise persist than our job just got easier. Take a stethoscope and probe around until you can pinpoint the noise, we're going to check anything that rotates at speed such as: wheel bearings, transmission, transfer case (if applicable), and front and rear diff (if applicable). Pretty simple to locate. Repairing most of these items won't be simple however.

The first step is to isolate the concern and locate it. Then move on to repair. ","1430439122"

Additionally a lot of the different Inquisition combinations give you small but interesting nuances even if you romance the same person over and over again with a different race or specialization even, while in Origins, there are mostly catch-alls (Morrigan doesn't treat you *too* differently if you are a Dwarf vs a Circle mage for example) so people probably have more initiative to do more romances for science! in Inquisition.

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","/r/outrun and /r/newretrowave would be a good couple places to start. An odd recommendation probably, but you could also try /r/vaporwave or /r/futurefunk.

The first two would be more akin to Real Human ~~Bean~~ Being and Zephyr, as the genres are focused on giving a big 80's synthwave feel. Some notable examples would be things like:

[Lazerhawk - So Far Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39zKhsT5naI)
If you are really into the funk aspect of it, but Lazerhawk has a fair few albums each with some different styles to it, some more like this, some darker like [Skull and Shark](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qYvqDqoYXMY) and more 80's style stuff like [Redline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpDn4-Na5co)

Other huge outrun artists that I would consider staples would be [Kavinski - specifically Nightcall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MV_3Dpw-BRY), [Power Glove - EP-1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTyFfMAkSIs), and [Com Truise - In Decay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yergWdn968o)

New Retro Wave and Outrun have a lot of bleed across one another, but are usually rather similar. I tried to pick a few artists that use a bit more of the funk aspect, but the genres can be a bit aggressive at times too. I happen to be a huge fan of it though, and seeing as how you mentioned Real Human Being and Zephyr, it would be worth checking the genres out.

Understandably, if that's too aggressive, you might want to check out VaporWave. Its a weird genre for sure, but I think it might be right up your alley as well. There are many different subgenres in VaporWave, most of which would require more specific explaining, but /r/vaporwave is a fantastic place to start.

No reccomendation list for VaporWave would be right if it didnt start with some of the essentials like [Chuck Person - Eccojams Vol. 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8fM-CGQVCY) and [Macintosh Plus's Floral Shoppe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcsYSJwewWk). Another example you might like is [Saint Pepsi, now Skylar Spence - Hit Vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3r2zleGxv7w) and [.CASTING - Late To Be Real](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xoeHeFCLfk)

This might be a weird list of recommendations, but if you hear anything you like let me know so I can hope to find more of that style for you, as the range of music here is rather... I guess broad?","1430439124"

So if you just fill up a  jug and set it on the counter un-capped, the chlorine will dissipate/evaporate and go away, give it a couple hours.  I just keep a jug or two in rotation to use for coffee making, sodastream, etc.   

If you still have objections other than chlorine, there are lots of good ideas in this thread.  Personally for pure drinking water, I just use distilled because there is nothing in except water molecules.

If it was order through fascism, the hunters all have that absolute power.  We can't even die.  Our force is so absolutely unrelenting.  That power comes at a cost, and it functions in a hierarchy.

Gehrman is someone I think being controlled or rather, influenced, but it just makes me think that each choice you make has consequences to be considered.  Gehrman being left in the nightmare is one of those.  I think Yharnam may very well be doomed, but the ending seems metatextual to me.  Yharnam isn't real, for us.  That has its own implications to me.  The doom itself is false, but in terms of staying in character, I do think there's a lot to be answered for.  ","1430439127"

1 - Have you tried out Spell Vamp quints vs. MS? I'm currently running SV which seems to help in lane as well as late game, but I wanted to get your take on it. Also, why a mix of Flat and Scaling CDR blues? Scaling CDR seems to be far more efficient.

2 - I have literally never beaten Swain in lane. Ever. I can't afford to trade, so I play safe, but then he pushes wave into tower and resets, and next thing you know I'm down 30 CS by level 9. By the time I get a jungle gank, he's strong enough to 2v1 us and the game is over. Any more tips for this lane from hell (which basically says to let him shove to tower, which I already do)?

3. Vlad has lots of HARD counters. Safe to say that he's better as a 'counter' pick than a blind pick?","1430439129"

Also when I was there, two of them took some time to give a small class of teenagers with Downs free haircuts, which was pretty cool. And they're really fast at it. And my hair looks great.

And now I'm drinking a beer, playing Mario Golf and waiting for the Eagles to give up an RG3-like haul to get a QB while we safely draft good players and beat them anyway.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","&gt; Strumming a guitar for reasons of self-promotion isn't the same as a group of strangers breaking into song out of nowhere purely for the love of life.

Breaking out into cacophonous noise for reasons of making other people think you are deep/fucking you/giving you free drugs isn't the same as playing at the subway because you deeply love music and song.

See, I can be a cynical little bitch too.

I've never met a hippy-type who actually did shit like that because it led to profound feelings.  They did it so other shallow ignorant people would think they were profound.

&gt; I'm not sure if acting sophisticated is the main signifier of enlightenment.

This is what you ignorant hippies don't get.  It's not about acting sophisticated.  It's about becoming an educated, and learned individual who has put time and hard work into serious study, instead of doing a lot of drugs, and ""painting your emotions"" while patting people on the back in non-critical environments.

It's about fucking growing as a human being, instead of hiding from growth because growth is hard.

&gt; I'm not sure if acting sophisticated is the main signifier of enlightenment. I'm also not sure how 'high' a 'civilization' humanity has ever established

Of course not.  It's a multi-objective optimization function using ensemble classifiers, so it can't be reduced into a one dimensional problem that is easily digestible by the masses.

Society and civilization is judged by its production of mathematicians, scientists, and heros, not the random pattern of zeros.

&gt; But, I'm sure that each and every bit of this comment could be argued against too.

Objectivity exists.  Reality is a bitch that way.  Just be glad we're sufficiently advanced technologically that you can lead a useless life of indolence and ignorance, supported by those of us who actually work for society, instead of dying of starvation due to a lack of useful skills and proper motivation (though starvation is a huge help with the latter if not the former), and which is sufficiently advanced socially that we recognize simply killing our useless members, or allowing them to starve is immoral, though it appears we are on a downward slope socially for at least a bit thanks to attempts by the ignorant to advance the fad of moral relativity.

Slight apologies for the tone.  I really detest ignorance, especially when it masquerades as wisdom due to extreme wealth inequality.

Seriously, the number of assholes tweeting about this shit from iPhones mommy and daddy's money bought them pisses me the fuck off.  If you want to change the world, rolling in the mud while having drugged up sex isn't the way.  Go to your local soup kitchen and pick up a fucking spoon.","1430439134"

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","Well it's really a matter of how many seats each party gets and if they can command the confidence of the House. That just means a majority of the House of Commons supports the government in place, as I understand it. The SNP in Scotland are expected to get no more than 5% of the nationwide vote, because they only have candidates in Scotland. However, they might get 55 of the 59 Scottish seats. UKIP stand candidates across the country, and might get 3 times the SNP's vote, but only one or two seats. 

The SNP is a left-wing party, more so than Labour, and they have made clear that they won't do a deal with the Tories. They might support Labour vote-by-vote, but not in a full coalition, as we have had since 2010. There is another hung parliament (no party with a majority) expected this time, and so if Labour want to form a government with their 260 to 280 predicted seats, they need the SNP to reach the 326-seat majority mark.

It is a matter of seats, and not the number of left or right wing parties, that will influence negotiations after 7 May. ","1430439137"

"news","t5_2qh3l","I do not personally believe Freddie Gray did this to himself at all.   That being said, nobody has the facts and it was just revealed that he suffered a head injury in the van, and the news station presumes he was standing at the time. 

http://www.wjla.com/articles/2015/04/breaking-news-no-evidence-found-that-freddie-gray-s-death-was-result-of-police-who-arrested-him-prob.html

Once again, These are not my personal opinions on the matter, just what was just released. Personally, i don't think he would be able to stand after seeing him being walked to the van by the officers while in pain and agony. ","1430439138"
