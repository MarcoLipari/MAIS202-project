"Libya","t5_2sbik","Thank you for your input. It's definitely very insightful as I can never truly understand the dynamics that a Libyan woman would consider. Unfortunately it seems that a significant proportion of Libyan women in the diaspora avoid or shall I even say hate Libyans in general.

I understand that the low population of Libyans in Europe and North America makes it very hard for Libyans to form relationships, however, I feel that if a Libyan man or woman truly desired to marry another Libyan they would be willing to patiently try several avenues.

My use of apps was really a last resort as there are no other accessible means for me to meet and speak to other Libyan women in the diaspora. Although it seems that the demographic who would be on the app are not the most compatible with my personal values.

It does seem to me that the contemptuous perception of Libyan men is likely driven by some trauma or other harmful experience. I personally would disagree with the generalisation that Libyan women are amongst the most oppressed women in the Arab world. The very fact that the majority of Libyan women in the diaspora marry non-Libyans with the blessings of their parents is sufficient evidence to counter the notion that they are all oppressed and that their lives are confined to a few realms of life. I do agree that Libyan culture is rife with strict rules and expectations, however, if Libyan women in the diaspora are so different in their outlooks and beliefs why is it unfathomable that their male counterparts would be any different. The few Libyan men I know in the diaspora are well educated, moderate Muslims who are genuinely respectful of others.

I would prefer not to be a hypocrite and generalise the large demographic of Libyan women who live in the diaspora, but it seems abundantly clear to me that many Libyan women have some sort of self-hatred or very skewed perception of their culture and male counterparts. I will be honest and say that the self-hatred I've witnessed had made it very difficult for me to consider Libyan women as potential partners in the past.",1696118400.0

"PlusSizeFashion","t5_2rvbk","Maybe it's just me, or plus size men in general; but I can never find anything in 2nd hand stores. And most men's plus size sections & websites tend to sell the same plain, basic looking clothing. Brick & Mortars seem to think plus size men only wear solid tshirts and sweats cause that's all they carry in their sections. I like to wear more colorful or ""outside the box"" stuff so I don't look like every other plus size man- unfortunately places like Shein are one of the few that has this type of selection. Fashion Nova has some, but only up to 2xl-3xl. While their selection is a bit more long lasting, the style is not as wide compared to Shein. 
 I think another part of the issue is cost. Everything is more expensive and people are not (overall) making more to match- so if I need something and can pay much less for- I have to consider this. 
Now I do try to engage in environmentally friendly practices when I can- I order jewelry from a place called Conscious Items that plants a tree for every item you order-; and pass down clothing to friends, family, and a donation box at my apartment complex. Hopefully my positive motives, thinking, and execution blesses me enough to offset having to buy cheaper clothing. As everyone else, I would love recommendations to better quality reasonably priced plus sized men's clothing.

That was genuinely such a sick moment.

[](#doggo)

At some point in the series, Bankai becomes commonplace, so I had honestly forgotten the hype of hearing someone say it for the first time. We had Rukia the other day, which was cool and all, but the sheer magnitude of ""the rest of the squad have to literally kill themselves to break the seal on my power or else I'd be destroying the balance of the three worlds"" into the coldest ""Bankai"" I've ever heard in my life was crazy. Made me react like a god damn kid.

"CoinBase","t5_2woql","I've only very recently gotten into bridging, largely because my brain needed a break from that good-old cryptocurrency learning curve.üòµ‚Äçüí´ 

and I'm not a fan of the waiting period either & haven't made use of Base but started out with learning to bridge between Arbitrum Nova > Arbitrum One so I can then trade ETH on Arbitrum One to Coinbase if I want to trade it in for ETH with super-cheap gas.

and to help with these ridiculous waiting periods the Arbitrum Nova to Arbitrum One bridging site is utilizing an external exchange called, ""Hop.""

I'm practicing doing all this in combination with using DeFi for trading Moons. learning the lay of the land re: all of this is quite heady for me but 

and I'm still trying to figure out the kinks because I'm looking at what might be at least one mistake on my part somewhere within all those steps. if I can't find a solution soon I'm probably going to request help here & a few more places. because I've been watching videos + doing a TON of reading & rereading trying to get used to all the steps and it's exhausting..but I want to get to the point of bridging & trsding from DeFi platforms easily. so, without needing to read a tutorial anymore as I do it.ü§û

but wanted to let you know there are options re: bridging sites that are faster than what Base offers + like that Arbitrum Nova to Arbitrum One bridge that uses thec3rd party exchange. 

I'm practicing doing all this in combination with using DeFi, like Sushiswap for trading Moons. and learning the lay of the land re: all of this is quite heady for me but I want to get to a place of using DeFi exchanges more than CEXs, esp. if the fees can be as low as they've been when working on getting used to bridging..which a few years from now that + waiting several days for completion will be a thing of the past re: ALL bridging options. a generation from now crypto users will marvel at all the steps we had to take during the old-fashioned crypto days.üòÑ

but in any case I'm not buying it either, that the 7 days wait re: Base is for security purposes. esp. when articles about other bridging services have mentioned something about the wait having to do with liquidity, there not being enough yet for it to be basically instantaneous.. 

and no idea if that's the only reason but the 7 days story from the Coinbase ptb is fishy as he11 + afaik, other Coinbase services & trades don't require a 7 day wait ""for security"" reasons. I've never experienced that..and since Base is new I think, once again, we're guinea pigs as they test out the system.",1696118402.0

It wasn't the Imperium that the 4 united to fight (if anything part of the point of them uniting was to create it but I digress) it was the Emperor himself. His plans for humanity and the pre-Heresy Imperium were the only threat great enough to Chaos that we're informed of that they put the Great Game on hold just long enough to crush them. Even the Eldar weren't fucked specifically by all of Chaos, but moreso by their unintentional creation of Slaanesh. I'm not an Eldar lore expert so please feel free to correct me where I'm wrong, but my understanding is that they were just kind of doing their own thing enjoying the fruits of galactic domination for millions of years and their hedonism accidentally created Slaanesh; and there was no ""hard"" war between them and Chaos leading up to the birth of Slaanesh.",1696118403.0

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Dr Know is insanely underrated as a guitarist. That man could shred, play jazz, and the best punk music you've ever laid your ears on! One of my favorites, top 10 absolutely, but not my favorite. 

My favorite will always be Kurt Cobain. 

Despite his lack of technical prowess, he was able to carve out an original sound. He had really good dynamics though. His ability to texture a song was just so vivid, and raw. You can't fake that sort of thing. And as a punk musician myself, it's the most inspiring thing to see.",1696118403.0

Now in modern times the social construct no longer makes sense, and the racial one is racist plus the fact that most of the other racial side got basically wiped out pretty much entirely off rwanda's terrritory by looking at what you are talking about, the nose (and also id cards), so the racial part also doesn't even makes sense anymore as well since it's negligeable today, in the sense that there is too few people responding these ""racial"" criterias to be considered a whole community/population, so the only sane and rational way to go forward was to identify as rwandans only, having 2 ethnicities would be plain ret@rded and only serve at keeping and creating division, especially knowing that these 2 don't have any cultural differences unlike some other countries.

This being said what you say about the nose today is true, although too little to matter demographically, you still have ""ex"" tutsis with these physical features, you also have quite a few in the diaspora, the diaspora tutsi is quite high proportionally to the total tutsi number, due to the genocide.

     ‚ÄúThe virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people. Data has shown that the COVID-19 virus spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact. The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes, sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.

Sometimes the COVID-19 virus can spread when a person is exposed to very small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours ‚Äî called airborne transmission.

The virus also can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it and then touch your mouth, nose or eyes. But the risk is low.‚Äù

Because if you scroll down on that Amazon listing, you can choose the 75% board with three different options for switches; Piano, Wine White and Jelly Pink. Happy to point you to which one would be preferable for you based on what you want your typing experience to be like.

As for a numpad, do you want wireless or wired? And what is your budget for that? Honestly, a numpad is a numpad is a numpad. For macros, I‚Äôd recommend the [Epomaker TH21](https://www.amazon.com/EPOMAKER-TH21-Swappable-Backlight-Programmable/dp/B0B9M115XK/ref=asc_df_B0B9M115XK/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=647317657163&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=12751209370980373154&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=m&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9031528&hvtargid=pla-1966951772822&psc=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwjt-oBhDKARIsABVRB0wLrSb2euujWWAjzk9_POINIVgVGMIC-_YH2MGmSyjCutB9_U9YyREaAmElEALw_wcB).

What happens is companies offer guardianship as a service to property owners who's buildings are for whatever reason, not being used for their intended purpose.

The companies then sublet to a few residential occupiers who live there and in turn provide protection from actual squatters. Usually the occupiers lay rent, but less that a more conventional rental agreement, but in Tien can have less security - often can be moved on with less protection from eviction. 

Also worth noting, aside from residential premises (under planning law) squatting is not a criminal offence, but a tort (a civil issue)",1696118405.0

"ShitPoliticsSays","t5_2vcl0","> Sex and gender are two different things, sex is biological... Gender is a societal construct

There is not a lot of evidence to support this conclusion, *unless you accept prima facie the prior conclusion that 'gender is a social construct'*. There is simply not a lot of evidence, outside the creation of an entirely new philosophical category of ""being"" known as ""gender identity,"" that ""gender identity"" exists as it is construed by social constructivists. It can't be both an internal disposition but also something which is externally constructed. It can't be both that gender is entirely a spectrum yet it exists with binary referents. It can't be both that ""gender is performed"" but only in reference to ""roles traditionally associated with sexes."" 

The game that progressives are using is a semantic one, because ""the facts"" don't support their conclusions. I'd encourage you to question some of the premises that are embedded in the language of ""but gender and sex are different,"" because under scrutiny they don't hold up.",1696118406.0

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

""And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping. The moon tells me a secret. My confidant. As full and bright as I am, this light is not my own and a million light reflections pass over me"" 

Reflection thematically touches on a lot of things but this lyric, for me, speaks to the romantization of the moon. Specifically, how we (including me) look at the moon and tell it all our problems, knowing it can't hear us or anything, it's just a rock in the sky. But the moon says back that this light is not its own, giving the credit to the sun, which shines on it and reflects back to us. The moon is reminding you that there is a whole myriad of cosmic coincidences to bring you to this moment, talking to the moon, and the moon is essentially telling you ""cheer up there pal, the sun will be back tomorrow to shed new light and bring a new day.""

"stupidquestions","t5_2qxdl","> You didn‚Äôt answer the second part of OP‚Äôs question about what you think the solution should be,...

If I could wave a magic wand and get people to agree with a single point it'd be this:

Government primarily exists to promote trust between citizens.

It may be an accident of history that caused us to arrive where we are today, but this is where we are: where one of the biggest jobs government undertakes involves enhancing trust so that we can engage in transactions with each other (so you can buy milk at the grocery store and trust you'll get milk, and not chalk water), so that we have someone we can go to when the other person renigs on a contract, so we can reasonably trust we can walk down the street safe from rape or assault or murder.

Further, government is force. Government is a monopoly on the escalation of deadly force. It's a gun to the head threatening to blow your brains out if you don't get along. (And that's not an exaggeration. We may dress it up in stages in the West: we may claim someone got killed not because they were [illegally selling cigarette 'singles'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eric_Garner) but because they were resisting arrest. But at the bottom of the stack, if you don't comply, you die. [That's what government *is.*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_on_violence))

Which means we should use government force lightly and carefully--and anything the government does that does not promote trust should probably not be done. We should be careful of 'one size fits all' solutions, and we should be careful not to think the correct answer to every problem is the government providing a solution. 

(I'm not saying abolish government. Again, *governments establish trust.* It has a vital role to play in our world, but one that needs to be carefully defined.)

----

The funny part is that over the decades I've been alive, I've noticed two things.

Increasing cynicism of society, of culture, and a constant drum-beat that somehow the world is going to end: the United States has been about to fall into fascism since before Reagan was elected. Hell, a number of dystopian movies (like ""Mad Max"") were taken as what would happen *when*, not ""if"", society would collapse.

And yet, everywhere you look, if you look in the long term (over decades) and not in the short term (with minor setbacks)--the arc of history during my lifetime has been towards greater individual freedom and greater recognition of the right of the individual to live our live as we so choose.

I was born in 1965, towards the tail-end of the civil rights movement, during a time when interracial marriage was illegal in many jurisdictions. Today, gay marriage is legal in the United States, and while not perfect, LGBT+ acceptance is significantly higher today than in the 1970's where two guys kissing could get you arrested (or worse) in some places. 

And we see this in all other arenas as well--in areas that favor the ""left"" (the rise in worker empowerment and in work-life balance as an important element), as well as the ""right"" (as courts push back at governments limiting gun ownership rights). The trajectory of many Supreme Court rulings (though there are notable exceptions) have been towards interpreting the Constitution as limiting the influence of the government on our lives.

----

That is, (a) people seem more agitated about the sky falling, but (b) life has, across most dimensions since I have been alive (nearly 58 years), nearly all things have gotten materially better.

(And even the housing thing--if we could just keep pushing back on companies trying to get people to work in the office against their will--can be resolved as people have greater freedom to live anywhere they wish, including areas where the cost of living is cheaper. And, as a bonus, working at home means you're not commuting--[which significantly reduces green-house emissions.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/sep/18/people-who-work-from-home-all-the-time-cut-emissions-by-54-against-those-in-office))

I can't help but wonder if these are related: as people increasingly have more power to control our lives, the 'elite' (defined as those who have a disproportionate voice in our society) are trying to push back by agitating, sounding alarms, and drumming up fear.

But I'm overall very optimistic about the future.",1696118407.0

The whole argument against equality of outcome is that it‚Äôs obviously stupid to aim for perfect equality of outcome. That‚Äôs true, but it doesn‚Äôt deal with the fact that outcomes are unequal at the moment often on arbitrary or unfair grounds that we know. You need to address that, alongside opportunity, not least because it‚Äôs a much better way of identifying where there are inequalities of opportunity!

I mean look at bo3 the dropped on the 360 and they had to limit it so much they just abandoned it and focused on the xbox one version 


Plenty of games came out for the xbox one and ps4 but most of those games that are now on both current and old gen

Are live service games that are still active and under DLC development which wasnt the case with the original old gen consoles 

The ps4 is going on 10 years old the games industry has gotten better in that time your console hasn't 

Most gaming pcs have upgraded and all the new consoles follow similar specs so both can have access to the same games

> will alter its undertones to be more western



Except for the part where One Piece's entire setting, with only minor exception, is already very generalized fantasy Europe.



> The main reason Oda said yes to this project


Do you honestly think, regardless of what Oda himself may say, that he has any control over whether a project like this actually happens? Toei owns One Piece and Netflix is a major investor and stake holder that is frequently involved in Toei production committees. This show likely would have happened whether Oda wanted it to or not, simply because Netflix is backing it.



> he wanted to try to break into America the way dbz and naruto did


If you honestly believe that, I have a bridge to sell you. Anyone with even a modicum of understanding of the market would realize that it simply isn't feasible. Dragon Ball Z is a unique case, it came out at a point when there wasn't much anime available, few competitors that willing to take a chance on it and even those that had were basically one foot in the grave by the time the series started airing in late '96 let alone when it moved to Cartoon Network in late '98, which put it squarely in front of a potential demographic of 54m households at a point where there were few cartoons really like it on Western tv and the relative simplicity of the concept meant that it could fairly easily mesh with classic toy catalog cartoons of the '80s, which was pretty much exactly what it did.

Unlike the more involved anime of the era with rich, complex stories Dragon Ball Z was simple and appealing in the same kind of way the likes of Power Rangers and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and helped lead the way as anime popularity exploded in the early 2000s. From there, Naruto wasn't all that different, the market was larger than it ever was in the U.S. and there wasn't a lot of strong competitors by 2005 aside from the breakthrough popularity of Fullmetal Alchemist but most importantly, like Dragon Ball Z, the conceit was accessible and the subject matter was novel and catchy.

One Piece, by contrast, not only had to make its first impressions in the Western market with the maligned 4Kids dub, this remained the face of the franchise in the West until 2007 when the license moved to Funimation, but by then the heat was already gone. It also didn't help that where Dragon Ball Z and Naruto were simple shows which not only appealed to concepts well represented in pop culture, they were also broadly accessible and straight-forward. By contrast, One Piece is weird, eclectic, and missing episodes typically made it hard (or at least harder) to follow the trajectory of an arc. And where its pirate themes should have made it super popular explicitly because of Pirates of the Caribbean, One Piece still ended up struggling with its primary audience. Bleach was, ironically, in a similar rut despite not having the same initial hangups purely because it too was odd, eclectic, and lacking accessibility.



> he's not going to demand that everyone only drink sake to maintain his Japanese undertones



That's a bit exaggerated, but you should honestly ask yourself ""Why not?"" Can you name even one Western anime adaptation that heavily changed the material (which is to say all of them) that was genuinely better because of it? Of course you can't, because every adaptation that has ever been done here has been awful.

At some point, when something persistently doesn't work you really have to consider whether or not it's still worth doing.

Also, you act like Oda was single-handedly guiding every aspect of the production. You do realize:



1- That claim comes from CBR.



2- Tomorrow Studios have explicitly said themselves that it's difficult to directly cooperate with Japan due to the time/language barriers.


Even if they're actually listening to Oda's input after the backlash of icing out Watanabe and Sunrise on Cowboy Bebop, the studio made it clear that they find it too difficult to actually collaborate in literally any meaningful sense, so all you're doing here is building up a head canon that doesn't really exist in reality.",1696118409.0

If you decide you won‚Äôt stay past 4 pm on a weekday, complete your task list in order of most important on down and *leave at 4*. Also remember to separate things that *must* be done from things that are *suggested* to be done.

Look at ways to help reduce the load. Can you grade less papers? Can you plan with a team member or someone who teachers your same subject and piggy back off each other? Use more supplied resources vs make your own? E-mail parents instead of call? 

Average results are not bad. Doing the ‚Äúbest I can‚Äù is not bad.

I get what you‚Äôre saying about how you view others classes and teaching load. We don‚Äôt all have the same situations. That teacher with 6 kids in an IEP class is working just as hard as you are though. If you don‚Äôt believe me, go sub for them for a week and find out!

I managed to get through it by turning off the sound track for most of the film.  (I was watching on tv, not in the theater.). Turns out most/all (?) of the scare cues are in the sound track.  

A really inefficient way to watch a movie, but that move was worth it.

You are afforded little to no plot armor. The reason why they make games like this is when you figure that stuff out out all on your own is one of the top 10 human emotions. 

How did you feel when you went back and found stuff on your own to beat those bosses. Did it feel good? I‚Äôm pretty sure it get awesome. 

If you ever get stuck or run up against a nearly unbeatable foe, or don‚Äôt know where to go the game won‚Äôt tell you directly. It‚Äôs gotta be your choice to go into the world and explore. 

That‚Äôs what makes a fromsoftware game magical but sometimes it‚Äôs a bitter pill to swallow. It‚Äôs ok to put the game down if you aren‚Äôt having fun. 

I ran up against a wall on my first playthrough and eventually I put the game down. I went back months later to replay from the beginning. I breezed through the early game and lo and behold. I learned I had missed an entire AREA to get goodies and get better. That feeling of, holy shit I missed this?!? Is unique to games like this. And I love it.

That's dishonoring their parents, and In the OT would be a death sentence, but they have the nerve to tell Jesus and his followers that not washing their hands before eating, as is tradition, makes them unclean.

The rest of the passage is about what's inside is what matters, not what's outside. You don't become unclean by what you put in your mouth, but by what comes out; words. In that sense, he's saying that the pharisees are hypocrites, they ignore the word of God when it's convenient, and encourage others to directly disobey the command to honor their parents.

Does Jesus support the death penalty? I'd actually say *no*, because in that time period it was illegal for anyone but Roman courts to condemn you to death, and Jesus was all about following the Roman laws.",1696118413.0

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Hello future romhacker here,

FEUniverse is where most of the rom hacking discussion take place. [The link is here](https://feuniverse.us/) (I recommend signing up if you going attempt a hack) 

Here's the starting guide for which is [here](https://feuniverse.us/t/getting-started/10320). This is where most of the guides are and hacks are station at. Now, I also recommend joining the discord. It where you probably going to get the most help. 

if you going to build a rom hack, I recommend starting with either FEBuilder or Lex Tailonis: They are easy engine. [Here's a tutorial for FEBuilder](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKc1QiwHf42do4fNvTlnFPb4XGd6ZP2Hh&si=vFI7xjPeTi24incy). But if you want to more indepth about each engine there's a good post [here.](https://feuniverse.us/t/romhacking-lex-talionis-tactile-and-srpg-studio-an-engine-comparison-post-which-game-creation-engine-will-best-suit-your-needs/17559)

Now there are some awesome guides made by nadnap about Fire Emblem design. [Here's a the playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4Na6cBiAAy7zany8I9CFN6wzMZtXWntq&si=TMVBpr0Plq_a0rnB). 

There are few guides lying around the internet. I honestly use FEUniverse as nothing more than resource, hacking, and tutorial repository. There are some great tutorials just search up a question and add ""FEUniverse"" There a probably a good discussion talking about it.

Also here's some advice: You may be overwhelm. Now, I could go on a spiel about everything but a post in FEUniverse really explains a lot more better than I will ever will. [Here](https://feuniverse.us/t/advice-for-rom-hackers/143). I hope you do well and perhaps we can work together in the future! Good Luck!",1696118413.0

"NASCAR","t5_2qs08","Ford has had some issues.  I'm a bit of a Blaney fan and I have been disappointed.   
It's silly Ford doesn't give just as much support to RFK.  Maybe they will starting next year considering the 17 and 6 have been running up front more.  Plus the 17 has 2 wins this year.  I wonder what's going on with the Fords.  Is it just the shape of their front clip or something holding them back?  Everything else is the same parts wise among all the teams and I'm sure they have just as much power under the hood as everyone else.  Maybe NASCAR will help Ford out and tweak the front end enough to help them out a bit for 2024.  There's still little tricks these teams figure out even with the cars all using the same parts from the same suppliers.

>Printing a ton and only letting people buy it from the museum would probably lead to a worse problem, where brokers from international markets just go into the museum

First off, you need to understand that when I say ""reserve the museum merch for in-person sales"" I'm talking about THE MUSEUM ONLINE STORE, NOT THE POKEMON CENTRE DROPS. I've said that pretty clearly lol. That's because the museum does not have the capacity to even handle the traffic the same way the Pokemon websites do and at the same time does not have enough stock for in-person sales. This has nothing to do with the pokecenter drops. 

Second, you need a ticket to purchase merch, so there's a limited number of entrants. 1 of each item per person, no exceptions. Queue to the giftshop, give everyone a ticket at the enttance, they must present it upon purchase and then you take it away, curm double dippers. Yes, the local scalpers will probably try to overrun the ticketing system  but they were already doing that anyways so it makes no difference. That probably needs a lottery system.",1696118414.0

Yes, one can definitely go on about mistakes Wrel and the team made, no doubt. But I also have the ability to look around and watch as this subreddit blows up about something, the devs change it, and then the sub blows up again in the opposite direction. I don‚Äôt envy anyone at RPG for having to try to manage such a wide diversity of players. And I have enough perspective to know that some things I don‚Äôt care for (NSO, construction, etc) are things some people have really enjoyed. I also know that some things I did like (outfit wars, war assets) are also despised by some for very valid reasons. Again, it helps to have a nuanced take.

I‚Äôm not totally sure why im trying to have this discussion this deep in a small thread at this point, especially since you seem to have decided that because I don‚Äôt absolute despise Wrel im somehow sucking his dick and im a ‚Äúshitter‚Äù (Jesus Christ man you need to expand the vocabulary a little).

Kalau jumlah charger ini ada lebih dari satu dan semuanya tetap tercolok di stop kontak, mungkin bisa signifikan juga.  Misalnya ada 10 charger yang nggak digunakan untuk ngecas, tapi posisinya tetap tercolok, anggap saja saat standby/tanpa beban itu konsumsi dayanya 0.4 Watt. Karena ada 10 charger maka total energi yang terbuang adalah 4 Watt. Apabila ini didiamkan sebulan, maka (  (4 x 24 x 30 ) : 1000  ) x Rp1.500 = Rp4.320",1696118416.0

>I like landfall 

It runs [[Valakut the Molten Pinnacle]] and support card as an alternative strategy. 

>I like tokens

I‚Äôve had games where I basically just spammed the board with 1/1 devil tokens. I‚Äôve also had games where I spammed the board with 6/6 dragons (they were short games). It‚Äôs a bonus that they‚Äôre not Goblins. 

>weird strategy

Speaking of weird strategy, the ‚Äúsecret commander ‚Äú of the deck is [[Spellweaver Helix]]. 

The deck that I have runs [[Neheb Dreadhorde Champion]] as the commander though he is not integral to the strategy. The deck itself is a ‚Äúdragon tribal‚Äù strategy.

"kotor","t5_2ssrb","No, the show doesn't even take place during the same time period.

Disney hasnt ""disnified"" any of the content from the Old Republic Era that has made it's way to Canon in the past few years.

I've read most comments and your replies to them here and to shed some light on things. No the High Republic wasn't around when Lucas still owned the company, that said there was always a time period before the Phantom Manace now that specific era is being defined more and more.

The High Republic novels and comics did a real good job of setting up this era and defining it.

For Lucas' part, he wasn't really involved with the Expanded Universe at all and didn't care for it that much. He only considerd the movies he made as canon the rest was all neglectable to him.

People really tend to praise George Lucas for things he didn't do.

The Acolyte will most likely have references to the Old Republic and will for most audiances be the first time they see a story set outside of the classic timeline.

I also feel like the High Republic in itself is also a experiment of how audiances react to these sort of time jumps. While the High Republic is set from 1000 to 200 years before The Phantom Menace this is still a small leap instead of the 4000 years to the Old Republic Era.

Mine did not align with the anti-skate value. On the 47F there are 3 holes underneath the platter that lead to VR resistors. One of them is to adjust the voltage to the anti-skate so it measures the same as the real world tracking force weight. 

Turns out I had a deeper issue and I spent about 1 1/2 months locating the issue, recapping, and deoxing. Definitely a complicated machine but I became very acquainted with the schematics so feel free to reach out with more questions. Good luck!",1696118416.0

"CanadaHousing2","t5_4gdqjg","Inflation is a persistent rise in the average level of prices over time.
[Bank of Canada](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2020/08/understanding-inflation/)

Inflation is a quantitative measure of the overall rise in prices of goods and services over a given period of time.
[Business Development Bank of Canada](https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/entrepreneur-toolkit/templates-business-guides/glossary/inflation)

Where the money supply comes into discussions of inflation is when discussing how inflation occurs. If the supply of money increases faster than outputs are increased, you'll get inflation. But that link does not make the money supply increase the defintion of inflation.

As outputs do increase and decrease over time, a fixed supply of money will not stop inflation (nor deflation). Let's go through this:

If the supply of money increases faster than outputs, you get inflation.
If the supply of money increase at the same rate as outputs, the currency is stable.
Thus, if the money supply doesn't change while inputs increase, you'll then have deflation.

I think in time, and with Mat's influence and pressure fork the White Tower, she would eventually move to stop the practice of Damane. But it would be a tough and slow process. Or else a volatile and violent process.its either going to take many years to stop collaring channelers and slowly try to convince the people it's not necessary. 

Or it's going to end up being a violent conflict. And the violent conflict is going to be doubly difficult because the side trying to abolish Damane won't be able to use them the same way they used to (obviously some would decide to fight on their own). Whereas the other side will almost certainly have Damane of their own and no compunction against using them to their fullest extent.

I'm pretty sure the 2nd outcome is the more likely, especially considering Mat is there and we all know how much he loves battles and tries to find them everywhere he goes. I think the abolitionist side would basically not have very many channelers (at least at first), and Mat has to try to win with his dragons vs Damane.",1696118417.0

"uktravel","t5_3e2d0","A few things: 
1) Double check the mileage limits on your hire car - often there is limits to the miles they let you drive and this would be over it. 
2) as others have said. Driving in the uk is tiring. You are kept awake by other drivers being around you. At all times. On the motorway you will be either sitting behind a lorry or switching lanes every minute of so (remember to have to keep to the left, so can‚Äôt just sit in one lane)
3) check the costs of driving. If you have to pay for fuel, and extra miles on the car it could be a lot!
4) if you enjoy seeing the world be car, you do you. As others have said you would get a better view of you could use a/b roads. But for that distance you really have to use motorway. We have a lot of history and don‚Äôt go right to the big names - they are usually not worth it. (Honestly Stonehenge isn‚Äôt - it was all moved about in the 29th century anyway and you can‚Äôt get close to it)

# Women being lesser than men in Islam


Quran 2:228:

**Men are superior to women**

And women shall have rights similar to the rights against them, according to what is equitable; but men have a degree (of advantage) over them. And Allah is Exalted in Power, Wise.

Quran 4:34

**Men can beat women**

Men are in charge of women by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend [for maintenance] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance - [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.


Quran 2:282

**Women testimony is worth half of men**

O you who have believed, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write [it] between you in justice. Let no scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write and let the one who has the obligation dictate. And let him fear Allah , his Lord, and not leave anything out of it. But if the one who has the obligation is of limited understanding or weak or unable to dictate himself, then let his guardian dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. And if there are not two men [available], then a man and two women from those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the women errs, then the other can remind her.


And already mentioned about women getting less inheritance than men.


Quran 2:223
**Women are tilth(field) for men and they can use them however they want.**

 Your wives are your tilth; go, then, into your tilth as you wish¬†but take heed of your ultimate future and avoid incurring the wrath of Allah. Know well that one Day you shall face Him. Announce good tidings to the believers




**These are only some of the verses of Quran and if we Include hadith here, it would make it even worse (having half mind/intelligence of men, not having the option to deny husband's sexual advances etc)**


I think these are enough proof.


>So the cases would be covered if the awl was mentioned explicitly in that verse. Your issue is with the verse not explicitly covering every situation.

>Why is it a pre-requisite for God to explicitly cover every scenario? Muslims certainly don't believe that needs to be the case, we just need to know how to fairly share the inheritance, and using precedence for similar scenarios is a valid tool. Yet you are just asserting that we are wrong.

Yes.

Allah claims to be a perfect omnipotent being who has created everything including mathematics itself as you wrote. He for one, should have no issue whatsoever in giving a perfect formula for inheritance calculation, even if it was unfair.
And as I've said multiple times, the awl system literally changes the figures given by Allah according to situation. So it is safe to say that Quranic given formula is wrong and limited. Which shouldn't be a case for an omnipotent perfect god.

Allah has claimed multiple times in the Qur'an that it is a clear, concise, easy to understand , detailed explanation, explained in detail etc.

Quran 6:114:
""Then is it other than Allah I should seek as judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book explained in detail?""

Quran 16:89:
""And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims.""

Quran 41:3:
""A Book whose verses have been detailed, an Arabic Quran for a people who know.""

Quran 36:69:
""And We have not taught him [Prophet Muhammad] poetry, nor is it suitable for him. It is not but a message and a clear Quran.""


>Ok read my comment again, and consider that men and women are not equal in every aspect. Men must look after the women, therefore, part of that inheritance will go back to the woman through the man which means he gets a bigger share for that bigger responsibility

Men and women are not equal biologically but they should have the same rights. Women are not sub-humans.
Even if Islam divided inheritance share equally, won't it be the same case as Islam is trying to potray here? Won't the married wife support his husband in running the house?
If 50/50 was given to men and women, won't the women help their husband in running their homes and looking after their kids? At the end, it should turn out to be the same as men having a bigger share and women having less as both still support their home equally. Have you ever seen a women, who has refused to take part in running the house? Even as a housewife, women give everything they have(money included) to run the house?

And wasn't Islam supposed to be a global, timeless,universal and fair for all religion?

Why are women considered sub-human in it and reduced to properties of men?

Why can men do anything they want, while women have all these restrictions?
Are women mere sex objects?

If yoy are a male, just consider for a moment that you were born as a female. Would you be able to do all the stuff you have done up untill now? Would you've been happy? And if you are a women, Are you happy? Living like an object, concealing yourself like you are some wex object men can't wait to get hold off?",1696118418.0

But God Himself is not fictional. The pastors in those churches who are doing that, or the people who rape little innocent children under the guide of the Lord are WRONG and they will get what's coming to them. Trust and believe that.

But witchcraft is the reason people are doing these things and using God to hide the truth of what they're doing anyway.

Witchcraft has run through my blood on both of my mothers and my father's sides for thousands of years. On my dad's side my family who were all witches and warlocks have an entire cemetery dedicated only to the family bloodline and that place is CRAWLING with demons. I chose to be the difference.

I've seen evil and demonic things as well as angelic and amazing blessings and miracles that God has done for me and for the people who I have prayed for. God goes much further than what you see on a Simpsons or Family Guy and South Park. If you actually did some hardcore research and bothered learning how to pray and start praying and also studying both sides then maybe you wouldn't have such a closed mind.

I have met PLENTY of people who say yes know God is real but they choose to do witchcraft anyway because they can do the evil things they wanna do in life without feeling guilty about it.
So you choose whatever you wanna choose. But saying God isn't real, the one who created the earth we live on , the body you live in and every single thing in existence means that you have some serious physical and spiritual blinders on.",1696118419.0

The article posted by /u/JCHW92 gives conflicting opinions on the subject.  Ottawa and Toronto say yes to taking the lane, where London was not so definitive.

However, the Ottawa police service say that enforcement is up to the officer at the time and only point to their bike safety page saying a cyclist can take a lane when safety warrants it and not the actual HTA.

Thing is, OP isn't talking about ""a"" cyclist taking the lane, they are talking about 2 cyclists riding side by side which does not appear to be covered anywhere.

At the end of the day, even if it was just one cyclist to the right, a car often can't pass safely without going into the other lane anyway.

So yeah, riding side by side is a little douchey.  But cyclists have every right to safe passage on the road.  So if OP comes up behind one, just exercise some patience, pass safely when able and don't be a dick about it.",1696118420.0

I couldn't even tell you where else is better. I just know I've been at multiple places and thought 'this is way better'. It probably gets all the hype because it's a very easy trip from Melbourne.

As the OP has been all over the country, I expect they've seen better than the Great Ocean Road in places you would rarely/never hear about.",1696118420.0

Can't picture myself ever booing Dame, but I wouldn't have felt compelled to root for him if he wound up in Miami, and thinking about that possibility really made me feel weird since I spent so long rooting for him, and he was so important to the team, and what he did for the community as well was incredible.

The body does not know the difference between nervousness and excitement. The only thing that knows the difference is your mind. So transcend that anxiety/nervousness into excitement. 

Now, my fears are just realizing I‚Äôm scared that I know I‚Äôve already gotten what I want. And it excites me. It‚Äôs a good kind of fear because I chose for it to be a good fear, rather than letting the fear be scary and having that as my dominant thought.",1696118421.0

I once had a certified check for $110K fall out of my jacket's pocket while walking home after just leaving the bank to get it. when i get home, i grab my phone from my jacket and i don't feel the check and go shittt. i run back towards the bank staring at the ground (i had remembered roughly when i last put my hand in that pocket, as it's also my cell phone pocket), and when i go to that spot (which happened to be the middle of a block), a cop car was there with a teenager. i sheepishly asked if they happened to see a check on the ground, and it turns out the kid called the police and they returned the check to me. 

i learned my lesson: i decided to take an uber to the car dealer the next am, rather than hoof it.

A parcel, which was promised to grace my presence betwixt the hours of two post meridiem and four antemeridiem on the previous day, hath only just arrived at the untimely hour of eight ante meridiem this morn! I diligently monitored its progress yesterday, as the delay was made known to me, and the appointed hour for its arrival was rescheduled to be betwixt the hours of two post meridiem and four post meridiem on the current day. Alas, I am worn thin by the ceaseless affronts to common courtesy, for it seemeth that individuals in our midst find it most convenient to disregard their obligations and act according to their whims.*  
*In their heedless pursuit of personal convenience, they neglected the use of a conveniently provided receptacle, a locker, designed to accommodate such deliveries. Instead, they chose to rouse all from their slumber on the sacred day of rest, a Sunday, no less, at the ungodly hour of eight ante meridiem. This lamentable incident stands as but one of myriad examples of my discontent with the state of affairs in this land. I am fatigued to the very core of my being, weary of the perpetual trials and tribulations inflicted upon me by the inhabitants of this metropolis. One cannot help but surmise that this untimely intrusion may have been deliberate, an attempt perchance to ascertain the limits of my patience.*  
*In this city, a building locker designed expressly for such parcels exists, where the object in question could have been securely deposited. However, the capricious whims of these individuals led them down a path of disregard for the tranquility of others. Verily, I am exasperated with this self-centered abode.*",1696118422.0

**This Cup Is Already Broken**
by Ajahn Chah

‚ÄúYou see this goblet?‚Äù asks Achaan Chaa, the Thai meditation master. 

‚ÄúFor me this glass is already broken. 

I enjoy it; I drink out of it. It holds my water admirably, sometimes even reflecting the sun in beautiful patterns. 

If I should tap it, it has a lovely ring to it. 

But when I put this glass on the shelf and the wind knocks it over or my elbow brushes it off the table and it falls to the ground and shatters, I say, ‚ÄòOf course.‚Äô 

When I understand that the glass is already broken, every moment with it is precious.‚Äù

"newhampshire","t5_2rmnf","I just finished up doing a contract in the telecom industry, so I can speak to this a bit.

What you're describing is a very large problem in telecom. There's a number of companies working on this, including the FCC incentivizing via a framework called STIRSHAKEN, but the problem is that the telephone system was designed to be ""open"" and never ""opt-in"" like it needs to be now with the amount of spam.

Bad actors buy lots of numbers and setup offshore operations to robo-dial every number or known numbers within prefixes, 100s at a time. Someone picks up? It's routed to a human or AI now that is ready to take their info. The problem is that they blanket you with calls and there's no way to stop this.

At this point, up until each carrier implements STIRSHAKEN and enforces, is to utilize the DNC (sadly, useless at this point) and NoMoRobo. You can try to change numbers, but most of those are just waiting to be hit by the spray-and-pray techniques out there.

I've read that a few of the cell carriers have their own protection mechanisms, but your mileage may vary on how good or bad they work. Sorry, but this is the state of the industry right now. Phone calls themselves might be very low value compared to the past, but your phone number itself is quite important (think 2FA).",1696118424.0

I welcome you. I‚Äôm no Jew (ok, maybe from heritage dna but I wasn‚Äôt raised as one) and my wife is a Jew converted long ago, but I understand how you may feel unwelcomed in both communities. I consider that a lot of what you learned in Judaism should be known by Christians since the Law is the foundation of most of what we can find in the New Testament. 

As for the ‚Äúpeople who killed Jesus‚Äù, it‚Äôs not all the Jews who killed Jesus, many followed him as we can trans in the gospels and Acts, but it was the jealousy of religious leaders who killed him. So no, you are not the people who killed Christ. Don‚Äôt get into this, it doesn‚Äôt worth your time.

I don‚Äôt have anything that I like, which is the reason why I‚Äôm kinda hopeless and thinking about letting myself go. Life is just too boring and pointles  


I'm an older person who has taught at the college level (biological sciences with a lot of pre-meds). I've seen this before. Full disclosure - I chose the road less traveled with a Ph.D. in biomedical research. I am NOT RICH. So this is the anti-suit perspective on steroids. 

I think you've hit on something that's very important for you to think through. You created an impeccable resume with great experience, but it quite likely seems ""canned"".  The reason: you may not be suited to be an investment banker. Are you trying to fit a round peg into a square hole? 

Now, I will grant you that nepotism is horrific at this time and if you don't have the right connections, it all becomes problematic. There is no such thing as a meritocracy these days. However, if interviewers sense that you have ""packaged yourself"" to the max, they may have concerns about hiring you. 

Another question: Since you appear to have some means, you do have the luxury of asking yourself this question: Does the world need another investment banker? The answer to that is almost certainly a big ""NO!"" You also have time to figure out what you really like to do. Now, that does not mean that you get a cabin in the woods and create wood carvings or spin cloth for a living. It means you find something viable that actually interests you and can make you a real living. 

What we need are people who DO THINGS, MAKE THINGS, and CHANGE THINGS. Investment bankers create nothing and their sole purpose appears to be making the rich richer and the poor poorer. The world needs more of this about as much as it needs another pandemic or a nuclear war. But that's the opinion of a long-haired 50-something Ph.D....so what do I know? 

The other thing you should consider is the cyclic nature of career tracks. I think the neoliberal economic policy that created this investment class that everyone wants to feed off of may be running its course. Course changes like this can be sudden and dramatic. My grandfather was very young when the Great Depression happened. He had to steer his company into a world of more shared prosperity. Some business people made it. Many more didn't. He was fortunate. It was his generous personality (literally) that turned him into a major success in the 1940s and 1950s. I wasn't born, but I heard the stories later on.",1696118426.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This memory just came to me today as I talked to a long time friend . I am a 63 year old female and this happened When I was 13.

I was riding a bus home with my church group after playing a soft ball game. We came to a convience store that Was only 1/4 mile from my home. I always have people drop me off there and I walk the rest of the Way so they don't have to drive down And turn around.

There are two hills on this road. as I am walking a car pulls up behind me and stops beside me . I look in the car to Answer Whatever question the driver must have . What I saw Was a man Covered in blood. there was a towel laying on the front Seat Covered in blood. the guy asked me to get  in the car that he wanted to talk to me. I said no and started walking. He drove beside me begging saying he Wouldn't hurt me,  he just Wanted to talk. I ignored him and kept Walking.

The bus driver later said he saw the car stop to talk to me but when he saw the car drive away he left.

The guy drove his car down the Street And turned to come back. This put the driver where he could reach me so I ran up a gravel driveway where 4 trailers were pretending I lived there.  I ducked in and out through there yards and Crossed backyards hiding in bushes to get to my house. I Was so relived knowing there was no way he Would know where I was. I locked all the doors and peeked out the windows. There he was sitting in my driveway. He didn't stay long but how did he know?

I immediately called my friend who was on the bus With me. Her parents called the police and then her family came our.

During this time my mom came home.  I filled her in. The first thing she did was set up an Ironing board in front of the front door and placed a Cocked shot gun on it. Later When my dad came home he was met With a gun pointing at his stomach. 

A place where my dad used to work had people that had information on this guy.  He had been having an Affair and the husband Caught him. They had a Knife fight. my dad and a friend of his went looking for him with Sawed off shotguns. I am so glad they didn't find him. 

The police brought him in for me to see him. no line up. He Was sitting in the lobby,  but it Wasn't him. my guy Was a SquirreIIy dude and this guy was large With a tiny scar on his Chin.  The officer said he believed he had found Someone to trade places with him??? The whole thing Was dropped right there. nothing more Was ever done.",1696118426.0

"GERD","t5_2qlaa","It can be such a strong impulse!  

I have to stop eating at 6pm. Here are some of my strategies:

Chew gum: the sugarfree gum made for dry mouth. This gives you something to chew and also helps with saliva production which is good for that inflamed esophagus.

Drink water. I sip water and make sure I have 2 or three glasses between my last meal and bed time. 

Think about breakfast: plan a wonderful small nutritious meal to start tomorrow, and think what a pleasure it will be to eat it. 

Distract yourself: Go for a good walk (another useful thing to help your body function optimally) , have a bath or shower. Tidy the kitchen (sigh) or work on a hobby.

Also consider if you are a bit of a sugar addict (I am, and if I eat sugar I soon get the intolerable munchies). If this is you, make sure your last meal does not contain sugar.

Good luck finding some strategies that work for you.",1696118426.0

"ExTraditionalCatholic","t5_22cbt3","By that definition, no I don't believe that the SSPV is a cult. 

From my experience, the SSPV teaches what the Catholic Church has taught for hundreds to thousands of years. And yes we have rules and requirements for certain things, such a modesty and general way of living but its not the Church just forcing her opinion on how we should live but teaching us what God wants us to do and His Commandments. The priests encourage us to live by this but they certainly don't force us to. I've never had a priest tell me where I should live, who I should marry and what job I should have, etc. I would say that don't ""excessively control"" us. 

I will agree that they do discourage questioning the Faith but I don't believe that they punish you for doing so. Maybe refuse you communion, depending on what you have doubts on. Many of the SSPV I have met are very helpful, listen to me and I'm sure if I did have doubts about some things, would be more than willing to have a conversation with me about them. 

I will say that while I don't disagree with them discouraging us ( even tell us not to) not to attend the other communities, I do think the SSPV should be more clear on telling us why and not just telling us that they are wrong. I didn't know for the longest time why, but once I did some looking into it, I understood their reasoning. But do think they should provide more information then what they normally do. 

I'm always generally curious on people who leave the Faith and don't really believe in God anymore. One questions I always have in the back of my mind to ask is - If there is no God, what is the point of this earth and life? Are we just here by chance to live in a miserable world, suffer, die and then nothing? That's it? What about all the miracles, such as The Miracle of the Sun, that was witnessed by thousands and thousands of people. How do you explain those?",1696118426.0

As long as they arent requesting access to sensitive shit, the approval fires off a onboarding chain creating the user account, setting permissions , adding to any SharePoint sites,  joining groups, sending a welcome email which  (begins to nag them about setting up authenticator before they even start), if they get a 365 VM it provisions that as well.  One day I'm going to attempt to integrate hardware ordering into it, so any new shit that needs to be ordered (from a list of preconfigured shit) , is handled by the managers.  Once they approve the form, order gets fired off for us to check over it before submitting it, or if it's something like a keyboard or toner, it just submits the order.

Home ownership in UK is higher that in Germany, and I doubt that the reason for it is that people in Germany ""love"" to rent. In UK, 20% of your mortgage payments on interest are tax deductable, whereas this is not possible in Germany. So you can decide as to which country is more favorable for home ownership.",1696118427.0

People who receive SSDI can work but it has to be under a certain amount or it‚Äôs considered SGA (substantial gainful activity). Since there are certain months with an extra pay period, she‚Äôs probably going to be over SGA those months, even though she‚Äôs not really doing anything different work wise.

She probably got hit an overpayment for that month she was over SGA and likely had to request a no fault or administrative waiver of the overpayment from Social Security. An overpayment means Social Security thinks they overpaid you and they‚Äôll start asking for the money back. Social Security sucks ass so it was probably a pain in the ass to get the overpayment waived.

Totally not illegal to let her take a leave of absence btw. If anything, this request almost feels like a request for a reasonable accommodation. She‚Äôs not trying to con the government or anything. She‚Äôs just trying to keep getting her disability checks and have a little extra income at the end of the month because her SSDI check probably isn‚Äôt that much.",1696118427.0

2: because you're a convert and your dad is not Muslim his permission is not required for you to get married the imam acted as a defacto wali in a proper Islamic state you would go to a qadi (judge ) who would act as your wali but in the west it's the imams who do it

Stop waiting for your husband. Go to the imam yourself and tell him your husband agreed to these conditions before your nikkah and ask him if they are binding without the written contract because I'm pretty sure they still are and then ask him if he can officiate a written contract for you and your husband. I'm sorry youre going through this and no one helped you. I am a revert as well I got married in Yemen and they automatically give you a written contract to record your marriage you're not considered legally married without it and you can't even rent an apartment together without your contract.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","So, it definitely was not just one thing that ruined my trust in her. It was a consistent pattern over the years. I would have accepted a sincere apology about specific things in which she acknowledged what she did wrong and promised to change. Instead, I was given very broad blanket type apologies that turned out to be lies anyway. This became a pattern. So, how does one move forward after that? I dont think you can.This is why I suggest you think hard about what it was specifically where you crossed the line. 

So what I suggest is to not give a blanket apology, but a specific one. Blanket apologies are pretty meaningless. A specific apology says: I know where I was wrong and want to fix it. Then, just don't forget about it, make a real effort to make things better the next time around.

Also, commit to your apologies, always. Meaning, never rescind them, to him, or anyone else. You should mean it. It has to be honest. Anything less will erode trust even further and perhaps put you past the point of no return.",1696118428.0

Its still there mind you. I think TF2 has a relatively good sniper when compared to other games. But compared to the many many interactions that go into every other class engagement (the very same interactions that only get amplified with teamplay) he's extremely boring.

Very rarely use this site. Just wanted validation or a slap of reality. 

I a 21(M) frequent a fandom forum website, where I mainly look at people's art and other works. So much so that I started posting my own work, and made some friends on the site.

Early this year, a friend on the site introduced me to someone who posts similar work as me. We seemed to hit it off so much that he gave me a lot more info than I probably should have received in such a short amount of time.

He told me that he was moving out of his parent's house. Thinking that he was moving because of work or school. But nope, he had no plan whatsoever and took the first oppritunity to get away from his parents. And also that he had a lease for 1 year.

And when I asked him how much money he had saved to do this, he said none. He was planning only to survive on government checks and food stamps. Keep in mind he told me he was 24 and had no job experience. 

Unfortunately, he wasn't given as much money and stamps as before (don't know if it's because he's an independent or state limitations) and thanks to all the rent he had to pay, he would spend the last half of each month staving himself. 

For a while, he was completely fine just watching movies on his TV or spending time on his phone. But would always complain just how boring his life was while talking about how sad and depressed he was. 

This went on for months, and I always tried to encourage him to go out, make some new friends, and get a job. But would always come back with some excuse or say he did try but that it was just too inconvenient. 

Early this month, he was constantly talking about how much he wanted a laptop. I recently just started a new job, and was hoping me buying him this laptop would help him stop being so depressed. 

I was planning on getting him a cheap laptop with decent enough specs to satisfy his needs. But even though he was in this position, he still had the need to be picky. He said that he wanted this exact laptop which was $500, and he told me we would slowly start paying me back.

But after he told me how much money he was given every month and how much the bills had cost. After paying me back each month, he would only have less than $100 for food and other amenities. Knowing that he was already staving himself, but he told me he was completely fine with starving as long as he had entertainment.

As the build up of me getting enough money to get him the laptop, he still kept telling his friends how bored and depressed he was. Even went on the site we use and posted how much he wanted to die in such a nonchalant manner.

I was fed up with everything and wanted some space between us. I messaged him that I was through all his self hatred and that buying him that laptop would do more bad than good. I stated that I wanted some time away, and left the group chat.

He said I made the situation worse and said we were no longer friends and then blocked.

AITA for really not buying him that laptop?

"Mattress","t5_2rnrs","Re: Dunlop or talalay, it seems like talalay is a little better as an ‚Äúintro‚Äù to latex if you‚Äôre not sure you‚Äôre into the feel. I find talalay a little too squishy, but I do consistently like latex in general. 

I am 100+ lbs lighter than you, and don‚Äôt like more than an inch of the SOL soft, on top of more medium (~25 ILD from another manufacturer, the SOL medium is a big jump from the soft in firmness), so it‚Äôs hard to imagine how much you could press into 3‚Äù of soft.  But I am consistently surprised by how different everyone‚Äôs preferences are.  

I think a lot of this depends on whether you have tried latex before, and how firm what you tried was.  If you have the time, since you are doing layers, I would start with making yourself a ‚Äútrial pack‚Äù that you use to determine what you want more of.  I‚Äôm not sure where your medium, firm, and extra firm would come from, but I don‚Äôt think you need anything firmer than the SOL firm (46 ILD). If you were also looking at Latex Mattress Factory (re your reference to ‚Äúextra firm‚Äù), what I‚Äôd get to start off in your situation is:
From SOL: 1‚Äù soft (20 ILD), 2‚Äù medium (34 ILD), 3‚Äù firm (46 ILD)
From LMF: 2‚Äù medium (28 ILD), maybe 1‚Äù soft talalay

Then you could experiment with layering all of that, doubling over each of the softs to see whether you prefer more of one or the other, and then maybe order a couple more inches of your favorite soft or another inch of your favorite medium. I love the LMF medium, but maybe at your size, you‚Äôd want more of the SOL medium. 

Or just start with a couple of these layers and determine which direction you want to go from there.",1696118430.0

"starcraft2","t5_2qspc","Right, but zerg are always going to be 1-2 bases ahead of terran unless they're doing some 2 base cheese. 

Beyond early game cheese, marines are powerful yes, but require supporting force multiplier units and they are hard countered by many different units in all rosters.  Terran NEED advance beyond tier 1 to continue supporting the marine. Zerg can get away with zergling baneling well into t2 as long as theyre not F2ing and specifically in the tvz matchup they remain effective with no special composition or thought outside of adrenal glands. 

The main problem I have with zerglings and banes is how effective a cluster of them can ravage or outright destroy mining bases with very VERY minimal investment in APM. By making them marginally weaker, it means you need to actually pay attention to them a little more and despite being the zerg race in name and function you can't just be careless with them. 

You see that at every level too. Suicide units are tough because they're either wildly effective or wildly ineffective.

"canadahousing","t5_425dri","This is not correct and it is scary that people are upvoting it because it shows people do not know their rights as tenants. 

For OP:

Reasonable notice is your right in this case. The courts for whatever reason have not defined reasonable notice but in tenant situations outside of the RTA jurisdiction 30 days is very commonly the standard. 

Given the notice has been 1 day, I find it hard to believe the courts would call that reasonable. 

Your course of action would be small claims court but that would most definitely trigger them immediately kicking you out (which you'd go to small for) or they give you the reasonable notice and you are out in 30 days. 

Do you have a written contract defining the space you would rent, the timeframe, and the money to be paid? 

I'd also recommend posting in r/legaladvicecanada, they get a lot of tenant questions over there and although not everyone is a lawyer, you get a lot more informed responses compared to more opinion based responses here.",1696118431.0

I think this is a good rec for anyone getting into Godard or who aren't really vibing with him. It's unusually warm for him, appealing and freewheeling without the excessive po-mo record scratching that can turn a lot of people off.

It seems when people talk about Godard these days they either refer exclusively to the '60s work or to the post-2000 essay films. But he did a lot of really interesting work in the '80s that goes unremarked upon and is ripe for rediscovery. I'm not the biggest fan of Godard, but I didn't ""get"" him from watching the '60s films like *Breathless* and *A Woman Is a Woman*. The film where he clicked for me (or at least did something close to clicking), was the lesser-known *Germany Year 90 Nine Zero* (1991). If there's a more potent dirge for the 20th century and the triumph & domination of capitalism over utopian dreams of socialism, I don't know of one. It's a very sad and eerie film, one that we are still living inside of.",1696118432.0

I had my catalytic converter stolen last winter. The guy put two wedges under my front tires and rolled my car back a few feet to easily get at it. I've taken extra safety measures since then to ensure that this won't happen again (it wasn't a cheap fix), including parking with my front wheels touching the curb at my apartment complex, which causes the front of my car to hang over the curb about four feet. I've checked with the neighbors who are assigned to park next to me and explained my reasoning, fully intending to park normally if it upset them, but they understood and said it was fine. Today, I had a neighbor who parks across the lot walk up and physically guide me into my spot and stop me once my hood lined up with the curb, and when I got out she yelled at me for parking the way I do. I explained why, and said if it was a problem i would stop doing it. She didn't care what I said and said how much of an inconvenience it was for her to ""squeeze"" around the hood of my car or go around. I'm sure I'm the butthole here, but I'm kind of annoyed that she implied that my paying $450 to repair the damage the first time, and not wanting to go through that again, did not compare to her "" inconvenience"". Thoughts?

When I cook I purposefully make enough for two meals so two days later I don‚Äôt have to cook. Sometimes I just make extra of one component of a meal and have partial leftovers with something fresh which cuts down on cooking time and effort. Like I make extra spaghetti then fry it with garlic to have as a side with another meat. Or extra baked potatoes bake great hash browns. Mashed potatoes keep in the fridge or freezer to have another time. Leftover meat like grilled chicken is great with a bagged salad for a simple meal. 

I also like to make one thing into another. For instance a large pot roast can be pot roast for two meals and the meat can be cooked down with bbq for bbq beef. I also like to make quesadillas or tacos out of leftover meats. A roasted chicken can also make chicken salad and soup. I like to add rice noodles to my soup for a meal and I leave a lot of meat in it. All requires some effort but really not hard to make.

I had no interest of doing QA, but I was having no luck at all getting interviews for general programming, and gave it a try. We set up a Zoom call, I answered a bunch of fairly easy questions (it turned out that this was the ""technical interview'), and started a few days later.

It really goes to show that networking is where it's at... even though we had never even corresponded on the Meetup and I had only been to several meetings!

As to how it ended, their company was bought out by a larger company and the new company didn't want any part-time employees. They offered me a full-time position, but I turned it down.

$200-800ish ppm fs is for smaller cities, or newer babies who don‚Äôt know any better, or survivalist fssw. 

$1000+ (like literally up to 10k or more) ppm is for bigger cities, more affluent daddies, established babies, etc. 

I‚Äôm not rate shaming anyone because it‚Äôs fucking hard out there, but this type of thing isn‚Äôt ‚Äúsugaring‚Äù in the classic sense. We‚Äôre seeing a blend of sugar/escort now and because there‚Äôs a lot of visibility and not a lot of mentors, babies get fucked over a lot.

Back to you. If he‚Äôs willing to fork over $1200 and trust that you will meet 2-3 more times with him, he probably can afford more, and he‚Äôs signaling trust and interest moving forward. 

HOWEVER- you posting this makes me think that the way he‚Äôs talking to you is off, so proceed with caution. Do the M&G in public, with safety precautions, and feel the vibe. Ask if he‚Äôs willing to do $1200/week for 1 meet.",1696118435.0

https://www.welfareinfo.org/history/

>Corporate greed is a huge contributor to inflation and it‚Äôs long last time we ban price gouging. The government didn‚Äôt make these companies jack up prices when they didn‚Äôt need to. Companies made those decisions.

Companies made the decision to print extra money?

>I generally don‚Äôt approve of government forcing people to give birth against their will. I think the government locks people up way too often. I oppose government bans on drag shows. So if I oppose government control like that, I wouldn‚Äôt be a Marxist, would I?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_under_communism

Drag shows aren't banned per se, they're banning minors from attending them or putting age restrictions on public performances.  If parents want to privately hire a drag queen to put on a show for their kids, they're free to do so.  It's also by state.

>I don‚Äôt know what label you want to use, but all conservative presidents support some number of government programs and government control. Which I guess makes them Marxists.

They're not going to wipe out all programs or defund them because they'll lose their voting base and the left would go insane.  Majority of conservatives don't want ""government control,"" they want law and order.",1696118435.0

In my mediocrity I had a better win rate playing watcher the way I normally play her, which is a much more balanced way that leverages a wider range of her card pool. I strongly advise anyone who plays this game for fun and not min/maxing to just play watcher that way, I enjoyed her way more doing that then trying to infinite and did not even have better win rate results when trying to infinite because I‚Äôm just not good enough or patient enough to do it.",1696118436.0

"SameGrassButGreener","t5_2u6j8","I was generally referring to core downtown. Portland has a more developed downtown, but lack of policing for a decade (whereas Tacoma has only given up for the past 5 years) means that there are more junkies and crazy people roaming the streets. I know at least two friends whose companies closed down their offices in Portland for this reason, and Portland seems resigned to just let it happen now. My last stay downtown was last year at the Heathman, where my wife and I were aggressively panhandled 4 times and asked if we wanted to buy drugs 3 times in one evening stroll. I'm not pearl clutching, and can handle myself, but that was worse than any trip to Oakland, SF, LA and reminds me of the crappy parts of Seattle and Las Vegas with those types of experiences. 

I found myself thinking how sad a once-proud City of Roses has become. I can imagine how that feels for tourists. Tacoma has the same problems but in smaller, more isolated pockets. 

Portland still has nice suburbs and neighborhood pockets, much like Tacoma, so it's not all negative. I've always had a soft spot for Portland, so don't take it as an affront on the PDX.",1696118438.0

Weight gain is a pretty terrible way of doing it, if you have body image issues (which it sounds like you 100% do), being overweight just to have boobs will make you feel way worse than your current weight with no boobs. It also stands to mention that weight gain may only affect you in the lower half of your body (women typically gain weight in their thighs, glutes and hips) and it‚Äôd take a lot of general weight gain to notice an increase in bust, again, arguably to the point where you feel worse about being that weight than you do now.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve looked into it, but if you choose to go down the path of surgery you‚Äôll have the choice between the variety of implants and fat transfer. Both are expensive as shit.

I‚Äôll also mention that if you do choose to get a breast augmentation at that size, it‚Äôs going to be very obvious you have them. You may feel more like a woman because of it, but everyone else (especially men) will *definitely* see you as more of a woman too. Ask yourself if you want that sort of attention. It‚Äôs completely fine if you do, but the sick, sad reality is that if you do get breast augmentation, you‚Äôre going to irreversibly tip the scales from ‚Äúcute young girl‚Äù to ‚Äúhot young object of sexual desire‚Äù.

That might sound ideal, but I promise you the grass isn‚Äôt always greener.

The part people won‚Äôt tell you about getting those kinds of drastic cosmetic surgeries is that they posit a situation where you will be 100% suffering from success. Augmented breasts, especially on people who didn‚Äôt have much to begin with are painfully obvious and obtuse. They‚Äôll look great, but even the best work will fall into this uncanny valley of ‚Äúyeah they look perfect but almost *too* perfect‚Äù. If you want men to constantly stare at your chest, women to talk shit about you behind your back because they‚Äôre envious and for you to never truly know what people‚Äôs true intentions are because you can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre being nice, kind or friendly because they legitimately feel that way or because you‚Äôre a hot piece with a gorgeous pair (get ready to hear ‚Äúcompliments to your surgeon‚Äù a LOT). I think you‚Äôre too young to be making those kinds of choices.

I really think you should shelve this idea and come back to it in your early to mid 20s. Your body isn‚Äôt even done fully growing yet, you don‚Äôt have nearly enough life experience and perspectives on real world beauty and haven‚Äôt had the opportunity to find out that it doesn‚Äôt matter one bit. I know it‚Äôs hard to not feel that way when everyone online whose popular has beautiful bodies, but as mentioned, the attention they get is so strong that if you aren‚Äôt someone who desires to be an influencer or someone who uses their body as their income, you will find the attention draining and it‚Äôll destroy your outlook on the world. I‚Äôve met so many kind hearted gorgeous women who are riddled with legitimate self doubt and self esteem issues because they just want to be seen as a normal person and not as a sexual object. It‚Äôs heartbreaking, and getting cosmetic surgery to fix it and putting yourself in a position where you have that looming over you is not a decision you should take lightly.",1696118438.0

That said, given the sheer amount of divine intervention in duels, and the very liberal take on getting advantages from magic (compared to cheating with mundane means, like another commenter pointed out), probably having exclusive cards with rarity enforced by their spirits (the god cards, for example, punished anyone involved in making them, also Ra punished duelists who used it without being allowed by him) isn't seen as cheating anyway.",1696118438.0

After months of feeling exactly how you are describing, thinking of the money, the process itself, the other side if it doesn't work.. I ended up saying to my partner that trying absolutely everything and knowing we tried it all would give me at least some peace if IVF doesn't work.

The only thing I can control is my choices, the rest seems like a gamble these days. We discussed how many rounds we can afford and will keep trying while doing so, in my clinic and because of my own circumstances they told me to think of a year before my first round. That's another factor, these things take time, and blood tests and appointments, etc.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Christianity in its original form (Catholicism) was founded not too long after the split of the roman empire (490 CE). Generally the beginning of the medieval times or what is known as the ""dark ages"" the Catholic church or rather the Papacy of the time pretty much was the defacto ruler of western and central europe depending on the exact time period.

People of science were lynched.
Critics of the papacy or religious sceptics were lynched.
If your neighbour paid the local bishop a nice sum you were lynched.
Wars were started because of Catholicism.
Genocides happened because of Catholicism.
Corruption was higher than ever
Progress was lower than ever
Strife among the populace was higher than ever.

This only started to subside after the first Protestant movements came around and we moved onto the renaissance.

Do I think protestant religions are better than Catholicism? Sure but it all stems from the same thing.

But yeah, the phytoestrogen thing is infuriating, isn't it? Because some sources say that since it's plant estrogen that it doesn't function like a mammal's estrogen anyway. But then like you said, other sources say you should avoid it, but then others say actually it prevents problems with estrogen by blocking the receptors! Regular endogenous hormones are complicated enough, so to add plant and synthetic hormones into the mix makes it impossibly complex.

"Genshin_Impact_Leaks","t5_3l2acu","not sure if it'll help but for me my mindset for team building with him has sometimes been the opposite. as in, I decide what the other team will be (alhaitham/lyney/tighnari/etc) and then if I'm not specifically looking to use him (which is rare but still) *but* I have no ideas for another team in the other half, I know I can rely on him to piece together smth with the units I have left that'll work.

This basically turns it from ""I'd have to use him"" to ""he's a reliable backup plan"" which I think can make it easier to be more open to other teams.

that said benching is almost inevitable no matter the investment, Hu Tao used to be a staple for me but I haven't used her in abyss since tighnari. my wanderer's my heaviest investment unit (c1 + got c6 faruzan) but I've actually barely used him in the abyss bc I don't often feel like using him there. there are many character releases so unless you go full vertical from now on and don't pull for new unislts, there'll always be new teams to try and old teams to retire or use less often. 

plus with Ayato you've more than gotten your primos' worth by now in terms of fun/clears, so imo there's really no need to feel like you're wasting him. he's served you well, you can let him relax now üëç",1696118440.0

The fans then repeat them in conversations about it. 

& then people just believe what they‚Äôve been told instead of paying attention to what the long form content is actually doing & implying? 

It‚Äôs hard to argue with somebody who believes that saying ‚Äúnot to victim blame, but she got herself into this mess‚Äù actually *isn‚Äôt* victim blaming, because it was prefaced with ‚Äúnot to victim blame‚Äù. The same person wouldn‚Äôt buy a ‚Äúnot to be racist, but‚Äù from some random stranger, but they like/ care about A&A, so they want to believe them. 

It‚Äôs the difference between attitudes vs. behaviors, or maybe declared attitudes vs. demonstrated behaviors- people have a hard time understanding it in themselves too. Maybe I say that I‚Äôm someone who always keeps the house clean (my attitude) but when it comes down to it, I don‚Äôt get around to doing the actual cleaning (my behavior). I think of myself as a punctual person, but I then have to wave away the times I‚Äôve been late. Etc. etc. 

Maybe they say they‚Äôre victim‚Äôs advocates, but then the work of actually advocating falls by the wayside. Saying you‚Äôre respectful doesn‚Äôt make you respectful, but a lot of people aren‚Äôt paying that much attention or haven‚Äôt listened critically enough to catch it.",1696118441.0

"Jujutsufolk","t5_47rbe5","I totally agree with your analysis of Gojo and Sukuna.

Gojo's strength shaped him, it made him fundamentally different from everyone else and this solid reality created a rift between him and the rest of the world. He was *objectively* so much above the others that he never expected to be understood, but at the same time, he couldn't fully understand the people around him, not being able to empathize with weakness and uncertainty.

*AT LEAST THIS IS THE STORY GOJO TOLD HIMSELF EVERYDAY*

There's a difference to be made from how Gojo felt and the reality of his condition. Yes, he was kind of doomed to feel a sense of disconnect because of his objective circumstances, but the bubble he lived in was almost entirely something of his own creation.

As you said, Gojo was the strongest. He identified himself with his title, with his power, and he used the same mentality to measure the worth of everything and everyone else. This is particularly interesting because it ties in with Kenjaku's words about ""one's cursed technique as a way to interpret the world"".

"samharris","t5_2thqg","Thank *you* for the thoughtful reply! I'm sorry I don't have the time to reply at much length, but I'll do my best.  

I think the sulfuric acid analogy is lacking simply because it's an entirely classical case. As soon as we consider experiments/observations where quantum entanglement could matter, there's no reason to anticipate statistical indepedence. And this is because - in terms of quantum behavior - it's possible that any two wave/particles in the universe share some history (almost certainly indirect). We know there are variables that are hidden, and they can encode information that results in the ""conspiratorial"" outcomes that seem so baffling.  

> Whenever we make an inductive inference we implicitly assume that we were able to somewhat fairly sample from the population we want to make claims about and clearly any bias in the sampling can bias our inference.  

I guess this is my main point. If we know that all quantum-scale interactions can effectively ""leave a causal trace"", why would you think you're ever ""fairly"" sampling a population? Any interaction (sampling) with quantum-sensitive things is going to be ""unfair"".  

> Would you say that you have a good idea of what is claimed there and understand the calculations? (Re: Bell's theorem)  

Mathematically, no - I am hopeless with the formal calculations. I have listened to many explanations of what the math means, and my understanding is that in a given measurement circumstance, a given value is expected, but in reality the resulting value is substantially different (but not wildly different) from that expected value. This tells us that there's something else going on. I contend that the ""something else"" is pre-existing entanglement (or some other consequential link) between the ""independent"" aspect of the experiment (e.g. the experimenter and the equipment) and the subject of the experiment.  

> On the obsession with local realism: It is the standard interpretations of quantum mechanics who have given up on local realism either by allowing nonlocal dynamics (e.g. de-Broglie-Bohm) or by giving up on definiteness (e.g. Many Worlds). t‚ÄôHooft on the other hand wants to preserve a notion of local realism at almost all cost. The hidden variables he proposes are only ‚Äúuniversal‚Äù because everything is related to everything in his world in a very precise way via minute correlations since the ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù which are then propagated through space and time (or any equivalent phase space) via classical (i.e. local, real/definite and deterministic) dynamics.  

Everything you wrote here makes sense. The way I would close the gap semantically is as follows: 't Hooft has everything operating via locally real rules, but since there are also hidden variables, your local systems will always have another meaningful aspect of encoded information that impacts their behavior. Because this (potentially) encoded information can be traced back to the Big Bang for every wave/particle in the universe, then you cannot have any isolated systems wherein ""independent"" tests can be performed. I don't see a disconnect with the local mechanics and the universal hidden variables that 't Hooft deals with. At this point, anything *but* that scenario would be counterintuitive to me. There are so many things that just click into place via the 't Hooft explanation IMO, most importantly the way it preserves a mechanistic (non-probabilistic) universe and allows things to reveal their correlation even at great distances (so you don't need to worry about ""instant"" communication). The information was always there, all along.  

Do you find it annoying that 't Hooft doesn't even try to deal with the nature of the hidden variables? I don't think anyone can earnestly make advances there - I think we lack the information.  

> If you are willing to give up on local realism then it becomes inexplicable to me why you would find superdeterminism attractive. Could you expand on the attractiveness you see a bit?  

The appeal here is as follows: among everything we can observe and assess via experimentation, it seems that we live in a mechanistic ""clockwork"" universe. And then we encounter something odd when we start trying to do experimental assessments of quantum phenomena: things no longer seem to be clockwork, they instead seem to be probabilistic (random, but in a bounded, predictable way). What is more likely, that at the most fundamental level, our universe has an entirely different set of rules once we're at the quantum scale? Or that (*as we know to be true*) our attempts at measurement always impact the systems we are trying to evaluate via measurement, causing weird barriers to experimentation? I believe it's the latter, and superdeterminism is the framework that feels most compatible with that scenario.  

All of science is a progressive, lurching journey from ignorance to enlightenment, and the vast majority of thinking has to be done with incomplete information. But scientists are not accustomed to a line that cannot be crossed in terms of experimentation. Quantum scales offer such a wall: we simply cannot do science in the typical way. With that being true, it's perfectly reasonable to expect that there are sub-quantum mechanics responsible for quantum (and, by extension, classical) phenomena. I don't make any presumption about how sub-quantum mechanics work, but I feel convinced that they are there, and they are mechanistic (not probabilistic). I don't think this would rule out **a** pilot wave model (because the pilot wave itself could be mechanistic/deterministic/non-random), and previously I didn't really see a massive tension or disconnect between superdeterminism and de Broigle-Bohm mechanics. I generally understood the pilot wave to be a loosey-goosey stand-in for the sub-quantum mechanics that probably exist. Refreshing my memory a bit, I suppose the big difference is that there's still a ""probability"" component in the pilot wave equations, so it's a different framing device but still ultimately probabilistic? (This is a tangent - feel free to ignore.)  

I hadn't thought about this stuff too seriously for a while, and was happy to find [this video](https://youtu.be/ytyjgIyegDI?si=slwVrbZvoidxNl8j&t=900) (it should play from the 15 min mark), which concludes with a framework by which we might get evidence for superdeterminism. I find this pretty exciting, since I had zero hope that it would be testable! But I think the idea is to *infer* evidence for superdeterminism, not directly measure it. I think theory is our only hope for going ""below"" quantum mechanics, and I share Sabine's optimism that AI might be able to help us make progress there.",1696118442.0

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","Not the publishers & platform holders either. At best you get crossplay on specific titles but being able to port your character onto all the multiple game engines out there is a very tall order

That‚Äôs not to say that a GameStop owned platform couldn‚Äôt mandate such functionality for games released on their store for PC and mobile but would require the mother of all negotiations with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo.

Plus there is brand and IP protection, e.g. you‚Äôre not going to see anything Lucasfilm haven‚Äôt approved in any future Star Wars games so the list of titles will be restricted",1696118443.0

"OpenDogTraining","t5_2zw8v","A trainer‚Äôs experience and track record with the specific issues that need to de addressed are far more important that these ‚Äúcertifications‚Äù.  Keep in mind they are not based on a track record of successfully working on these problems.   They don‚Äôt even require the trainer to have ever worked with a problem dog.  

Example: 

The CCPDT has no requirements for a trainer ever working with a dog like this, much less get results.
The first level retires a minimal  amount of experience (300 hours I believe) and then a 180 question multiple choice online quiz.  
The second requires the trainer to submit 4 videos, each under 5 minutes working with a dog in a 10‚Äôx10‚Äô area. 

This might be ok for working with normal dogs / basic obedience, but definitely not ok for behavior modification. 

Always talk to the trainer first.  Get references and make sure they have a proven track record working with your breed and the problems you face.  

These certifications are frequently more about marketing in my opinion.

I‚Äôve been in some of the NXT boats and while they are cheap from a MC/luxury standpoint, the main internals seem to be solid. 

Heyday is so new that I‚Äôm not sure anyone knows how they will last. I will say you will outgrow that MC in a few year once the kids become teenagers and their friends become bigger with them. 

I‚Äôve had a journey in boats. Started in a couple Bayliners. Got hooked on wakeboarding so the family bought a Moomba Outback. MC X Star followed by a Nautique G23.

Third 50 hours, you keep playing out of habit and to recapture the rush you had before, doing all kinds of niche things to keep it interesting.  
  
In the last 50 hours, the repetitiveness becomes really noticeable because only the five or six identikit sires are left to explore, and the side characters have said everything there is to say.

"whitecoatinvestor","t5_ky4cc","Well, when it comes to deciding between a Roth IRA and a Roth 457b as a resident, the lack of a matching program for your Roth 457b is definitely worth considering. Since you already have a Roth IRA that you're contributing to, opening a Roth 457b could potentially offer some advantages. The main advantage is that the contribution limit for a Roth 457b is much higher than a Roth IRA, allowing you to save more for retirement. Additionally, contributions to a Roth 457b are made with pre-tax dollars, which means you'll pay taxes on withdrawals in retirement instead. However, it's important to consider your financial goals, such as the flexibility of accessing funds before retirement, as Roth 457b withdrawals typically have restrictions. So, while opening a Roth 457b can offer additional retirement savings potential, it's essential to weigh the advantages and disadvantages based on your unique situation.",1696118446.0

More importantly, there's a massive difference between what some groups want and what they get. You'll notice that most of what this group say they want, the Voice doesn't give them. It doesn't give them power to make laws. It's just ""an advisory"" body, which they explicitly say they don't want. It doesn't enshrine ""treaty making"" in the constitution.

So you could take this as an example of how the Government's proposal *doesn't* bow to the demands of First Nation's people, but compromises on the 'less controversial' elements of what they want. The Voice gives absolutely zero legislative power. Even if these are the people who will populate it, the chances of them actually getting a treaty are slim and the chances of them getting the power to make laws is non existent. So you can calm your fears, or you can stoke them. It's up to you.",1696118447.0

What did she used to do before to manage stress, rather than eat?  Can she go back to that?  The key to changing undesirable behaviours/habits is to replace them with something else, not just get rid of them entirely.  

I say you could approach her with this and it‚Äôs less about ‚Äúher being fat‚Äù and more about managing stress in a healthy way.  She‚Äôs not dumb.  She knows she obese and not healthy but for whatever reason cannot stop the habit/dopamine rush of tasty food.  Presumably she wants to be healthy for herself (and you but this should be for herself).  Mental health (healthy coping mechanisms) is a huge part of physical health.  Get to the root of it.  But it‚Äôs probably not gonna happen overnight either.

Ne mozes ti da napravis pokretljivost i motoriku momku koji je visok 197- 198 cm, prosto se rodis sa takvim misicnim insercijama, tako se razvijes, imas takva vlakna, imas takav nervni sistem i konstituciju. 

Ne radi se samo o visini, nego i o pokretljivosti sa tom istom visinom, a to npr. ne moze nikakvim treningon da se popravi. Isto tako brzina reakcije moze minimalno da se ubrza, brzina sprinta sam vec rekao 80% genetika, skocnost ima mnogo veze sa time gde ti se list vezuje. 

Niko ne kaze da ti ne mizes da igras pristojno kosarku, ali da igras dobro da bi mogao da zivis od toga i time da se bavis treba sve ovo vanserijsko da imas, pa tek onda da pomislis o treningu.

You are trapped. If this were a ttrpg, it would be akin to a dominate person so powerful it calls for a reflex save, not a willpower save, to resist. It governs the aspect of connections between all things, and while its uses are varied, its primary purpose was to fulfill the desire in all hearts for peace.

This is something that an exceedingly small number of women get with their ""normal"" periods but, in the opinion of the doctor teaching me, while it's technically common for that patient, it's demonstrably coming from some pathological process and we just don't know about it. Probably there's some kind of intrauterine haemorrhage going on where the spiral arteries or some of the veins are rupturing inside the endometrium, causing massive blood loss. This woman needs birth control NOW, and she needs to be told that if she wants to have another kid then we need to have a chat about that because it'll need to be basically planned in advance.

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","People that played overwatch 1 way back when they had two tanks are used to always playing with a shield tank, such as rein, sigma, or orisa (who had an actual shield ability at the time, and no mobility abilities). Nowadays ramattra would also be considered one of these tanks. And the second tank would play an off tank, (dva, zarya, hog, ball, and now JQ and doom who was a damage hero at the time). 

Winston in my opinion and from personal experience, was regarded as a flex tank who could provide an actual barrier, but had the mobility to dive and deny space in enemy high ground by diving and dropping a shield on the widow or Ashe so that they could not fire shots from that space as it would just hit the barrier instead. Many call him a dive tank because of this play style.

Now that we only have one tank per team people have started to associate the more aggressive dive tanks with attack and the more passive ‚Äúwait for them to come to me‚Äù shield tanks with defense. While these thoughts are somewhat valid, it also is entirely dependent upon the composition of both teams. Do both teams have a widow and the defensive one is getting diffed? Is the Cassidy going on hard flanks to use high noon and getting immediately shot at because his head becomes a ‚Äúshoot me‚Äù sign when deadeye is triggered? Does your Ana keep getting flanked by a hyperactive Genji or Moira every time sleep dart is on cooldown? Then run a hyper mobile tank so you can peel for them. Winston is honestly really strong on defense because he provides a shield (even though it‚Äôs temporary) while being able to jump between teammates that require assistance.",1696118450.0

And anybody, regardless of their age, gender or sexuality who actually forms their opinions and beliefs based on this manufactured shit needs their heads read.

And also as a cisgendered heteosexual (kinda) ""man"" I can tell you the ""ideal type"" for men is a vagina and a pulse. Nothing else. I don't care what anybody says, deep down men are incredibly superficial because of base genetic programming. Any man who has a modicum of intellect, self-awareness and acknowledgement of the world around them will have overcome that genetic superficiality. They may have physical preferences sure, but it's not a requirement.

Any guy running around insisting on tits and ass, yet also having hips and a thigh gap, is a fucking cretin who is compensating for something and also doesn't how how the fucking female body works.

For example if I decide my Drow wants to embrace the illythid powers then why would he go around helping people? He wouldn't.

And just killing all the good characters to harvest xp isnt a good role play either. So it requires a little more imagination like maybe an injured mind flayer in the ship is still alive and I decide to keep him alive and he gives me missions, info etc.

A good character might kill him and then go around helping people in the druid grove.

"2sentence2horror","t5_52ly8h","Tldr: I wrote a huge wall of text mostly about how great titan fall 2 is and what it's about





Side note, I'm glad people are excited for titan fall 3 cause I feel like titan fall 2 didn't get talked about by anyone I remember I'd never heard of it and I just bought it cause it was really cheap on sale and it looked interesting and I had some money on my account so I bought it. It ended up being one of my favorite games, the campaign was awesome and the multi player is great, multi player is so good that it's now my go to fps for when i feel like merking some noobs. It stays installed on my ps4. For some reason cod felt like it was the only game that played well as a multi-player fps, like cod is so smooth and responsive it's perfect for making quick movements and it's accurate too and for some reason it just feels right completely playable fun fps with no hiccups, most of these other fps games have low frame rate and things like motion blur to cover it up it's just not suitable for an fps multi-player match, even destiny has it (destiny still does it better than most though, it's still playable and it's to where it's not really annoying to play), these games just lack the ultra smooth snappiness of something like cod, titan fall 2 on the other hand did it really freakin well it's super smooth and snappy, it's really accurate responsiveness it has all the stuff needed to give you the most control of your game. Being smooth and what not is just the fundamentals, it just means the game is playable and it's accurate and has nothing annoying you have to deal with, it makes it a lot more fluid and fun to run around too but it doesn't just do movement right the game itself (multi-player) is very good. The guns feel unique and powerful and they keep it simple for you, you even have unlimited bullets during the match (you still have to reload) so you don't ever gotta worry about finding ammo. Another thing done right by titan fall, the wall running is actually fluid and behaves exactly how you want/expect it to which means you can actually use it while in battle effectively and easily, it works well enough that it becomes second nature to use it. Then theres also powers you can choose from like one makes you invisible for 10 seconds or whatever then it has to recharge and you can use it again, I use the hologram one it creates and releases a dummy copy of yourself that you can have run ahead of you so the enemies will shoot at the dummies and now you know where they are release one and they'll unload on it and while they're distracted you kill them. Then there's the titan, battling normally as a human on foot charges the titan meter when it's full you can call your titan which is a gigantic robot with weapons that you can pilot, you can choose from like 6 different titans that all are very different and you can change what power ups they have for their weapons. As a titan you could hunt regular non titan enemies, you can shoot them or step on them but usually you end up fighting other titans not humans (humans can do a move though where they climb on top of your titan and rip a battery out causing lots of damage) when your titan is too damaged you can still exit it cause if it's damaged enough it will turn into a huge explosion. Being in a titan is as fun as the human combat and they made the maps very well so they're good for humans and for the titans to fight, having titans in the regular team death match games is actually pretty cool it's all smooth and responsive too, when you're a human yes you gotta watch out for titans cause they will kill you if they see you but for the most part in the regular human fps combat the titans don't actually get in the way of combat, you can also focus on killing titans you can grapple them and get on top and remove the battery for mega damage or you always have an anti titan gun in your inventory, they only do little damage at a time but you can be far away hidden shooting your huge rocket launcher or using the plasma ball gun, just don't stop shooting and keep hitting them. For assisting or causing a titan kill it gives you a huge boost to your titan meter so it's a good way to get your titan quickly. There's also a ton of little npc soldiers running around everywhere, you get a very tiny amount of points but they're really weak and easy to kill so they're something to do/shoot when there's no other player around you can just kill whole groups of soldiers just by spraying in their direction.",1696118451.0

Tower of Fantasy: I love the graphics and the intro was engaging, but after about 30 minutes of playtime I could tell it wasn't for me.

I wanted ToF to succeed but yeah, just not my kind of game.

Snowbreak: I played it on PC. Compared to what the rest of PC gaming has to offer, it's just a bad shooter. I enjoyed the story, the dorm interactions and some of the boss fights, but given that 95% of the content was kind of dry combat, I just uninstalled it in the end.

"RegalUnlimited","t5_zx02e","I got 3 movies i thibk it COULD be

1) The Holdovers: the movie is 2 hrs 13 minutes which is about 15 minutes more than the runtime giving by regal. 

2). Thanksgiving: Runtime says 1 hr 34 minutes. So about 23 minutes shorter than the Regal time. And it says it could be ""4- 24 minutes off"". So that adds up. The thing is, it comes out in November so I know people will say ""it can't be that"". But idk people said ""it can't be a horror movie so it won't be 'Talk To Me'"" and it was ""Talk To Me"" and they said ""it won't be Dumb money "" and it was. What im saying is, the only things that matter is the runtime has to be close to the giving runtime, it has to have the same rating. And it has to be a movie that hasn't been WIDE released yet. 

3).Dear David: it has the same runtime as Thanksgiving. But it comes out Oct 13. 

Other ones I think it could be is Foe and Marsh Kings daughter. The run time for those are 1hr 50, and 1 hr 48 minutes respectively.  And those are possibilities. I DONT think it will be Dicks the Muscial or Freelance. For different reasons. But Foe and Marsh Kings Daughter are still possible. 

Here's my theory. I think its most likely finna be a horror movie. Think about it, its October. So I would HOPE they would do a horror movie. 

It can't be Five Nights at Freddy's since that's PG 13. 

The only ones I know comes out after Oct 9 thats a horror movies and Rate R are Dear David and Thanksgiving.

"Flipping","t5_2y9q6","Yep.  They clean their house out planning the sale, and they run into a few things they think are valuable so they look them up and put them in a pile.  They figure they'll put them in the garage sale with the printout.  It will bring in hoards of ""collectors wanting to pay top dollar!""

Then when they don't sell, they go back to the closet because ""fuck those people who don't know the value of this amazing stuff.  I'll sell it online myself.""  Maybe it gets pulled out for the next garage sale a few years later where the same thing happens.  

Then maybe they decide they have time now, so they're gonna list it online, but they have to create an account and verify their identity, and fuck that.  They'll put it out at the next garage sale.

Pretty soon they get REALLY sick of looking at it and sick of it not selling, so they decide once and for all to just take it to the thrift store, except by now it has no value anymore.  If it's clothing, it's not old enough to be vintage.  It's just out of style.  If it's some sort of hard goods, it's just trash, and again, not old enough to be vintage.  It's just shit no one wants anymore.",1696118455.0

"JCBWritingCorner","t5_7u41nb","I'd like to quickly clarify a few things with regards to these points in particular! As per the UN's Protocols for the Minimum Acceptable Standard of Living, or the P MASL charter, the UN prioritizes a slow, gradual, and sustainable development model when approaching long term space colonization efforts! What this effectively means is that there's a trend towards conforming habitats to be acceptable to baseline human physiologies rather than adapting and modifying humans to fit their new surroundings! It's effectively done in order to ensure that all citizens are capable of equal accessibility to all places and all locales, even if it is in space, without the need to have been physically modified to fit that environment, as all environments that exist in space that's rated for habitation are already built with baseline human physiologies in mind! So space habitats, lunar stations, martian cities, etc, all have appropriate measures for radiation shielding, gravity approximation using spin gravity, amongst other considerations made during construction to ensure the safety and the health of baseline human physiologies! :D 

A bit of this was inspired by some of my older works with themes of humanity triumphing over nature, modifying nature itself to suit their needs, through sheer force of will and industrial power rather than forcing themselves to fit the environment.  

I do apologize if this wasn't the answer people were expecting, it's just the course I made with my worldbuilding and I really do hope it's an acceptable enough answer.

I also wanted to say I really appreciate the work you've put into these analyses and I very much enjoy reading them as they give me an incredibly useful benchmark to see just how much information I've been able to convey as per the plans I have for the story thus far. You've been able to analyze and pull so much from the story and I can't help but to smile as I read through all that you've written down here! :D",1696118455.0
"thedavidpakmanshow","t5_30b6q","Yeah, because allegations presented without evidence can be refuted without evidence. Nothing you said is true. You don‚Äôt want a legitimate debate.

Even if I needed to, which I don‚Äôt, bringing facts wouldn‚Äôt matter because reality and facts and evidence don‚Äôt matter to you people. But again, allegations presented without evidence (which you‚Äôll never have because you‚Äôre wrong) can be refuted without evidence. Everything you said is complete bullshit.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","It is in the books. Dumbledore says it to Harry in the scene where Harry is dead/not-dead. He thinks the fairytale is just that: a fairytale.

According to Pottermore, the wand has a Thestral tale hair core. Which could explain why the fairytale links the articats to death.

"AmITheAngel","t5_u58f6","My fianc√© and I have completely merged finances; we share one joint bank account where all of our money is direct deposited. We do have personal accounts with a few thousand in each, respectively, but these are mostly a relic of our lives before we merged finances. Part of the reason we merged finances is because we do have a large income disparity; I'm currently a graduate student so my income is reduced until I get my degree (~2 yrs from now). Pooling our money helps mitigate any power imbalance that might arise from him making ~3x my salary. 

We chose this path partly because my parents and their money issues. Throughout my childhood, my parents never merged their finances (so they followed the ""AITA model"" more closely) and it caused a TON of resentment and fighting. My mom makes about 1/6 or 1/7th my dad's salary and as such she always resented feeling like she had to ""keep up her end"" of their joint spending. At some point it caused such a blow up that they finally saw a marriage counselor and that person helped them come up with a more merged financial plan. I didn't want to go down that route so my fianc√© and I merged finances immediately when we got engaged. 


Hope this is helpful as an example of two different ways people do it. Frankly, I think when you're married its silly to sharply delineate ""yours"" vs. ""theirs"", but I guess some people like that.",1696118455.0

Answers to your follow ups:

(1) Moynihan has great buildings (and a decent number of people in BigLaw live there), but the area (Penn Station and whatnot) has a lot of tourists, it can get uncomfortable at night (decent number of sketchy people and it gets pretty dirty as a result), no good grocery stores nearby, and it can get pretty loud with all the transportation. There are a few excellent restaurants in Hudson Yards, but it‚Äôs just not worth living over there.

(2) Chelsea is an *amazing* neighborhood. Maybe look at the vacancy rate and rental history of the units for the spot in Chelsea to see how long people are staying there. Check reviews of the building, too. I‚Äôd still pick E 94th if the amenities are already established and people are using them (new buildings will often tout amenities but won‚Äôt have them ready for like another year). If the gym access is included in the price of the rent, maybe go with E 94th. If not, then maybe the Chelsea unit and get a subsidized gym membership through your firm. 

Rooftops IMO are overrated. Half the time, they‚Äôre closed for almost half a year. Lounges are nice, though, but eh - I don‚Äôt care enough for them to be dealbreakers unless I‚Äôm keen on hosting little get-togethers often at my building.",1696118457.0

1. Binding of Isaac Rebirth.

Great amount of unlockables, lots of items and stuff that cause dopamine hits. You can also pick this up and put it down. At least 500 hours of content, and lots of achievements.

2. Donkey Kong Country (Snes/Switch Online)

 The music in this game was great enough for me to actually sit through and finish this a few times in a couple sittings. 

3. God of War 1 - 3.

Actually amazing gameplay, never played them prior to 2021. If I had to pick one though it would be GoW 3.


Okay, actual games I recommend for your situation.

1. Runescape.

Yes its an MMO but it might as well be singleplayer. Player based economy, lots of skilling and grinding. The whole game is a giant sandbox, and while most MMOs usually bore me now a days, Runescape is one big numbers game and the dopamine of leveling up or selling an item for max GP is actually great.

2. Rocket League.

Your running late and in a rush, and you KNOW, your SURE, you REMEMBER putting them in a certain place, like maybe a dish on the hall table, and they aren't there.  You have a vivid memory of putting them there, so where did they go, you start to wonder if somebody moved them, ask everyone where they are, maybe get mad at your kids/wife/roommate for moving them, because you so clearly REMEMBER putting them in that spot, the only explanation is somebody else moved them.  Then after all that you find them, and you find them somewhere that can't be explained by anyone but you, lets say you find them in the pocket of your pants in the hamper or something like that, but you still REMEMBER putting them on that table in the hall, even when your holding the proof that that couldn't have been the case.

It's so easy to be so sure isn't it?  Especially when our emotions are running hot.  If you've had that experience, to so vividly remember something incorrectly, while your holding proof that you are wrong about it, to have reality rub your nose in your own fallibility like that, then you can understand you don't have to be mentally ill to be mistaken about these sorts of things.

Then a week later we'd find out we had $16,000 dollars to spend by the end of the month or we'd lose it. But that money couldn't go to the truck repair.

In some cases it would have taken a literal act of Congress to get money from one budget to one where we could use it for something useful. But then, some low-level manager could swoop in and spend it on something stupid just because it looked like unnecessary budget and they didn't want to have less for next year. 

In some cases the reasons why it ended up like that make perfect sense if you look into it, but the reality of it ends up being incredibly dumb and overcomplicated. It's never as easy as it seems like it should be.",1696118459

There is no debate we said ""not one inch eastward"". instead of having any ounce of integrity, your argument is one of not proving that we said a thing but it needs to be magically n writing. 

With that level of subterfuge you are also saying that Russia had a choice to not defend their borders. We clearly installed a pro western government, troops and weapons on their border. And lack the moral integrity to uphold what we agreed upon. And you add that maybe if Russia would have been nicer to it's neighbors we would not have had to start encroaching on their nation. You are saying that in a thread that has a neighboring country saying they will no longer support this proxy war. 

Thanks for clarifying how you feel. How much are you getting paid to push this bullshit narrative again. You are so intellectually dishonest, that you have reduced yourself to comic relief.

"Fishing_Gear","t5_37vfu","Many bank or wading anglers that think they should still don't wear their PFD, so I think he really should research and select whichever PFD he'd be willing/committed to actually wearing. Too many variables and reasons not to wear it for anyone else to pick out the PFD he's most likely to actually/consistently use.

The most frequent reasons I see given for not wearing a PFD is they claim their PFD is too bulky or basically, since so many others don't wear them, other people who otherwise would wear one are influenced to be complacent or even self conscious wearing theirs.

https://www.ifish.net/threads/pfd-for-bank-fishing.912282/

https://www.theflyfishingforum.com/forums/index.php?threads/pfd-for-wading.917305/

It seems that the most popular PFDs among bank anglers are CO2 cartridge inflatables (with manual pull tab being more popular than auto inflated when wet, which may occur when you don't want/need), but some report/like using kayak angler PFDs that use foam floatation and are bulkier than inflatables but still less bulky than most foam buoyancy PFDs designed for other sports. 

Inflatables come in either a vest or belt type (watch YouTube for how to deploy the belt type after it's inflated). The belt type inflatables are also popular for recreational Stand Up Paddle (SUP) boarders, whereas the vest type are also somewhat common for boaters and some kayakers (though most kayakers favor foam).

The upside of inflatable is less bulk and heat trapped when not inflated, but the downside is manual inflation types require the wearer to remain conscious and calm enough to pull the inflation cord (consider 'cold water shock's). Also, rarely, inflatables have simply malfunctioned and failed to inflate when the inflation cord was pulled, so they require more inspection and replacement of the CO2 cartridge to avoid becoming less reliable. Foam is already buoyant, but is useless if he finds it too bulky, hot, or even unfashionable to wear. 

There is one hybrid that includes a minimal amount of foam to float a body but perhaps not keep the head above without some treading/swimming (depending on the wearer's weight) but with an inflatable chamber/action to make up the difference; it's called the Mustang Survival Khimera, but it's relatively unpopular (except among SUP paddlers, who like how it's low profile but has some foam) because it's relatively expensive and it doesn't have pockets or accessory attachment points designed for anglers.

As a kayak enthusiast, I'm only familiar with foam floatation kayak angler PFDs but not inflatables. If I bought a foam kayak PFD for bank fishing instead of the inflatable type most bank anglers seem to prefer, I'd personally likely opt for a ""thin back style"" rather ""high back style"" kayak angler PFD, because the ""thin back"" distributes some foam in a thin relatively flexible layer across the entire back where the ""high  back"" style only has foam on the front and back of shoulders so the equivalent total foam volume is more concentrated and bulkier in those areas where it is distributed (front and shoulders but not lower back). ""Thin back"" and ""high back"" are just alternative ways of avoiding placing foam where it would obstruct and interfere with a kayak seat back. Most bank anglers appear to favor inflatables so start there but, a popular thin back kayak angler PFD is the NRS Raku, which basically just a thin backed version of their popular high back Chinook. A bank angler sneaking up on finicky trout likely wouldn't want the high visibility colors option (like orange) that many kayakers wear so motor boats see them rather than run them over.

I've never worn waders, but the ""wading belt"" outside/over the waders to prevent them from as quickly filling with water if submerged is the gear item I've most often heard emphasized even by those that don't wear a PFD. https://www.orvis.com/what-gear-is-important-to-have-for-safe-wading/what-gear-is-important-to-have-for-safe-wading.html#:~:text=Wading%20belts%20will%20help%20keep,a%20sail%20in%20the%20water.",1696118460.0

You cant appreciate VP till you play it on PSX somehow as the backgrounds are stunning and anime cutscenes beautiful. I like CG(especially PSX/Saurn era CG), but Lenneth and all these other games were $5-$20 used(getting a real game not worthless file) forever for psp in 06/07 atleast.   


Dont be fooled especially anyone not gaming and aware of things in the mid 00s-2012 atleast.   


All im saying is dont be conned by ebay scammers on originals or psp versions of games. its only been a bit over 10-12ish years and believe me prices held from the 90s-2012(with slight variations on select stuff).   


Theres plenty of PS2's available and the games as well. Get the original and never repay for what is at its core(aka how my JP VP is(without anime cutscenes, some castle scenes in the beginning that were very minor(but I like their effect myself).   


If ya want to play VP on Vita its possible with Lenneth and the PSX ver(specific fixed version).   


(not related)- Dragon Quest VII PSX has never been playable on PSP as well as its text would never show up, but someone also fixed that games file. I have both on my Vita so I can say for sure they work.   


I think its crazy to keep spending money on and rebuying what you already have. I agree I may not own anything newer that works than PS2/PSP(broken)/PSPGO(too small but atleast works on tv but no PS3 working=no DualShock 3 use :-/.   


I am 37 (born 8/6/86) and seen a lot but honestly its crazy I feel to waste $ on the same stuff repeateadly. I lost all I had originally from 1990-2010 and I now only have like 100ish games total, thankfully have 25(27 total) psx JRPGs and a small pile US JRPGs for PS2 but unless theres a significant difference or reason to I would think about if theres any true benefit as these companies we may feel attached to but they only care about getting as much from everyone as they can.   


I am still missing a handful of games: Xenogears, Star Ocean 2, Tales of Destiny, VP, and need to replace/get fixed a disc or 2 and I honestly never got Silmeria(I want the JP boxset so I waited but never happened...xenosaga 1 as well.   


Long story short try and potentially forget about graphics(I believe PS2 was more than detailed enough but my personal opinion matters to just me) and consider a real copy or if you refuse that... just get a stupid PC and emulate PS2 and as otheres have said, if the graphical presentation of the game isn't acceptable to you as-is...theres always patches for HD presentation as others also said.   
Like...consider a preferreed method/decision and go from there. Also, there are games being translated and with a modded/regular console or computer you can play them also/as well for free.   
Just something to consider. I hate not having access to all these games i owned originally myself.

I atleast thankfully have the lenneth guidebook which helps a shiton as it applies to every release/version of VP. been awhile but I believe I left off at Ch.4...its quite a long/intracate one thats for sure. Though I dont really know JP I know kana and am trying to learn kanji words...also the JP manual has english translations of the main menu if people who dont knowe JP alsso gave it a whirl.  


I beat Lunar: SSSC recently...Still working on Eternal Blue Complete and Tales of Destiny II(Tales of Eternia). All great, though theres many many more. :Y:",1696118460.0

He was determined not to lie and attempted to shelter you from his issue by not speaking. You pushed this, so you need to be adult enough to handle it. No matter what you do, O.P. it is your life. You had someone who wanted to shield you from his insecurities by choosing not to speak. Then, I respected you enough to be honest when you asked him. That combination is very rare. There is a saying that applies to adulthood. Don't ask questions you don't want the honest answers too. There are much worse things he could say in anger and jealousy that I have heard men say. No one is perfect, but he at least cares and is honest.",1696118461.0

I'd do extra water changes for the next while until they start looking better. Cleaner water will let them recover quicker.

Going by past posts you know about dropsy etc.

If only the symptom is lethargy then it could be sick with many different types of disease and the lethargy is the fish not feeling well. Fingers crossed it is just constipation as the fish should recover from that easily enough. 

Repashy gel food is recommended on this sub quite a bit. Some of the other food types can lead to constipation due to fillers in the food. Also high quality pellet food that you soak prior to feeding is recommended.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

And if I can be of any help to your son, please let me know. I have been through the wringer with medications, side effects, and surgeries. 

I have had this my whole life, so I don‚Äôt know what it feels like to get diagnosed but I would imagine it is scary, especially for a parent. Don‚Äôt worry about him having one in public too much, as people know first aid more than you would think. I have had seizures alone in public places, and I have always been okay. I have also explained seizure first aid to every friend, employer, and coworker I have ever had. In my case, people have been completely understanding.

And remember, people do get better. And there are even people who don‚Äôt get better and still lead beautiful lives. I have a long-distance friend who has 4-5 grand mal seizures a week, sometimes more. She works a full-time job, maintains strong relationships with her siblings and friends, and lives a life of service. I admire her resilience and optimism.

So, your son will be okay as long as he maintains a positive attitude, and so will you. Look at these seizures as a challenge and say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre on.‚Äù I will be doing the same thing.",1696118463.0

"AskElectricians","t5_2xtq0","I‚Äôm going to give you the Double It Rule: When sizing a generator for a motor load, you double the full load current, if the full load current is unknown doubling the Breaker Value will also work and actually provides a larger margin of safety for the motor Starting Load. The reason for this is because motors require a very huge inrush of power to get them started.  Now that I have explained the why, let‚Äôs cover the HOW.  Using the 20 amp breaker as a starting point, 20 amps at 240 VAC is 4800 Watts.  Doubling that gives us 9600 Watts.  This is the Generator Peak load capacity that you need to confidently run your pump!  The good news is that a generator of this capacity will pretty much run everything in your house!

When he started to ask where his Daddy was, I told him that his Daddy had to go for a grown up time out. I told him that he was made from love and that his Daddy will always love him, but that Daddy needs to be taught to use Gentle Hands, Gentle Feet, and Gentle Words, and that we needed to give him the space he needed to learn those things. As he got older I told him more, but always in an age-appropriate way and in language he understood. None of it was a lie, either. His dad was in prison for the DV offences, he loved my son, and he was on a healthy relationships course in prison.

Remember, you've done the hardest bit. The rest will evolve on its own, so try not to over think it. For me, it was almost a relief when he asked, and I had a whole long speech planned about keeping him safe and how sorry I was that I'd managed to fuck it all up before he was even born. Turns out all he needed to know was that his father existed and was doing something that he needed to do. Everything else was my brain doing it's PTSD thing.",1696118464.0

I moved from Brazil to France to do the trainings. Choose your training and go for it. You are going to enjoy it. AMI is an international diploma. I have friends in almost all continents.

Yes, some schools only hire AMI guides. 

I have a friend that made both AMS and AMI, she says that the difference is huge, she enjoyed both but she recommend AMI. When you compare the program, workload, teaching practice, it is easy to see that you are going to study more and be more prepared doing AMI.

In anyway, after you do your training you are going to **\_start\_** your Montessori career and actually build your wisdom. Training is just training. Real practice and real children you are going to get only in a real situation.

She also does at-home insemination for MUCH cheaper than the clinics. I was SURE I had waited to long for my IUI (I did a compromise between clinic advice and my gut feeling and scheduled early in the morning on the day I thought was too late). But it worked, to my shock. It was also unmedicated. I credit working w/ the midwife because my guess is that if I had waited for that afernoon, I would have missed it.

""No sex on first date."" ""I need a connection."" ""I need to get to know someone."" False. With my ex, it got to the point where we'd just go straight to the guy's house and talk for a few minutes before they'd start. Although to be fair, chatting and talking beforehand helps a lot.

please [calculate your TDEE](https://tdeecalculator.net) and look at what the recommended cutting calories are for you, or just eat 100-200 calories less than your TDEE(maintenance calories). also i‚Äôd recommend eating adequate protein (.8-1gram per pound of body weight) and strength training to get some muscle back. good luck thanks for asking :)",1696118465.0

Wenn es nicht genau 18.3¬∞ C kann man mit denen auch nichts drau√üen unternehmen. ""Nee lass ma zu warm""  - ""Nee lass ma zu kalt"" lol",1696118466.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","I don‚Äôt feel like college athletes are always so much more athletic than normal people, or say, high school athletes. Between 3% and 12% of high school male athletes go onto play in the NCAA, varying on the sport. A lot of those who don‚Äôt had no intention to try to be recruited: perhaps they wanted to focus on their academics, or didn‚Äôt want the intense commitment to that lifestyle. Others might try and fail to be recruited. Those who play in college would have made the choice to pursue it, and were selected by a team.

Some of these athletes are more high-skilled than extremely athletic. Others are great athletes, and others are great athletes with special skills. I say this as someone who doesn‚Äôt feel particularly athletic, but I did play college soccer. I would say my athletic basics have always been very average, even below average: I‚Äôm not especially fast or strong, and I can‚Äôt kick the ball 60 meters like some players. I‚Äôm good in some specific skills that made me a good goalkeeper. I wasn‚Äôt a good athlete but I had fine skills, and I did choose the college athlete life that requires a high level of dedication, and continued to be dedicated for a long time. 

I would bet that for the former high school player who missed the field goal, if he dedicated himself to practicing regularly and staying sharp today, he could make the kick that he missed.",1696118467.0

"Volt_Inu","t5_5j5xue","I don't give a shit about usecases. I give a shit about price. It's been proven repeatedly that a token with zero usecases can make people rich: Shib, Doge, Pepe, BTC, Floki Inu, etc. I even made money on a total scam coin like Saitama. And made money on other bullshit tokens like Dogelon. 

Crypto will never be taken seriously in the real world. One reason is that you have zero control over it. With stocks, if you own a significant number of them, you can sit on the board meetings and have a say in how it is run. Heck, a person with a large number of stocks can even kick out the founder of the company and run it how he sees fit.

With crypto, the dev has the first and last say on how things are run. Even if the dev doesn't own 1% of one token, he still is the boss. All this talk about crypto being community-driven is bullshit. You get zero say in how it's run. 

That's one major reason why society at large will never take crypto seriously. Who wants to put serious money into something you have no control over?

That's why I don't chase after crypto for usecases, I chase after crypto that are doing well in ranking. As I posted before, Volt was at 262 when it had zero usecases and focused on exchanges. No that Voltoshi is focusing on usecases and forgoing exchanges, ranking is 690 on CMC. So we were doing well with the previous formula. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.",1696118467.0
"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","Do it on at least two separate servers - with each player on a separate server backing up the others - if you can get 3 or 4 separate servers that's better but it puts more people on ""watch"" flying rather than keeping people in reserve to take over when the main guy needs to go.

The bedlog serves as the final backup in the event of all servers 30ks simultaneously.  (it happened once)

It helps to have other players playing on the server - doing normal things like salvage, pvp pve bounty hunting, trading etc...   they're monitoring the health of the server and can serve as rescue in case the guy flying needs to QT back to the station to repair the coolers.

Cooler reliability is the weak point here - as soon as the cooler(s) fail, the ship overheats and becomes disabled. 

The ship that's actually flying towards the jump point is doing the tedious job - he can set an anti-logoff uncouple, and just check in periodically to make sure his player character is still hydrated/not hungry, etc...  so that he doesn't just go stir crazy doing nothing but flying down south not very fast.",1696118467.0
"granturismo","t5_2s4f7","TLDR: Skill Issue

Not all cars can be driven that way and may require some adjustment to their setup to allow for it.

If you're oversteering under braking you're braking too hard with the wheel turned, not trail braking properly, or upsetting the balance of the car with poor shift timing.

BTW you can still lock up the wheels with ABS enabled, same as real cars ABS can only do so much. Its an assist, not a 'do it for you' system.

If you're getting understeer you're probably accelerating too early/hard, applying too much steering angle, or carrying too much speed into the corner.",1696118467.0

"dogpictures","t5_2r5qg","My comment was already way too wordy, so I didn't specify. Apologies for the tirade I am about to unleash. I hope you find some of it entertaining: 

She had set a candle atop her toilet tank. The cabinet was mounted just above the toilet. The bottom shelf/wood of the cabinet was burnt in a large arc, so it was obvious it (wood) had burned for longer than a few minutes. 

She told me some friend of hers had done it, unbeknownst to her.

After she'd moved out (thanks to Covid), my housemate (also my in-house painter) told me there was candle wax on the walls, in another location.  And lots of places on the walls were darkened by incense that had been burned.

This tenant also poked about 200 holes into the brand new paint --- walls and ceiling. 

RANT CONTINUES:

She also went on a short holiday and allowed *some woman she didn't even know* to stay for several days at her place (a cottage attached to our home). I only discovered this ""visitor"" when my housemate mentioned some ""strange woman"" was walking up and down the cottage path, day after day, while tenant was gone. Tenant told me later the woman was a friend of a friend; someone she ""really didn't know at all.""

At the very start of Covid-19, this same tenant had two women she had just met that day stay with her, both women cooking up a storm. Women who tenant told me ""needed a place to cook.""  I put the kibosh on the women staying overnight or longer. It was stated in the lease that there were to be no overnight guests unless landlord was notified first. 

This clause of lease is because where we live, everyone wants to visit and no one wants to pay the exorbitant cost of a hotel or motel. 

Nevertheless. I did allow the tenant's family (mom, dad, two siblings) to stay for more than a few weekends. 

I guess I should mention here that all utilities were included. Free wifi. And also nice laundry w/ brand new HE washer that tenant overloaded (one time) to the point where I'm truly surprised the machine didn't breakdown. 

Here is the ONE LOAD of wet clothes that I removed from the washer ----- after I had given her specific instructions to *never* overload the new washing machine.

I've spent half of my life calling myself ""ugly"" because I'm not conventionally attractive. Learning that people I would typically consider out of my league (such a stupid phrase, by the way) are attracted to me was a shock. I was so set on my own perspective of myself that it didn't seem possible. I'm not setting my entire view of myself on the opinions of others, but the realization made me do a double take.

I like my plush thighs. I like my soft belly. I don't magically love my chubby arms, but they make sure I get all of my tasks accomplished at work. I have wide feet, but they're able to stand for my whole work day. Taking the time to step back and try to see myself how someone else does was mind altering for me.

I know that's not necessarily a route everyone can take. It's hard to suddenly ""accept"" yourself as is. It takes time. You deserve that acceptance though. You deserve self love.

"SameGrassButGreener","t5_2u6j8","Asian here with a recommendation. Madison, Wisconsin is a beautiful little city built on an isthmus between 2 lakes with a 3rd nearby. It has the flagship school of the University of Wisconsin and the population here is generally university educated with a strong background in STEM.

Madison has a decent variety of food for its size. The Asian food here won't match the availability of the Coasts or southern cities. But there are several Asian grocery stores and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Thai restaurants.

There are bike/pedestrian paths everywhere through the city. When I lived in downtown Madison I could easily walk for hours at a time from neighborhood to neighborhood. There are several nature reserves in the city where you can walk through forest.

You want cold? Last year it snowed in October and continued through April. Spring was all of 2 weeks before summer hit.

How much passive aggression do the locals have? All of it. The only difference between Midwest tact and Midwest passive aggression is context. But I think the people here have a friendly forthright way of talking.

Is it racist? Relative to Wisconsin's rural areas no, but there's no escaping certain assholes. Also Wisconsin's standard for being a worldly person is not the same as California's for example. But I am comfortable here.

This is my pro-Madison bias showing but I prefer it to Milwaukee haha. Milwaukee has many similar things to Madison to recommend it. But the suburbs around Milwaukee are very conservative areas of Wisconsin and Milwaukee itself is one of the most racially segregated cities in America. The city often gets unfair treatment because the local government does not want to provide resources to the black population. Of course that's not what's openly said, but the pattern is clear.",1696118469.0

"MichiganWolverines","t5_2s3vu","So is losing like the whole game multiple times.

We‚Äôve allowed one score all year in games not already decided-  the Nebraska 7 the UNLV 7 the East Carolina 3 with under 5 mins in the 4th while being shut out by between 4 and 7 touchdowns‚Ä¶. And third stringers in,  cmon.  

Those garbage scores are 17 ‚Äúlet‚Äôs not get shut out‚Äù moral victory scores  are most of our defensive points that we wouldn‚Äôt have allowed if we played starters‚Ä¶. and we‚Äôve allowed 13 otherwise and one touchdown and two field goals over 5 games. 

We‚Äôre allowing 2.6 meaningful points per game‚Ä¶

@ Nebraska has given us trouble in the past.  Hard place to play with fans I admire a lot for selling out and are insanely engaged even after losing for a while.  Not today.  

But we‚Äôre gonna get our one first place vote again and Auburn threw this win vs Georgia away.  Heorgia didn‚Äôt have a lead until inside the final three minutes and Auburn threw a fluke int on what looked like a game winning drive.  Ugh.  And we‚Äôve got the pac 12 in the mix now, Florida state? Seriously?   Hopefully ND is out of the conversation, but probably plays out of it, and there‚Äôs no group of 5 team in play now, but that‚Äôs still 5 conferences, and it looks like they might wanna give the PAC 12 2 spots.  SEC might be the best chance to knock one out.  

If we go undefeated we‚Äôre fine but I‚Äôd like that non-con championship participant #4 slot open like Alabama and Ohio State always get.  Should we lose to PSU or OSU.  Even then it might not be enough.  We‚Äôd have to lose to someone else and beat both of them or lose the B1G title game while beating both of them, to have enough good wins.  otherwise we won‚Äôt have strong enough schedule to back in. Maryland can help us they should be ranked this week, Wisconsin and Rutgers could get back in the rankings even Iowa is still receiving votes.  

Texas is good that should be 2 after us (and the only team id say could deserve 1, possibly also Oregon now after Colorado‚Äôs showing against oregon.  If we‚Äôre looking at only this year.  Washington 3 Oregon 4 Georgia 5 

1. Michigan 
Texas
Washington
Penn State
Ohio State
6. Georgia
Oregon
USC
Washington State
Florida State
11. Duke
Alabama
Oklahoma
Ole Miss
Notre Dame
16. Kentucky
Maryland
Oregon State
North Carolina
Miami (FL) 
21. Utah
Missouri 
Louisville 
Fresno State
Rutgers

RV: Wisconsin, Tennessee, LSU, Memphis, Texas A&M, James Madison

At what point do we stop looking at last year and start thinking about how UAB is threatening to beat Georgia the third quarter.  

Nebraska sucks but so does Auburn but Nebraska is the harder road stadium to play in‚Ä¶ if the team isn‚Äôt good.  Auburn gets on fire when they have a good team, but they‚Äôve been second fiddle to Alabama so long that‚Äôs not a fiercely hostile football environment anymore.   It‚Äôs sure as hell not  the Shoe, Beaver Stadium‚Ä¶. Camp Randall or Kinnick or fuck even Spartan Stadium if it‚Äôs us playing.  

Not to mention we didn‚Äôt exactly play a game that wasn‚Äôt over in the first quarter.  Nebraska clawed a TD down 45-0.  Ugh.  We‚Äôve been at 2 for like three years.  I just really don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre 2 based on what we‚Äôre supposed to be looking at.  We played a perfect game on both sides of the ball in a hostile environment - Georgia turned the ball over many times and needed a fourth quarter comeback.  

Are we winning games by so much that people aren‚Äôt paying attention?  And only watching the close ones?  Like JJ executing a perfect drive for Michigan‚Äôs 5th touchdown, did anyone even see that?  Probably not because they were all watching Georgia lose to Auburn the entire game‚Ä¶ and Georgia fighting hard against UAB and Georgia going down 2 scores to South Carolina‚Ä¶",1696118469.0

Jk. Do you have a skincare routine? Generally speaking a simple routine should include a cleanser, a moisturizer, some sort of active for targeting an issue (optional), and a sunscreen.

Aside from a skincare routine are you sleeping/exercising enough and ensuring you drink enough water? Eat a healthy diet? Managing stress? An imbalance I. These areas can have an effect on your skin and aging.",1696118469.0

"WaterCoolerWednesday","t5_21wmza","So I'm trying to get a few of my friends to come to Vegas for New Years this year. It'll primarily be my best friend, his wife, and my other best friend who I went to London with earlier this year. If you weren't following that story, we were intimate with each other for the first time on that trip but decided we were just gonna stay friends. I speak to her all the time but haven't seen her in person since. Because it's gonna be the two of us and another couple in my one bed apartment, I think I'm gonna have to have a very awkward sleeping arrangements call with her.

Let's back up a little to a couple weeks ago when I started talking to this new girl. I was really excited about her, but the thought honestly kept crossing my mind that if it worked out with her I definitely wouldn't be able to be physical with London girl again, and our friendship might be kinda screwed in general. One of my only friends I've told about what happened in London is basically convinced I'm in love with her. I don't *think* I am, but if I'm hesitant about getting serious with new girls because of my relationship with London girl that's kinda not the greatest sign. I think I'm possibly psychologically blocking out the possibility that I'm in love with London girl because there's no way we end up together so it would not end well for me if I was.

Anyway, yall can't really tell me if I'm in love with her or not, I guess I'm just trying to figure out how to handle us going forward. In London we both agreed we are still best friends and want to keep visiting each other but now that we're starting to make plans to I'm realizing this is gonna be a bit more difficult now. Because like in all reality, I probably could work it out where we don't have to share a bed for New Years, but honestly a very large part of me doesn't wanna tell her that because I want to. I guess I know the answer is to communicate with her honestly what my feelings are but that gets really scary because I don't wanna lose my best friend. Idk. I don't regret anything, the situation is just kind of hard.",1696118470.0

They all valued the individual, private ownership, owning private property, providing goods and serivice in exchange for money in a neoliberal market.  The only people that I think could be described as proto socialists, proto as how most people use and understand the word, would be some of the communes of Christians' that might have be around during that era but for sure popped up later like the shakers. that being said i don't think they really fit the bill either. The founders were really mainly concerned with the role and function and power of the federal government and state governments and their power/influence over each other and the citizens of the US and ""the market"" like what and how much and if they could tax things and what.

No mention of ""8K"" or ""ultrawide"" or even ""32:9"" on their web site. Just ""Dual 4K UHD"". I think they're trying to sidestep this confusion, and good on them for that.

The industry moved from measuring vertical resolution (1080p, 1440p, etc.) to measuring horizontal (4K, 8K, etc.), and that has led to some awkward and logically incompatible naming conventions.

Instead of thinking of it as ultrawide, I like to think of it as ""8K ultrashort"". It is the correct resolution for ""8K"" movies that are in the right aspect ratio, so I think calling it some variation of ""8K"" does make sense.",1696118471.0

- Unless you have stated that you wish to be contacted privately for privacy reasons, etc, please be wary of anyone who contacts you about your request outside of your post. We are unable to assist with any problems that may arise from dealing with users who contact you outside of this post.

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

A/T is not from MBTI but from Big 5.

It's Neuroticism. T is high, A is low.

I have never found it to make sense that it was part of Big 5, because good therapy, EMDR, etc. can totally change your level of Neuroticism.

The same really can't be said of Extroversion or Agreeableness. Neuroticism is disordered thinking. Openness is not. 

That said, I think Big 5 implies that traits are good or bad, like high Extroversion is good and low is bad, etc. The more you read the descriptions of traits, the worse it seems. 

There is an alternative that uses the same traits but a high-0-high scale with two ends, like High Extroversion - High Introversion etc. This makes more sense to me, as it doesn't have embedded value judgments.

But yes, high Neuroticism is bad, and is associated with difficulties in relationships, or mental and physical health problems. It's not something immutable, though.",1696118472.0

I have seen it against all the cars but I think it is easiest to see versus the really good Golden Fox Players on most maps. They have the best chance at breaking away from the pile of cars at the start of the race and depending on the track can boost consistently enough to stay up front.

That being said it does give pretty consistent top 10 placements. Whether it passes hard bumper placements or just saves some HP and lets you boost more favorably in the final stretch.",1696118473.0

Then what did they do? Gave him the goddesst of powers, he inherited like 6 powers ? Just whatever man.

Exactly! Why did he inherit the GOD tier of all quirks OUT OF THE BLUE! Hori bro... make him earn it!

You are a GROWN UP and sometimes that means Sucking Up Uncomfortable Feelings. Go do a Dale Carnegie class, or watch some videos on how to do polite chit chat, or read some books on the importance of LISTENING to other people - being ‚Äúsocial‚Äù is not brain surgery, for heaven‚Äôs sake. All you have to do is practice a couple of open ended questions, look intently at people when they answer, and say things like ‚Äúwow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat happened then‚Äù or ‚Äúhow did that go over‚Äù and bam! You‚Äôre a socializing master.

Basically, just be interested in other people, and fake it if you aren‚Äôt. If you want to be a real hero, look for the other people with a pained nervous expression, and do your best to make them feel a bit better. You can also put a time limit on it - two times a month for three hours is very reasonable - and expect equal support of your interests.

An ""optimal"" build is only useful in the hands of someone who already has the skills required to not really *need* the build.

A better option is always to give advice about a build for whatever specific struggle the person is having. Fume Knight is weakest to strike damage; the Old Leo Ring is worthless in that case.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Right, here we go. 

A lot of concerns raised and they might be legit but this also could be an amazing opportunity so let's manage our downside. 

1)Get the company to offer a transition bonus to the current IT Manager. That should include handing over all current admin passwords, any current documentation, and being available for knowledge transfer for you for a certain time period (1 month is probably fine). 

2)Get some assurances on their level of future investment. They're firing the entire IT department - they need to be prepared to hire immediately or engage a vendor to provide support while you rebuild. Make them commit to the number of employees they're giving you and at what levels or the budget to hire a vendor.  

3)Get the budget numbers. You might have to rebuild from scratch - make sure you have money to do it. Can't rebuild the Titanic on a rowboat budget. 

4)Your comp should include bonuses and measurable metrics to achieve them. Ideally you would have something like ""manage downtime during conversion to below x%"" and ""transition to new infrastructure in x months"" and ""IT Strategic plan delivered by x date""  Stuff that aligns with actually doing a good job. 

5)Signing bonus. If you're really worried they might kick you after a few months, get a signing bonus and bank it to use for a parachute if they do. I'd also include an early termination agreement too. If you're let got, for any reason beyond egregious HR stuff, within the first year they'll pay you 3 months of salary. They'll probably negotiate you down to 6 weeks, that's likely fine. 

6)PTO. No matter if this is a trap or an opportunity, it's going to be a lot of work. Make sure you negotiate your PTO appropriately and include ample mental health days so you don't burn out. 

I'm probably missing a few things but that should appropriately hedge your downside and make the risk small enough to take this gig without a second thought. **Do note that this is also your ONLY CHANCE TO GET ANY OF THIS.** This is when you have the most leverage. Companies don't care about retention, they do care about recruitment though. 

Anything that comes 'later' that's not in writing is bullshit. So look at those things as nice to haves because you likely won't have them.",1696118474.0

A bidding war breaks out and drives the price well above the reserve - Win.

"datingoverforty","t5_su6ij","I think this is good advice and I believe this is the approach the retired guys I talked to took with me. I agree that a good amount of people don‚Äôt understand how wealth or income works. It‚Äôs not really taught in school and a lot of people learn about it through their social circles. 

I really have no interest in going to five star restaurants. I‚Äôve gone to fancy restaurants w/my STBXH‚Äôs family and the portions were really small and a bit too creative for my taste. ü§£ Just seems like a big fuss and a waste of time and money. 

I am materialistic though‚ÄîI have a lot of nice things, luxury handbags, jewelry, luxury car. I have a gorgeous, very expensive, and super sparkly 3 carat+ engagement ring that I got compliments on often. I was going to pass it down to one of my kids, but not anymore, seems like a bad luck charm. ü§£ If anything when strangers would compliment me on my ring üíç, especially if the lady told me how lucky I was, I would just feel sad. Like my life was a lie bc my marriage was so bad. My STBXH was all about how we were perceived and wanting to look good for outsiders. One year a popular photo Christmas card company used our family photos on their website in a few of their Christmas card templates (we had to give permission for this as well as the photographer). My STBXH was thrilled with this, like look at our perfect family. It felt really fake to me, things had been bad in our marriage for a long time. ü•∫ 

All this being said‚Äîthe material things, vacations, our kids achievements, etc. all covered up how miserable our marriage was and how much my mental health was suffering. I just want to live an authentic and peaceful life moving forward. üôèüèºü¶ã",1696118474.0

See, as progressive as the younger generation claims to be, they are, in fact, extremely prone to suggestion, and are MK Ultra'd to a devastating degree. 

They lack the ability to engage in society, and use their cell phones to opt out of reality. Even when they are forced to react to events, they raise their devices to watch it through the digital screens rather than to face it in the flesh.

"caffeine","t5_2r544","Yeah caffeine can really mess some people up. A lot don't even consider it as something that could be causing any problems whatsoever. It has become so ingrained in our society that it's probably more rare to not consume caffeine than it is to be a regular consumer.

I've been trying to quit myself because I know that it causes chronic anxiety and disrupts my sleep. Unfortunately, it's also one of the few things that provides me some semblance of energy and motivation. I feel like it's probably something I'm trying to use to treat my underlying depression, but it may very well be highly contributing to it at this point.

Did you struggle with mood, energy, and motivation during the detox? If so when did you start to feel better?

I got close to 2 weeks once but I still had no will to engage with life. I wonder if it was just the depression at that point.",1696118476.0

"NarutoFanfiction","t5_2yhj6","Doubtful.

Boruto had the issue of creating a world that sort of spat in the face of a lot of the foundations that were being laid in the original.

A compelling story definitely could have been told with Boruto that could have been just as interesting as Naruto, but they started right out of the gate with the wrong foot.

Imagine for a moment that you take the framework that is My Hero Academia, and you reskin that for Boruto.

A young boy grows up aspiring to be this great hero, who is a symbol of peace for the world. And it just so happens that said symbol is his father and he has these massive shoes to fill, and he doesn't know if he can ever really fill them.

But then throughout the world the forces of antagonism are actually byproducts of a world that Naruto and his success as a shinobi brought about.

People that are Uzumaki pretenders. Villains that believe Madara was right and the current peace is fleeting. Etc etc.

I think people would be more accepting or Boruto regardless of the end pairings had the rest of the series been adequate.",1696118476.0

"gekte","t5_3kr89k","F√ºr eine Funktionierende Landwirtschaft sind Nutztiere sehr n√ºtzlich, die produzieren D√ºngemittel und k√∂nnen Teile der Ernte essen, die wir nicht essen wollen. Doch wir sind √ºber ein gesundes Verh√§ltnis zwischen Tierhaltung und Ackerbau hinausgegangen. Zu viele Fl√§chen werden ausschlie√ülich genutzt um Tiere zu ern√§hren, obwohl man aus diesen mehr Nahrung bekommen k√∂nnte w√ºrde man dort Lebensmittel f√ºr Menschen anbauen. Wir Deutschen exportieren tonnenweise Tierkkacke, weil wir unsere Felder immer an den Rand der √úberd√ºngung bringen und trotzdem Schei√üe √ºber haben. Die ganzen Methangase die K√ºhe auspupsen sind nicht gut f√ºr die Umwelt, viele andere Dinge an der Massentierhaltung auch nicht. Man h√§tte einige Fl√§chen vielleicht sogar √ºber, w√ºrde man weniger Tiere halten, weil so unglaublich viel Ackerfl√§chen zur Ern√§hrung der Tiere gebracht wird. Davon k√∂nnte man etwas an die Umwelt zur√ºck geben. 

Ich bin aber auch ehrlich. Massentierhaltung ist eklig und eher schlecht f√ºr uns alle langfristig. Aber ich f√ºhle mich nicht schlecht, nur weil ich ein Tier esse. Auch Echtleder mag ich zb. sehr gerne. Aber wir m√ºssen etwas in der Landwirtschaft ver√§ndern  und wenn es nur darum ist, dass unsere B√∂den durch die derzeitige Form irgendwann unfruchtbar werden. Ich wei√ü auch, dass wenn wir zb. 5 Millionen K√ºhe weniger halten wollen diese nicht einfach auf Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen freigelassen werden k√∂nnen. Die werden trotzdem auf einem Teller landen, nur eben nicht mehr ersetzt durch neue K√§lber.

Fazit: Tiere zu halten ist sinnvoll und ergibt lecker Fleisch, aber wir √ºbertreiben ma√ülos damit. Fleisch darf gerne teurer sein, Milchprodukte auch. Aber verschwinden muss das wegen mir nicht.",1696118477.0

The Titanic 3D rerelease had an obnoxious audience (CityWalk) at my screening. People just‚Ä¶aren‚Äôt as fucking funny as they think they are. Come back with better jokes for your Titanic MST3K and we‚Äôll talk. Meg 2 at CityWalk was also terrible - summer time, so peak theme park people trying to take a break at the movies. There was a group of like maybe 8-9 teens and a solo adult/dad. The teens weren‚Äôt even the issue, it was the dad. He was obnoxious - started during the trailers and just continued. We ended up moving farther down - a couple was horizontal *loudly* making out and being very gropey. I literally could‚Äôve ignored them but their make out noises were disgusting.

This is a major oversight in the study as on day one, the community can decide where and how much renewable energy is deployed.

There have been a number of callings I have had in life, however nothing has come easier to me than writing. I wrote here and there for all my life, but just got serious early this year, specifically in the spring.

>How did you know?

When I got serious, the words and sentences just flowed out of me, and became a beautiful short story with a meaningful message. It is incredibly complex, and is delivered in such a way that leaves the reader having to really stop and think about its greater application to our society - and world.

"harvestmoon","t5_2s3kr","They don't really add or take anything away from the game for me personally so I don't mind the games without them. 

If the dialogue is good, then the portraits are just icing on a cake I'm already enjoying, so not having them wouldn't make me enjoy it any less. But then you have a case like Poot where the dialogue was repetitive and a bit bland, but portraits wouldn't have really elevated the characters for me.

While I wouldn't mind if future games didn't include them so long as they improve the dialogue, I totally understand people feeling that the games are lacking without them. Fwiw, I think not having portraits and the inexpressive models were two of the many complaints given to the devs about poot, and they seemed to take the criticism seriously. So I think it's likely they'll either work more on the models or just straight up bring back portraits going forward.",1696118479.0

"TenantHelp","t5_2xuez","It seems your roommate is referring to ""constructive eviction"" 

True constructive eviction is rare and requires that:

* The landlord‚Äôs failure to keep the unit repaired has allowed the unit to become an unfit place for you to live,
* The unit cannot be restored to a fit condition by ordinary repairs, and
* You move out of the premises.

Are all three conditions here met? I don't have the complete picture but it looks like that's not the case. Arguing the first bulletin will be hard if it comes down to a court case. 2nd bulletin seems unlikely. Not sure about the 3rd bulletin either (did every tenant move out?).

Constructive eviction must happen because of the landlord‚Äôs actions or inaction in  
fixing the condition of the unit. The law allows a reasonable time for landlord to fix issues. Are you able to prove this?",1696118479.0

"miraculousladybug","t5_39tdz","It feels weird saying this, especially as someone who's been very vocal about criticing her in the past, but I have to give that to Marinette. Season 5 fixed so many issues I had with her, and actually addressed them instead of just sweeping them under the rug, but people seem to hate her now.

To be clear, I never hated Marinette l, but I've been begging for the writers to do better with her for such a long time. The stalking and obsessing were never cute, and I've lost track of how many people have reached out to me, to tell me their stories of how they ruined their childhood relationships by copying her. Marinette is intended to be a role model to young girls, and they allowed her to give a negative example for way too long.

That said, Derision was a nearky perfect episode in terms of addressing this. Not only did they explain WHY she acted this way, but they also acknowledge that it is not healthy, and should not be excused. Season 5 had an overarching theme of reasons vs excuses, with Chloe and Gabriel making excuses for themselves, while Marinette acknowledges that though she had a reason, it did not change the negative effect her behavior had on herself and others around her. Marinette saw the harm of her actions, and did the work to improve herself. Chloe denies the fact that her actions come from emotional abuse by her mother and a lack of self with, and chooses to instead over compensate and tramples on others to try and make herself feel better. She doesnt want to acknowledge her own faults, so she uses her assumed superiority to excuse hurting everyone around her. Gabriel knows he's hurting people, and he knows why he does what he's doing, but he uses the pain from his wife's death to justify his actions. Again, making excuses for himself, instead of accepting the reality of her death and moving forward to ensure his and Adrien‚Äôs happiness.",1696118479.0

"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx","1. Not moving to Hawaii and encouraging others not to is helping Hawaii. Talking about both past and current struggles in Hawaii can help Hawaii. Hopefully this conversation we're having can bring not just yours, but others' attention to and knowledge of the current struggles there.
2. A strategic position does not mean it's not causing suffering or that there aren't things the US government can do to lessen that suffering. Maintaining hazardous materials is literally the bare minimum they can do. The idea that China would cross majority of the Pacific and annex a US state if we closed even just one of the bases on the islands is preposterous. An attack on Hawaii dragged us into a world war. An annexation certainly would not be written off as a loss. There's so much in between ""Being more responsible guests and forming a more beneficial partnership"" and ""Clear the bases and give Hawaii to China"". 
3. Colonialism and oppression is not over. It's no different than elsewhere with racism, but with the addition of actively buying up cultural and ancestral land, pricing natives out of family homes, as well as making it harder and harder for Native Hawaiians to qualify for land rights. Just because you have not personally heard about it doesn't mean it's not happening.

I was Legendary Eagle Master in csgo, with down ranks when I‚Äôd play other maps lol.

In the beta of premier in cs2 I was at a rating of 11,500 which I thought was pretty good considering active duty doesn‚Äôt include d2.

I went 10 wins, 2 losses, and 1 tie on dust 2 to unlock rank, and I ranked at silver elite‚Ä¶

4 games later, 2 wins 2 losses (mind you, im going 2:1 KD in all of these games - and I‚Äôve dropped to silver 4.

My assumption is that cs2 has completely wiped rank history, which has always helped maintain stability in accounts with a long play record.

This means that there will probably be wild fluctuations in ranks as it stabilizes, and I‚Äôll have to grind back up to LEM on dust 2 specifically.

Since she is not suicidal or homicidal the criteria that would apply is ""A gravely disabled person is someone who may suffer serious harm because he fails to provide for his basic human needs and refuses to accept necessary hospitalization"".  Even if they did a committment it would be for a evaluation and a psychiatrist or at a court hearing could lift it.  It's not for nothing because it's essentially a papertrail.

"PS5","t5_2s887",">V has a predefined story and narrative choice. 

No they don't lol. Pull out the sources homie because the game lets you pick your background, it let's you pick between a bunch of wildly differing choices and it has a ton of endings. Unlike Geralt who only makes choices that all fit within a certain realm of believability with his book characterization, V does not have such a template. The Vs from 2 player playthroughs can start and end at completely different points vs two Geralts or two Kratoses.

Pull out the quotes where CDPR confirm who the canon V is.

>You keep saying Cyberpunk is an RPG as if it gives you freedom in how you do everything. That's the lie they marketed the game as. Have you actually played the game? You have little choice over the story or how the characters develop.

You have plenty of choice. Not having *all* the choices is not the same as not having any. There are even RPGs where you have little to 0 choices as to how the story or characters develop. That doesn't make them *not*-RPGs.

Cyberpunk 2077, just like it's pen and paper parent, is an RPG.

>Is that the virtue of an RPG? Having no control over the story? I don't think so. Especially if you wanna talk about the TTRPG world Cyberpunk came from. So your point makes no sense.

There's a long and stories tradition of RPGs where you have 0 impact over the story. See classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest or western classics like Diablo. RPGs are about choices but not necessarily moldable plots. See all the murder hobo parties that play DnD with 0 regard for plot and just use it as dressing to justify combat encounters.

>You say they focused on stealth cause it was expected and people asked for it? Ha! As if they didn't sell the entire game as to have freedom over the story and a dense world with awesome AI scripting. Funny how thats the one thing they failed to improve on. 

I don't think I ever claimed a ""focus"" on stealth, just that it was something expected and welcome. Them not having a reactive enough story and bad AI has nothing to do with whether they tried making an RPG or not. We aren't talking quality here, just definitions.

>So yeah. I think they should have focused more on the bigger picture of what an rpg is and less on stealth.

And you can have whatever opinion you want buddy. But thinking they shouldn't have included stealth is just stupid and shows you either don't understand that products are made to appeal to more than just you or fundamentally misunderstood what sort of game CDPR was always making.",1696118482.0

I'm not sure why it's 7, but that's based off reported abuse so that average could be vastly different in real life since many people never report their abusers for various reasons. The stats on that website are super depressing. I looked into the whole 7 attempts thing after my old therapist quoted it when I was mad at myself for not leaving my abusive ex sooner. It took me 3 attempts before I finally got him out of my life for good. I have sympathy for my friend because I know how hard it is to get out of abusive environments when that's all you ever known. People who grew up in abusive households are more likely to be in abusive relationships later on, whether that be as the abuser or the abused. I grew up in an extremely unstable abusive household for most of my life and even when it got ""better"" there was still a lot of neglect/abuse happening. When I finally got into a healthy environment I didn't know how to handle it. My body was reacting like there was still danger when there wasn't, it made me paranoid waiting for the other shoe to drop. Logically I knew I was safe and I *wanted* a healthier safe life, but it kicked my fight or flight into overdrive. A lot of people who grew up that way who then get into abusive relationships react the same when they leave. It scares them into going back because safety is unknown territory. It can dig up repressed feelings and make survival tactics more apparent. It can be terrifying in its own way. I believe that's what my friend experiences and that's why she keeps going back. I'm lucky I had access to therapy and a good support system that was extremely understanding, without those two things I don't know if I would've ever broke the cycle.",1696118483.0

I remember it being used in academic articles during my degree, and I graduated many years before The Good Place first aired, so while it may not have been very widely used by the general public, the show's incorporation of academic philosophy very much lends itself to this kind of usage.",1696118485.0

LN V19 CH1:

>I asked it to use ‚ÄòNihility Collapse,‚Äô which I still had a difficult time understanding even after it was explained to me, and to make it more powerful. That is how the ‚ÄòImaginary Blade‚Äô was born.

The Null Energy absorbs the target‚Äôs energy and then throws him into Imaginary Space. If you have forgotten, I‚Äôll remind you that Feldway and the rest are spiritual life forms, losing energy is like taking damage, and Null Energy absorbing all their energy would do that.

If it was normal eating (Soul Gluttony) through Azathoth it wouldn‚Äôt be a one-hit kill, because if someone is resisting it with their will, they won‚Äôt be eaten. Like how Rimuru needed Velgrynd to transform into a meteor basically to lower her will and eat her instantly.

Not only that majority were advised to meet Pac at 662 and Franky was advised to ride behind pac and PAC left his vest at the hotels and told his Family to STAY IN THE HOTEL AND **NOT** to leave.  


Pac first, KNEW something was about to go down.  


Secondly, Reggie admits he worked for the Feds but says it's conspiracy crap that they had anything to do with it. He talks a lot for a man that has nothing to do with it.  


This is how we know people asleep at the wheel.

**VEGAS** is the story **THEY SOLD YOU.**  


People, can't seem to delineate from that actually night. **VEGAS** is the **symptom** of what eventually transpired.   


What people **SHOULD** be focused on is **NOT**  **""WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT""** and more focused on   
What lead up to that night  
Who was invovled  
Why> Why is the most important.  


Again, I said 9 months ago reggie was gonna get arrested. This is all part of the story they selling. Then **Dear Mama,** which was made by industry favorables is gonna accept some award on behalf of Afeni and PAC and look off stage right at the ceiling "" **YOU CAN FINALLY REST PAC..WE CAUGHT THE KILLER""**  


Everything around you folks is fabricated **BS.** So much, I even had Reggie himself write me a comment that Mopreme wasnt even in Pac's life around his death, so why trust what he says.   


When **Reggie**. Worked for Law enforcement and head of Pacs security was the very reason pac had **NO bodyguards** that night and **gun.**  


**STOP TRUSTING .THE PEOPLE WHO TALK THE MOST. THEY ARE LYING TO YOU.** They are just prepping the next narrative to SELL more of the Tupac legacy.  


You'd be surprised if you like pac said**"" Look back on my life...from another level..""**   


Dude's telling you countless times in his music what was gonna happen. Even made a fuckin music video where he was shot coming out of an event with Ace of spades **""club 662"".**  


He had a pretty go idea Vegas was gonna be the Hollywood movie ending good enough, to procure a hip hop legacy.

2. I used to watch with my grandmother, and she would usually call some of the spots (more so when wrestlers would move or counter their opponents) without fail.   

3. Watching Beyond the Mat also solidified the choreographed/scripted nature of the business when it showed (amongst other examples of exposure) The Rock rehearsing, then recounting live his Royal Rumble 1999 promo for the I Quit Match with Mick Foley.",1696118487.0

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

You know perfectly well what the possible dangers are out there. For girls and women of any age. To deliberately discount those possibilities is downright foolish. 

In this particular instance I think her work place failed her. Walmart should be getting ready for a massive lawsuit. And they are completely in the wrong. This young woman was complaining for a year about the creepy guy who wouldn't leave her alone. A Fucking Year! They could have contacted the local police that they have a possible stalking problem. There's a whole playbook of possible moves they could have made. They didn't even do the bare minimum and make sure they didn't work on the same day. It's criminally negligent to keep sacrificing women and girls like this. And I know you've seen rapists get a ridiculously light sentence so as to ""not ruin a young man's life"". It's very disheartening sometimes. 

Statistically speaking the domestic partner is most likely to have murdered a woman, especially a pregnant woman. (Disclaimer- I understand that women attack men as well. I would never make an argument against that)

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","Thanks so much everyone, I can't express how motivating it is to share these stories and be heard. This sub is changing my life, for now, and hopefully for some time to come.

The birthday was good. Closer friends, and at a house rather than a pub. Stayed most of the night. I was complimented on my clear skin and eyes, which was very encouraging.

The big take away: I've noticed in recent years that my confidence in making my friends laugh has taken a hit - my prefrontal cortex has clearly been dulled by regular drinking, even when I'm not actively drinking or even hungover. Also, my anxiety and lack of confidence was getting in the way. But last night I made an effort to engage and take risks to make my friends laugh, and it worked for the most part. I felt confident and could also read the room better. I feel so glad to have my thoughts connecting clearly. The idea of taking one of the alcoholic beers out of the fridge was not at all appealing. 

I know this phase of feeling strong, like everything in life, will not last forever, but I hope to carry these feelings forward when temptation tries to get the better of me. Thank you all so much, sincerely. IWNDWYT.",1696118489.0

Markets are a solution for allocation of scarce goods and resources and unless you take a very extreme position (i.e. that luxury food and housing shouldn't exist) there will be some kinds of food and housing that are scarce.

And no, I am not clicking it myself. Aside from probably being unbearable, I know who profits from me doing that.

Edit: she‚Äôs saying that dad was having casual flings with her in the house, so she was overexposed to ‚Äòsexual shit.‚Äô She also loathes his new girlfriend. He owes child support (we already knew that,) the photos of mouldy food and shoes again, both parents engage in physical abuse and exposed her to inappropriate stuff young. She also says her mum (maybe meant step mum?) brought designer bags while she went without food. She claims he also abused her mother in the past. 

Oh, and claims her dad set up the death hoax and Lil Tay coin. And is in cahoots with the ‚Äòmanager,‚Äô who is actually a scam artist. Which i don‚Äôt exactly disbelieve, but leaving out the brother was caught promoting one stands out. Probably because he‚Äôs the brains behind this shit being used to *promote a flex track.*

Dad using Craiglist (and the child support) is the only thing with receipts. Which is not unexpected considering the actual allegations, but it‚Äôs also probably the thing I‚Äôm the least concerned about. Adults hooking up isn‚Äôt exactly the issue in all this.

Oh, and the allegations about racism coming up again,.The justification used this time is ‚Äòhe was trying to stop my career because my mother was allowing me to hang around with black and Latino people‚Äô Which‚Ä¶yeah. He may well be racist. A lot of people are. Byt that‚Äôs not a train of logic I entirely buy.

Why are you being so imprecise, is it on purpose;  we know **material effects** have **material causes.**  In fact, 100% of observed **material effects** have **matetial causes.**

Why are you equivocating, and being imprecise?

>You're trying to use scepticism to justify not accepting psr, but the only other option is brute fact. Brute fact = not-psr.

No, the other option is ""I don't know.""  Yes, one or the other, via your definitions; I am stating I don't know because we have 0 evidenve, 0 infornation about non-material.  

You are trying to talk about a topic you have no idea about.  This is unsupportable.

>You making this distinction of only having evidence of ""material"" causes has no justification, unless you can link that distinction to some reason that we should expect there to be no cause

I have.  I'm gonna put the biggest 2 reasons in all caps, bold and italics.

***100% OF ALL OBSERVED CAUSES ARE MATERIAL.  100% OF ALL OBSERVED EFFECTS ARE MATERIAL.  THIS IS A REASON TO EXPECT THAT 100% OF CAUSES, AND EFFECTS, WOULD REMAIN MATERIAL.

"service_dogs","t5_2v0po","No I totally understand people work their dogs off leash for various reasons and I support working your dog in whatever way works best for you. Like I said, I did it until I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable not having a physical tether to my dog. But I‚Äôve also had to prove in a lawsuit that I needed him off leash and that was a trying time, even if it ended in my favor.

As disabled people the government isn‚Äôt on our side. They‚Äôre usually actively against us, and so I‚Äôm saying there is usually a way to work without having your dog completely off leash. Me cautioning people is trying to save them what I went through, which was being attacked and dehumanized. 

Other disabled people and specifically service dog gear makers have made gear really accommodating. Bold Lead Designs makes harnesses that have magnetic latches exactly for people who have trouble with standard buckles. You can attach a traffic lead to the harness and leave it there so it doesn‚Äôt need to be clipped and unclipped. Looking at other options should always be the first step. When I transitioned from working off leash it took me a while to find something I felt comfortable with that worked for us as a team, but I did it. And like I said, I reached out to others in this community to crowd source ideas and found nothing but support. 

Also, just as I don‚Äôt know your disabilities you don‚Äôt know mine so try not to make assumptions about what I do or do not understand :)",1696118491.0

Though I do think people often assume skill-based is a purely positive thing. Not everyone wants their skill at the game to be the determining factor. That can be stressful for a lot of people. When gear is a determining factor it makes the game more accessible and casual which is appealing to many, myself included.  


As a final note, while IM could reverse direction and try to go down the route of a more competitive game, it'd be incredibly difficult to do so with what they currently have.

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","The oak trees around my house commune with me when I'm stoned on edibles. 

The first time it happened I became an oak, transported into its body, and became impossibly long and my fingers stretching and my toes stretching into the dirt and wiggling with all the other organisms below the surface, and all the rushing of fluids up and down my middle section. Then the oak became me and was surprised at how *hot* and mobile and stumpy my body was, and the weird head thing on top of my shoulders =) 

They told me that they miss the connection between people and oaks - when the people took care of the oaks by burning and tending and the oaks fed the people. We don't have that connection any more. That people are animals so we DO things, whereas the oaks provide food and talk to all the organisms below and above ground and create the community of life. 

They said that to the rest of the community of life it's like humans are at an exciting party but we're in the corner with our face to the wall pretending that we're the only ones here and everyone else (not human) thinks that's pretty sad. 

They said humans are like children running around with matches that are going to burn down the house we all live in. They said that we shouldn't think of all the life on the planet as this species or that species but as a entire single organism surrounding the globe, interconnected and interdependent. 

Sometimes when I'm high I become aware that the molecules they're breathing out are getting into my lungs, making up part of my body and vice versa.

Topics such as projected line ups, how to get tickets, discussion of obvious transfer targets, opinion posts such as ""Here's what I think of player X"", or simple questions like ""What do you think of player X"" tend to fall into this category.

While we don't have a problem with people posting their opinions occasionally, we ask that some effort be put into the posts so the sub isn't overrun with ""Here's a thought I just had"" type posts. For example, a post saying about a potential transfer target that includes a statistical break down of the target as well as similar type players, would probably be left up, while a post that simply states, ""I think we should buy player X"" might be removed.

Our goal with this is to ensure that Chelsea news is not drowned out by repetitive questions as well as ensuring that discussion on certain topics does not end up split across multiple threads.

If your post is removed for this reason, we ask that you use the search to find previous posts where this topic was discussed or post your opinion in the ""Daily Discussion Thread"" which gets posted daily.",1696118492.0

And NO I had no idea that there are cultures that hold the wide-spread belief that people have the power to manipulate animals! That's fascinating. I certainly wouldn't rule it out personally. I can imagine it plays an important role in your culture in a number of ways. 

Out of curiosity, I'm curious what country you are from? Or if you're more comfortable to share at least what continent / subcontinent?",1696118492.0

"marketing","t5_2qhmg","Course 2 if you want to go in to the deep end with academics, research and generally knowing how to figure things out by yourself and realizing that knowing shit is hard, aka no google, reddit or linkeidn or even AI for your marketing strategy advice.

Course 1 if you want to know what others have found and how to best use it, quick and painless like. Likely still would use Google, LinkedIn and reddit for advice anyway and assume AI just knows shit right out the bat about your specific customer base.


If you choose 2nd one, you will likely turn in to a pessimist, seeing how hard it is to actually know wtf is going on with peolpe. Bussineses generally see negative ppl as lunatics anyway so you might end up teaching the next generation lunatics yourself. You will become elitist at some point and love every minute of it because the other cool marketing guys can't tell when to use qualitative and quantitative data, they will often pick a number and claim they know everything there is to know about that old 58 y/o woman who is, based on their segmentation, just an old woman who likes to spend her money on candy, then assuming she just loves candy.

If you choose 1st one, you will be loved by everyone. You will know how to use data to make things look nice, some marketing jargon to keep everyone on their toes in meetings. You will make pretty things and awesome content for the ""right"" people. But you will never be able to find out if what you did was mere chance ocourance or if it was your skill that made it happen. This will lead you to an average life of a marketing professional who gets reprimanded for doing something wrong (even though it was not their fault) while the lucky ones whose shit worked 50/50 get higher up the career ladder. You will hate sales and love every hard working marketing professional because you know how hard it is, and sales is just marketing for 1 person at a time anyway. You might even get a CEO position if you are positive throughout your career and are lucky enough to not get a dick of a boss. You will then spen most of your time at events, talking your ass off and making connections at the dinner tables with simmilar people like you. And you will likely have a son named Leonidas just because you are on a different income bracket than the rest of the marketers who were just shit at their job.",1696118493.0

But I've been specific to only buy (the much better!!) agnostic accessories, i.e. Sony XM4, Fitbit, etc. The Sony headphones / earphones in particular are WILDLY better than AirPods, I don't know why this isn't talked about more. I guess kids and footballers walking around with them \*\*constantly\*\* in ear validates their usability? I don't know...

Anyway, I am actually going all-out here and saying with 100% unbias that I truly believe Apple's benchmarks are cheated, or at least I believe that they specifically engineer the SoC to process exact Geekbench calculations as they are predictably executed. I have a Galaxy S23+ right now and it is ridiculously faster than even the iPhone 15 Pro Max, that I just had delivered. The only thing iPhones are faster at is photo and video editing, where it is miles ahead.

I want to return it and get a Pixel Fold, but I'm curious to wait for the next gen model. IMO the form factor appears to be miles better than the Galaxy Z Fold series, and additionally the hate that Tensor G2 gets about being too hot or too slow, I'm finding hard to believe, but just based on my experience with Exynos and Snapdragon phones previously, as above.",1696118493.0

Kind of fell off when we both stopped watching YouTube for a second. I remember the Shane Dawson doc on her and he showed her house and wealth. She never showed anywhere besides her bathroom in videos. She'd do her fashion or shoe videos at abandoned places to go with the spooky vibes. 

When I saw it I was shocked. Of course she'd make tonnes of money on YouTube, she was killing it for a while! It was just a shock to see all the cars and size of the place. I was glad she kept it all hidden on video though because it made her more trustworthy since she wasn't flexing constantly. 

After the doc I think I remember she got into veery hot water because she went to Starbucks and they wouldn't give her a free refill ( I'm not in America so I don't know their policy but they don't do that here) and she bitched about it and cried on camera like someone killed her dog. People, knowing he was clearly rich, called her out like gurl...you can pay the $5 for coffee.

"dating","t5_2qhb1","For me, it depends on what mood I'm in. I usually only want casual sex if I'm going through a period where I think I'm not going to find the type of woman that I want a long-term relationship with. It's the ""I want someone else, but I'll be with you, if only for the night,"" sort of mentality. The last woman did get a clear discussion about what I was looking for from her, because the woman before her didn't seem to understand what I wanted when I said I wanted to date her, and I felt guilty. I wasn't thinking about anything long term, but she ghosted me two days after. I never really got an explanation from her that made sense to me, because she went from talking about having sex with me and how we were fine when I talked to her the day after, to ghosting me, and finally to sending me angry text messages three months later, saying that she ghosted because she was angry with me for the way I ""acted the last time we hung out."" I felt so guilty about it that I went through every imaginable reason in my head before I finally just decided to let it go and be clearer with the next woman. It turned out that next woman was using me to cheat on someone, so...eh. I still know that what I want most is a lifetime with my best friend and lover, who has values, goals, and interests that align with mine, who pushes me when I need to be pushed, who pulls me back when I need to be reigned in, who gets my jokes and references, and who is her own person, yet makes me feel like I am looking in the mirror. I also don't really feel like I really know where to go from here. I guess you could say that I'm just waiting. Maybe you should start doing the same thing. While you're okay with one night stands, you also want someone who doesn't get tired of you after they fuck you three times. Maybe they're afraid of catching feelings.",1696118494.0

She just drops everything where it‚Äôs convenient and never picks it up and puts it away. (Unless she has to clean for some particular reason - a lot then just gets thrown into a box).

We have boxes of both our stuff in the garage and I think if mine are still there, I can convince her to keep some of hers there.

Your SIM could be 3G/4G, if so it's bottlenecked at 3G speeds when using 4G. You can get a free SIM replacement from your network although IMO they're cunts with their proofs (like taking a photo of you, serious).

Your MiFi could also be a 3G/4G device, similar rule applies. Get a 4G/5G off Amazon. 

There's also other bottlenecks, like the WiFi standard has come a long way in the last 5 years. We're on WiFi 7 now I think, which is IEEE 802.11ax in English, so if your chip is older than that then it can't support faster speeds, higher throughput, and wider bandwidth. WiFi chips are cheap and easy to install. Dongles are shit, especially if they're not USB3.2 and multilane, and of course the female USB has to match, as does all the other hardware you have between the internet and the OSI layer 8 input (your eyes).

The trouble with your attitude is that you think this is something you get to have a say in, or society gets to have a say in.

You don't.

The market does.

Some of the comments I see treat all jobs as if they are equally facile - and all you need is some warm body sat there turning a handle.

You simply cannot think in terms of acheivement and excellence.

Why on earth would the brightest and best engineers want to go work at some company when the person next to them who does fuck all is getting paid the same?

Talented people want to be around talented people. Companies want people who fit their roles.

You don't get to sit there and play dollies with society because you have a child's understanding of the workplace, and justice.

Woudn't it be better if all people were paid the same for the same role?

Why not?

Why stop there? why should one job be paid better than another?

Are your ten hour days pissing around with Powerpoint really more valuable than some guy crawling around the sewers excavating calcified wet-wipes?

Why should you get paid more than him?

So then lets pay everyone the same and see where that ends up... or we can just remember what happened last time we tried it.",1696118495.0

It‚Äôs valuable in the emotional sense: it gives you something that can‚Äôt be explained easily. 
It is a piece of history: 
how many things found in a museum do you think are valuable in the utilitarian sense? A pair of rusty old shoes, for example, wouldn‚Äôt do anyone any good, yet they would be considered far more valuable than say, a pair of functional rubber boots bought recently. Both items belong to the same category, but the boots within the museum are representational of a different time as well as having other factors making them much more rare.
In the instance of this tree it would most likely be its position along Hadrians wall, its involvement in a classic movie, as well as the scarcity of older trees in general nowadays in many areas. It‚Äôs also a tourist site if I remember correctly, but I may be mistaken.

In my opinion I come from poverty and many of us are having access to parrots because they are widely bred now and available. People in poverty deal with a variety of bad mental health...that is exactly why we are in the situation we are in. For people like us we have things thay keep us going, like animals to love and care for. Like homeless people having a dog with them. We aren't able to take care of them from financial stability or having the right mind to know everything to prevent any tragedies because we are busy dealing with shit while having something to keep us going. But it's obvious we are trying our best especially going out of the way to be here on reddit and find the right answers.

"UnethicalLifeProTips","t5_3cx36","This works pretty much anywhere outdoors. 

I was mushroom hunting with a buddy several years back near the watershed that provides drinking water to my town/10s of thousands of people. The watershed is protected from trespassing by a massive fine. My buddy and I were looking for mushrooms on the side of the road that acts on the border (literally theres signs all over one side saying there's a fine for trespassing/even being on one side that was $200+) we were on the legal side, legitimately looking for mushrooms. I grabbed a grocery bag to pick up all the empty beer cans/garbage from the trashy folks that enter the woods near where I live. 30 minutes after we started walking around, picking up trash as we went, a law enforcement ranger rolled up to talk to us. Granted, we were following all laws, but he could have assumed we were up to jo good and cited us. Once he saw the bag of trash in my hand he was instantly at ease and offered to haul it away for us. No harm came from it and it was a positive experience overall.

Protip: Going out in the woods? Clean up trash as you go. Run into law enforcement or a landowner and want to get on their good side instantly? Show you've been trying to clean up as you go. Theres so many dirtbags that dump trash and disrespect nature. People will notice you're there for a good reason.

 I worked in the wilderness several years later and no matter how remote I worked, there was always trash to be found. Ever seen a faded pull tab beer can? I have several times and those haven't been made for decades before I was born. Trash is EVERYWHERE in the wilderness and the person who is going to ticket you, arrest you, yell at you or worse are generally also people that are out there because they love the outdoors.",1696118496.0

"whiskey","t5_2r06y","Not sure what you expected? Whiskey drinking isn't a science as much as it is an art. And like with many artistic interpretations fro. Critics, the aesthetician appreciation will differ between individuals. Usually only the very best of the best are what universally will be acclaimed and the very worst of the worst will be turned down.

I'm sure you really enjoy what you drink. That's great. It suits you pallete, and isn't that all that matters? Most likely it was never going to be the very best of the best where everyone trying it would give it rave reviews. Be happy that one of your fans wasn't turned down outright by everyone. Means you have a great drink that matches well with your pallete. Yay.

Also, tasting nodes are completely subjective. You do realize that leather, tobacco, various fruits, caramel, and spices aren't actually added to the whiskey? I know you know this, but the flavors we do associate come from our brain trying its hardest to take what it smells and associate it with something from our past. That something of course will very based on experiences. Honestly, what does it matter that there's no consistency in the smelling and tasting? I promise that what you taste and smell isn't the same as what I'd experience. Doesn't mean your experience is invalidated any more than mine. 

So, back to your point about whats the point in taking stock in online reviewers. I agree that many reviews won't be terribly helpful, except if you are trying to avoid bad brands/ experiences. If you want great experiences, then they are helpful there too, as you'd at least know what bottles have earned more unanimity among the tasters. Amd of you just want something good, then you know that the bottles that get mixed reviews, like your favorite, some good, most average, but all positive, well that gives you a point t of reference to try that new bottle.",1696118496.0

If ur listening to music, make sure u listen to music that doesn‚Äôt distract u ( abit guilty lah, i listen to kpop while doing maths bc i needed that energy boost.üíÄ) btw, if u have a school library, u should try studying there instead of the public library. During my time, i use to study at the school library after school because it was daaaamn empty, no one goes there unless got some consultation stuff. If u can‚Äôt concentrate for a long period of time, try using the pomodoro method. 25 min study, 3-5 min break, then continue the cycle. Assuming ur prelims went bad, remind urself that olevel is the chance for u to redeem urself. If ur results for prelims were good, remind urself that this isn‚Äôt the time to slack, whatever u get for prelims doesn‚Äôt 100% cnfm what u will get for olevels. For me also, when i got my prelims results, i was stunned to see i just pass my maths LOLLL, anyways i started to panic after that, my teacher told me to study at least minimum 2 hrs of maths a day, i‚Äôm not a big fan of maths, so everyday was a torture for me to sit and do it. But i remind myself, it‚Äôll be over soon and I don‚Äôt want to end up regretting later during results day.

"Starfield","t5_3g41m","This. I love the game but the creation engine really shows its cracks in 2023. I'm a realistic person and rate games based on a variety of components, graphics, audio, gameplay, mechanics and narrative. docked it two points from Starfield for two reasons.

The first was graphical. On console the game was restricted to 30fps to enable a 4k resolution. The problem is the game cannot maintain both, and I personally feel that if it can't maintain either, there should have been a performance mode.

The second is mechanics. Starfield has so many awesome systems but they are not fleshed out. For example you can have a brig on your ship but you cannot bring in bounties alive. Or my personal pet peeve being smuggling, there is no financial benefit to smuggling past authorities that scan your ship vs offloading contraband on a station or planner without scanners.

Again. Starfield is awesome and it is my favourite game of all time. I can't wait to see how the official expansions flesh out the game systems further.",1696118497.0

That was the only catch in the match. The catches are like points in One's ruleset and they're only given for strong submission attempts. In the match, Kelly had 1 catch for the toehold attempt & Khan didn't get any.  So Kelly won 1-0.

Kelly also did a good job using the cage to her advantage defensively to pin Khan and restrict her hip movement for most of the match. Which I think is why Khan wasn't able to score at all.",1696118497.0

It's not for everyone, but when done correctly it can dramatically improve the body's ability to heal and repair. The idea is that healthy cells and healthy mitochondria can survive this hardship but unhealthy tissue cannot. There's a lot of autophagy on a dry fast.

And the low PUFA diet is my attempt to get closer to an ancestral diet. I was struggling with too much fatigue and brain fog when my polyunsaturated fat intake was high. In a modern world it's high because of seed oils and grain fed animal fat, neither of which was present while humans were evolving.",1696118497.0

"armenia","t5_2qo29","I dissected both of your comments but for some reason they were deleted and I don‚Äôt have the energy to rewrite it. I‚Äôll respond in shorter form:

Both of your comments dismiss my entire analysis without any counter-points to add and insinuate that I‚Äôm somehow a ‚ÄúRussian propagandist‚Äù because I have a nuanced opinion. For some reason, anyone that doesn‚Äôt lick the west‚Äôs feet is some sort of Russian 5th columnist‚Ä¶

Not that I have anything to prove to you, but you don‚Äôt know me whatsoever. I have NEVER supported Kocharyan. I‚Äôve criticized Kocharyan since the day I read about his policies for making Armenia more dependent on Russia during his incumbency. And I am also of the belief that he and RF probably had a hand in the 1999 parliament shooting (not 1998; do your research before criticizing someone) that killed Vazgen and Karen (who I also believe were the most patriotic leaders Armenia ever had after independence). To that point, you don‚Äôt KNOW what stance or steps Vazgen and Karen would have taken for the benefit of Armenia if they were still alive. To claim otherwise is literal guesswork.

And your remark about the US hindering Turkish invasion in the 90s (citation needed) is baseless. Whether you want to admit it or not, whether it was based on NATO‚Äôs call or on turkey‚Äôs call independently, Russian presence in Armenia stopped turkish invasion to avoid a larger military action from Russia. Yes, obviously times have changed. Not sure what issue you take with people changing their opinion. Or do you place benefit to the west above benefit to Armenia? Because both back then and now, Armenia‚Äôs natural interests are adverse to the west.

I‚Äôm not ‚Äúpro-Russian‚Äù or ‚Äúpro-Iranian‚Äù or ‚Äúpro-Western‚Äù or ‚Äúpro-Martian.‚Äù I‚Äôm pro-Armenian. That‚Äôs it. Next time you have something to say, you can respond to me directly and counter my points politely. If you believe the West is a better option than Iran at the present time, then back up your argument with facts. Otherwise, comments like yours are basically the Armenian version of McCarthyism.",1696118497.0

I would try to make your milk slightly thinner (less time aerating) and fill the cup less before pouring the initial winged base. This will help you make the design wrap better and gives you room for more layers. Also try to focus on moving the pitcher towards the back of the cup more as you wiggle to make your winged base.

It just has to be a few simple words spoken to somebody in the correct circumstances, under the right conditions, by somebody who is capable of judging the students condition and knowing when these words are applicable, that will trigger a change. If people all already knew those words, they would be robbed of their power. Those words will trigger the appropriate response only when the conditions are right for the student to receive them. I have experienced something like this myself, from somebody who was the closest thing to a spiritual teacher I have ever met. This man would make observations about my condition that were undeniably true, and obvious, and I felt like if I just thought about it for five more minutes, I would have seen how true and obvious they were. But also, it's entirely possible it may have taken me another 20 years to figure it out for myself, if I ever did.

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","It comes down to the difference in design templates between web2 and web3 products. Web2 has everything in walled gardens, with *some* interoperability (ie. everything is its own space, but you can navigate between them and, where designed for, share some functionality/assets). Web3 is built with interoperability as part of its foundation - walled gardens being optional, but existing within metaverses with a common codebase. In theory, developers building on a given metaverse could have native interoperability with *every other product* built on it; the metaverse serves in similar fashion to a geographical continent, with all traffic on it being able to move and take their assets freely (within reason) from space to space.

Using your example, ubisoft doesn't have to spend money to honour someone playing a character from a different franchise in web3; just building in, say, ImmutableX or Loopring's metaverse potentially guarantees that anything with similar graphic quality can host their assets with minimal work on their end. *Maybe* a whitelist to avoid truly stupid shit/NSFW assets from getting in.

Obviously, not every AAA studio *will* utilise that functionality - hence walled gardens still being possible - but if it's baked in from the ground up, everyone has the choice.",1696118498.0

I want to say first before anything, this entire situation is on the owner for having a breed that needs specific things and not doing them, and also acting like it‚Äôs no big deal. It IS a big deal. Mouthiness needs to be addressed and kept up with consistently and they clearly don‚Äôt do that. They also clearly have no enrichment for the dogs. Snuffle mars and puzzle bowls would be great for them.

Anyways, I‚Äôm not going to say you‚Äôre not ‚Äúcut out for the job‚Äù based on this one situation. This is a tough one that would have had me grinding my teeth, and I specialize in these types of dogs. I also have lifelong husky experience. Not everyone can handle every breed, or larger dogs. For now, maybe stick with smaller and medium sized dogs so you don‚Äôt get taken advantage of- cause that‚Äôs what the puppy was doing. To him, you were like a new dog introduced to the house meaning he‚Äôs gotta not only be all over you, but show you he was there first. Large dogs can and will take advantage of people, I see it at work all the time. We have a gigantic doodle that is a spoiled brat and has tried biting everyone but me, and has even pinned people. He‚Äôs the sweetest fluff when it‚Äôs just me, him and the other dogs with no other people. So you CAN still do the job, just protect you self and have boundaries and always meet first. And ask ALL of the questions. 

Sometimes you can get owners to tell on themselves in these situations 
‚ÄúHas your dog ever bitten before?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, but he can get nippy when playing‚Äù
‚ÄúDoes he play rough?‚Äù
‚ÄúWith dogs yes‚Äù

There can be some crime and disturbances if you aren't careful where you choose.   I just took a look at zillow to see rentals listed and it seems prices are getting pretty high in the area from what I expected.  Gautier is a bit quieter than Pascagoula and is just to the west of the shipyard.  Oceans Springs is a bit nicer than Pascagoula and Gautier and is right across the river from Biloxi.  That's still only about a 15 or 20 min drive to the shipyard.  If you start looking for places and any questions about the area feel free to reach out and I can give you opinions.  I used to rent a duplex from a family friend in Moss Point.  I haven't reached out to the lady who owns it in about a year.  It's my grandmother's friend and my grandmother passed away but if you'd like me to ask if it's available I wouldn't mind.  It would probably be a lot cheaper than alternatives and it's in a nice neighborhood on a scenic road.  It's a small 2 bedroom with a garage between the main home and the segregated apartment.

>    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
>    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
>    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
>    *[META] - Description*

Reality, and facts, have a bias towards progressive policies. 

Conservatives don't like that so they retreat to news that will lie to them.

"Flooring","t5_2sm23","Adding padding to that area would work, it just would need to be secured to the subflooring, staples do the trick.  
They will pull it back up, which should not be too hard at all seeing there are bubbles (means it is super loose since its new carpet).  They will be able to fold the carpet back over itself, its pliable, install the tack strip, which SHOULD hold the carpet around the vent in place.  If it doesn't, make sure they staple the carpet to that tack strip, so it doesn't pull off.  Any little divots from the staples will be covered by the vent cover.  If even that doesnt work, they will have to seam carpet to that area to patch that hole out, then stretch it, then recut your vent hole.  
Its fixable, but by not doing the job right the first time, they definitely made some work for the next guys.  Assuming they send a competent crew this next time around, it shouldnt be too difficult of a fix in all reality.  Just do not let them send the same crew, frankly they need to be trained or finding other employment.  
If they refuse to actually rectify the situation, contact the carpet manufacturer and have them come look at the job, they will see the bubbles amongst all the other errors, and go after the store/installers.  The manufacturers have regulations/expectations that installers must follow, otherwise it is on the installer to rectify it (new carpet, reinstall/pay for another crew's fees, etc)..

"Stellaris","t5_39cuc","Stellaris is one of my favorite 4x games ever.   


My hot takes: 

* The learning curve in Stellaris is probably too steep for most players (though most Paradox games are like that) 
* Stellaris is mostly an economic management game. 
* Most wars in Stellaris are uncompetitive and one-sided, but competitive ones can be a blast and very satisfying
* I miss victory conditions in Stellaris. What was wrong with controlling 40% of the planets? 
* The UI in Stellaris turns into a frustrating mess once you have more than 20 or so planets. It's just not built for that.  I have no idea how players have the patience to manage 100+ planet empires. It's not that I can't do it, it's why would I want to? It becomes such a chore.
* Some player love huge galaxies in Stellaris, but I generally avoid them like a disease. 
* The automation systems can cut out out a lot of the busywork of playing the Stellaris, but I don't use it. 
* I do love how broad and unpredictable Stellaris can be.  An Inward Perfection neighbor is nothing like a Fanatic Purifier neighbor.  Having a single exit home cluster is nothing like having a triple exit home cluster.  You can go from peace and prosperity to fighting for your life. Strategic adaptability is more important than other games.
* Is Stellaris balanced? No. Is it fun? Yes.",1696118502.0

Also, most of her cringy behavior (it wasn't even that cringy... it was just a few bad jokes and some bad dancing on SNL) was because she was feeling suicidal at the time, as we now know, and it's really so unsettling how publications picked up on that and decided to exacerbate it by convincing everyone that she was an artist with no talent, no substance, and no clue how to be a pop star. Doing that YouTube livestream was fucking *genius* because it's the only thing that made audiences observe her as an individual with their own eyes, and that stopped the media from being able to run with whatever fake narrative they wanted about her.

The angry leftists who hate both political parties 

>What sort of evidence makes you think that? 

No real evidence other than the shit I hear in leftists circles 

>You use the modifier ""too"". That implies you agree with the notion that maga/right-wing extremists would like a civil war. Do you think that?

That's basically what they want, or at least a political coup. 

>I cannot begin to explain how deeply absurd I think your statement is. I'm certain there are some extreme-leftists somewhere itching for a fight but they sure as shit aren't voting for Biden and probably don't vote at all.

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It‚Äôs not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

How I folded clothes, made my bed, hovered, cleaned the bathroom, drying dishes. Everything was apparently wrong. .

"castlevania","t5_2ss33","My bad, I meant Tzuentes (Drolta) but got autocorrected to Terra.

Olrox feels redundant since we know Bathory is insane and the cycle of vengance arc is slapdashed together too. I agree the booty call for Mizrak & Olrox was weird, especially on how much of a zealot they made Mizrak out to be until the last 2 eps. Sure hypocrisy of the church is subversive but it felt like they were running on three different scripts with that relationship. Outside of being a wannabee Puss in Boots Death for Richter, he's a plot contrivance at best and just another sad gay Ann Rice knockoff/stereotype at worst which is another step down from their writing on gay characters like Issac and even Alucard (though that relationship was shlocky too).

First time was Richter telling Maria not to go off verbally half-cocked to the Abbot, supposedly showing she has self control and isn't a spunky girlboss stereotype...Which she pratfalled straight into. Then as Richter said, they needed a plan but then went in cocksure and blew it with Annette's emotions which felt weird since Maria should of just uses her summons to scout ahead but stay quiet. I know some people would say she's torn up about her bird's death but she gets over it fairly quickly and is back to slinging them wily nily next ep and honestly a scout would prevent bloodshed. Terra was the only one with a plan, using the secret passageway to the church but later on Maria recklessly goes to the Abbot alone and gets captured. It's the same rush into danger problem they keep whining about but never learn from over 8 episodes. Sure this can be fixed in a Season 2 but plots like this wear themselves out by Ep 3 to 4 at best.

The blushing/near kiss was tacked on because it was rushing way past flirting when neither gave those hints, especially when doing it in the last 2 eps. I had to rewatch 2-5 to see if I missed something because it felt like they cut content to get them to that point.
I think the problem is that by adding Annette & even Eduoard, they stretched themselves thin for time as it feels like this should of been a 12 cour or at least have each ep be an hour long to better develop each character.",1696118506.0

And so we get a studio, announcing in earnest about the most popular franchise in the world with fans who've watched the original trilogy a zillion times, that ""We want to remind audiences of the magic of Star Wars""and then releasing a dull, soft reboot, where even even the most enthusiastic SW fans saying they don't want the whole trilogy being a soft reboot...

It just dissolves in water, and is sucked into the fishes gills, vs being taken orally. We can just take these orally..from what I understand, its fine. This is all coming YEARS after having a huge argument with a friend for using fish mox this way. But its something you can use while you wait to see a doctor. As long as your dr knows you used it, its basically okay.  Illegal but okay.

"tarot","t5_2qhu4","""Interpreting cards"" doesn't mean ""making stuff up.""  
Let's take the Lenormand Coffin. I've chosen that one to get away from the goop that's been imposed on the Tarot Death card in recent times. People like to say that one is ""transformation."" Dead things do transform, but they don't turn into butterflies. They rot. When you decide that a card is both butterflies and death, it becomes useless. That's probably why people think they have to make stuff up.  
The Coffin is a permanent ending. It's also a card of sickness. So if you get Ring-Coffin-Heart, the connection signified by the ring is severed. The Heart is also affected. It becomes ill, ""heartsick"" over the loss of the Ring card. All of this is ***objective***.

I don't think it's particularly strange though - they don't think the Lego scale is suitable to act as an artistic medium, that something different is required for that purpose. Presumably enough other people agree that they've carved out a successful business from it, so seems to me it was a sound choice.

We can't even get a system based on insurance right either.  Go private and the gaps widen even further.  Why, because you can't insure yourself for what practitioners will eventually demand.

"Dublin","t5_2r1hz","Maybe so. I've just turned 33 and I live a lonely life. People are with their partners and/or their kids. People that aren't in long-term relationships are sleeping around with casual partners.

People that aren't hooking up with partners - like myself - spend a lot of time alone, this is the way its been for years and it gets more and more like this as the years go by. 

In my own life it seems to be panning out as such:
I find there's just no one really around ever. The sparse few friends that I stay in touch with, I really only check-in with them once every couple of months for chats on WhatsApp or phone calls. I meet them maybe 2 - 3 times a year and it has to be done by appointment and booked long in advance because of their busy lives.

The vibe is almost like ""people have grown out of hanging out on short notice and going for a round of pints on a weeknight."" I use the term ""grown out of"" because it feels like I've been left behind and not progressed into the stage of life involving partners.

I used to go for pints by myself but I don't do that as much anymore because as I age I'm more wrecked by hangovers. I have more responsibility with my job, I can't afford to have beer grog on the job all the time. My age makes it less excusable to get goosed and if I get goosed by myself at the bar there's no one my age hanging around any more. So the whole pub thing is not there for me as much any more, and in Ireland that's one of our main social hubs.

I find as I age its harder to click with people, and I think its because people are more closed up, which is fine. I think people have their ""tribes"" formed so to speak, by the time their grown up, and the door to new tribes is kind of shut. People stick to their own crew, people that come from the same background as themselves, people that share those strong things in common. That's just human nature I think. I personally find, being alone a lot and hanging around looking for new connections, people can be suspicious of you, its like ""who is this guy and why does he not have any friends? He doesn't have a partner. Those things are missing from his life, something is amiss, let's be wary of him."" 

Like other people here I've tried the MeetUp app and tried loads of different things, but I just haven't clicked with anyone. People can be nice and all that, but I've personally just found it hard to click with people on it, and I've found many meetups just aren't my cup of tea to be honest.

In short I think yeah, life does become more lonely as you get older. If your someone that can have partners that can really cushion the blow and maybe dissolve the loneliness of adulthood, but if you're one of the many that can't match on a dating app and can't hope for picking someone up at a bar, then I think loneliness is most certainly par for the course.

Most of the complains and rants that i have seen on this subreddit are true, the game just feels half baked, there is lots of things that makes the game feel very unfinished.

Maybe Bethesda will improve it with the next updates or dlcs, they have a plan or want to have a plan for the years to come.

Still that doesn't change the fact that the game feels poorly done at this moment.

Yes you can do lots of things right now but there is equally many bad things, some old game mechanics their games like Fallout 4 and now Starfield makes you you feel youre playing a 2011 game with pretty graphics.

Comparing it with other RPG AAA titles of course it will leave you with a damn bad taste, paying a full priced game just so the game to be the pure barebones because what make the game special will be the next dlc and mods so at this very moment you're playing a half done game.",1696118512.0

"kundalini","t5_2rezq","Perhaps everything. But slowly and over time. Sometimes I could be doing a mundane task and like washing the dishes and have an earth shattering realisation, but for the most part it feels like it is clearing old junk out. Fears anxieties anger  guilt resentment the desire to ruminate no longer haunt me. I can feel the same energy but it doesn‚Äôt stay in that part of me, it keeps moving. 

Another example was an inability to visualise in my mind (making WLP difficult). This was from puberty, and strange, since as a child i would have both vivid and lucid dreams. I don‚Äôt dream like I used to but i can visualise better now. 

I can dance again. I feel more creative, less reactive. Sexually more in tune with myself and my wife. 

To me it feels like the sensations (be it discomfort, pain, pleasure, muscular contraction, kriyas) are sign posts the energy is bringing to my attention. Trying to ignore it, fight it or keep it there (if the sensation is pleasurable) is not helpful. Personally I find it more helpful to recognise it, talk to it and relax into to it so it can do what it needs to and eventually the energy shifts? Or releases? I‚Äôm not sure how to describe it but it moves. And that‚Äôs cool üòé",1696118512.0

Sorry yall wanted to try and come up with a new way to distinguish between 2d standard def  and 3d stard def  to 2d HD and 3d HD  wouldnt it be cool add tbe series x and xbox digitial into a new category of large console along with ps3 ps4  ps5 xbox360 and xboxone that use HDD 3d graphics. Adding the extra D to HD but it could be referred to as large console.  

Then start the whole new line of mini classic  console that have live and online plus new features. And old throwbacks. TRANSPARENT CONSOLES HEADSETS CONTROLLERS. Cause new consoles suck as far as over all looks. The new atari 2600 has internet capabilities and uses a xbox style atari controller thats all new and they also make all their old controllers again. Atari was still being made in the 90s people if they made a new system a few years ago and has internet  comeome big big names of today and not so long ago nintendo  or nintendo64 and sega arent that old right now in this day in time and would be cool to bring bac the old consoles of that time period and so they all are here again for awhile once more and who knows how long.

"AncientGreek","t5_2qwux",">Are there any major points of contention in scholarship regarding the pronunciation of Classical Greek?

There are many dialects from many different times and places. There is no consensus about whether to use restored or Erasmian. Restored pronunciation can't be completely reconstructed for a given time and place. Erasmian is actually a lot of different systems that differ between countries. You can find lots of recordings on youtube by professional classicists or well-informed amateurs, and if you listen to them, you don't really find any two people who pronounce every phoneme alike. Some people use tonal accents, others use stress accents. Some people observe the distinction between long and short vowels, others do so only in poetry, others never. Some people pronounce omega and omicron identically, similar to a Californian ""o."" Some people do omicron more open than omega, while others do omega more open and omicron. Similar issues for epsilon/eta.

If you want to hear pronunciations by some people who are experts and nevertheless don't pronounce their phonemes alike, here are some examples. E.g., I think you can find every possibility for omicron/omega among these.

"PoliticalScience","t5_2r16u","'Socialism' can mean a lot of different things - Marx first conceived of it as an intermediary mode between revolution and communism. In Marx's conception of socialism, everything is owned by a strong state (which is run by the workers), and communism is reached when the voluntary dissolution of that state occurs (hence why the USSR was socialist and not communist - they never reached communism)

All of this is to say that using the term 'socialism' obscures away from engaging seriously with thinking about a post-capitalist world. The term is so broad it can't actually mean anything - I might imagine you are referring to Marx's conception, and you might have something totally different in mind.

Now, if you chose some obscure team from the other side of the world, you could argue it's virtue signalling or whatever. I would still maintain it's within your rights. But, if you choose to support a foreign team because you like them and the way they play, who cares. Just don't jump the ship when things go awry. And actually, I have been to a Real Madrid match just this year. Won't name which one to avoid doxxing myself, but I in Spain at the time, so I took the opportunity and saw the game with my own eyes. And hell, will it be a memory for a lifetime.

And the old way had a bunch of problems with its shot conversion percentages, such as needing 3 goals from every 10 shots, which is asking a lot when the best strikers are ones who generate enough chances that the ones they spurn don't matter, and can get away with a high rate of wastage.

How is ""score 5 bicycle kicks or else"" an improvement over ""score 15 anyway you feel like"" even with the shot conversion idiocy?

Should there not be a push for freedom in the ways that you score? Possibly a minor bonus for trying different things, such as a finesse heavy player hitting a volley for the first time?

Can this at least be more geared to positive reinforcement and goodies, instead of focusing on what happens if you don't do it?",1696118516.0

Outwardly acknowledge the issues but don't go out of you way to have meetings with the Negative Nancy there--those will only make you feel miserable.

If your supervisor is like some people I know, their ""criticism"" is less about helping you turn in better work, and more about making themselves feel better by bringing you down. **Don't give them opportunities to do so.** Keep your interactions with them to a minimum.

If you trust the quality of your work--and you keep getting vague responses to questions--then have faith in yourself and assume that your supervisor's criticisms are wrong and/or irrelevant. 

If they are *this* harsh towards your work, you'll likely get fired anyway, and you *don't* need extra meetings to make you falsely feel like a failure on top of that.

In short: your supervisor is wrong, not you. Even if their criticisms are legitimate, their approach is so hostile that their criticisms aren't useful. 

You are good at your job and knowledgeable in your field. Surround yourself with people who acknowledge this and ignore those who seek to take that from you.",1696118517.0

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","People always get heavily downvoted when they ask about changing the rules in this sub. I don't agree with it, but it is what it is.

But to your main question, yes PF2e absolutely is meant to have a sort of ""anime style"" power scaling as characters level up. It's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. A level 10 character is effectively expected to be a low level super hero and would absolutely just be better than a common level 1 scholar. (But also for context, a scholar who had spent so long training in something to be an expert should probably be around level 5 anyway, not level 1.)

That said I wouldn't consider PWL more realistic on its own either. The problem with low modifiers on d20 rolls is that now you get stuff like the dumb barbarian succeeding on a knowledge check that the expert scholar failed in, just because of the d20 roll. If you're going for a sense of realism in skill usage, I think you'll want to frequently gate checks behind proficiency level. Like ""you can only attempt this if you're trained"".",1696118517.0

In my town, unfortunately,  it was right wingers that organized to do this. They used it as an entry point to get a lot of civically minded concerned neighbors involved in local politics. Then they managed to build local political power in a pro policing, clean up our town agenda that quickly became hostile towards a lot of homeless people and young people. I wish that I had thought of doing such a thing but working with people to move in another direction. We have a very active community group organizing around housing from the liberal/left side as well, but we really made a mistake in ceding this ground to the right. Average apolitical people notice and understand litter pickup in a way that's more direct than changing housing code or needle exchange. I recommend people getting started doing this, it doesn't require much skill and it has potential beyond the obvious.",1696118517.0

"law","t5_2qh9k","I have been shot at. I have been robbed at gun point point times, both in retail AND, lmfao, doing pizza delivery. Shout out Indianapolis for being a waking horror. My house at 24th and Capitol was even hit with a stray bullet. During one particularly bad robbery, I got a concussion from the robbers that fucked up my education (going to school for math is hard when you are struggling with basic counting) and my hobbies (drumming is hard when the passage of time is bizarre and hard to grasp). I was very angry at them. 

I also acknowledge that them dying doesn't change anything.  It will not improve my circumstances. 

Dumb and VERY anecdotal, but a tale of two exes. Real, just fake names. 

A girl we will call Jolene cheated on me. That hurt a lot. She was cheated on later, it was brought to my attention thru the grapevine. I briefly felt a spiteful ""haha serves you right, you deserve it."" In the moment I thought that rage would feel good, but all it did was make me hate her more. 

A girl we will call Dolly left me for a friend of mine. Yikes, right? Maybe 3 years later I got a message out of the blue that was a sincere apology that took responsibility, a self-aware acknowledgement of why it was bad, and no expectation of forgiveness. That actually felt nice. I got some closure. In a weird twist of fate we are kind of friends now (this was 18 years ago). 

Career wise too, lmao, I also wasn't working shitty retail and food gigs barely making rent because I was thriving. ""I'm delivering pizzas in an area that doesn't tip because it's my passion. You know if you do what you love, you never work a day in your life!"" I was still getting help from my family to make rent even overworked. Car breaks down? Fuck. I can't afford that. 

Well imagine I don't have the luck of a family that can afford to toss me some coins when I'm unable to have total autonomy. I was already skipping meals, but if I was truly starving and didn't have the option to concede to my family ""hey I actually don't really have much grocery money this week."" 

I don't think anyone wants their career to be ""delivery driver robber."" Yes, since I was a boy I dreamed of stealing cell phones from T-Mobile. Just like my heroes. 

There's probably a desperation that lead them there and the other options also suck. Generally people's needs aren't being met and desperate times, desperate measures is the slogan of every generic shitty movie isn't it? We can factor in education and all kinds of circumstances but it's not ivy league campuses where these types of crimes are taking place. Downtown Indy wasn't affluence and high education. My fellow human beings, by most metrics, are consistently being failed by their representatives. I don't think pistols at dawn is going to make a dent in their desperation. 

So then your approach to US law is Americans should be constantly grievously wounded? I want to make certain I understand. Other countries, nuance and a path to redemption and self improvement. America, target practice.",1696118518.0

However, a good part of that fare covers dining as well, so I'm not completely on board (pun intended). 

Where they absolutely lose me is that they charge double for the ""all included"" package for solo travelers as well, unless you're in a solo cabin on the new ships. I'm trying to get a cruise booked in the spring for me and two friends (a married couple). Two cabins, one double occupancy, one solo.

Actual workplace democracy means that workers control the workplace, which cannot be true unless the worker owns the means of production. Not simply that those who work in a particular shop own the particular tools in that shop; it means that the categories of ‚Äúthose who use tools‚Äù and ‚Äúthose who decide how tools are used‚Äù must become categorically synonymous. *That* is the collective ownership that makes socialism separate from capitalism. It‚Äôs not a shared holding of the MoP as a commodity, but a more fundamental (revolutionary, even) shift in what it means to control the MoP. Control of the MoP should not be a commodity which can be traded as though it were a tangible thing, but a social consequence of using the MoP.",1696118521.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Ok, your families are super toxic. You're 20. You don't need to worry about kids. Even if you did want kids, you're 20. Your cerebral cortex hasn't finished developing yet. They need to let you have a life first. 

My husband and I also have chosen to be childless. I'm 37, and I've said I don't want kids since I was 16. So has my husband. So, I'm finally past the ""you'll change your mind"" stuff.

People do get uppity about it. 

Here's my theory, though. Mind you, it's just a theory, and I'm probably way off. Also, it's a theory that doesn't apply to all. Also, I'm still developing it, so hopefully, I can word it right.

I think a lot of people are parents but hate being parents. So, they are upset that you have chosen to be happy, unlike them. They feel that it's unfair that they are miserable and you aren't. 

The other is that some people have so little self-worth or substance that they can't imagine living without children. They need an identity and purpose somehow. 

My friends who like being parents in the healthy - wow, this is awesome, I'm glad I did this - and not the - omg, idk how I'd live without kids - unhealthy nonsense are totally understanding. Different things make different people happy. Those people also have something outside of reproduction to make them whole people. 

To clarify, I'm sure once someone has an individual child and gets to know them, it's hard to imagine life without them. But I mean, people who have no purpose without kids in general. I hope that makes sense. I love my husband, and I'd be crushed if I lost him now, but if I never met him, I'd be fine.

That's the kind of connections you are making and that's nothing short of nuts.

I'm not the one claiming things that aren't shown in the manga. If you're making wild claims then you are the one that has to prove it, and if you can't offer proof then you are the one that has no argument lol Good riddance.",1696118523.0
"electricvehicles","t5_2qwzm","The seven units/seven spaces math is really screwing you over. I think it's safe to assume you will always have *at least* seven cars (and someday they will all need charging). 

When you said 
>It‚Äôs a vacation town with tight spaces.

Did you mean just very *small* spaces or very **few**? What do you do when a resident has two cars? Is it rare for all seven units to be occupied at the same time? It has to happen *sometimes*. 

If you had even *one* extra space unassigned, I say put in a ""semi-public"" charger that you control the access/billing to (for just you seven) and call it a day. With your limited charging needs and cordial relationships, you could depend on the ""honor system"" for getting your charge when you need it. Opening it up to the general public would screw with that. 

You can still do that with just seven spaces, but it's going to be a little trickier. It will be more than just vacating the spot when you're done charging. The drivers of both cars (the one done charging and the one that needs charging) will both have to be there at the same time. 

I think you need to look further down then road and just bite the bullet and install chargers in all seven spots. You'll want that eventually and it will make selling your units easier in the future.",1696118523.0

When cheaters come into a game and effortlessly steal everything we work for, it cheapens all of our work to honestly earn the stuff. That means it steals the sense of gratification we would've gotten from that slow and steady climb so they can get a toybox of shit that they'll throw at their arse in two seconds because they didn't actually give a shit enough to work for it. Games rely on restrictions in order to create gratification. Look at the diff between the most popular minecraft mode, survival, and it's shittest mode, crative mode. You could work on your world for thousands of hours in survival mode and be enthralled and proud, but if you switched to creative after all that time and started spawning free stuff all over the place for yourself, it'd suddenly feel horrible to play that server anymore because the value of items wouldn't feel real.",1696118524.0

Either it'll be a point of issues between you later on if you don't convert or if you do convert he'll more than likely cherry pick which island elements he really requires you to follow based on his culture and not on his belief which will grow resentment between you guys.

Okay so in my work. Check me out at r/RingocrossStories there are a few major rules to ‚Äúfeeding‚Äù because I aim to make vampires come off as realistic as imaginable.
1. Vampires cannot just run amock feeding on whoever whenever. They have to use something called ‚Äúauthorized feeding zones‚Äù
2. Rich vampires can have there own private feeding session but no vampire can feed on humans of high social standing without consent. Imagine a vampire draining the life out of Donald Trump lol how do you get away with that‚Ä¶!
3. Vampire in my lore do not have to feed constantly like blood junkies like depicted in the movies. I mean how would that work in real life? They‚Äôd run through there supply and have no humans left. 
There is so much more‚Ä¶ such as how they‚Ä¶ you know what check this story out. This is one of my stories in audio adaptation:

Maybe I'm crazy but I enjoy being by myself or with some who's comfortable by themselves. Your dog is definitely enjoying the CBD. I started with gummies but I really didn't notice any difference to be honest with you. Pills are ok but I like control, some days a little more and some a little less. So I'm currently using tintures. 
If you are currently using CBD I would start lower and build your dosage up. I've tried many products but the 4500mg Super Spectrum does a great job. I'll take a half dropper in the morning and I feel calm all morning. If I feel anxious I'll take a little more. When I go to bed, I do a whole dropper and sleep right through the night without feeling groggy. They also have a great sleep tinture. Let me know what you think.

They literally didn't. Let's compare to pre-wipe how the game is TODAY: You can't get +3 all on anything (nothing legacy either). +2 is the limit and is only available on certain pieces such as weps / chests / legs. +weapon rolls are higher and more common, yet all weapons have had substantial +weapon damage nerfs so adding it to your stats doesn't bring you up nearly as high.

Today's 4k juice kit is yesterday's mid juice kit. They lowered the ceiling while also making blues with GODLY ROLLS (compared to pre-wipe) extremely common. I literally picked up +2all green heavy leather leggings from the merchant for 70g and resold for 200g seconds later.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

"JoeBuddenPodcasts","t5_3x92n4","My mother is a whore and one of the worst people I know. We have no relationship because she chose alcohol and men over her children. She taught me a lot about women which is why I vet them well and I know for a fact that most girls aren‚Äôt touching 15 bodies unless your only dating convenient liberals and loud black women exclusively. 

You could just look up the statistics. The promiscuous are more likely to abuse you, to cheat on you, more likely to suffer from a debilitating mental illness, more likely to bring predators around your children, more likely to suffer an addiction, more likely to have a partner beat them, more likely to commit paternity. 

Yes I would be very insecure with a women I know was a hoe. I watched my mother use the security of men that were around her as a weapon to break to them I saw her friends do it they‚Äôre husbands and boyfriends. My mother had a reputation, these men knew but my mother specifically chose men who did not have dads. Men who would easily believe the words of a woman. Oh and she hated being called out on it. 

Do you get it. I cannot have chaos in my life as an adult. I will kill myself if I ever have to deal with the chaos whores bring with them.

2. Assuming the percentage given (45.24% F) is a percent by mass, convert grams of F to grams of NaF. There are many ways to do this, but the one that makes the most conceptual sense is to always use 100 g of the total substance. So 100 grams of NaF would contain 45.24 grams of F. You could also use 1 gram of NaF and use decimals for the F and use 0.4524 due to dividing by 100. Either works. Just make sure g F is on bottom to cancel from the original step (F- and F essentially have the same mass).
3. Convert g NaF to desired units. Looks like the problem doesn‚Äôt state what units, so you could probably leave it in grams. Although the problem gave the fluoride in mg so you may need to convert to that.",1696118529.0

It shows that Trump chose to ignore all the people who were telling him he lost and there was no fraud, and instead decided to rely on a fringe group of wackos who were telling him there was a way he could stay in power.  You had asked how we know that he knew he lost, and this is how.  Perhaps it's not enough for you to personally believe that he knew he lost, perhaps you need Trump to be convicted in a court of law by a Trump-appointed judge presiding over a jury of Trump supporters before you'd believe that he did something wrong here.  

But that just makes us non-supporters that much more curious about why you continue to support this person who has shown such disastrous judgement.  The hoops you guys jump through to avoid accepting that Trump tricked you into thinking that the election was actually stolen - while he was being told be every credible and reasonable person around him that it wasn't.

Some dealers have dogshit service managers who take on work that gets denied by VW and the dealer is left holding the bag. Those dealers typically got burned one too many times and refuse to do ‚Äúwarranty‚Äù work so that they still get paid.

Its best to find a service manager who‚Äôs agreeable to the mods you want and stick with them. They cant roll back a TD1 code for a flashed ECU, but they can steer focus away from needing a full diagnostic scan for things like blown shocks or leaking sunroofs.",1696118532.0

She is looking for any response from you and you need to not give her anymore of your energy. Any interactions between you and her will be enough for her to continue. You cannot reason with her, she will never accept anything you say. 

Make the other people in your life aware of how uncomfortable you feel and make it clear to them that they are not to share any information about you with her. Appoint someone you trust to be the person who receives any information about her actions and they can determine what needs to be shared with you, otherwise you don't need to know what she says or does unless it concerns your safety. 

Disengage. Don't react. Don't respond. Will be tough since you live in a small town and your social circles are enmeshed. She will escalate before she finally loses traction.",1696118532.0

Intimacy is a mental thing for women, is there any chance that she could be resentful for something in the past? I‚Äôd recommend counseling, and even getting a vasectomy so her hormones can balance out.

In my situation early on I thought old school, I‚Äôll work and pay the bills and you clean and take care of the house.  It didn‚Äôt work I changed after we talked about it but I still didn‚Äôt do enough for her. I focused more on the issues at the time that I was losing sight of taking care of her emotionally as a husband. Usually if a woman is withholding sex it‚Äôs because we men aren‚Äôt creating the emotional intimacy connection.

"celebnsfw","t5_2qp6s","I am sure we could debate Hollywood using underaged nudity in films at length.  In the context of the movie, parental consent, etc, it might be deemed fine.  I think what some have issue with is anyone who might be posting or looking at this for any type of sexual stimulation as according to Google she was only 16 when she filmed this.  If you are getting off or even just getting aroused from this scene then that is where some might find it creepy.  

It is like with Blue Lagoon and Brooke Shields.  She was only 15/16 at the time of filming and her nudity made perfect sense for the story and setting.  That doesn't mean people should be screen capping it to discuss how nice she looks naked.  You are basically saying how hot you find a 16 year old which if you are older than say 18, that comes off a bit creepy.   Grown adults should not be talking about how nice the breasts of a 16 year old are.  

Just my opinion of course.  Doesn't mean you have to ban the movie or even not discuss the scene.  It just probably shouldn't be used as spank bank material.",1696118533.0

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It‚Äôs not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying ‚ÄúDM me.‚Äù

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don‚Äôt want to assume if it‚Äôs not referenced by OP.

 - Here‚Äôs how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you‚Äôd like to play in DMs, you may ask if they‚Äôd like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don‚Äôt say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

It's not a ""continued push"" -- it is the normal motion process in federal court, as a result of the original motion filed by Jack Smith.  The next step is the hearing on October 16th - and orange chucklehead doesn't have to attend, so he's not going to jail that day:

""MINUTE ORDER as to DONALD J.

Just remind yourself that those days were you sleep all day or are too fatigued to function weren‚Äôt wasted, they were serving the purpose of keeping you healthy. You wouldn‚Äôt tell a person with the flu that sleeping wasted their day, would you? Sorry if I‚Äôm coming across as one of those crazy self help people üòÖ But seriously, mindset is key for Narcolepsy. 

If that‚Äôs a hard step for you. Pick one task or chore to do on those days, and only do it on those days. Laundry (but not folding) or something else small that is easy to do in short spurts, and only do it on those days. Make it less of a ‚Äúsleep day‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúlazy laundry day.‚Äù For me, sleepy days are the days were I make sure to call my family (parents, siblings, etc.) and see how they are all doing. It‚Äôs easy to do in short bursts, and has a fantastic way of making the day feel useful.

The ultra beasts were not created by arceus but are still part of the pokemon roster also dialga is a god how you gonna be killing a god that if yoy can no longer time travel can just freeze time and do all the damage needed

However that would make them the typless type which is neutral to all meaning even if you said they have no type they can no longer injure the pokemon so you would either need to follow the typless theory or be able to do no damage to us which also means you have stats qhich meany you can be killed

Bullet seed the bullet IS the move meanwhile you are bringing in an item it is not a move 

I wasnt saying they are mire intelligent than yokai even though there is a pokemon that is intelligence and with its two counterparts represent sentience i was saying that they would be able to pull of strategies meaning shedinja immune to your typless type

You were talking about how yokai are outside of existance kind of like the distortion world which giratina and humans and pokemon can enter so your yokai that hide away outside of existance get erased too

Basically hino cannot attack pokemon unless they were typless and if they are typless type they are erased by shedinja",1696118535.0

He was absent always working, addict/alcoholic. His wife was extremely verbally, mentally, and physically abusive to me, but treated her daughter/my little sister, like a queen. 

My mom was the lesser of two evils, addict, not really mothering, bipolar, etc. She could be really mean verbally sometimes, and we did have a few physical altercations but I knew she loved me and she struggled with her own demons and whatnot. But i had the freedom to see my friends, do what I want, go wherever I want, which also in really wasn‚Äôt great but as a 12-16 year old that‚Äôs all you want. 

My mom eventually got emergency custody for a bit and then I was just kind of staying with other family members. But I relate to what Tay was saying and some of the things she was feeling. I think the entire situation is entirely possibly. My mother too spent all the money she ever could save up fighting for me. My father was verbally abusive at times and very manipulative to both of us. It‚Äôs a toxic cycle. 

I feel for Tay and I hope she seeks some therapy and learns how to cope with everything. Really fucking sucks to go through so much trauma for so long as such a young age. I personally can‚Äôt wait to see her comeback and will be supporting her fully!!!",1696118536.0

Then CU got a new coach. And all I could think was how I expected the spirit of the game to be totally lost. And watching the game (on TV) made it clear pretty quick how true that was. It was like a red carpet. And even after they went into double overtime and lost to a team that is objectively much worse, all we heard was celebrities talking about how amazing this guy is.

Different standards of cleanliness exist and us men's do tend to be way more relaxed than women. Again, I'm not telling you this as an excuse but as a way to promote understanding instead of infuriation and actually working together to make things change.

Instead of getting angry because he doesn't do things when you'd rather he did them (and feel that then you have to do them) and don't want to have to instruct him to do it every single time, sit down and have a long convo with him. Explain the differences between your cleanliness standards, the way his not actively helping makes you feel like he's leaving it up to you and how that engenders frustration and anger, and how having to be on top of him asking to do every single thing would also constitute extra work on your part. Make him see how unfair it is in your eyes and how that's going to be chipping off your happiness and feelings for him.

All those are things that I guarantee you haven't crossed his mind at all. That might make you angry in itself but remember that men simply are not raised and socialised that way. I want to believe that most men are willing to change those ways for the woman they love if they're made to understand the actual gravity of the issue as opposed to the nothing they perceive and then feel confused at the anger and bitterness that ensues.

>i think we had something like 500 this year so far. what more needs to happen to get it under control and why hasn‚Äôt progressive places like california become a gun control ideal for other states to look to when rethinking their own policy?

That's not my point, my point is that she convinced Trump to use the AOW Rule in the exact way the NRA and NRA members **didn't** want it to be used. As Trump campaigned on gun rights and the 2nd Amendment, so by doing this he completely fucked over his base. This is why he didn't win in 2020, why he won't win in 2024, and the refusal to fight him on it (and impose stronger limits on Presidential authority, now desired in the war against Biden) is why the GOP won't win again.

Yeah I‚Äôm just going to have to hope she doesn‚Äôt just let the visuals just go to the same creative grave yard as the Formation World Tour.

"Kingdom","t5_2sl0d","Shin was born in like... 259 BC, right? It seems like he'll be getting close to 40 by the time Qin's unification campaign is completed. Obviously, he hasn't hit his stride yet, but I have to imagine he's getting close to the point where he'll make Great General. Perhaps if he's instrumental in the fall of Zhao or Han (seems like a foregone conclusion), he could make GG by 230 BC at the earliest. 

Come to think of it, didn't Hara say how he wanted to continue the manga up to the point where the Han Dynasty begins? If Shin is still alive at that point, then he would be closing in on 60 years old, or about the same age as Gaimou. The man could be a grandfather at that point.",1696118541.0

"UFOs","t5_2qhds","My point is that the way you categorize coincidences matters. Your methodology is flawed because what you've binned as a single coincidence is actually the product of many other coincidences (as well as things that are not sttictly coincidental, but can be described probabilistically).

The example of ""Lockheed-Martin"" being printed on the craft highlights this in an obvious and intuitive way. That would be the product of a huge amount of coincidences. One could argue that the use of two-tone director lights has less of a randomness built into it, but ultimately it would still require numerous coincidences to result in the same outcome that has been widely adopted by human flight practices.

Not to mention, why would you even need director lights on the bottom of a presumably interstellar vehicle in the first place?",1696118541.0

"ArgentinaBenderStyle","t5_q369p","El tema es que tambi√©n estamos poniendo de ejemplo un pa√≠s como Nueva zenlanda, donde el 80% de la poblaci√≥n tiene completa la educaci√≥n media superior a diferencia de Argentina donde (tengo entendido) solo el 26% completa esta instancia.
No s√© si este dato sea v√°lido para el argumento pero yo creo que sirve para diferenciar las capacidades productivas de cada poblaci√≥n. Un programador o t√©cnico puede producir bastante capital en jornadas m√°s cortas de trabajo sin alterar mucho la ganancia final lo que podr√≠a permitir bajar su horario laboral y eso de hecho generar√≠a un mayor rendimiento ya que su trabajo tambi√©n depende de su salud mental.
Ahora si vamos a un pa√≠s como argentina donde la cantidad de gente especializada disminuye considerablemente si podr√≠a verse afectado el aumento de gasto en mas salarios para cubrir los mismos tiempos de producci√≥n.

Al final del d√≠a lo que importa es cu√°nto sea capaz de ganar la empresa para poder pagar al final del mes los salarios, si aumentas la cantidad de salarios pero no aumentas la producci√≥n entonces te terminas quedando en n√∫meros rojos y eso termina por quebrar la empresa y dejar a todos sin trabajo. As√≠ que supongo que tiene un poco de sentido la analog√≠a de la pizza; si la cantidad de pizza al final del mes (capital producido) sigue siendo la misma entonces si invitas a m√°s personas entonces cada uno comer√° menos. As√≠ que supongo que me fijar√≠a m√°s en garantizar primero que haya suficiente ""pizza"" para ah√≠ despu√©s poder invitar a m√°s comensales y que todos puedan saciar su hambre.

"workout","t5_2rir8","\- yes looking at the way your program is structured you are only hitting each muscle once a week which isnt terrible by itself but to be honest i would just pick a noob 3x full body program from the wiki or boostcamp and roll with it.   

\- i dont think the way you are structuring this program is really forcing you to put in a lot of effort near failure or pushing strength progression  

\- ie. take a look at how [this program (by geoffrey verity schofield)](https://www.boostcamp.app/geoffrey-schofield/rampage) is structured where you automatically take sets to rpe 8-10 which generally just means each set is pretty tough and you should be trying to add quality reps to last week  

\- or [gzclp](https://www.boostcamp.app/cody-lefever/gzcl-program-gzclp) where you have ""15+"" sets where you can shit test your effort figure out if you need to go heavier next time  

\- as well as the ascending sets you are doing basically just make you do a lot of work for not quite as many super hard sets near failure which sounds pretty inefficient. yes you will be warming up quite well like this but you might as well do pyramid sets (e.g. 135x12-15, 155x6-10, 185x4-6) where you know that the effort will still be high with lighter weight

\- think of the execution of the movements as well to the point where you have at least a little bit of mind muscle connection to whatever you want to grow even if mmc is a little bit overrated sometimes. eg. my chest gets a better stretch if i do a tiny natural arch on a bench press instead of a totally flat back and my quads get smoked on squats and leg presses when i go super deep and pause.  

\- you are also tall which means yes squats are maybe more of a glute and back exercise than an ideal quad exercise because most tall people have torso to femur ratios that make them pitch forward a bit more, so maybe if you do a pure bodybuilding program you might not do normal squats at all, or if you pick something designed for a mix of powerlifting strength and muscle, you'll just have to be conscious of how you pick your ""secondary"" movement [(the clip of arnold talking abou front squats is exactly what im talking about)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lVvlWdBFv3c)   

\- anyways all is moot if you are just not eating enough to gain weight and you might have to employ strategies such as getting a loaf of bread and jar of peanut butter in your dorm, bringing some buffet food back in a tupperware, more high calorie processed food etc. basically any advice ever given on /r/gainit.   

\- and take measurements and pictures in identical conditions (e.g. ""closed door, residence dorm bathroom, lights on, standing next to towel rack, morning no pump, pick a pose and camera angle and stick with it"" or ""bodyweight+thigh+chest+arm tape measures"" every couple months) so you can actually tell if you're stalling or if its just body dysmorphia being a bitch",1696118542.0

lol nice strawman. That was never my point. My point was that Luke reassured Leia that Ben could be saved. That he wasn‚Äôt gone. He wanted her to keep trying to save hum. That doesn‚Äôt require force mastery to do. And even if it did, Leia demonstrates impressive use of the force by using it to propel herself through space in TLJ. 

>Huh how did it do that?

That the force is everywhere and in everything. That it is omnipresent. That it is more than just a superpower. That it is bigger than that. Rey took that shit to heart man. And like what Yoda tried to get Luke to do in ESB performed an icredible feat of force use to save people. Ironically it was to lift rocks, but the idea was the same when Luke explained the force is so much bigger than what she thinks it is 

>More like he fell into an irrational depression.

He caused his nephew to fall to the darkside and kill his students because he failed as a mentor. Yeah totally irrational to be depressed about that. /s

>That's a bit of a fancy way of putting ""help them escape from a stupid situation they got themselves in"" - however it's presented dramatically enough, so ok lol

>    https://reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/wiki/format

This is what your title should look like:
>    *AGE [R4R] - Description*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your title:

**1. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. Replace the first ""R"" with your gender and the second ""R"" with the gender you're looking for:** 
>    Use only **M**, **F**, **T** or **A** for tagging gender. Use any combination for couples: **MF**, **FF**, etc.

**4. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject:**
>    *[META] - Description*

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","\> I also believe that these laws could easily be used unfairly and selectively enforced, which therefore limits the effectiveness while simultaneously increasing the chance that unjust actors could use for racist purposes.

So again, ""I won't support them, because I think they'll just be used to deny use weapons that we sorely need to make us safer"". 

Go ahead. Show him the studies I showed you. He'd probably be very much for it, as black people die at disproportionate rate in firearm related deaths. But you know, that'd require actually **reading** it. 

So you're still against the policies that Harvard and Oxford say will reduce firearm related deaths as surely as antibiotics work, but you don't want them implemented, because your irrational fear of some massive government conspiracy to deny black people weapons will ignite some sort of black people genocide, instead of the regulations acting like **in every single other country they've been implemented in?**

So you think this fear you have is so realistic, so that you honestly believe the studies, you believe what they say, you **know** these horrible amounts of firearm related deaths could be reduced, but you won't do it, because you don't trust the government? You trust the government less than random crazy people who decide to go on a rampage and have no violent history before that so they can just go and get a gun? You trust them more than a government that's bound by rules and regulations, and not just by your domestic ones.",1696118544.0

"CatholicDating","t5_3348n","Great question and thank you for all the added details! I say clarifying your expectations from the beginning is a great plan. For example, I have done online dating and one of the times I did, I lived in the San Diego, CA area. Men in the military made clear that they lived on-base. I know many Catholic marriages where one member of the couple was active military for at least 20 years. As a matter of fact, I remember a girl I went to Catholic school with had at least three siblings and her father was in the Air Force. 

Your future bride has to be 100% a fan of the fact that you are a patriot and have the courage and zeal to offer years of life to serve your country. Anything less, I think, is disappointing. Also, regarding the 4-5 year thing, it should take couples about 6-18 months to discern marriage. Anything less, you don‚Äôt really know that person and anything longer wastes people‚Äôs time. Faithful single Catholics in the military who are actively discerning married life are uniquely positioned to date and to embody Christ in their sacramental life after the marriage. If you are encountering Catholic women who do not see your service as the impressive asset that it is, you need to move on, imho. 


What are you referring to with ‚ÄúCatholic point of view on Armed Forces?‚Äù Are you referring to the 2,000 year rich history of the Church supporting soldiers and warriors in many ways? Or perhaps the canonized saints who also fought in wars (good examples are Saint Sebastian, Saint Joan of Arc, and Saint Ignatius of Loyola). Or maybe you are referring to the Archdiocese of Military Services USA https://www.usccb.org/resources/what-should-catholics-do-archdiocese-military-services-usa ?

I don't know what I would pay for a used card, but it would have to be considerably cheaper than a new one from a store with full guarantee, and I would only buy it hands on once I've seen it in action and working. So this would mean driving somewhere and investing time and gas money... but that's just me.

Also, damn, gfx cards are not cheap in UK. Here in germany I pay roughly the same for those in cards in ‚Ç¨).

"GolfSwing","t5_30ms3","Personally I think your hips are way too fast and aggressive too early in the swing. I have gone through this myself.

Getting the hips fire so quick is a problem because the hips spin the upper body and shoulders open too. Tour players on average have 30\*-45\* hips open to target at impact, with shoulders 0-10\* closed to target at impact. 

If you can control the hip/shoulder separation to create those angles, then well done. I suspect what you will be doing is having your hips pull your shoulder open at impact. The shoulder direction dictates the ball direction.

This will have a few results - 

1) pull fades - the launch direction starts left and the face is left open from the club trailing too much.

2) straight pulls - you'll start reacting to point 1 and try closing the face down more.

3) bigger slices - when the timing is really off, the more extreme open face will have the ball start to the right, even though your swing direction is right.

If this rings true, try slowing the hips down and get the feel that your back is to target at impact. It won't be, but try and make it happen as an exagerration.

That will get your launch direction starting right for a push path, and encourage a push draw shape.",1696118544.0

What is your UNPOPULAR opinion about BG3?

Not that I think gay dudes are impossible to classify as badass, hard-as-tacks, stone cold killers (though really, how many gays have you met like that lol). Not that I think a woman should never be tough-as-nails. Not that all men should be emotionless brick walls of toughness.

Zoals de rest van dit draadje ook herhaald, bezuinigingen op de GGZ zijn funest geweest, en dan gek genoeg vooral de ""niet zo heftige"" of ""leuke"" programmas.

The more money you make, it obviously is better for you economically however there has to be balance in your life. But if you can manage your money, you won't ""need"" to make as much.  Lots of people make tons of money but are broke. 

Don't make stupid purchasing choices with cars. Vehicles are a huge negative to have on the books. Own them if possible or atleast have one used car in your household.

Have a strong, solid partner who you respect and who respects you. Communicate all the time. Face challenges together and look forward to addressing those challenges. Respect yourself and your family name. Do yourself favors in the future - things that will pay dividends in the future.

Always make the effort to do little things like doing the dishes tonight even if your tired so you do not have to wakeup to them (for example).

Remove ego and emotion from as many decisions in life as you are able to. Be good to others. There is a karma system in this universe for sure. Buy a homeless person a meal once and awhile... the universe will reward you in some way shape or form at some point in the not so distant future. 

Avoid being around shitty humans or humans with shitty habits. Separate your work life from your personal life. Your job doesn't define you. You, your family, the company you keep and your actions define you. 

Spend less time on social media. Take time to yourself free of technology. Go on walks. Enjoy nature.",1696118547.0

It's just a different set of rules for a diffrerent society. What works in one place might not work in another, what people want in one place people might not want in another. 

The point is, in the US, very few people want to restrict gun ownership beyond registrations and background checks. In the UK, most people want guns to be heavily restricted.

It takes away and uniqueness that they once had in hearing silly big numbers because now it's a take of muh multiverse threat and infinite speed.

Discord vs Bill was an excellent exception in that regard, since the reality warping was prominent throughout the entire fight despite it not taking place outside of its own area, barring a few minor setting changes.

- Unless you have stated that you wish to be contacted privately for privacy reasons, etc, please be wary of anyone who contacts you about your request outside of your post. We are unable to assist with any problems that may arise from dealing with users who contact you outside of this post.

- Please remember that fast usually does not mean best. Unless you're in a hurry and the request is urgent, it's best to wait at least an hour before choosing a submission. It can be very demoralizing for our editors to spend time working on an edit only to find that OP has chosen the very first submission, which is often not the best quality.

- Remember to zoom-in and look carefully at the submissions before choosing a winner. Recent advancements in AI have enabled some very impressive edits to be made very quickly, however it often results in unnatural distortions of things like faces and hands and background objects that more careful editors can and will correct manually, but at the cost of a bit more time. Again, it's best to be patient.

- Since this is a paid request (you've set the ""paid"" flair and/or you've offered payment) all submissions will be watermarked. Once you've chosen a submission and sent payment, the editor will send you the final, un-watermarked file.

- Once your request is solved, remember to change your post's flair to ""Solved"" by commenting ""SOLVED"" and thank those who helped you.

Which is based on norms which change and thus don't really matter. You can have your own values and while someone might find your creation a mess, you won't.

>Slavery is a bad idea proven by history

No, looking at history it is a great idea. It is a bad idea according to the modern ideologies. Every great empire/nation had slaves. You could even argue that we still have slaves (in the west). Where do you draw the line for when someone owns or controls you? I'd argue debt is slavery.

>Give slavers freedom and make them come back for more

I don't understand what you mean.

>Idea, dude. If the idea of ‚Äúheaven‚Äù exists and it‚Äôs the same for most of people, they will make that idea a reality.

Can you start quoting what I wrote? i don't know what the context is here.

>(power) Yes and you can overcome obstacles by using others as a source of power, maybe even using their powers, it‚Äôs not just that but it‚Äôs related

You're missing my point. I'm saying that exercising power is not exclusive to using other people which you seem to be implying. You can, but it's much broader than that.

>Two sides of the same coin dude, you‚Äôre trying to find your own meaning, same here, but we are still playing the same game. Unless you are playing your own game which I‚Äôm not familiar with.

Context?

>You‚Äôre actually bringing up something cool by saying that if I play my own game, others will play their own games. If we can‚Äôt play one game, can‚Äôt we unite all games into one? Well that‚Äôs something we‚Äôve been doing as a humanity in general.

Your last sentence builds on the fact that there are different ""games"". Talking about it in that manner makes no sense because you segregate everything from each other. People just act. There is no your game or our game. There is nothing to unite. Things just happen.

>But there‚Äôs also another thing to address here which would be, protection and security, to make sure the game is fair for everyone and those who doesn‚Äôt want to play it, don‚Äôt interrupt

That comes down to morals again. There might be those who don't care for ""fairness"".

>Like for me to articulate what I‚Äôm trying to say in one clear sentence would probably require poetry or something like that so it doesn‚Äôt sound as babbling.

That's probably the most pretentious thing you've written thus far. No, it turns into babbling because you either don't have a clear idea in your head or because you don't know how to argue/discuss. You start talking about your thoughts based on the assumption that I agree with you which is what makes a mess of everything.

>We literally came full circle again

To what? That you're babbling? 

>I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre trying to tell me that Nihilism is an answer?

Answer to what????? We weren't discussing what the ultimate solution is... But fyi I think Nietzsche's √ºbermensch is the solution.

>Bible also addresses the idea that it takes two people to understand something

That makes no sense so I guess context is missing here AGAIN.

>If our sets of morals align I really don‚Äôt see a point of arguing, because that basically like fighting for who is right.

How did you make the conclusion that we agree with eachother? You keep babbling, going from one subject to another. We haven't reached any conclusion in any of the subjects...

>If I just tell you what I want, would that make it easier for you to understand? Or you just going to tell me that my ‚Äúutopia‚Äù is unachievable? Because if you‚Äôre gonna tell me that, it means you‚Äôre lying, because if you‚Äôre not lying, then my whole life is a lie. But if you want to achieve something like me, at the basics let‚Äôs say a ‚Äúhappy life for me and for everyone else around me‚Äù then why are we arguing? You don‚Äôt think me trying to make you happy would be a good thing?

Again, you're doing what OP described in his post. You're strawmanning me without knowing what I actually think. Aint nobody got time for that.

>This all either makes sense or it doesn‚Äôt but it‚Äôs all the same at the end. Maybe that‚Äôs what god is then I don‚Äôt know dude but I will keep asking and keep trying to understand what I need to know to get myself where I want to be. Without lies and what I think would be evil intentions, a solid path to follow, I think. Since I believe that most people would think the same way.

So I 16f technically have 5 siblings but due to many issues don‚Äôt consider my older brother to be my sibling. I won‚Äôt go into detail as to why but he abused me and my older sister for years and then moved and cut contact.

But the problem arose when I was at a college tour and the tour guide asked if I had any siblings and I said yes I have 4. My grandma who was with me tried to correct me and said no you have 5. So I said no I only have 4. We spent the rest of the tour with my grandma huffing and puffing.

When we got back to the car she asked me why I don‚Äôt consider my older brother to be my sibling. So I told her funny how you knew which one I was not mentioning when I said I had 4 siblings when I never specified, and she got mad at me and told me no matter what my older brother will always be my brother and I need to forgive and forget what he did to me and my sister because when it happened he was just a teen. 

I told my family about this and got mixed reactions so know idk if I‚Äôm the ass or not.

Use karting as a learning tool to best prepare you for cars. If I were you, jump into a single seater as soon as possible, maybe even after your first season in karting. It will be very much sink or swim, but you are trying to make up for lost time after all.

"consoles","t5_2qxn6","I/O is input/output in a computer. It's how fast you can read and write data. In this context, it's SSD speed. Modern games need a LOT of data loaded for high resolution textures, etc. and console RAM is limited (16GB total on both PS5 and XSX; compared to VRAM on PC GPU which can be 8, 12, 16, and upwards of 24 GB on the latest cards). So I/O is very important for 1440p and especially 4K gaming when those assets (textures, objects, etc.) need to be constantly loaded and displayed on-screen. They can't all be loaded into RAM, so the SSD speed is very important to load these items fast so there is no stuttering or pop-in during gameplay. That's one of the real benefits of the current gen consoles, is ""streaming"" assets into the game in real-time from the SSD. 

The old way with mechanical hard drives was to load levels into RAM as needed before the player interacted with each area. That's why there were loading screens, and level layouts specifically forced players through loading screens or tight spaces where the game could clear space in RAM and load in new assets for the next area. That isn't required anymore. And the speed of the SSD and the bandwidth bus to/from the SSD is important - that's the I/O speed.

The PS5 also has hardware based decompression of data streamed from the SSD so the CPU isn't stressed. It's pretty awesome tech, honestly.",1696118551.0

Multiple schools in a district and a single workspace makes for ugly long domain names, but aliases can help.

It sounds like you're going to be purchasing a new domain and Workspace licenses, and then doing some migrations.  Folks like Amplified can help with details and migrations. From the little information available, it sounds like you could skip the ""subdomains"" step-- unless this is about timing and organization delays.",1696118551.0

Actually God expects us to listen to him the deity and trust his judgment. Which as we know a lot of people don't do. And our sense of morality is not the same as God because he's knows literally everything and we don't. How could you say your understanding of morality is better than God's?

>
You're just making the usual ""we can't understand god"" arguments or ignoring (or simply aren't grasping) the argument I am making about other religions so there's no point in discussing further.

That's understandable but I'm trying not too, how else can I get a better understanding about this topic without  discussing it? Also the reason I asked this question is because I think its unfair how a lot of people say the very concept of God is evil. Especially when they usually base it only off of the chirstan God. I'm not trying to prove to you God is real or believe in my religion. Just how is it fair to demonize all religions and the concept of God based on only one religion?",1696118552.0

They show them. You can see datamined pictures from the latest patch of the jump points right now. They've shown important parts of Pyro.

> Star Citizen is the most funded game project of all time, and it has been 11 years.

It's also the most technically ambitious project of all time in its genre. That's why you can't point to any real competitor as a comparison. You say ""this is bad!"" yet no one's done better. The money/demand is clearly there, and game companies like to make money. If anyone could deliver a SC competitor in less time, they would have. But they don't, because it's too challenging and therefore risky with a traditional funding model.

> travesty 

Relax my friend, it's a videogame. All SC was supposed to be was an attempt at ambition that nobody has done before. A technically challenging persistent mmofps space sim. There are good reasons people keep dropping the closest competitors and funding SC. It's the only game in its genre.

>If grammatical gender refers to masculine and feminine words, then i don‚Äôt see why human gender wouldn‚Äôt refer to masculine and feminine attributes

It refers to male and female humans. A feminine attribute would be an attribute typically associated with females.

>Still two, bc there‚Äôs only ever male and female that a trait can be attributed to. But unlike sex, a man can be feminine without being a woman

What is the gender of a feminine man?",1696118552.0

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","If you were to play only one AC game in your whole life, you should complain.

That's only partially a joke. This is a franchise that was designed from the start with an ongoing story, the first game ending with many questions left to be answered.

Interesting that you mention the Horizon franchise, which of all the RPG franchises is most similar to Assassin's Creed and clearly borrowed *a lot* from AC (you can even do ledge assassinations). At first glance, this would suggest one of the three RPGs, but a big part of the HZD story is messages from the past, which in the AC franchise happens mostly in the older games with Desmond as the modern day protagonist.

A good compromise candidate would be Origins. The gameplay is similar to HZD, right down to archery being the OP solution to many situations. Bayek's story is almost the reverse of Aloys:

* She starts with no family and desperately wants one. He starts with a family and loses it.
* She starts as a total outcast and gradually becomes integrated (up to a point) into society. He starts as part of a longstanding official arm of society (even if one that is fading) and ends up an outcast.

I find this all quite ironic, since for a while Horizon was my best AC substitute at a time when Ubisoft seemed to have totally lost the plot.",1696118552.0

As for this chick and her opinions . I mean , none of this is ""news"". I've been talking about this for ages and have brought it up multiple times here on reddit.  
But despite Travis and Kim's affair,  which everyone knows about..it doesn't change my mind about Kim being a narcissist,  attention whore and totally wrong for the way she treats her sister.  She's an awful human being.  It has nothing to do with her trashy past with Travis.  Kim was a piece of self absorbed shit way before she knew Travis. 
As for Kourtney, she knows the history. She didn't have to get involved with him. But she did.  So with that,  comes all this awkwardness and possible jealousy of knowing your sister was with your ex.  But she chose it. Nobody made her.  She gladly jumped into that messy incestuous cesspool.  So I mean,  they're doomed to have these types of issues.  It comes with the territory unfortunately.  I don't think it's the main issue though of "" why Kourt hates Kim so much"". I think it's a million reasons. They're a very toxic family,  in case nobody has noticed.",1696118554.0

They had two sets of porta potties of only 15 each and one Pay-per-entry attended/cleaned bathroom. 60,000 attendees? How does that make sense?

"henna","t5_2rk88","So. Henna is red. That‚Äôs the color it is. Lawsone is the dye molecule and it is a red orange tone. It‚Äôs colorless when it‚Äôs in the plant, and oxidizes to the red orange. 

Mina brow tint does not contain henna. It contains SOME amount of cassia obovata plant, which imparts no color (maybe slight golden tones) and is usually reserved for its conditioning benefits. Mina brow tint uses PPD, or p-phenylenediamine as it‚Äôs colorant. This is the standard chemical dye that causes severe reactions and sensitizations. In addition, Mina contains sodium picramate, which is confusing. This metallic salt will react very poorly if you use with chemical hair dye. You‚Äôve heard those stories of people melting their hair when they use henna and then have salon color added? Sodium Picramate is usually the culprit. 

So. If you want a natural hair dye, henna is a great. But you‚Äôll always have red tones at least in part because henna is red. 

I would recommend you discontinue use of the Mina product. PPD is scary and I cannot believe they are having people put this around their eyes.",1696118555.0

Picanha, yes. Linguica, yes.  But no maminha, fraudinha, etc (although they sell frozen pao de quiejo).  The butcher will hook you up with thick cut cross-cut beef ribs (asado de tira).  Anther place for that (and for Spanish-speaking Latin American cut and sausages, including morcilla) is the Super A in Falls Church (Lee and Graham or Annandale Road, blanking on the details.). 

In your searches, if you come across chuleta kan kan, please let me know. I hear that Virginia Meats has it sometimes.

That‚Äôs all I got as far as leads.  I do buy brisket at Wal-mart or Costco sometimes.  And the whole ribeye cut at Costco can be worth it.  Harris Teetet when they have a sale is good too, as somebody here mentioned. Oh, and Springfield Butcher sometimes too.

Honestly, bulk buying at Costco or half cow on Eat Wild are probably your best bets.

It lists the 3700X on there for comparison so you can see what the performance difference is.

That being said, I looked up a few comparisons of game benchmarks with the 2070 and a 3700X vs. 12700k even, and they are within 10fps margin of error higher for a 12700k. The bottleneck is the GPU at that point, so while the 12700k does outperform the 3700x on the gamers nexus review, they are also using a 3080 FTW3 card so... it's not a slacker and outperforms your 2070 by quite a margin. A 3080 will pretty much double the FPS of a 2070.

So at that point, it is the cost of a GPU upgrade as well to get more than the 10fps boost + the cost of the 12700k. So in my opinion, probably not worth it. Not right now with the way the GPU pricing is going. Though the 40 series has come down by a bit recently.",1696118556.0

You can get Mordecai to 50 or 60 after that but you might have pulled better champs by then. Mordecai also brings better utility than Warpriest so you can use her until level 40 but don't rank her up beyond that. 

You should try to put Lifesteal gear on your champs (definitely put the login Lifesteal gear on Kael). Lifesteal gear, in the early game, removes the needs for a healer for a while (until you get get better healing champs like Apothecary).

After you do all that, you can work on getting Armiger to level 60 as he is an excellent Spider champion.",1696118556.0

when you go into the basement to integrate Abel on the location of the Delta's boat. Go to the side wall where a pennet flag is hung. Then go over to where a shelving unit is at there should be an old etcher sketch thing. That is all for this level.

When spying on the raiders with the boat, go near Willy and pick up Omar's rabbit foot. Move by the log kind of near AJ and you will pick up a horseshoe fallen off one of the horses. You need to get both before you conclude with everyone before leaving this area. 

Your last two items is at Jame's barn. One will be to the left of James' that will be the windchimes that is kind of by AJ inspecting the Salt Lick. There is another hidden achievement with this if you talk with AJ on what a Salt lick is, linking back to Season 1 ep 2, on Clem's first experience what a Salt lick is. Then go over to James's right and pick up 'Beet' Nick.

There are several mission breaking bugs, including in the main story. There are also a lot of underdeveloped/poorly made areas that were obviously dropped in development and bad UI decisions that wear on you the entire game.

First off ""hate"" is a strong word, pretty sure this isn't an emotion people usually feel towards fictional characters. anyway i'm gonna do this bullet point style except improvised:

1- imagine your friend is kind of a goofball and this girl in class is constantly jumping every opportunity to make him look like more of a clown than he already is, pretty annoying

2- also the ""shallow popular high school chick who then becomes deep after facing traumas from the past"" trope, generally not a nice person to be around, i'm sure it's considered ""good character writing"", but it does make the character dislikable

3- the whole arc with her talking about mitsuru behind her back instead of just confronting her from the start, i mean i get that she has her doubts about the SEES, which is super reasonable, but like every morning ""hey guys, don't you think mitsuru is sus af?""

4- she's kind of pushed onto the mc as a romantic interest in the beginning of the game in a way that is a bit off-putting, i started avoiding her just because it felt like the game was telling me to do the opposite if that makes sense?

5- also the ""maid costume"" arc, made really cemented her ""i thrive off attention but also complain about it"" vibes, like you just said you were dreading wearing the maid costume, then you get a video of her lamenting how she didn't get to try it on

does this make sense? it's a recipe for a somewhat dislikable person, i'm sure it was meant to come off that way, but the fact that she comes off as annoying is undeniable here.

Walking my doggy friends and seeing them all goofy and happy with a stick or meeting another dog (I‚Äôm a dog walker)

Helping my widowed mother in law with stuff around her house, like taking out the trash or lifting boxes.  Having tea with her and chatting is so comforting and warm.

My cozy orange cat who is purring in my lap at the moment.

Identifying trees/birds/wildflowers with my guidebooks..  a new ID is SO thrilling.

The monthly art gallery ‚Äúart walk‚Äù the first Friday of each month.  The pieces that really move me.. just such an overwhelming beautiful feeling.  

Giving friends & family a tour of my vegetable garden anytime they come over.

Having a beer while listening to music, sweating in the hot sun working out on the garden and explaining all the things I have growing.

Reading my book each night before bed on my kindle all cozy in bed, well past midnight, while the rest of the world is asleep and it‚Äôs dark and quiet and so peaceful, and the pressures of the day and the chores are long done.

Any time spent with my niece and nephews is just heaven, we could be doing anything and it‚Äôs pure joy.

Swimming in the summer time.  Particularly in the ocean waves.  Dunking under the waves or letting the crash over me.  Floating and feeling weightless.  Probably the most euphoric feeling for me.

"PacemakerICD","t5_335mp","I‚Äôve had four surgeries like this. Three related to my S-ICD and then after years of different forms of trouble with that device I had a fourth procedure to remove the S-ICD and insert a transvenous unit. 

Eat a big meal right before your cutoff time. Plan for another on the way home. For me those two points in time usually are nearly 24hrs apart, and this helps a ton with the discomfort and crankiness. 

Expect to wait around for hours after you get to the hospital. I generally am asked to get there at 10 for an ‚Äú11am‚Äù surgery but at a busy medical center that generally means 3:30 because a device placement is one of the least urgent things done in the cath lab. Then I‚Äôm out at 6 and allowed to leave at 9pm or something. Lots of dead time. Be prepared to amuse yourself and charge your phone. 

Bring your phone and glasses into the OR. They will keep them safe for you and you‚Äôll wake up with them. It‚Äôs a lot better than waking up without them. 

Having gone through both, the S-ICD recovery is more difficult, particularly the first time when they create the pocket. They are making a pocket under the skin and then tunneling a lead under the skin across and up by the rib cage and sternum. It ends up making a pretty large area of your body sore. The placement location is under more tension too so everything about the wound is more annoying. I didn‚Äôt feel like driving or even bouncing around in a car for a solid 10-12 days after. So be prepared for being stuck at home.

For me the pain peaks around the 2-3 day mark. I‚Äôm usually more functional the day after the procedure then it hits me around 48hrs. At about the one month mark things are 95% of normal again. Don‚Äôt rush it with the lifting and movement restrictions during he recovery period. Whenever I‚Äôve had wound complications they have always been like 3-4 weeks out when the pain is gone but things are still healing and I decided to chop firewood or something else equally stupid. For the first couple of weeks the pain keeps you from pushing the limits but just because it doesn‚Äôt hurt doesn‚Äôt mean it is ok. Listen to the doctors on that stuff because if you do mess up a wound it can add several more weeks to your healing time.

For S-ICD placement they should give you opiates. It‚Äôs 50/50 with transvenous but like I said the S-ICD recovery is harder and you deserve to be comfortable. If you get them they will put in your RX during or after surgery. Have them send it to a 24hr pharmacy unless you‚Äôre sure you‚Äôre finishing up early enough to pick it up at your normal place and obviously figure out where that pharmacy is so you can stop on the way home. I only
Take opiates at night, usually once an hour before bed and a second time if I wake up in pain. I‚Äôd rather have double the quantity of perc 5s than the normal
quantity of perc 10s so I can adjust the dose down more easily after the first couple days. I would recommend keeping Tylenol and ibuprofen around as well too. When you‚Äôre not using the opiates you can alternate those two every three hours to keep things pretty ok. Once you stop the opiates you may continue using them for a few more days.

Finally for some reason the Physicians Assistants always seem to give me way different info than the doctors pre procedure. I‚Äôve been told no driving for two weeks, general anaesthesia is and I‚Äôll be spending the night then the doc says ok to drive after 72hrs, no spending the night, conscious sedation. I hate the contradictions but ultimately the doc is right and you should be prepared to get all of your answers from them. I usually bring a list of questions for the pre procedure meeting. They will also send you home with discharge instructions. I‚Äôve never had to spend the night after a device related procedure even when it is pushed late in the day.

Finally regarding your diagnosis, if you haven‚Äôt had genetic testing get it. Idiopathic is a lame place to end up with something like this. Knowing your exact causation can go a long way towards improving your treatment plan and quality of life. Today the ICD seems like the big deal but long term it will be the VT as episodes of VT are very disruptive to your life, particularly if they are coming with ICD shocks. Ask me how I know.

This is something from a previous patch people are taking out of context repeatedly.

This was talking about the meta of teams running Bard running around the dungeon with crazy movespeed, never resting because of tranquitiy and chorale + cleric. Just constantly W keying people at extremely high speed with full spells up.

The changes in the patch slowed the game down significantly. They nerfed bard songs so you have to sit to use them. They nerfed consumables too so it's harder to stay topped constantly by bringing full inventories of meds. They capped movement speed so buffball teams weren't rushing people with 400 speed barbs pushing in invis.

Think you might want to read up on the recent history of Venezuela - It wasn‚Äôt impoverished until hyperinflation hit and it is still going specifically because of the actions of the current government - dictator Maduro

[Reuters 08/03/2023 - Venezuela's bolivar weakens against the U.S. dollar as inflation rages](https://www.reuters.com/markets/currencies/venezuelas-bolivar-weakens-against-us-dollar-inflation-rages-2023-08-03/)

From the link:

*President Nicolas Maduro has presided over a prolonged economic meltdown in the oil-rich nation, which was once South America's wealthiest.*

*The annual rise in consumer prices for June* ***topped 404%,*** *according to central bank data, as analysts predict that inflation will continue to accelerate this year*.

more at the link

That is a big part of why people aren‚Äôt just leaving but escaping.

>And by the way, we are not under a regime.

OH, look up the generic definition - 

Just think if the Biden Administration took over Venezuela, they could fix the inflation AND could decimate the oil industry there - IOW, do what he has been doing here and then the migration would stop.  We might even get some tax base out of it too.",1696118560.0

"GermanRoaches","t5_2gio5k","sprays don't really work for cockroaches in such a large building. Older buildings are more likely to have pest problems especially in densely populated areas, this doesn't have much to do with the nature of the building, more that since it's been occupied for so long it's had more chances to have pests introduced into the building. My building has roaches, we will never be rid of them but we were able to drastically reduce the number getting into our unit by covering the vents with window screen. We also have glue traps spread around the unit to monitor for roaches, we catch the occasional one which is much better than the seeing multiple everyday all day we had before. 

Bad management doesn't help, here they insist only dirty places and dirty people have roaches (not true). When ever I report seeing them I'm told no one else is complaining about them.... I feel it's probably that most tenants have simply given up or don't see it as a problem.",1696118562.0

From my own experiences with threatening situations, it's like there's a second, detached-from-your-consciousness part of your brain that instantly makes a rough calculation of: - *""If I tried to fight back, would I reasonably be able to win or escape, or would it risk further aggression? - If I tried to flee, would that work without escalating the situation/is fleeing an option?""* And if both of those are 'No', the brain sometimes goes into Fawn if the threat seems available/open at all to at least *some* communication, and freeze for anything else. 

So I think it might have to do with that quick rough judgement about how well you'd fare against the threat. Men usually have the physical advantage, and women are also socialized to be harmless and to fear harm, so those might contribute too.",1696118563.0

"chaosmagick","t5_2usek","Because encouraging individualism does not allow a lot of room for control and order. Any group sustains itself through some level of coherence - requiring group morals, rules, traditions or practices. If all members of a group were required to create and execute unique and self-generated morals, rules, traditions or practices they would be too different to one another to cohesively remain in a single group. 

Chaos Magick is a very good example of what you're looking for. Rather than being a cult, order or religion, it is a philosophy used to inform an individual's practice. Many many Chaos Magick Covens or Orders have been attempted, but it's like herding rabbits. 

You might ask yourself why you require a solid organisation of others to explore these ideas? If what you're looking for is individual creation, why must it come from community?

Furthermore, there actually are communities that hold these morals. You're posting in one right now. Also look at Discordianism. These are just two off the top of my head. There very likely many more I don't know of.",1696118564.0

"AmazonVine","t5_28yu6q","1. Not understanding the tax implications has nothing to do with the program other than they are required to do so by law, in countries where they are not required tothe Amazon Vine program doesn't report anything. Unfortunately it would not be feasible to really have a guide for the US because there are so many factors to everyone's individual taxes that it'd be impractical. There are a majority of people that don't have much knowledge on their own taxes in which they should seek out professional help the moment taxes are mentioned and having to pay them if they have any concerns.

As for what your being taxed on, it's on the same window that pop's up in order to even request the item clearly stating it's estimated taxable value. If it's not for some reason there may be some compatibility problems with the web browser your using. There's been some people reporting that the tax value can change after they request an item but personally I haven't seen it, but definitely something to look out for.

2. The rule about not being able to give the item away or sell it for 6 months is there just to keep people from abusing the program. In actuality they don't really have a way to enforce it or even monitor it, but it's a rule nonetheless which they might be able to enforce in certain circumstances, but likely it is also there to protect the sellers of the items since they pay Amazon for being in the program as well as pay the typical shipping for the items. Your also considering that Amazon is charging you for the item which is not true at all, it's the government that is charging you, so these are totally separate from each other. The condition that you keep the free item for 6 months has nothing to do with owing any taxes on them at the end of the year.

3. There is Vine support you can email at any time using the Vine help button on the top of the Amazon Vine website, it would be nice if they made it a little more clear to use that to ask any questions. As with any customer service the quality and truth you get can vary depending on the representative that answers but generally I've have good experience with them. Amazon cannot officially link or promote reddit or Facebook groups for liability purposes, but it would be nice if they did have some sort of forum. Then again the information you'd get would be subject to the same problems with customer service.

You have legitimate questions and concerns and believe you were just frustrated and venting on your original post saying the program is ruined by these problems. Occasionally they send out a survey email on the program so that is a good opportunity to present these concerns. If you feel the tax burden is the biggest issue, reach out to your local Congress representative and senator, while neither have absolute authority over the issue, they are your direct contact for most of what you seem to be upset about. I think you'll enjoy the program more now that you have a better understanding, have fun",1696118565.0

Roughly translated back: ""Regarding this announcement, one has closed it for discussion.""

\----

Here the deeper grammatical structure:

`my- íy-t         pyno    lojaba-s  tos      xel-dok`  
`thing-shout-DEF IND.PRF close-REL DAT.ABST speech-against`

Sentences in Xelbek follow this format:  
*Topic - Auxverb - Subject - Main verb - Direct object - Other objects*

Subjects or direct objects can also be suffixes of the auxverb or main verb respectively.

The topic of a sentence might also serve as a subject or object if there is a relative pronoun or particle. This always points to whatever stands before the auxverb.

In this case, ""*my íyt*"" serves as both the topic and the direct object of the sentence because of the relative suffix ""*-s*"" after ""*lojaba*"".",1696118565.0

If he tried with a toy, then he was given a non-humpable toy and the humping toy was removed from rotation. If he tried to hump a person that person was instructed to stand up and walk away. If he was insistent then it was instant nap time.

Humping can be a habit and hard to break if you‚Äôve let it go on for some time. Desexing your dog will generally not stop it, especially if it‚Äôs already a pattern. It‚Äôs just a way to release energy and sometimes it‚Äôs just what a dog does. It doesn‚Äôt hurt anything and a lot of people will get a toy that‚Äôs just for humping.

"USMC","t5_2qswv","Interesting discussion on this thread. I haven‚Äôt seen it mentioned yet, but I think the moral issues and reputation that would be created by embracing steroid use are a huge thing to consider. If steroid use was facilitated and encouraged, non-users would likely face a lot of pressure to participate, especially in occupations where physical performance is more important. This would cause strife within the USMC and damage its public reputation. Most civilians would not approve of an organization that pushes fresh, high school graduates to go on gear. For these reasons, I think turning a blind eye to PED use is the most lenient the military will ever be",1696118566.0

"kansascity","t5_2qngc","OP, I think if you're able to provide a good service, at a good price, that you would be successful. Emphasis on ""at a good price"". Of course, this is difficult for a variety of reasons, especially because most places in KCMO have around 10% sales taxes, even more if you're within a block or two of the streetcar route. 

Personally with the way the economy is, everyone I know, at all income levels, are reducing their discretionary spending. My friends and I are going to bars and restaurants less, and when we go, we are ordering less drinks, or lower cost options. I think most other people are the same. 

If you can manage to price alcoholic beverages at $6 or less (for at least some options) and food, if you're doing it, at under $15 for an actual meal, I think you could have wild success. If instead it would be one of those places where it's closer to $10 a drink and $20-25 for a meal, well, it better be one of the most delicious places in the city with the most impeccable service. 

We've seen actually great bars and restaurants go under over the past few years, largely due to effects from the pandemic. To be truly successful I think you need to do something that no one else is doing, or at least something that they aren't doing very well. 

Also if there's no patio on which to smoke cigarettes I'd have no interest going there, and I think a lot of people would feel the same way. We still have a much higher than average number of smokers here. For example if I go out to drink at a bar, I really won't even consider going unless they have a patio I can smoke on.

Det sjuka √§r pappa har ber√§ttat lite hur det gick till. P√• den tiden var det ju kassetter man anv√§nde och det fanns ju liksom inte n√•gon k√§lla som sa om n√•gon artist sl√§ppt en skiva. S√• min pappa hade ju sina favorit artister och gick f√∂rbi kassettbutiken varje vecka f√∂r att kolla om n√•gon sl√§ppt n√•got. En dag g√•r han f√∂rbi och fr√•gar och till slut blev personen som jobbade d√§r arg p√• honom och sa: ‚Äùtror du de sl√§pper musik varje vecka eller?? H√§r, ta och k√∂p den h√§r kassetten, det √§r ett svenskt band med tv√• tjejer och tv√• killar‚Äù det visade sig vara ABBA hahaha. Sjuka tider..

Ja vi har √•kt tillbaka men det var m√•nga √•r sen nu. G√•r typ inte att √•ka d√• jag m√•ste g√• lumpen och vi vill heller inte bidra till landet med tanke p√• hur det styrs och ser ut just nu. J√§tte intressant med bostad och SFI. De blev ju placerade i n√•gon liten by eller stad och fick en bostad och det sjuka var att de hade m√∂jlighet att v√§lja f√§rg p√• v√§ggar, lite inredning etc. (Helt otroligt att de fick den m√∂jligheten). Mina f√∂r√§ldrar valde v√§ldigt snabbt att l√§ra sig svenska f√∂r de 1. Tvungna f√∂r att g√∂ra livet l√§ttare men 2. F√∂r att de ville bidra och bli en del av samh√§llet. S√• b√•da gick SFI och ganska snabbt b√∂rjade jobba p√• Eriksson.

St√∂rsta kulturchocken var v√§ll √§nd√• att svenskar √§r v√§ldigt reserverade och kanske inte v√§rldens mest ‚Äùvarma‚Äù m√§nniskor. I Iran √§r ju folk v√§ldigt n√§rg√•ngna, √∂ppna, varma osv osv och det var lite sv√•rt tror jag. Men den st√∂rsta chocken av de alla var ju sj√§lvklart v√§dret. √Ñn idag sv√§r de √•t v√§dret haha (p√• skoj sj√§lvklart)",1696118570.0

Regardless, at the end of the day, there is no Bi police. You can be bi, you can be homoflexoble, you can me mostly a lesbian, just a lesbian, or questioning.

It just comes down to finding a label that describes who you are attracted to and you and communicates it to others.

Even WW1 New Mexico would be more welcome to the game. With so many Ships that accomplished so much missing in this game, it annoys me that the Devs would prefer to complete their USN BB collection with the arguably the least effective and used class of BBs in WW2.

Point is, it's only a tragedy if you resist the natural changes that come with advancements. We can't artificially prop up outdated industries just to maintain tradition.

They're most famous as a trio, but they were actually four during their first stint of popularity in the 70s. The fourth member, another female, left following allegations of having had an affair with the lead singer's partner. Shortly after, during the Sanremo Festival, she got a court order that reinstated her into the band (I wonder what the legal basis was), but eventually decided not to perform with them during the final night of the show.

They reunited however for a recent tour celebrating the group's 50th anniversary, always at the Sanremo Festival.

The band members are from Genoa and earlier on got help and support from legendary songwriter Fabrizio De Andr√© and then from Franco Califano, another famous and rather peculiar singer.

It was the latter who named the band as they were ""rich in spirit but poor in money"".

Their 1981 hit ""Sar√† perch√© ti amo"" achieved international success and it has been covered with huge success in Sweden and Denmark, but the lyrics are about a guy being offered a one-night-stand by a hot girl at a club.

The tune has been humorously rewritten as a football/soccer chants, with the final line of the chorus mocking Juventus fans (them being the universally despised group among supporters of other clubs).

That version of the song got played at the Athletics European Championships in Poland last summer, creating a bit of a diplomatic incident with Juventus' board and fans. Sane fans just laughed at the DJ picking the wrong track and played along with the chorus.",1696118573.0

I agree that votes could be viewed as a poll, and that the poll could show people, no matter how small, that there's people in favor of a certain direction. 

But that's not the argument you laid out before that sent us down this path.

My vote -> contributes to larger pool of votes -> attracts DNC -> DNC attraction leads to effort & money spent towards the area -> election flips.

The locking bar for the open position is up front by the switch and when you push the switch forward to open the knife it is released and it rides along the top surface of the knife as it cycles before dropping into place behind the blade to lock it open. When you retract the  knife it is pulled up to unlock and then stays up until the switch is pushed forward again. 

With double edged blades there should be a notch ground into the locking bar so that it clears the edge better to reduce dulling.

He can be defined by one word: narcissist.  He is narcissistic to a degree that in his mind, it is just him. He lusts for his own daughter because he doesn't see family, it is him and then the rest of the world. He accuses others of things he does because he only knows what he does. He lies because he just speaks stream-of-consciousness and doesn't even care to keep his stories straight, he doesn't care enough. Everything is and always will be about him.

I agree with a lot of the comments. It's a bit of an unreasonable request to have without giving any sort of context behind it. You have to understand things from your in-laws' point of view. To be asked something like that with no reason behind it comes off as really accusatory. 

You may benefit from having a conversation with your husband about your boundaries, why you have them and what the expectations are when it comes to who is caring for your child and how. Your boundaries and the request you made isn't unreasonable, but the way you made your needs known is what caused all these issues.

"twinflames","t5_36lk4","I know exactly what you mean with the snap comment.  I am normally very stable mentally but when my tf walked away the first time I snapped but didn't show it to him. I acted as if I didn't care but secretly cried for MONTHS. But the real snap was when after 2 years I almost had the opportunity to see himin July and he acted like a straight jerk so I responded back 5x worse to hurt him. I hated that he was so calm and appeared emotionless. Me and his karmic are opposites. She's known him for over 15 years, pressures for kids, marriage..not that attractive (not trying to be mean). I do not want children, no pressure for marriage and I work in similar field as him while also modeling.


When we worked together I had at least 4 or 5 men who asked me out and turned them down. I was very focused on work. Until my tf and I started our friendship. It's funny because he asked me when we started dating why I was interested in him because he never thought I would be. He's actually not my ""type"" since he is short, corporate, serious type of guy but with ME he let all the guards down as did I and we clicked instantly. I think I also pushed him too hard this time so I'll have to face that consequence. Just hoping one day he will have an awakening and see I was trying to fight for him and love him so much.",1696118576.0

"HentaiAndRoleplayy","t5_3zthc3","Hey folks!  
  
I'm posting on behalf of my DM. We're playing a tabletop system called Kult, which focuses a lot on twisted and gritty themes in the modern world (which overlaps with a grimdark, magical version of it). This is a voice game, but our actual erp will be done via text! However, there will be heavy nsfw elements in our sessions, so please be comfortable with this if you plan to apply!  
  
That said, this is a story-focused game. We want genuine characters with interesting backstories integrated into the plot. So if you're here to go from one smut encounter to the next, this is not the game for you! Our DM prizes consent and comfort above all else, but as a group, we do enjoy very dark and heavy topics/themes/kinks (and we're very respectful of boundaries, consent, and just generally not being a creep ooc). If you will be triggered by these things, please do not apply for your own well-being and safety <3  
  
So far, we've stuck to Fridays at 8pm EST, but we do plan to be flexible and may play on Wednesdays instead. We'd like people who are open both days to avoid scheduling issues. In the future, we may stick to one or the other.  
  
There are three players already. We're all gals playing gals!  
  
If all of this looks grand to you, please send me a message for the google form!",1696118578.0

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","In your title, you mentioned incorporating as a S.P. which I assume you mean Sole Proprietor. This is very different from creating a corporation.

As a sole proprietor, you only file a T1 and all revenue is considered income and taxed at the same rate as if you were salaried. The only benefit is you can deduct business expenses which you wouldn't be able to as a salaried employee.

Create a corporation on the other hand is creating a completely new entity with its own tax filing (T2) and is taxed at a lower rate (small business tax rate since you wouldn't be making that much). Naturally, you'd need to pay yourself so you'd still need the corp to pay you a salary which would require you to file a T1 yourself and you'd pay the regular salaried tax rate on that salary. If any profit is left, then that would be taxed at a lower rate (small business rate).

Usually, 80k gross doesn't make it worthwhile for either one. Especially since you'd have added expenses you'd probably want to buy like disability insurance, critical illness insurance, and a bunch of other health related insurances unless you have a salaried spouse and you can be added to their salaried benefits through their own work.",1696118579

Idk of this really works well but I've gotten it to work a few times againt heros with slow heavies BUT you can try it. After landing a heavy finisher you can throw the bleed stab. If you can get them to try to parry it you may instead land the heavy then buffer a gb to try to catch dodges and parries.

When the oppent is bleeding you can enter pounce stance and just wait for the to dodge. Againt Most heros, you can wait and then react to the dodge and you can get the pounce.

Also you may already know this but light parries guarantee a pounce. Pounce into walls for a free heavy. Regular pounce guarantees zone as well as double lights.

Idk if it's confirmed but whenever I get a heavy parry or a gb I always heavy into soft feint bleed stab to co statly keep that pressure uo. Or you could obviously just heavy get the raw dmg and reduce the risk.",1696118580.0

You chose Elsa or Brave as your alternatives??? Could you get more white in an alternative? Are you sure this is out of respect toward blacks? I'm not seeing it. In short, you have an awesome chance to wear the hell out of that green princess dress and represent Tiana in your friends 1 special day, why not just be the best fucking princess you can be and have fun. Nobody expects you to be Tiana. You're her representing her dignitary, or just a woman in a green dress. Tiana doesn't represent the Black census, I do. If you want to show appreciation for something, pls stop gate keeping it. We have enough closed doors to push through. Your logic means it's bad for our daughters to sing about building snowmen or live with short men and take apples from strangers. That's not cool.

"tankiejerk","t5_136u9r","Why would they be coupled? Democracy is inherently egalitarian and capitalism is structurally hierarchical. If anything, capitalism is antithetical to the realisation of true democracy. It‚Äôs capitalism that needs to prove it can be compatible with democracy, which it can‚Äôt, because it ultimately isn‚Äôt.

With all that being said‚Ä¶ not every power structure is capitalistic, and power structures can and will crop up outside of it. The process of attempting to get rid of a given type of power structure through disruptive means will necessarily create momentary turmoil and opportunities for newer or different ones to take its place.

What we, as socialists, need to prove, is that we are indeed capable of providing a credible plan out of the current situation that effectively dismantles the status quo while also safeguarding against both its return and all kinds of threats that were not fully able to express themselves beforehand because capitalism was top dog and annihilated its own competitors. This is arguably exactly what happened in the past, and unless we can provide a good solution, further attempts may be in similar danger.

This is not specific to our goals and has more to do with the nature of any structurally transformative process. Change is unstable, in fact, that‚Äôs the entire point. But you should still try to change, because the alternative is worse, and we didn‚Äôt get all the way here by hiding in our caves and refusing to innovate. The methods for harnessing fire, making metal tools out of ore from the ground, and radically altering our way of life by creating agriculture were incredibly risky, and came with a host of various crippling negative downsides. So were the ones to abolish feudalism and remove the monarchs, to end slavery, and those to eradicate polio. So were the ones to remove the fascists the first time around. Yet we humans were ultimately successful in all of these endeavors, even if we initially failed.

Make no mistake -the 20th century was a massive failure for socialism. This is a historical fact. But *the track record is in our favor*. People have always gathered up forces to heal and come back to fight for it another time. I would be lying if I said I knew how we are going to get there, or when, but we‚Äôve literally always stepped into the unknown having learned from our mistakes and improving on our first steps forward. You don‚Äôt get anywhere in life by learning to never falter, you do by learning to keep getting back up. These things take time.

So what about solutions? Safeguards? Accountability? Personally, I think we need to create a living, breathing, intellectual proletariat that can coordinate beyond what individuals can achieve. Our era has offered us the perfect tool for this -we are using it right now. For the first time in history ever, anyone from all over the world can discuss with anyone else at a massive scale in longform essays. We have to leverage our numbers, and synchronize. How to reach critical mass is tricky, but hopefully once we beat back against propaganda from decades past, and everybody has access to resources as to how to recognize who are true allies and who have their own personal agenda, we may start seeing results.

This will require the average person to have some moderate amount of sway in their life, and this generation is still young. But so many of us are progressive compared to our elders, and we seem so intent on actually wanting better, that I have optimism it can happen. I am convinced a real move away from capitalism and its influences, provided it comes with actual consciousness of how it can be hijacked, along with prevention tactics, and a focus on holding leaders accountable, with the willingness to replace them, could only strengthen democracy and the voice of the people.",1696118581.0

"SameGrassButGreener","t5_2u6j8","I think there are a few dynamics going on with different groups.

Group 1. Venturing off to seek your fortune.  
For most of the 1900s, these ambitious people were going to California.  I think cost of living and tax structure has made Texas the new destination for these folks.  It‚Äôs not perfect, but it‚Äôs hard to argue with economically.

Group 2: have achieved some financial success and stability, now seeking quality of life.  I think this is most of the people on this sub.  Covid was a wake up call that you don‚Äôt have to have an hour commute each way.  A little older and more established in their careers, they have more flexibility to work remotely.  They want 4 seasons (but mild summers and winters, of course), walkable neighborhoods, good schools, access to nature and recreation, and ideally a rational, functional local government that they don‚Äôt have to think about too much.  These people may have tried Texas, but aren‚Äôt buying it.

Group 3: struggling to get on the economic ladder.  
These people are looking for a place where median job will cover median expenses, and will allow them to get on the ladder.  The last three years of people moving, low interest rates, and excess capital, have distorted some markets in different ways.  These folks are a little younger, and don‚Äôt see a path forward in their current location, but generally need a job to move to.  External resources, like the social capital to have an available room to live from a relative, becomes a disproportionately large asset.

> 
> According to Baykar CEO Haluk Bayraktar, one of the investments is a drone production plant, construction of which has already begun. He also added that they plan to complete it in about one and a half years.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe have three main investments in Ukraine. One of them is a factory. Then we have a service center and also we have a headquarters office in here. [‚Ä¶] This investment, which is around $100 million, has already started. The construction has already started. It will take about one-and-a-half years to finish it. We are targeting minimum 300 people to work here. And we have ongoing cooperation,‚Äù Bayraktar said.
> 
> He also noted that this production will be self-sufficient, ecological and mutually beneficial, since Ukraine has unique technologies for the production of engines, and Turkey has drones on which these engines are installed.
> 
> ‚ÄúWe also have some challenges. The supply chain, sourcing and development of the human capital because of the effects of the war, and regulatory environment especially the regulations that will support these investments,‚Äù Bayraktar said.
> 
> According to him, the current war has become a war of unmanned aerial vehicles, and Ukraine has some advantages here, including due to the use of various types of aircraft, although it is difficult to implement. Feedback from the military on the use of technology is especially important under such conditions. That is why the Bayraktars used in Ukraine were equipped with a number of unique systems.
> 
> The CEO of Baykar also expressed support for Ukraine.
> 
> > ‚ÄúWe are not here to maximize our revenues or profits. We are here to maximize our support for you. We respect your fight for your freedom and independence, to keep your sovereignty,‚Äù Bayraktar said.
> 
> He said that all donations from Baykar, as well as from Ukraine and Poland, had been used, in particular, for the purchase of radar systems and they had already detected thousands of targets and brought significant results on the battlefield.
> 
> ‚ÄúThe total value of these donations is up to $106 million,‚Äù Bayraktar said.
> 
> He added that Baykar had also implemented a number of humanitarian initiatives, including sending humanitarian cargo and organizing a camp for Ukrainian children.

The Attorney General is a Democrat, so he's definitely not going to prosecute a politician for a misdemeanor that resulted in no physical harm or property damage.


And even if the Attorney General was a Republican, I doubt they'd waste time prosecuting unless there was a clear confession since it's a just misdemeanor with a $1000 fine. They have much bigger cases, and if the defendent envoked their right to trial by jury, all bets for conviction are off without a confession. Most likely the defendent would just plead guilty, pay $1000, and use the situation to campaign anyway.

- there seems to be a maximum of 1 or 2 rhynios in the wild at the same time
- you can't get them to spawn faster by killing other stuff

I've personally had the most luck with the swampy jungle in the middle of the map, I've found two separate ones at 57, 48.5. I've also seen one in the orange square on your picture, and today I saw one in the most right green square.

So if you hear people call him Alatus (actually its also his constellation name too iirc) then just know that translates to ""big cloud bird"" in english

If you call someone um ig like Holy Spirit and didnt translate it to chinese, most people would probably not realize that person's name is a reference to a dove. Sure the name is there but unless you are an Anglican Christian, you arent going to be able to put two and two together.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp",">In all honesty, this just shows how YouTube ""stars"" are mostly garbage people, and that US gun culture is seriously fucked.  When everyone is potentially strapped, you escalate quickly to ensure you survive the outcome.

Bwah ha ha ha ha ha.  I've heard many gun advocates say an armed society is a polite society. If people approached every interaction or exchange with another person as if that person was armed, I can see how things would be much more civil and polite.  

Unless you are an asshole YouTubeDudeBro prankster.  Even after getting shot he said he's gonna keep making videos. He must have serious brain damage from a previous prank to keep doing that after being shot. It's kinda sad that he has so little regard for his own life and well being.

Lots of big physically tall or strong bullies will stop after someone stands up to them a time or two. They learn that no matter how strong they are, or how well they fight, there will always be someone who is either stronger, or a better fighter or both. Wonder how many times YouTubeDudeBro prankster is gonna have to get shot before he rethinks his actions?",1696118584.0

So I explained to him how most of the type of guys who catcall aren't doing it to be complimentary or kind.

God forbid someone actually admit they have gear and don't find it fun and suddenly your story isn't real but all the other posts in here these same people are treating it like it's completely true. Shit's wild.

My group was the same way, it's actually just not fun, we ran Buff Ball day 1 of EA just dicking around and saw how OP it was just because my buddy wanted to try Bard for memes.

We ended up running that because you mostly had to in that meta, everyone remembers how bad that was but it was still the same shit.

Running through, one tapping people because we snowballed our gear.

It was boring AF for us so we left the game and haven't played since.

Devs can make the game they want, but I just don't see how people find that fun.

I watched Soda this week before this latest patch and saw time to kill was up and was excited, seems they don't want to go in that direction though which sucks since that's what I like.

"languagelearning","t5_2rjsc","A few things - first I think it depends on how closely related the new language is to the language(s) you already speak. Like my first language is English and I‚Äôm learning Spanish now as my third language. The beginning felt very easy because the two languages are closely related and have so much in common and I‚Äôve heard Spanish around me because I‚Äôm in the US and it‚Äôs the second most common language here, and then as I progressed it has started to feel harder past the beginning stage because now I have to start to handle the parts that are significantly different. But if I were learning a language that‚Äôs really distant from ones I know and which I haven‚Äôt had ambient exposure to, I think the beginning would be the hardest. Like I briefly looked at Ukrainian and very quickly was like, oh it would take forever for me to even have the first clue what‚Äôs going on in the simplest conversation. 

But I also agree with the commenter saying you hit a wall in the future where it becomes really hard to go from good to fluent. I‚Äôve also experienced that. I think it‚Äôs easy in the middle to get arrogant about language and think you‚Äôre better than you are and then you realize everyone‚Äôs been coddling you and you know much less than you thought.",1696118586.0

"DeepThoughts","t5_2qwm7","Okay, interesting question. First off, this may sound like an insult to teachers but it's not. Teachers aren't necessarily masters of the topic that they teach. So a teacher wouldn't really be able to tell you everything that you could do with math. Teachers become teachers because they like helping students. They like kids. Or they think they're suited for it. That's why it's mostly women. Because women generally are associated with raising children.

So, if you really want to know what people use math for, don't necessarily ask a teacher. Ask yourself. Ask somebody who's very smart and intellectual. Actually, that's kind of what you've done here. You went to a website on a page where a bunch of people who think they're smart go and asked them.

Okay, so secondly, to answer your actual question.

People do use math. It is actually something that you use. I'm also not really sure what you mean by complicated mathematics. Are you referring to algebra? Algebra isn't that entirely complicated. It's kind of just an abstract thought. And actually, I think that's really what it comes down to. I think it's just mathematics with abstract thoughts. So, it's teaching you to be intelligent. Do you want to be a caveman? No. You don't. You might say that because you don't feel like doing math. But the truth is, what you want is to be the best prime form of yourself. And to do that, you need to be smart and intelligent. And if you're going to be smart and intelligent, you're going to look at mathematics with abstract thoughts. So that's what algebra comes down to. Imaginary numbers, things like that.

Then you've got statistics. And actually, statistics are very common in modern times. It's always on the news. It's always in every article that you read. Statistics, statistics, statistics. So, learning statistics is actually very helpful for the modern person. If you didn't learn statistics, you would be very liable to get Hoodwinked by a lot of the news articles and statistics that are used in the news. Because, statistics can be easily bluffed and exaggerated or lied about.

Then there's geometry. Now, I guess you don't really use geometry that often. But, I don't know. It's just higher level thinking.

I mean, based on your logic, what is even the point of going to school? I guess that's what you have to ask yourself here. And I think you would see where your logic is going wrong. Because, school is actually important.

I do think a lot of school is just daycare. And it's especially not helpful because modern society doesn't really allow us to connect with each other. So, if there's a struggling student, teachers often don't actually do a single damn thing to help them. Which is what school is actually supposed to be about. Enrichment.

. So I guess that's what it boils down to. Enrichment.",1696118586.0

"LiesOfP","t5_4g4ood","Your post is the type of post that is coping hard because you're one of the players that cheeses their way through the game.

What other bosses in Elden Ring that have attacks that accelerate so quickly you can't respond to them after little to no telegraphing when the acceleration will happen? At best you will be able to name one attack for a very small amount of bosses, like godskin noble's belly blast. They are in the extreme minority. Most attacks in lies of p are like that 

And I'm not mad because I can't fulfill what my ego wants, I have been no hitting the bosses in lies of p, with most of them only being with perfect guards. So I have nothing to be mad about. What's annoying is bad players acting like criticisms of the game aren't legitimate because they traded and healed their way through fights and think everyone else should be happy using brain dead strategies.

"de","t5_22i0","Japp, das kommt von rechts.

Das Framing, dass dahinter steht ist, dass rechte Ideen der Grundzustand w√§re, normal, unpolitisch. Dementsprechend sind alle Abweichungen von diesem ""unpolitischen Normalzustand"" - die Darstellung nicht-wei√üer oder nicht-heterosexueller Figuren in Medien etwa - automatisch Ideologie. Und die wird nat√ºrlich von au√üen auferlegt, den ""normalen"" Leuten aufgezwungen, obwohl die das gar nicht wollen und das Werk, das unpolitisch zu sein habe - also rechts - w√ºrde damit verunreinigt und entwertet. An der Stelle sind wir dann nat√ºrlich auch wieder auf haaresbreite an der sogenannten Entarteten Kunst des dritten Reichs angelangt.

Implizit hab ich es schon gesagt, ich will es aber auch explizit tun: Selbstverst√§ndlichkeit ist ein Festhalten am angeblichen Status Quo, am eingebildeten Normalzustand, ebenso politisch. Wenn ein Werk eine rein wei√üe, rein heterosexuelle Gesellschaft abbildet, dann ist das nicht unpolitisch. Diversit√§t abzulehnen zu sein ist eine politische Forderung.

Der Slogan der AfD bei der letzten BTW lautete √ºbrigens ""Deutschland - aber normal"". Da sieht man schon, wie gef√§hrlich diese Erz√§hlung √ºber einen angeblichen erstrebenswerten Normalzustand ist und wie dieses ""normal"" definiert ist.",1696118588.0

I just think Brad was just a bit of a late bloomer. Probobly spent his late teens expecting to spend his life on the vineyard, before getting inspired by the 'Ad Astra, Per Aspera' poster, and signing up when he was ~20. Graduated at 24, and turned 25 on the Cerritos.

From what I can tell, Brad, Tendi and Rutherford may have all overlapped at the academy, but likely weren't in the same year group, or even the same division, so wouldn't have likely came across one another. Tendi would have been at the Starfleet Medical Academy like. But Mariner was well ahead of them all. However with Rutherford, there's a very inconsistent timeline. The writers definitely didn't keep to the same track with that one. Because we 'know' he had been working on Douglas Station before joining the Cerritos crew in 2379, and was cybernetically enhanced 'as of a few weeks ago' from Stardate 57436.2 (8th June 2380). However the whole incident with Buenamigo which caused him to get the implant supposedly happened during his first year at the academy, also on Douglas Station. And there's frankly no way to reconcile these two 'facts'. Considering Mariners familiarity with Rutherford in S1E1, he had clearly been there a while. Longer than 'a few weeks'.

"Michigan","t5_2qhtl","So up until 4 years ago I lived my whole life in SE Michigan.  I loved it, but graduated college in 2010 and it was just ‚Äúyou either work for a car company, a restaurant or you didn‚Äôt work‚Äù and the career places knew it too.  I remember sitting in interviews competing against guys my dads age after auto layoffs which drove salaries suuuper low from all the competition, while every yeah all those colleges churned out more and more kids with computer science degrees.  It just seemed like 90% of the tech stuff in Michigan was service desk hell. 

I rolled the dice and moved to San Antonio and practically tripled my income which allowed me to get a house and start a family.  It sucks, almost all my friends and family are up there, and while I do work from home and could move back if there‚Äôs ever a call for returning to the office I‚Äôd be screwed.  

Not shoveling snow or chiseling ice off my car is nice, as well as not having to worry about my car rusting from salt and it‚Äôs lovely to not have to drive on roads full of potholes but I‚Äôll be honest in the back of my mind I find myself wondering if I haven‚Äôt doomed my small family to being climate refugees down the line.",1696118589.0

Now this is the thing the rent in her area lowest goes for $1,200 even apartments. She got a deal because she knew the leasing lady for her duplex so she pays $1,000. Here‚Äôs the thing her electricity is average $500 thanks Texas! Her fridge is always unplugged her oven is too. The ac is turned off most of the time and when it is turned on she doesn‚Äôt set it any lower than 78 even on days it‚Äôs 112 degrees. Multiple AC guys have been out and said it‚Äôs not the AC it‚Äôs a new machine. She doesn‚Äôt have a TV so nothing plugged in. I can say when I lived in her area my electricity was typically $6-700 a month in a one bedroom home it‚Äôs normal for the area and yes we checked it‚Äôs the lowest pricing in the area. We‚Äôve contacted the company and the leasing company and they both found nothing wrong on multiple visits. That alone is pushing $1,500 a month just rent and electricity. With all the other bills included she‚Äôs maxed out. Sometimes she does have an extra $200 a month or more but her job doesn‚Äôt offer dental or healthcare so sometimes that money gets put towards her healthcare needs. Also no Texas has absolutely no benefits for her she makes too much money and has no children. She also needs mental health days where yes she will go buy a new pair of $20 sneakers every few months or go buy a meal from Chick-fil-A but honestly I looked over all her finances and it literally just goes to overpriced bills and health needs. Even weekends suck for her. She is on call this weekend so she can‚Äôt go and do anything or take on another job she takes work calls all day/night. They only pay her $30 for the whole weekend for it and she has to use her personal cell phone. She also has to go to her work once a day on call for surprise check ins this weekend. We did talk about getting her set up for the delivery gig jobs but she‚Äôs worried her car will give up faster. The car shop told her she‚Äôs lucky if it lasts until the end of the year.

I‚Äôm 37 weeks pregnant now so I expect the current total lack of sex but it‚Äôs definitely not because I don‚Äôt want to, even in my current state. He‚Äôs excited to be a dad and talks about how much he loves me and wants to be with me, but I can‚Äôt see myself staying in a dead bedroom. Back when we used to have sex multiple times a week I could see myself marrying him, but when he talks about getting married now I just kind of wait for him to get ADHD and change the topic because I think it‚Äôs bad enough being tied down with a baby I can‚Äôt throw legal proceedings into the mix too. I definitely feel tricked because when he was courting me there was all kinds of affection and intimacy and attention that disappeared once he got me to say I love you.

The woody bits on the outside we consider ""bark"" are all just dead layers of old skin/cambium they keep for protection, the tree above doesn't even have older bark, leaving the cambium vulnerable. The outer layer(bark) is also the only think alive on a tree. All the interior is deadwood sealed off from the environment. Yes it protects the tree and that's why the young tree was vulnerable to having its bark rubbed. Because it wasn't thick enough to protect the tree. Saying the deer doesn't recognise that and find a bit of sap while rubbing is pretty offensive to the deer as well. They'll eat what they can get, they're not gonna pass up on some bark while the sugars are pumping thru it.

You really need to pickup context clues better and learn when you're wasting people's time with Semantics.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","This is prolly gonna surprise you,  but because we have guns here, people don‚Äôt poke or shoot people up the way I have heard that it goes in the UK.  Almost any situation you could solve with a gun you could solve with a boot knife, and if not, having a gun would just be an extra thing you would lose being robbed.  As long as you have some street sense it‚Äôs actually fairly easy to stay safe in America.

If you seriously don't know how a bar works as an adult man, for the love of god go to one on your own first so you don't appear visibly confused when you take a girl out.

This isn't rocket science. Just get out of the house more so you don't get overwhelmed by the simple prospect of going to a bar.

If you only get out and do things with women on first dates, they will immediately sense your lack of ease. Find a way to develop a semi-active social life where leaving the house is part of your actual weekly routine and not something you save just to impress women. That way, you actually have a worthwhile life that they can join. And you won't have drinks as the only option for dates. You'll have other activities that you can propose that you actually enjoy.

If you do decide on drinks for dates, don't go to Applebee's. You're a grown man, not a high schooler. Find something that isn't a strip mall chain shithole.

Basically, just get a life. Get used to going to unfamiliar places. Then this process won't seem so daunting.",1696118592.0
