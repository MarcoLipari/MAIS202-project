"Damnthatsinteresting","t5_2xxyj","Using a watch as a compass

To use your watch as an approximate compass outside of the tropics in the northern hemisphere, hold the watch horizontal and point the hour hand at the sun.

Half way between that point and the twelve o'clock mark on your watch points to the south. For example, if it is eight o'clock, point the 8 on the watch face at the sun and south would be at the ten o'clock position. If it is four o'clock, point the 4 on the watch face at the sun and south would be in the two o'clock position. At midday (twelve o'clock), the hour hand itself should point south.

The method of halving the angle between the hour hand and the twelve o'clock watch position is required since the earth rotates once in a day, but the hour hand goes around the clock face twice.

In the southern hemisphere, hold the watch horizontal and point the twelve o'clock mark in the direction of the sun. The north-south line is half way between the hour hand and the twelve o'clock mark.

Using a watch to determine direction within the tropics is more complicated, since there are two solar maxima. The sun may lie to the north or south (or at midday be directly overhead), depending upon the time of the year.

Because time on our planet is divided into 24 broad time zones, the sun is not normally directly south or at its highest point in the sky at exactly midday. The watch-as-compass method is therefore an approximate guide to direction only. The most exact method of finding direction without using a compass is to mark and measure the shadows that occur around midday. The shortest shadow cast by an object always points exactly north.

To find where the sun is on a cloudy day, hold a pencil or stick upright over a light piece of paper or a lighter part of the ground. The stick or pencil will cast some kind of shadow, indicating the position of the sun.",1667260800

"KUWTKsnark","t5_5mhcrd","I have an actual theory. 

So, there's this ep on S22 of ANTM where they do a doll photoshoot. And Tyra comes in and gives them a little workshop on how to pose like a doll from her days as playing Eve in Life Size. The winner of that week, [Lacey](http://mformodels.blogspot.com/2015/09/antm-cycle-22-8th-episode-living-life.html?m=1), did the same face. 

My theory is Kendall went looking for inspiration for her Jesse, and found this, and ran with it. The reason it looks so odd is because Jesse wasn't meant to be a plastic Barbie type doll, the way they were according to the concept of that photoshoot. The doll was floppy, not fixed. Hence the disconnect.

"baseballcards","t5_2u5oo","It’s a crap shoot at the end of the day, but there can be opportunities out there.  With that said I think most of the collecting community tends to keep their favorites close to the vest.

Good opportunities tend to be found with buying low on highly touted rookies that underperformed in their initial debut, players who’ve added loft when they already had gaudy EV, and prospects in the 2nd half of the top 100 or just outside it.  

Pitchers are typically less coveted in the hobby, which means their value doesn’t climb as high, but it also means that the market can be slow to adjust.  This can lead to some nice buy low opportunities as well.  Older, late developing guys can also be a nice buying opportunity, but the margin for error with those guys is quite thin since they might not have that many shots to prove it left in their career.

At the end of the day you have to do you own research and make your own calls, but don’t let people make it seem like it can’t be done.  There will always be risk and busts but if the hits do well enough they can easily cover the misses assuming you aren’t buying high on hyped guys.",1667260801

"Diablo","t5_2qore","I like both. For completely different reasons. 

D3 is easy. I can reach max level and put a decent build together in a day. And by then end of day 2, I'm playing the build I want and slowly improving it. Then I'm just mindlessly running rifts and relaxing. Multi-player is good, but not necessary.

D2 is tough. It takes a while and some help to get through the hell difficulty. And as soon as you complete hell and really start farming for gear, those people I used to like playing with are now the people grabbing loot faster than me, and I hate them all. There are builds I want to play, but may never accumulate the wealth to be effective or efficient with them. But as a result, every bit of progress is a fight and feels more rewarding.

When I'm in a mindset that losing can be fun, I play D2. When I'm about to throw the controller at the TV, I switch to D3. Both are great games. Both are worthy of investing hundreds of hours. Both are fun for different reasons. The only reason people say that one is better than the other is because they value one type of fun more than another.",1667260801

But that's just a drop in the bucket when it comes to how out of character everyone acts in this outing, consistently. Basic facts about characters (Luka is a reporter and currently working for Rodin as of Bayo 2, Jeanne and Bayonetta live together, etc.) go completely ignored, and nothing about the characters or their lives outside of the plot is ever commented on.  


Hell, they don't even take the time to explain what the antagonist wants or how he's able to martial a multidimensional universe destroying army that eliminates all resistance.

"Xenoblade_Chronicles","t5_2vcc3","So there are some blades that are guaranteed from specific core crystals (like the dlc ones I mentioned before or Wulfric) gatcha just means pulling from regular, rare, and legendary core crystals. It's called gatcha as that's the general term for a system like this, in refrence to gatchapon's, japaneese capsule toy machines, which inspire the general mechanic of luck-based character pulling. Games like Fire Emblem Hero's or Raid: Shadow Legends are examples of gatcha, though those are more predatory as you pay real world money for pulls whereas you can earn unlimited blade pulls after the one time purchase of Xenoblade 2 and barring paying for the dlc (which only grants a small additional amount and that all comes with the bonus of the Torna expansion) you can't purchase extra core crystals with irl cash. And to my knowledge, barring a few exceptions like the special 500k core in Gormott's shop, there aren't any cores for traditional sale (though they also can be bought in NG+ with bonus XP, though it is generally just better to raise the arduin in the gormott farm area as when full grown he becomes a level 99 unique who can be farmed for legendary cores fairly easily). 

Spend your cores fairly regularly, but save for now. Odds are you've pulled most of the currently available rare blade pool and more become available as time goes on.

There are some pretty great common blades, in fact there are a few skills exclusive to them like Orb Master which isn't great at your current point in the story, but after you get a specific mechanic in chapter 3, is a really solid ability. They can also function as stat sticks, some Blades (like afformentioned Crossette) benifit from not being swapped off of as they get damage stacking or other benifical effects so long as they are on the field and haven't died during a battle, but lose them if swapped off. You can then use commons on characters using a blade like that along with certian rare and higher core chips to up important stats for their drivers like strength or agility. They may not have much in the way of being unique, but they have good stuff for them. Additionally, when raising a common (which is generally much easier than a rare) once you max our their chart, you you can release them for greater rewards (and finishing their chart grants some inherent rewards as well you'll want anyway). It gets easier to raise them in time btw so don't go trying to grind a bunch out now.

Additionally, commons can have extra copies of abilities like botany or forestry which the more copies/higher levels of said skill you have of it generally the more drops you get from collection points. This obviously has a cap and doesn't scale well, but keep it in mind if you happen to need some random fish drop and your best fishing skill blade is unavailable at that time for one reason or another.",1667260801

I have literally sent you peer reviewed research showing raising minimum wage reduces employment (be it both jobs and/or hours). Automation takes time and capital. As the price of labor increases, the search and more importantly the willingness to pay for labor substitutes increases. This is basic supply and demand economics. The CEPR article you sent shows this as well. The Center for American Progress is a liberal think tank founded by John Podesta and chaired by Tom Daschle.

After i have had a play I'll decide which one to stick with. But ill be using the aftermarket software with the pcpanel. Either way the turnup does everything it says and looks good.

And I did leave, but now I have flashbacks and lots of questions and I feel I would regret if I do not ask to help me understand, while in therapy at the same time. Clearly I got “used to” the stuff he says and I became calm and not jumpy on the inside, but something on the inside told me to run for my life. Now I learned I grew up in DV situation was raised by a single parent who is abusive, though I try to minimize in my mind the abuse in order to have some kind of relationship with my parent. No contact is better but then I won’t have any family. I recently learned that all the men in my family was abusive and went to jail. I thought that would break me down, but surprisingly, I feel calmer and better knowing all that and wonder why no one told me that earlier, I though I was crazy this whole time. Parents need to tell their kid the real story to give them closure, but if they don’t, what can we do. Just live our life with our loyal pet and try to make friends with healthy people who are not abusive.

I had image in my mind like what if he hit me on the head with a gun, that would hurt a lot and I wasn’t waiting to find out anymore.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","For the average middle American person, wealth inequality is the number one issue that dominates their lives even if they don’t discuss it in the terms that people from the coasts do.

Every single one of my MAGA or MAGA adjacent friends sound like Karl Marx when they talk about America, even though they have been taught (really just conditioned, like in a cult) to respond to socialism with extreme, almost pathological distrust. 

This gives us a strange horseshoe situation where rural cons and big city succs strangely have a lot in common though they absolutely hate each other because of differences in lifestyle, biased right wing media and, above all, differences in attitude towards religion.

Meanwhile the center is left out because the populist wings of both parties consider the center to be responsible for the current economic situation.

How do we solve the problem? Through economic policy that is pragmatic and good for the free market while also being progressive. This is tricky, but I think can be done through the modernization of American infrastructure and an increase on income taxes for the rich, while keeping corporate taxes low. 

We also need to find leaders that can bridge the gap between the intellectualism that coastal elites respect, humble origins that coastal progressives and middle Americans respect and some sense of spiritual drive. Such leaders are probably key to uniting the country even as most of the “deep state” positions are manned by coastal Ivy leaguers.

So far Buttigieg and Biden are the Dems best able to manage this balancing act though Biden’s raw leadership abilities is stunted by poor public speaking ability. 

The reality is, we probably need 20-30 Biden’s and Buttigieg’s to make it through the challenges of the next twenty years. We need to start looking for them today.",1667260805

"AskPhotography","t5_2t96o","**Lighting**

This photo is starting to veer into accidental silhouette territory: the subject (the building) is much darker than the sky, as well as the street to the left of the frame. 

Looking at the shadows, you're shooting into the sun. It's not midday sun, since the shadows are a little long, but you haven't caught golden hour either. 

Since you can't move the building, you either need to find the right time of day (assuming this was taken in evening, I'd bet on sunrise) or move so you can get a perspective on the subject that's well lit. 

**Composition**

Composition is secondary to lighting. It isn't about how you position your subject in your frame, rather it's how your position your subject relative to the light. 

That said, I do see a few distracting elements in the scene: notably, the signs, and the pedestrians that are in the shadow. 

It's not a bad image! And you can fix some of the lighting trouble via Lightroom masking. But the reason why you find it to be ""not an exciting photo"" is because you're not working with exciting light.",1667260807

OP, I want to tell you something that my husband told me before I started nursing school:

I was reading through this subreddit, FREAKING the FUDGE out thinking that nursing school was miserable and that I was destined to hate it. I cried to my husband complaining to him and worrying when he gently reminded me “the people that have the most horrible and extreme stories are the people that are most likely to post on these types of subreddits. They need a place to vent, and Reddit is a good place too - however, there are a large number of people on there I’m sure that have had a great experience in nursing school or at least a pretty normal one”. It made so much sense to me. From then on, I decided to let myself experience nursing school instead of expecting the worst and just waiting for something horrible to happen like I had seen on Reddit.

Yet she tells stories about how when she was a teenager they siphoned gas for fun, drove around and knocked over mailboxes, stuffed potatoes into mufflers, basically kidnapped, tarred and feathered a grumpy old neighbor, drove through a brand new wooden fence of that same grumpy old neighbor, etc, all with great nostolgia.

The thing is back in the 40s-90s there wasn't constant video surveillence showing it. The brutal things highschoolers and middleschoolers did back in the day while being labeled as ""kids will be kids"" or ""boys will be boys"" is absolutely gutwrenching if you truly take time to talk to someone that grew up in the 40s-70s. Obviously kids still do terrible things today as well.

 The biggest problem I am seeing is that this neighborhood is forcing people to celebrate major holidays. 

Major holiday is poorly defined, and depending who decides can mean forcing people to celebrate anywhere from 5 holidays to more than 30 holidays. Some holidays are also not 1 day only but can last up to a month. 

Some Major Holidays are also contraindictory. What if I am forced to celebrate a holiday that goes against my beliefs? Would this neighborhood force me to celebrate Columbus Day when I would rather celebrate US Indigenous People's Day? 

Also. No way am I going to put of decorations for every single holiday. What even sort of decorations would I put up for something like Valentine's Day or Labor Day? The cost and waste that would come out of that would be far too much trouble than is worth.",1667260808

"Rogers","t5_2t1cc","You said in the other thread you were getting it at the Apple store though? I have no idea if they use the same program as Rogers associates do for adding the phone.


Anyway if you get it from a Rogers store, the 'up to $250 off your balance' offer would be something that's tagged on your account. If you saw it online or texted to you, they'd also see it on their end. Was it the store employee or call center employee who said there's no offer for up to $250 off the balance? A lot of call center employees are bad, whereas if you work in-store, you're dealing face to face with people who tend to hold their work to a higher standard and making things right when justified/within reason of what they can control.

Regardless, it's not a matter of 'not honoring' it as much as it's whether the rep is looking in the right spot and clicks the right things to make sure it gets waived. And on their end, it may have been ""sent"" to the 'accepted offers' tab of your account due to the initial order placed online... but it should still be discoverable if they know where to look/what to do.


Also to your point in the other thread... if your order hasn't shipped yet, there's no way it should take 24 hours to re-add a phone... unless the issue was something credit related that required additional approval. Otherwise it should be immediately after it's cancelled.

The Mazda3s are really nice as well, but have next to no aftermarket, especially cosmetically. I recommend these as long as you plan on doing the basics like wheels and tyres, coils, exhaust etc.

After doing plenty of research on Lancers myself, I've seen a lot of bad things said about their ATs.

You can get AWD G37xs coupes but they were very rare to find when I was looking. I recommend these as well since the aftermarket for VQs is massive and they are well known to be bulletproof

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

&gt;◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ｘ What does this mean?

&gt;◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

&gt;◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

The other thing that 'impacts' hitch-based bike carriers is... wait for it... impacts.  If the assembly slams around, that can be bad for the hitch and its mounting. There are 'snubbers' that you can install at the receiver-to-carrier joint that you can tighten to eliminiate damaging impacts.

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","My late father was the Storyteller and DM since the late 1970;s He ran a long lasting Chronicles of Darkness game, he left notes about all of the games he was a part of, one note for each session regardless of his role in the game (player or storyteller he did both). His notes about the CoD games say that he used the settings of the old White wolf games, and the rules of the CoD also known as the New World of Darkness system. He liked the new wod rules better. Anyway based on his notes and being crazy smart I might be able to run a good game for others. I picked up pathfinder 1st edition in only 2 weeks and was able to run a fun game. The problem is, it's hard to get good players willing to let a child run a game for them.

"slaythespire","t5_3hbbd","It does mitigate it. Going drom 3 choices down to 1 is worse than going from 4 down to 2.  To give am example, lets say that you have a 1/4 chance of srawing a 'good' card.

Going from 4 to 2 drops your odds about 25% while going from 3 to 1 drops them by 33%. In terms of rations 4-2 reduces your odds by a factor of 1.59. From 3-1 its a factor of 2.31",1667260811

"SeattleWA","t5_2vbli","The CDC used two studies. One used it on patients who had been in ICU for an average of 17 days. That was intended to show failure since it is only effective within 72hrs of infection. To demonstrate toxicity, they held another study, with 2400mg. According to the WHO, which lists it was one of ten absolutely necessary drugs to be included in any international care physician's kit, they suggest a dosage of just 400mg. It has been used for decades and for literally billions of people throughout Africa, South Asia, Eastern Europe and South America. The scientist who discovered it and modified it from its fungal origin to human use won the Nobel Prize for it. If you'd like to see more information that doesn't come from Jimmy Kimmel, but rather actual researchers, I'll include a link at the conclusion of this post. The question about penicillin you ignored was to show that penicillin is used to treat Chlamydia in pigs, so just stating that a human medicine can also be used on other mammals is hardly a damning observation. Long story short: it has an 89% reduction in severe illness and death. The big issue with it was the fact that Merck had let its patent expire, so as a generic drug, a dose was just about thirty cents. Pfizer did the same with Bextra since Ibuprofen was so prevalent and inexpensive. This of course led to their record breaking financial penalty of six billion once people started getting strokes, cardiac events, etc. But hey, I'm sure this time they're totally on the up and up since Trump let them use Operation Warp Speed to hurdle a few protocols (and gave them absolute liability immunity). If you want a fun but terrifying read, check out their initial application for EUA from the FDA. It's about sixty pages. There is no, I repeat, no statement declaring efficacy for reduction of infection, transmission, or prevention of severe symptoms. In fact, they specifically say it does not prevent serious illness or death. It's sole claim is that it showed to marginally abate minor symptoms. This is their conclusion, not mine. A little less trust in US government agencies, late night talk show hosts, and the twelve trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry would be appropriate. Go to the source of people's assertions and read for yourself. It's been a very hectic and confusing time for all, but we're learning as we go. Best of luck to you. Sorry for the wordy post, but honestly it's just a fraction of what you'll find from a bit of hands on investigation. https://www.cureus.com/articles/82162-ivermectin-prophylaxis-used-for-covid-19-a-citywide-prospective-observational-study-of-223128-subjects-using-propensity-score-matching",1667260812

"TryingForABaby","t5_2sil5","There are two things, that I know of, that can prevent pregnancy after miscarriage. Retained product of conception (RPOC) and an infection called chronic endometritis. If you’re having regular periods and are not experiencing any new pain or other changes to your cycle, then the chances of this are fairly low, since both conditions are pretty rare.

I know it’s really easy to assume something’s wrong, especially when you got pregnant so quickly the first time. But you’re still within the normal timeframe for conceiving! 

And if something *is* wrong, trying for a little while is actually the first step towards diagnosing the problem. I know that’s discouraging, and I know the waiting sucks. 

So I recommend calling doctors and finding out when they’ll see you. They may let you set up the appointment in advance, or may be willing to do some basic tests right away.",1667260812

And the scalpers are taking them, separating them, and trying to sell the lowers for $800-900 and the uppers for $650-800, almost doubling their money.

"Lyme","t5_2rzlq","This was assumed when I was treated. I got tested, but after two weeks of doxy I was still experiencing severe symptoms and was positive for one of the markers. I was later treated with a few different antibiotics for a prolonged course along with TCM (3 weeks of lightning pearls for Lyme followed by 3 weeks of thunder pearls for any coinfections). 

I started getting sick about a month after the suspected tick bite, but am embarrassed to say that I didn’t even make the connection until I thought to mention it on the phone to the doctor several months after that, despite severe neurological symptoms and terrible pain in my teeth, head, and bones/joints where nothing of the sort had existed previously. In retrospect, my symptoms were classic pathogenic spirochete infection, but I’d been bit by so many ticks throughout my life that I’d thought nothing of it when I didn’t feel the bite (which is rare for me) and therefore didn’t remove it until a few days later, plus the symptoms took a month to surface so I simply didn’t make the connection. It was six months after that that I began treatment, and five months after that that I was cured (at the end of December).

I wouldn’t wish either Lyme or its coinfections on my worst enemy, and am so, SO relieved that, after trying many things, I finally found a combo that did the trick.",1667260813

"spiritisland","t5_mw8qk","They say ""power card"" a lot more often than ""power."" Power means either cards or innates, and there are relatively few effects that can apply to innates. Offhand, the only ones I can think of are fast/slow modifiers like Lightning's Boon, and range modifiers like Reaching Grasp.

Meanwhile ""power card"" is used for all the things that can't work with innates: so anything that has you gain/play/reclaim/discard/forget/etc. a power card, and anything involving the card's cost. Notably all the repeat effects (except when a power repeats itself) care about cost: Downpour, Earth, Powerstorm, Twinned Days, and this new Sun one.

Edit: There is a weird exception where they drop the ""card"" part when they specify Major/Minor/Unique, I guess because the ""card"" is implied (you can't exactly have a major innate power). So you'll see ""Gain a Minor Power"" or ""Gain a Power Card,"" but not ""Gain a Minor Power Card."" I kinda wish they hadn't done that, if only for consistency.",1667260813
"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","But Marx and Engels emphatically do *not* view society (or European society at least) as having the same structure or system throughout history. They see capitalism for example as rising out of the ashes of the previous structure of feudalism due to the rise of the bourgeoisie against the aristocracy. That's why they think a change from capitalism to communism is possible: each stage of history, they claim, has within it the tools of its own end.

Their conception of class as being based on relations to the means of production (owners and non-owners) is applied to other social systems, but the particulars of each social system or historical stage are still different from each other. A key example is that the industrial labourer, unlike the medieval serf, is not tied to a particular lord or plot of land. The idea that society is composed of rulers and ruled, strong and weak, haves and have-nots, etc is not specifically Marxist, or even leftist, at all.",1667260813

"cyberpunkgame","t5_3az7x","&gt;Are the Mantis Blades Generally on par with the Kantana?

Yes

&gt;Are there Advantages to equipping them over a Katana or is it just Damage Numbers?

dmg and the mantis blade strong attack lunge

&gt;I have been seeing alot about this Power attack lunge that locks you into an Animation, possibly getting you killed. Has this been fixed in a recent patch?

Nope you still do the lunge and you still are stuck in that animation.

&gt;If not, is this a huge concern?

kinda, well it depends. You can't just strong attack leap into a group of enemies as they will shoot you down when you are stuck in the animation. But when you play a more sneaky build and or the enemies are more spread out then it works. Other than that you can always hack them down with light attacks.

&gt;Are the Mantis Blades good with a Body, Reflexes Build?

Well yes. Those are the attributes you kinda have to skill for blade builds in general. Body for survival and reflex for the blade perks.

&gt;I have seen a Method where one can get a Legendary Variant of the Mantis Blades for free

Was it the one next to a cyberpsycho? Yeah that doesn't work anymore. Dunno if there is still a way to get free legendary ones.

&gt;What would be some Mods to look out for if I was going for a Mantis Blade Build, what are some generally fun build to try out when I have the chance?

Quiant Sandevistan MK4 (don't punch fingers, he is the only one that sells it), double jump legs and aside from that everything that fits in with your meele build.

You might wanna give Monowires a try. They count as blades too and are imo way stronger than Mantis Blades.",1667260815

Its a 'Spell', 'Melee', 'Area of Effect', 'Strike', and 'Cold'

4 of these overlap with the same tags as Frost Strike so those are 4 different stats that will scale both skills simultaneously. And because of how the 'Spell Activation on Attack Hit' converts all 'Attack Increases' to also affect spells, it will boost the spell damage of Frost Shock, in reality its 5 overlapping tags. So for example the 'Fighter's Wrath' Attack Enhance gives 'Melee DMG Amp' which will affect Frost Strike AND Frost Shock, but not Frost Orb.

It probably only gets used maybe once a week, if that. For everything else, he really does get to do it at his own pace and I work with him on a lot of things to make him comfortable when other people would tell me ""he's a dog, just make him do X"". It's the same thing, to me, as using a spray bottle to get a cat to stop biting.

"Daytrading","t5_2qxlo","I would highly recommend looking into micro futures for several reasons.

1. The pattern day trader rule requiring you to keep a minimum of $25,000 in your account does not apply to futures.
2. The margin requirements for the micros are minimal at only $400-$1700 per contract depending on the instrument and broker you use. Thus you can start with just $3000-$5000 while still being able to scale in and out of positions.
3. They trade 24/5 meaning that you don't have to worry about holding overnight and having the market gap up/down and blowing way past where you would have wanted to stop out.
4. The taxes are cheaper. Regardless of how long you hold a position it's taxed as 60% long term gains and 40% short term gains.
5. Futures are a leveraged instrument so you can still make worthwhile gains while only using a small amount of capital.

There are also companies such as TopStep that will stake you $50k-$150k of futures buying power for a few hundred dollars a month. They have pretty strict drawdown and trading requirements. However, it's a good way to get your feet wet without having to risk your own money.",1667260819

"MagicEye_CrossView","t5_qvw0z","It works because the original photo has perspective. For the sake of explanation, imagine there are only the middle two columns.

For the column on the left, since it is to our left, we’re viewing its right side. Likewise, for the column on the right, we’re viewing its left side.

So when you cross your eyes and the two columns overlap, your right eye is viewing the left column viewed from its right side, and your left eye is viewing the right column viewed from its left side.

The guy can stretch his penis out to his erect length but not further. When he gets hard it doesn't grow, it merely fills up with blood at 7 inches. 
So all these dudes on here stretching and jelqing they are merely stretching out what they already have. They're not adding anything to there actual erect length.

That said, my pointing out the Christian nature of the phrase and the assumed Christian audience it is therefore meant for is also equally an astute statement/observation. 

The central point of his idea is that we are our own creators, we are or can be our ""gods"" because we set in motion the seeds which birth ourselves in each cycle of the universe.  A brilliant idea, on par with the idea of each person (ever), just being a reincarnation of one entity - simultaneously reincarnating  so as to mature into...god. The same kind of idea but expressed a different way. It's worth pointing out that the story, as told with that Bible quote, lends legitimacy to the Christian mythology.

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","Go ahead and get the api master kit.  Strips are pointless. I modified my filter to include biomedia and just some scrap cut to fit stuff since the flow is so low in the 3.5 gallon. Some may argue this isn't big enough but it's def better than the bowl. I threw in some leftover substrate from my planted tank with a java fern and a white stripe which I now know shouldn't grow in water but it's doing well.  Piece of small driftwood and 2 chunks of hair grass. He's thriving and color change immediate.  I would treat your tank as a bowl for now almost.  Daily partial water changes and dose with prime.  It will take forever to cycle I bet.  Other option is take him back to the bowl and properly cycle the tank with either a fishless or with something like feeder minnows. I used neons then moved them to my 55gal. If I use feeders I move them to the turtle tank.  So far she has 18 that she hasn't eaten.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","This does not respond to anything I said. 

Yeah, it's their wedding and they can make this rule.

If you make a rule that says your own sibling can't bring their partner to your wedding, you are an asshole, unless that sibling or partner has done something to earn that.

I said I wouldn't have gone. 

I didn't assume - I asked OP whether this rule was just for her or for everyone, and whether there was a reason it might just be her. She hasn't responded.

Acknowledging that finding a qualified caregiver for a disabled person is expensive or difficult is NOT playing the disability card. That is an offensive claim made by people who don't want to deal with the fact that the disabled face unfair challenges. 

Aside from how finding a caregiver affects OP, the disability doesn't seem to be part of the issue. OP does not try to say that is why he wasn't invited, and neither did I.",1667260821

"HomeNetworking","t5_2s4pd","It is located on the exterior wall (which happens to be a ""party wall"" with the house next store) that would be to the far right side of the diagram I attached.  I spent a good chunk of the weekend on this, so would love any troubleshooting advice you have.  Here is what I have tried / found:

* I have been testing the MoCA connectivity by re-arranging cables to make a  
home-run from the router to the destination or using at most one 1600 Ghtz  
splitter (that I can see)
* The main coax splitters were in the basement.  I could find 3 runs that go up through the basement to the first floor (the three points marked) and 2 runs that go up the exterior of the house and enter on the second floor.  Note there are 6 rooms with co-axial, the 3rd floor is the one unaccounted for.
   * The exterior entry that comes in below the 2F office is an orange coaxial cable.  However, the cable behind the plate in our bedroom (which is where I get signal out when I put the MoCA adapter downstream of this exterior entry) is white.  Intriguingly, the cable behind the wall plate on the 3rd floor is also orange
   * Given the above, I am worried someone cut it / split it during a reno to bring cabling to the bedroom, but left that connection behind a wall somewhere
   * I have disconnected and looked behind all of the coax plates on the second and third floor and even used an endoscope to follow the cables as best I could to find this mystery split - but no luck
* I have tried disconnecting the plate on the 3rd floor and plugging directly into  
the cable behind the wall in case that was the point of failure

Open to other suggestions - getting that cable to work would be key",1667260822

This is just a de-tuning reactor ahead of some Power Factor Correction Capacitors. If someone attempted to use this as a passive harmonic filter, they were setting it up to fail. First off, there is no need for PFC caps on a VFD circuit. If this was for ANOTHER adjacent motor load that needed PFC caps, the detuning reactor is there to attempt to PROTECT them from the affects of the harmonics created by a nearby VFD. But if not selected properly (by first MEASURING the harmonics to know which harmonic to tune to), the caps may have still absorbed too much harmonic current and failed, in which case the reactor coil feeding that failed cap would be seeing very high current and the steel core would likely start to delaminate, which would be the loud humming you heard.

And for my thoughts, sometimes they’re just not there and all I can do is feel and then other times, I feel like I’m spinning out of control and I’ll try calm myself down in my head. 

I know this sounds a bit odd but I have these two parts of me which one I think is my inner critic that is still me but is just very mean but they aren’t necessarily mean during these episodes, they’re just anxious and go to the worst possible scenario, the other comforts me and tries to help me calm down, it’s still me but they’re sort of divided into different parts and have the same voice as my thinking voice. I’ll start pacing too. 

And my episodes mostly surface around triggers but can also be random similar to yours. I’ve also been dealing with this choking feeling during the episodes around my family where I’m more likely to have episodes around them, I can’t speak, I can move but I feel frozen, stuck. If that makes sense. 

I’m sort of just suppressing it like you, I have a therapist but I just don’t feel safe with any therapists due to past experiences, and I’m still being emotionally abused so if I say anything about it, they won’t believe me or they’ll believe me but simultaneously downplay it, or whatever I say in the session has a chance of going to the abuser and then the abuse will just worsen or I’m worried I might be hospitalised due to sharing my thoughts and what I’m experiencing.

I’m just so confused as to what I should do and what me having these “episodes” mean, they’ve started getting a lot more frequent and I hate it and sometimes I don’t even cry, I just tear up and the emotions swallow me, it’s like I can’t even get any relief from crying because my body won’t let me.",1667260824

"CoWorking","t5_2s8fa","Have you heard of [Groove](https://www.groove.ooo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=posts)? 

Groove is a digital co working space designed to help you *get sh\*t done with fun* ;) 

You hop on for 50 min distraction free sessions with fellow Groovers who're online at the same time (*or you can schedule your own Groove session beforehand)*... and then you proceed to flesh out your to-dos, get them done, discuss with each other what you were able to accomplish, and repeat the same process with as many Groove sessions as you'd want! 

Groove is currently free, and you can use [this sign up link](https://www.groove.ooo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=posts) to join in! 

I have been using it for the past couple years, aside from also building it with my colleagues, and the whole point of us doing this was to create something that: 

\- can actually help you get work done distraction free

\- and introduce you to like minded people who can form a supportive friendly community!

Working remotely gets really lonely at times, and I hope by using [Groove](https://www.groove.ooo/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=posts), you will feel a little less isolated, and a lot more supported :D",1667260824

The follow-up to Erin Sterling’s New York Times bestselling hit The Ex Hex features fan favorite Gwyn and the spine-tinglingly handsome Wells Penhallow as they battle a new band of witches and their own magical chemistry.Gwyn Jones is perfectly happy with her life in Graves Glen. 

She, her mom, and her cousin have formed a new and powerful coven; she’s running a successful witchcraft shop, Something Wicked; and she’s started mentoring some of the younger witches in town. 

As Halloween approaches, there’s only one problem—Llewellyn “Wells” Penhallow.Wells has come to Graves Glen to re-establish his family’s connection to the town they founded as well as to make a new life for himself after years of being the dutiful son in Wales. 

When he opens up a shop of his own, Penhallow’s, just across the street from Something Wicked, he quickly learns he’s gotten more than he bargained for in going up against Gwyn.When their professional competition leads to a very personal—and very hot—kiss, both Wells and Gwyn are determined to stay away from each other, convinced the kiss was just a magical fluke. 

But when a mysterious new coven of witches come to town and Gwyn’s powers begin fading, she and Wells must work together to figure out just what these new witches want and how to restore Gwyn’s magic before it’s too late.",1667260825

"Sourdough","t5_2s7wc","&gt;Yeasts do not create bubbles. They create CO2 molecules that dissolve in the dough and eventually diffuse to dough air bubbles depending on concentration gradients (Fick's Law)

They create bubbles mate. The CO2 molecules go wherever they can, and if that's into a waiting air pocket formed by mixing they will go there. If you pop that bubble a new pocket will be formed and it will diffuse into there. If there are literally no air pockets there, such as with brewing, they will create them because a bubble is simply the CO2 pushing outwards.

&gt;By the way, bread dough is a gel, and baked bread a set foam, not a stabilized foam. Chantilly is a protein-stabilized foam.

Although the Wikipedia page has grouped it with [Oriental Orthodoxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oriental_Orthodox_Churches). [Eastern Orthodoxy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church) is different and OP of this post is wrong.

It’s literally a COMPLETE martial art. Every user used it differently. Other Niko, Niko himself, Ohma and others have used it differently. Ohma’s Niko style is built not only from training with Niko but from his countless street fights and survival. He fights like an MMA fighter but with Niko style techniques as the main focus.

Its extremely comparable, its just not the example that makes your claim hold alot of weight.

&gt;The FCC was until recently run by a dude who wanted to repeal net neutrality and who immediately was given a cush private equity job immediately after.

The FCC isnt the people argueing this, its the CMA.

&gt;he tides have begun to change with moves like the GIPHY acquisition by Meta being blocked, the Nvidia-ARM deal being slated to be blocked leading to it being preemptively nixed, the GlaxoKlyne merger not going through, demergers and spinoffs becoming more frequent, etc etc.

Which these are all faire, its just weird that these same people would okay Sony's acquisition of bungie under the same guise deny microsofts. Anyway you slice it microsoft is not getting the advantage over Sony with this deal, in either terms of marketshare or market revenue.

In fact we could argue both those same cases against sony with their purchase of bungie against microsoft. While i applaud regulators for going against big business, i would respect them a hell of alot more if they were uniform with their decisions instead of picking and choosing. Because i agree with microsofts comment on this matter that it very much does seem like a bias choice considering the circumstances.",1667260827

"sleeptrain","t5_3f3ch","Hey, the travel days itself were ok, he napped on and off for 4h during the ~8h flight. Adjusting to the time zone happened over about 3 days with minimal wake ups outside the norm but very early mornings. 
I'm not sure if we were dealing with a regression, teething or over stimulation during the day but after roughly 1.5 weeks he would not sleep for more than 45-90 min during the night. We also had to room share during that time which isn't our usual arrangement. We ended up bedsharing to get any sleep and enjoy the trip. He adjusted again within 3-4 days after being back home and being able to have separate rooms fixed the multiple wake ups at night almost immediately. 
Hope this helps, it's a bit of a blur but that's as much detail as I remember.",1667260827

"Zig","t5_3cf47","Super excited for what comes next. Big congratulations to the Zig core team and contributors for getting this release out the door!

The [new autodoc generated standard library ref](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.10.0/std/#root;AutoHashMap) is a huge improvement and should make browsing the standard library so much nicer. I was sad when it got shelved until the self-hosted compiler was done, and now I can't wait for continued work on it.

The clarifying changes around pointers/types that were doing weird things seems good.

The compile error for misleading whitespace is... odd? But good, I think. It just stood out to me as something most languages wouldn't go so far as to make a compile error out of.

The example bug shown in that section is pretty nasty though, and I can't really think of any cases where having it as a compile error would be disruptive.

Looking forward to updating my toy graphics framework. Fingers crossed it doesn't hit any translate-c issues.",1667260827

I suspect that there is also some whinging going on as well. The Russian fleet has been pretty well savaged, though not destroyed, and appears to be incapable of surface actions. In the meantime, ships are sailing, something of a slap in the face of Russian powerlessness. 

Russia seems to have trapped itself in the Black Sea. It is unable to reinforce or replace via the Dardanelles because Turkey has closed them to naval vessels. The flagship is sunk, the second flagship seems to have been damaged, other major assets have either been sunk or severely damaged. In the meantime, Russian naval assets are not conducting any sort of sea control missions but are instead hugging the coastline to stay under land based missile and aerial shields. Venturing beyond brings them into range of Ukrainian anti ship missiles. Plus, Sevastopol is now no guarantee of safety for the fleet. 

Of course, they could move naval assets further East to Novorossiysk. Of course, this would mean ceding control of the Black Sea to others (Ukraine, Turks, Georgians, etc.). The Ukrainians don’t have a navy to speak of but the Turks do. All of this would be a reversal of Russian gains made in the past 300 years…",1667260827

Like, obviously every leveled headed adult here, based on the description in the OP, is going to say the same thing ad nauseam.

No, if you havent taken a sick day in 5 months, it is preposterous for you to be concerned about calling out, regardless if it's a holiday. And certainly it's a bad working environment if your manager is going to have issue with the scenario that you have explained here.

But as a manager for a small company,  I always give everyone the benefit of the doubt initially. There is only so much good faith that an individual employee has until they enter the territory where I am forced to not trust them because of frequent attendance issues. It is a lax environment where trust is everything. There is no tally or attendance point system and most of my guys are long time employees for which I never doubt their word. But over the years there are absolutely the opportunistic type that have worked with us enough to the point where I now make it a rule to explain to every new employee, that while I am super lenient with attendance hiccups or when sick days need to be taken, I always stress that they be honest with themselves, because enough call outs will eventually result in me simply not believing you anymore and in the event of a truly needed sick day after a string of callouts over the last 2 months, I might take disciplinary action.  

No manager should ever make you justify your sick day with a note or document, but depending on an employees track record, a non invasive doctors note if you happen to go to the clinic or quick care goes a long way to restablish trust if you have damaged it.

There will always be shitty managers and shitty employees in any industry.",1667260828

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I agree that trans women are women, but it's good to acknowledge that this is the case because the definition of the word ""woman"" has shifted relatively recently.  When exactly it shifted depends who you ask.  I hadn't really encountered this idea until I went to college in 2012.  I'm not sure if it's because it was 2012, or if it's because that's when I happened to go to college.  But it's fair for example to say that this would not have been a widely used definition for the word woman in 1990.  

Personally I don't have any problem with seeing language shift over time, and we still are able to talk about biological sex when it is relevant, for example in medical situations.  It's important to remember that in most situations it's not relevant, and that generally the details of someone else's biology or medical history are none of your business.  And above all, it's important to be kind to people, regardless of their identity or how they present themselves.

But do we gain anything by demonizing people who resist a particular recent change in the way language is used?  I'm all for criticizing Rowling, but do we actually gain anything by framing her as a horrible human being?  This is a bit reductive, and too simple to be true.",1667260828

Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. 

Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing. 

Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher. 

And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High's notorious gossip app.Only, Simon never makes it out of that classroom. 

Before the end of detention Simon's dead. 

And according to investigators, his death wasn't an accident. 

On Monday, he died. 

But on Tuesday, he'd planned to post juicy reveals about all four of his high-profile classmates, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder.

"Real_Estate","t5_2qx53","I bought land with Velur nearly ten years ago and it has not worked out very well. The land I bought is in California - Lancaster area. Velur aligned me with two other investors as you can “share land ownership “ in California. 

No, Velur is not a scam, but I have so much regret on this investment. The fault is mine, ( not doing my own research and trusting a friend who was involved with Velur ).It has been a money pit; as every year I pay taxes and my IRA fees, so I’m down 5k. Lots of hype about the building prospects on this land, but in ten years, no offers - no activity, other than me paying taxes and IRA fees.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; Everyone who creates an account?

I admit I haven't made a new account in 6-7 years, so I wasn't aware that it subs you to defaults now. My bad.

&gt; It's not user error to not sort by new. I'd argue most users don't do that.

Would you settle on user laziness then? If you can't be bothered to do the minimum to change what you consider a sub-par user experience, I have a hard time laying the blame on the website.

&gt; The excuse that ""someone else did it"" didn't work in grade school and it shouldn't work for multimillion-dollar companies.

I'm not saying ""someone else did it"". I'm saying it is a widely known (and sometimes necessary) form of punishment for those who are unusually toxic. If someone is on here throwing around racial slurs and being an exceptional asshole, then I would argue that  shadow banning is a better way of dealing with them because they don't immediately know they are banned. They will think they are just being ignored, and some percentage of them might stop acting like an asshole because they aren't getting reactions like they want.

&gt; It certainly does auto-subscribe you, at the start when you create a new account, something you suggested to fix shadow banned. Additionally, it's content that is pushed towards you in general, not subs

Again, I'll cede this one because I haven't made a new account in a long time.

Just made it up. This is why false accusations are such a valid concern. But go ahead, dog on the hate pile, it doesn't matter. The fact I had to share such  horrific story to get even a shred of empathy shows that I was right, men are seen as evil automatically.

Note their URM numbers are similar to Stanford medical school which legally can consider race/ethnicity.

The undergrads are abiding by it at least by the letter (race checkbox isn't revealed to readers and lack of interviews hides race), though they've structured their admission system in a way that maximizes the desired ethnic diversity (e.g. considering high school average test scores more than parental income, which pushes down Asian numbers).",1667260831

Thanks for responding! My current technical skillset is the training in Google's data analytics certificate, and self-studying SQL Server through Udemy, and Mr. Itzik Ben-Gan's Book: T-SQL fundamentals. 

Why did I choose ETL? I went through the Google data analytics program, and came to the conclusion that being a data end-user wasn't something I'm particularly motivated by, nor excel at doing, however I still want to be involved with making data useful to the decision makers. 

I picked up an interest in ETL development from the interview research preparation for an apprentice ETL analytics role with a healthcare data integration company. The hiring manager was good enough to give me a shot but I lacked SQL knowledge. I am determined to be be ready to go at the next attempt with whomever has an opening. 

As I'm job pivoting at 41 years old, I do not have the luxury of wasting time, therefore I'd like to just get down to what's needed to land a job and be successful. I am properly motivated and willing to put in the work - I just need a bit of guidance .",1667260831

One of my more recent ones I didn't get to play long but I enjoyed the concept. 

It was for Rise of the Runelords, a Varisian Arcanist, School Savant archetype.

I built him strongly on flavor instead of optimization (used to play with a lot of optimizers, so I needed to to keep up) and there was so much that worked for it. 

Took the Ancient Scholar campaign trait, and his backstory was that he was raised along a family of sorcerers, but as the family traveled across Varisia, he studied the ruins they came across and augmented his spellcasting based on what he learned of Thassilonian magic. 

Being from Sorcererous origins but studying Thassilonian magic, it made the mix of prepared and spontaneous casting logical.

School Savant played into his chosen study, taking Evocation: Admixture, and leaning towards Wrath in terms of personality. 

Varisian tattoo made sense too, traditional to his people, but also giving additional focus on a school of magic. 

But unlike the Runelords, he tried to temper his specific sin, viewing it as a flaw that comes as a cost to the kind of magic he did, as opposed to leaning into it like they might. 

Unfortunately the campaign didn't get too far, but I really enjoyed playing him.",1667260832

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","It doesn't become blood 'as' I drink it, but rather when the Priest says the words of consecration over the bread and wine i.e. when he says, in the person of Christ ""This is my body"" over the bread and ""This is my blood"" over the wine.

However yes, I don't think scientific instruments would normally record any change, mind, sometimes there are changes, and these are called Eucharistic miracles, but they are rare, and one doesn't really have to believe they occur in order to be Catholic; though I do believe they occur.

The sense in which the bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ is in terms of the substance (hence 'tran-substance-iation'); the substance of a thing is an aspect of it's identity; it is what stands under (it 'sub-stands') the accidents or appearances, (hence 'sub-stance') and gives them their unity as the sort of thing the entity is, and so their intelligibility to us as the sort of thing that they are despite their changes.

Thus we know that a man is still the same man, even if he undergoes some changes (gets older, gets greying hair, wears different clothes, etc.), the term 'substance' just names an aspect of the being (namely, what he is i.e. a human) that lets us track him through time; thus while a particular human undergoes many changes, he still remains 'human' despite the changes; because the properties he's lost were not essential to his remaining human.

So likewise to say that the wine becomes blood is to say that the substance of the wine (what makes it 'wine' rather than something else) turns into the substance of Christ in general, and his blood in particular i.e. it becomes his body, blood, soul, and divinity; which is to say, it becomes him, both in his divinity and his humanity; it becomes 'the whole Christ' or 'totus Christus'.

(To note, I have to stop on this point somewhere, but one could go into 'infinitely' more detail here; the Eucharist is a sacrament, and therefore a mystery; which means not that we can't know anything about it, but that there is 'infinitely much' to know about it, for the sacrament reveals God, and God is infinite; and so this means that we, having finite minds, cannot in this life know 'everything there is to know' about it; but since our minds are ever growing, we are rather free to ""continually learn ever more and more"" about it, and so explore ever more deeply into the mystery by means of the tools of faith and reason.)

In any case, yes; the Catholic Doctrine has always been that there is a real change; so those Catholics who are well educated about their faith on this point, and who learning this, have decided to persist in their belief, do all hold that a real change occurs, and not merely a symbolic one.

The drug lords in Mexico have LOTS of money, they build personal castles in the middle of towns and huge casinos (it's ridiculous).

They don't get their money from the government (so they don't profit off of Mexico nor any of the countries further south).  People in Mexico don't make a lot of money (the rich ones steal that money from taxes).

Another issue is that drug lords get lots of guns, and very few guns are made in Mexico (the country is too beaten down to develop any kind of gun making industry).  Lots of guns are purchased from the U.S.

Lots of money and guns come from the U.S.  Lots of people get killed with guns in Mexico.

Drug lords are killing everyone, but I don't see any reason to guilt or blame drug users.  The country has many other problems that are enabling this, so many different kinds of people are pitching in to kill innocent poor people (mainly government leaders).

The people that should be shamed and stopped are the ones carrying out the killing, but they are sadly unstoppable (cuz crime is very practical in Mexico, just a slap on the wrist).",1667260832

 ""...would return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago; the rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-income taxpayers would face the largest increase. In addition, the Administration’s policies would focus additional IRS resources on enforcement activity aimed at high-wealth taxpayers, large corporations, and partnerships.""

And

""...reduce the burden on compliant taxpayers by allowing the IRS to better target noncompliant ones and to reduce the number of audits that resulted in no change in tax assessment.""

"XC40_Recharge","t5_51dhq1","I also don't need a whole station situation. I just need a spare cable to plug into the NEMA 14-50 I had installed in the garage. But trying to find a spare is an overwhelming barrage of base stations, cables, adaptors, and every other thing that don't seem to be what I need. And all of them TWENTY FIVE FEET LONG. I could go for 6 feet if I could find it. But I'm not totally sure what to get because Volvo won't tell us anything about the cable except the NEMA plug.

It's really uncool to not give specs and standards in the description at all. They clearly don't want you to shop around so they make sure you're nervous about what you're getting elsewhere. All they give is the NEMA ratings which is the plug that goes into the wall. Got it. Everyone knows that, and I have that installed. But the side that goes into the car itself? No idea. They won't show it. They won't say it. But I can tell it's not 14-50. Is it J1772? Maybe?

"RealGirlfriendsnParis","t5_6d3zyi","You’re exactly right!!  I was blown away when she made a list of the things she’s never done but has thought about doing at some time in her life.

I forget what episode it was, where she was talking about not finishing anything.  She said something about not writing a script, a book and a play.  Then she talked about not finishing design school, fashion school or college. 

She says the reason for her never accomplishing anything was because she was afraid of failure.  The fear makes her anxious and the anxiety makes it impossible for her to finish anything.  She’s 25 or 26 and she’s never had a job in her life.  She was also whining because her dad had cut down her allowance.

The man pays for everything and since he bought her the apartment she lives in, he cut back on her money.  She said she wasn’t complaining she was merely stating a fact.  

Her brother seemed extremely puzzled when she told him about becoming an agent for the artists that use his studio.  I’m not familiar with the music industry, but I do know that a  lot of artists use well established agents that tend to have law degrees, because they’re required to make sure that their contracts are fair and equitable.  Contracts can get extremely complicated and I don’t think she’s qualified to represent anyone. 

I think she said that but her father is an art collector she’s very knowledgeable about museums because she’s been to many museums all over the world.

Or maybe I’m having a hard time following her train of thought.  Anyway, it’s painfully clear that she’s never finished or even started many of the things she professes to be capable of doing.  She’s also squandered many opportunities that have been presented to her.

She says she wants to be free from her father’s money but hasn’t quite figured out how to do that.  She says it’s a toxic relationship because he’ll say something mean to her and gift her a Chanel bag at the same time?

She sounds like a rich, entitled, trust fund baby.  I’m not sure why she’s pretending to want to give up her trust fund money and instead try to support herself.  Agsin, it’s something she wants to do, but won’t attempt it because she’s afraid of failure,

I drove a 19 year old Honda. Great car so I gave it to my son. I bought a 2021 Honda Hybrid and plan to keep it for the next 20 years. (Paid cash for both cars.) Moneywise, I'm doing more than fine.  Though I do live in an apartment because I don't want to do stuff around the house.

When people rag on you for having an old car, pretend it's like an old pet.  ""I couldn't get rid of Panzer (give your car a name)... we've been through so much together.""  Or ""It's going to break my heart when I have to give her up. I don't think any other car will be as good.""

You're a bit of an AH for losing your temper but they are truly major-league AH for ragging on you for your choices and for losing their tempers at you seeing their (probable) truth.

Some are better than others depending on the material for all items it will affect how it fits which affects if it looks cheap or not. 

I got a really nice corset, lovely dresses, well made stitched cowboy boots, jeans, etc most items are really cute.

I’ve been disappointed a few times too though. There are stuff I wouldn’t recommend but I think it’s overall worth it. I did have a purse break from one night out only used once. A phone case thar broke also inside the purse :/ but I got another purse which is really cute so it’s okay.",1667260837

"panthers","t5_2s1w0","This is probably going to remain an unpopular opinion, but damn I'd have loved it if Baker came any other year/under anyone else's tenure. All the Baker naysayers like to shout how he was carried by a strong line and run game when he was good in Cleveland, like that hasn't been our Panthers ""Keep Pounding"" identity from the start. We have HOOOOOOOOOVER chants for a (great) fucking fullback within like 5 years of being a franchise, our own version of double trouble in JStew and Dlo, and one of the most prolific dual threat QBs the league will likely ever see. Any QB who could have come in and thrown for 3500-4000 yards and a tight QB/INT ratio like Baker did in 2020 would have been a rousing success on basically any Panthers roster before Rhule and Tepper fucked shit up.

Even now people are trashing his play like we haven't seen PJ Walker win games under someone else or a how great a run game even our RB2 under Rhule could have provided. But I digress until such a time as Baker sees the field as a Panther under someone other than Rhule. 

There's an alternate timeline out there somewhere where Rhule was rightfully fired at the end of last season and Ken Dorsey came in and came into this season with Mayfield and everything just fucking worked, because while Baker isn't Cam, Baker would still very much succeed in a similar offense and Ken could build that for him. 

I know he's probably gone next year barring some circumstances, but I really do hope he gets another shot at a stable franchise. Something like 6 coaches in 5 years and the only one that did him any good also sold him up the river for a fucking sexual predator.

**Sorry, your post on /r/femdompersonals has been removed.**

Your account must have a higher karma level in order to post. We do not share how much karma or what type of karma is needed to post.

There are different types of karma, and we change the amounts up and down regularly to refine their purpose, so even if you have posted succesfully before, you might get told you now don't have enough, or other people might to have posted successfully with what seems like lower amounts.
    
**To reach the required karma, our advice is to spend a week commenting and posting over on /r/BDSMcommunity, /r/BDSMadvice, /r/Femdom, or /r/FemdomCommunity, and then try posting your personal again**.  

Please note that using ""free karma"" subreddits will no longer help you reach the required amount of karma to post.

If you message modmail about this to complain, your complaint will be ignored and you might get banned if you're rude, or you ask questions that we have answered in this message.

This subreddit is not interested in allowing posts from casual throwaway accounts; we are here to support active and engaged users of the Reddit kink communities. 

We do not expect an unreasonably high amount of karma, it is easily achievable to reach with a few posts and comments across Reddit.

 This clearly shows that the guy who worked at 2 jobs and was too insecure about his life and the family is his priority is gone as the new Walt or Heisenberg shows no remorse or regret unlike Walter White will.

Another scene is when Walt poisons Brock. 

This is massive as the innocent Walter White would never hurt a fly and cares for kids since he is a teacher but Heisenberg literally doesn't care about his surroundings and does whatever it takes to eliminate his target (in this example Gustavo Fring) even poisoning a child, which he knows later will trigger Jesse and convince him that Gus did it, so the target is eliminated easier.",1667260839
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Assume is when you take something of a wild guess. Presume is when you make a guess based on what is probable. For example, if I flip a coin, I will presume that it will land on either heads or tails. There is 99% chance of that happening, so although I am guessing, it is a safe guess. If I say that the coin will land three heads in row, I am assuming because there is no evidence to suggest that will happen, and such a thing is not even probable.

An affirmation is a public declaration of something, whereas a confirmation is to find the correct answer. Let's say that a politician is having a debate, and someone asks them to state their position. When the politician says, ""I am telling you now that I will lower taxes,"" that is an affirmation of their policy. Later, people will examine the tax policy of this politician and crunch the numbers to see if that politicians actually did lower taxes. Those researchers are trying to confirm that politician's statement.",1667260839
"teachinginjapan","t5_3c154","One thing you should consider is how difficult it is for non-Japanese to get housing in Japan, particularly when you don't speak Japanese or have a Japanese person to act as your guarantor. There is a lot of discrimination in the housing market, and on top of that, it's very expensive to move into a new place. You generally have to pay 3-4 month's rent, and sometimes more. 

There are shared accommodation complexes run by companies that target foreigners. The rent is cheaper and they don't charge much to move in, but these are usually not very pleasant places to live. 

This is why companies often provide housing: they know it's hard to get an apartment, so they take advantage of that situation by making you pay THEM for it, while in the process overcharging for their own profit. Just so you know.

If, however, you have a good bit of money saved, there are plenty of options. One of these is UR housing, which is run by the government and doesn't require a guarantor or high move-in fees. They are not allowed to discriminate, so as long as you have a Japanese speaking person help you with the paperwork, it's not a problem if you can't speak Japanese. 

In addition, there are guarantor companies you can pay to act as your guarantor. But this option raises costs. 

Generally speaking, you either need good Japanese skills or plenty of money if you want get your own apartment.",1667260839

For Confirm, thats usually used for more fact based things, like confirming the suspect or confirming that you have a meeting at noon, it can be positive or negative. Affirm is more when it has a positive adaptation and is more used in the court of law, like when the suspect affirms his innocence!

Be real for a second get off KSIs meat and just be factual. Every single one of Jakes opponents beat Swarmz and Pineda and Woodley and Anderson both beat Logan. Jakes just better at absolutely everything and by a far distance. His timing and accuracy is better, his combinations are more advanced, his punch power is more impactful and therefore harder due to his better timing and accuracy compared to KSI, his head movement and footwork/movement is better, he’s faster, he’s got a better jab, his shots r more technical and not just winged out shots, he has more fight IQ. KSI realistically is a street brawler with a pretty weak chin that overcrowds himself and throws some of the most inaccurate shots you’ll ever see. I don’t even like Jake Paul and don’t think he’s very good, but KSI is an absolute disgrace to boxing. Jake Paul at least trains and it’s clear he is at a professional level, KSI is barely at an amateur level",1667260841

Part of the Iranian squad don't even like their regime... And the rest are probably just not in condition to speak up.

Honestly for me the limit was surpassed very early in the invasion when they tried to get a Dostoevsky class cancelled and they started banning teenage athletes from drafts in USA (and I wonder how many of those kids who couldn't run away in time are now being sent to the front lines against their will). I don't think people realize the terrible precedent that sets when you blurry the separation between a totalitarian regime, an elite class, or its supporters, even, and the general populace. Godwin's law but I wanna remind everyone certain regime in the 30s started off justifying itself with the bankers' abuse.

Make them play without emblems. Don't play their anthem. Put ""The country formerly known as Persia"" on TV screens if you want. I bet a large part of the Iranian squad would take this happily (they already stood with jackets covering their badges in a friendly not long ago).

"Eldenring","t5_122hf1","I definitely think there are some quests that go too far, especially when they are hiding something as significant as a key item or a whole ending behind it (Millicent’s for example). A significant contributing factor to this is just that the world is way bigger and nonlinear, so it’s just too difficult to keep track of some questlines without a guide (especially when some steps can be several hours of playtime apart from each other). Fromsoft’s quest design isn’t made with the intention of completing all of them, but you should have a reasonable chance at completing (or at the very least starting) most of them, and unfortunately that isn’t the case with ER.

However Ranni’s questline is an exception to this (one that I wish was instead the standard. It is very hard to miss, and aside from talking to the doll three times, each step is pretty clearly laid out by npcs. It doesn’t lock any items behind any obscure events, just lore, which probably doesn’t make any sense to a first time player anyway.",1667260842

Here's an example commandline that will trim a video so that only 0:30 to 0:45 is kept. And even better, it'll process almost instantly and without quality loss.

    FFMPEG -i inputfilename.mp4 -ss 00:00:30 -to 00:00:45 -c copy outputfilename.mp4

The `-c copy` command tells FFMPEG to copy the video streams directly rather than re-encoding, which is why it maintains 100% of the original quality and finishes so quickly.",1667260842

"CatastrophicFailure","t5_38tab","I picked a ridiculously heavy electric pickup truck (7,200 lbs) as an approximation between a passenger car (3,500 lbs) and a semi truck (80,000 lbs).

Using the [FHA vehicle distribution for California](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2019/vm4.cfm), and ignoring motorcycles, buses, and single unit trucks (5% of traffic), the 60% of Camrys, 18% of F-150s, and 17% of semis normalized to 100% would weigh 377 lbs/lane-ft (or 6% less than the linear density of a Rivian).

Just eating better , sleeping well, moving around , going outside does wonders for mood &amp; well being. 
And when improved and combined with regular Sadhana , be it Japa , Kirtan , Dhyana , whatever you like , life can get better pretty quickly. 

Find some scripture that resonates with you , a practice you like , take care of the physical temple and don’t stagnate. Reach out for help when you need to, nothing gets better when we keep it locked away inside ourselves. 

“ But they for whom I am the supreme goal, who do all work renouncing self for me and meditate on me with single-hearted devotion, these I will swiftly rescue from the fragment’s cycle of birth and death, for their consciousness has entered into me. (Bhagavad Gita 12:6-7)

Those who meditate upon this immortal dharma as I have declared it, full of faith and seeking me as life’s supreme goal, are truly my devotees, and my love for them is very great. (12:20)

Never forget this, Arjuna: no one who is devoted to me will ever come to harm. (9:31) “

What I received when I requested information on my father were incomplete records. It didn’t have any awards listened on his form, yet I have a paper certificate of his commendation medal. My father left behind no medals that I ever found. 

For the OP, I don’t know how you can get his records if he served in Vietnam working on top secret activities. I don’t think it will be as easy as filling out a form. They should never have been in Cambodia and I feel like those who were will never have their records released. 

For OP, I’m assuming that your father must have also died from illnesses related to agent orange. Our fathers sacrificed absolutely everything and ultimately gave their lives. I hope your father was able to find peace in his life. For me, being the daughter of a Vietnam combat veteran is the greatest honor. They were given nothing in life but built a legacy that will last. The toughest soldiers America has ever had. Forced into service, severed in a horrific war with very little support, then returned home and was spit on, only to find out that it was an unjustified war and that they were lied to.

So last week my mother told me and my sister she would not be taking us trick or treating. I was fine with this and only asked that she drop me off at my aunt's house as I knew she (my aunt) would take me with the rest of my cousins. She agreed to take me to my aunt's house.

Fast forward to today, and as you can probably tell by the title she did not take me. So obviously I was pretty upset so I decided to just take my shower and go to my room. After my shower I made the terrible mistake of slightly stomping while walking downstairs to grab something.

As I was walking back to the stairs she stopped me. She proceeded to ask me if I had an attitude, and despite my denial she continued. She then asked me aquestion that left me confused. She said, and I quote, ""Did I ever say I was taking you to your aunt's house to go trick or treating?""

This left me in stunned silence. She paused for a second, then continued to scold me for the next minute or so. So reddit please tell me, AITA?

She's certainly gone up and down the coast many many times since I last looked at her account. 

I hope this helps. 

In the very least, her whereabouts are fun to keep track of.

I would guess you'd probably be pretty happy with 1440p 144hz though, and you can get a computer and monitor that will do that for around $1600-1700 at the moment.

"biomaterials","t5_3m4ll","So I'm a student in a Bioengineering program. I have a project coming up in my biomaterials course where I have to come up with or find existing technologies that utilize biomaterials to accomplish a goal. I want to improve upon implantable electrodes. Current electrodes are bigger than wanted, and the smallest of them (Nuralinks) is not rigid enough to be implantable without complicated machinery. The goal would be to develop a new polymer that has a high compressive/tensile strength, is not subject to extreme deformation under a force, and is able to be synthesized in a very small scale while also being biocompatible and not easily degradable.

I need help with a few things. 

1. When going about synthesizing novel polymers, where should I start? I don't even know what monomers I should start looking at and plugging away with, not to mention a cross linker, catalyst, terminator, etc. And what method of polymerization would be best for making something at this scale?

2. Coating for electrical conductance and biocompatibility. Nuralinks uses some form of gold. I'm sure there is some surface modification of the polymer to achieve the coating, can anyone suggest sources for how this is accomplished? Or ideas of a better material that could be used. How would the coating effect the degredation of the material underneath? How do metals like gold degrade inside of the head cavity/brain tissues.

3. General sources for how current electrodes are synthesized, the methods etc.",1667260846

I would then keep all the new races of, and ported over factions to, AoS the same with the minor edit to lore that the gods from the warhammer fantasy world were able to create the new races like deepkin for example, as the mortal realms were connected to the warhammer fantasy world through the warp.

"QualityReps","t5_fljpi","Sizing is always a hit or miss. Generally, I'd go tts for everything as the charts for sellers are innaccurate 90% of the time. So if you're going to order a size  online in america just order the same size on taobao. Chinese sizing and American sizing are the same.  Just stick to your normal size and measure through your agent after.

Generally the size chart is usually 3-4 cm off the actual.

Also based on the construction of the material of the shirt or jacket it might be a smaller chest length but fit accurately so measuring your own clothing and comparing is highly innacurate imo.

People general up the difficulty in mostly single player games because its more entertaining - not because they get better gear. If I had to speculate they WILL probably have better rewards for difficulty on the 4 player coop even if its just more Nth metal or something.

"askmath","t5_2qm4f","What do you mean by infinite time loop?

By some definitions of time loop, there are no differences between each instance of the loop so no one can decide to do something differently.For example you might rewind and reenact steps so you do a single set of actions once per loop (so am infinite never of times) and no other actions. 

And who is the observer?

From an outsider's point of view someone in a timeloop would do a single set of actions a single time


Finally, I would argue that if the agents have perception of the timeloop then they will never do the same thing twice. Maybe they breathe differently at the start of the loop or the remember something and take a second too long to do something or maybe they blink at a different point in time and by that point the loop is completely different to any previous instance",1667260848

Porque isso é a verdade. O principal ponto da Bíblia não é saber explicar Deus, ver milagres acontecerem, ter provas disso ou aquilo, o principal ponto (palavra melhor dizendo) que define o cristianismo é a fé. Jesus chama todos a crerem nEle, não entendê-lo.

"California_Politics","t5_357go","Responding to climate change is going to cost money — a lot of it. The investments in Prop 30, which are massive and generational, will put us on track to reduce California’s air pollution fast enough to help curb catastrophic global warming. Prop 30 funding is directed at dramatically cutting pollution from California’s two largest sources: vehicle tailpipes and catastrophic wildfires. Those investments are funded by a small incremental tax increase on the wealthiest Californians: $17.5K on every million over $2 million annually — pocket change for a cohort that has done extraordinarily well over the past decade. The money goes to jumpstart our transition to a green transportation system, especially by incentivizing low-income families to purchase EVs. Prop 30’s programs also include a dramatic expansion of our EV charging network as well as funding for CAL FIRE to reduce the impact of megafires. It’s not the tax itself that will help solve climate change, but the investments that the tax enables.",1667260848

I'm not sure I follow you. Like, as a bi/pan guy, logically I couldn't be friends with anyone because you would ""never know"" what my real intentions are with a friend. In reality, of course, I'm not simply not inclined to sleep around, and I don't see a problem being friends with people irrespective of gender. 

After all, 99% of all interpersonal relationships in your life are non-sexual. It seems strange to me to rule out emotionally-fulfilling relationships with people based on their gender. Meanwhile, I personally wouldn't be comfortable telling a partner that they can't be friends with others; to me that seems more like not being able to trust your particular partner, pointing to a deeper issue in the relationship.",1667260849

"Forgotten_Realms","t5_31rpx","It appears there was some kind of very loose contact between the enclaves, probably a ""council of arcanists,"" though that might be too formal a term for it. They got together and decided if they needed to obliterate some orc tribes or whatever. I assume that from those meetings they delegated authority to the settlements on the ground through a local bureaucracy, I suspect based on the original model of Seventon.

The ground settlements were just left alone as long as they did what was needed, basically providing supplies to the arcanists. The overwhelming power of the arcanists made any kind of rebellion futile.

Netheril's extreme lack of centralised authority is one of the three key reasons they didn't simply conquer all of Faerûn, the other two being wariness of the elven empires that effectively surrounded them on all sides (Illefarn and Eaerlann to the west, Evereska to the south-west, Cormanthyr to the east) and not being bothered.",1667260849

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;&gt;Now you're just repeating the same lies while flatly ignoring my arguments. I see very little of substance (and some seriously broken English) that wasn't already plainly addressed, and a person in pure denial. Honestly, this response is so desperate and poor and this thread so dead that I'm not wasting my time responding and believe my previous arguments cover most of this for anyone still reading to this depth.  
  
Do you think name calling helps your case? Do you think you getting emotional helps your case?  it doesn't. Feel free to run away. I wouldn't be surprised!   
  
&gt;&gt; That this kid can't seem to grasp the difference between a protest and a failed coup is laughably pathetic gaslighting.   
  
Again, Check mirror.   
  
&gt;&gt;Clearly you're very deep into the cult to all reading this and have very, very poor sources for information.  
  
So factual legal testimony is a poor source? Hilarious.   
  
&gt;From Pelosi (3rd in line for President) meeting with an ALLY versus Freshmen reps having closed-door meetings with RUSSIA LMAO.  
  
No now you need to move the ball to congressman - if they are only in congress over a period of time then it must be ok... Or, if the meeting is with an Ally then it must be ok but they cannot meet with anyone else!!!  
  
Hilarious.  
  
&gt;&gt;    Trump routinely associated with Epstein and Maxwell; he even wished the charged sex trafficker well and lied about his relationship with them.  
  
Both were New York high end Socialites. They hung in the same elite NY circles. News at 11.   
  
&gt;&gt;    Trump instigated that an insurrectionist coup on January 6th and denied a free and fair election. You don't seem to care about this.  
  
How was it a coup? What was the plan? Who was involved in the plan? What proof do you have of any such plan and how was Trump involved in these plans? I'm perfectly ok with the president asking for protesting and protestors supporting their candidate.   
  
&gt;    Trump extorted Zelenskyy and was IMPEACHED for it.  
  
Not by the Senate. That makes it politics that fails to make it's own impeachment legitimate. In other words, slow news days because that impeachment with a pack of bubble gum only gives you a pack of bubblegum. It literally has zero repercussion of anything beyond showing that the democrats will do anything to gain their own power.   
  
&gt;    The 2016 Foreign interference in the election was substantive  
  
You really are just repeating yourself! How so exactly? Exactly how substantive was it???  
  
&gt;    You continue ignoring the other vectors through which Russians interfered in the 2016 and 2020 elections.  
  
I'm not particularly interested in covering how foreign countries interfere. I would assume many other countries try to interfere. We do in their elections!!!   
None of that means Trump was involved.   
Do you think different? If so, how so?   
Everyone knows why foreign countries would interfere against Clinton. She was a known admitted warhawk far more hawkish then even our military generals. This is documented. She was a threat to the entire planet so it seems obvious that other nations would be concerned about her against a dovish Trump. when our intelligence agencies have stated that at best any interference was negligible then it's not much of a concern.   

&gt;&gt;All your arguments are best-summarized with INCREDIBLY WEAK Whataboutism + False-Equivalence fallacies. Focus on the worse offenders, which are obviously Republicans.  
  
Again check mirror. Maybe keep some tissue next to you because all I hear is whining and no concrete answers.   
    
  
&gt;&gt;Conservative parents don't believe empathy and tolerance are important virtues to instill in their children (that's a bit concerning, as I thought they were the party who always invoking Jesus...).  
  
Where did this even come from? Now you are just making up shit!!! Too funny!  
  
&gt;Liberals believe it is important to teach Children:
    Curiosity
    Empathy
    Tolerance
  
You must be referencing things like this:   
https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1587149047634087936?s=20&amp;t=4luoDFic2Db_O27-CfuLSw  
https://youtu.be/DntwrhKvIlU  
  
Is that's what you are referencing then no I do not support teaching that to children! Id rather have children be children instead of being exposed to adult sexual fantasies.  

&gt;&gt;Whereas Conservatives believe it's important to teach:
    Obedience
    Faith
  
That's part of living in a civil society to obey society's norms.   
  
&gt;&gt;It's right here where you see the divide being sown. Empathy—a high-level emotion—needs to be fostered  
  
Another empty argument that I have no empathy based on no factual evidence to base your claim on. That's on you. that's also on you not empathizing with my position and where I am coming from but yet you are quick to call my names and make claims of my character. I call that being a hypocrite.   
    
&gt;    Conservatives are responsible for the vast majority of violence in our nation's history.  
  
I shouldnt have to say this but REDDIT is NOT a credible source and you would not be able to use it in school or any other researched documentation. Loooool Cherrypicked ancedotal evidence does not make a case.   
  
&gt;    Conservatives / Trump supporters are the least-educated Source 2 Source 3  
  
Well, I'm educated and I've rebutted all your point so now you need to ignore those and stretch yourself to other points not related to our initial conversation. Hilarious.   
  

&gt;Testosterone, the predominant male hormone is known to elevate rage and aggression while muting emotional sensitivities like empathy.   
  
Does it only elevate to rage and aggression or is this more reaching?   Does this somehow make men less then women because we have higher testosterone - in your high level of thinking?   
 
the entire 2nd half of your comment is basically into comedyland! Wtf dude! Get a grip!  I thought I was conversing with someone rational but now I'm concerned you may come over with a hammer in your hand!   
  
So testosterone is bad.  
conservatives must employ aggression and intimidation due to a lack of reasoning (all???)  
conservatives must provably have more fear and anger due to a larger amygdala and reduced pattern recognition and lack of adaptation.   
  
Then you just make a story up in your head about all conservatives? like everyone is all the same and does the same thing and lives the same lives? Is this from the same guy pushing empathy and tolerance, oh and curiosity???    
  
and conservatives are more shortsighted,   
more stressed!   
More selfish,   
and then... we need to start considering the possibility that it's not that education is biased with liberalism, but that liberalism is a result of being educated  
  
  
WOW  
  
You literally grouped half the country into your fantasy of how half the country is and used your gibberish nonsense to validate a story you completely made up. I can't even.......  
  
WOW. Crazyland! Talk about so out of touch with any semblance of reality! I've had a lot of conversations on redditt and I think you may have made it direct to the top of conversations I can't believe are legit!!! Seriously.

No, not really. Mitochondria are inherited mostly from the mother and the brains  consumer metabolic energy which is supplied by mitochondria. But that does not mean it provides intelligence any more than a brain also consumes a lot of water, therefore water creates intelligence. And while you just cite something you probably just googled after seeing my response, as it was not there when I responded, you didn't provide a source.

However, I am familiar with what you are claiming, and it has been largely debunked:

It's easy to say employees can move, but most employees are going to have family. Maybe the spouse has a job and can't move.  Most municipal tier jobs are like this.  So now you're paying someone extra to make up for a longer commute OR they quit and go to work for your competition.  The competition that maybe put up a billboard saying if you worked here you'd be be at work already.  (Real story btw)

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","With only the wind shear rune for WW. I can sustain max fury with no issues. The opener is the important part. I use war cry to buff battle rage and then before I get to the first pack I zerker and then stomp (I use the fury gen rune for stomp) the first couple of mobs. The fury I get from stomp is always enough to start spinning. Just gotta keep pulling after that. 

I do my best to weave rends at max fury or when stomp is off CD to get back to max fury quickly. Hope it helps!

Just to add: You can definitely run bul kathos weapons. I use them for any farm content. The perma max fury / movement speed is super nice. But for pushing always try to use rogue / slander for the buffs.

Also, furious charge has a rune that reduces the CD based on how many people you hit. If you keep smashing into mobs it’s always off CD and generates rage. It’s both nice for farm content for the speed and the rage gen it can provide.",1667260850

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA. Do you not realise just how delusional you sound right now?? It would be the absolute deal breaker for me if I found out my husband's mom who seems to have trouble respecting boundaries, was contacting my family and sending pictures of my son to the same people who probably hurt me or did something awful to me. There's a reason why your wife doesn't talk to her family and your mother had absolutely no right to do what she did even if she didn't know the reason. Your mother is not entitled to your wife's past issues and she should not have done that. What your mother did was incredibly disrespectful and ignorant. Like why is she trying to get in contact with her son's wife's family??? Also saying your wife would not be a good mother simply for 'abandoning' her own is a stupid and godawful thing to say. Your wife might have had abusive parents and has finally managed to leave them but your mother decided to be meddlesome and nosy. And you telling your wife it is her fault that your mother did all this stuff is basically victim blaming 101. Your wife doesn't have to tell your mother anything personal about her and your mother is NOT entitled to that. And then you make it even worse by telling your mother exactly why your wife doesn't talk to her parents anymore, something which your wife clearly only trusted you with and doesn't want your mom to know. And your mom pretending to be apologetic and shit when it's obvious she clearly doesn't give af and just wants to isolate herself from the problem she created. YTA Op you and your mother are TA. Can't wait for your wife to divorce your ass and find someone and their family who actually respects her.",1667260850

We got our limited Intel ARC stock through official distribution channels and they're priced to provide less than 10% margin.

Half in not paying rent for two months and half with a big cheque as we left. The second time it happened the homeowner got dumped and needed a place to live. He had to move back in and he was in rough shape. He offered to pay our move but we ended up settling on let us stay here until we can find a new place and he wouldn’t accept our rent cheques.

"GroundedGame","t5_28fh29","It's disappointing, it kind of feels like the devs are fixated on making sure that players don't have too much fun. If they're concerned about people being able to over-farm, limiting it to 5%-10% ROI would be totally reasonable, and eliminate the tedium of having to wait for 2-3 hours for wolf spiders, etc to respawn. I'm a middle aged dude, and while I really enjoy this game, I can't afford to put 40 hours into grinding late game resources. And in a single player game, they shouldn't be so concerned about exploits. Players like exploits; they're fun. Sorry for the rant, I've just been increasingly frustrated with the bait and switch mechanics in this game. I wouldn't care if it didn't have so much potential.",1667260851

Why give me links if you don't read the sources on the link?  
  
1. Most of the sources come from this website (https://www.animals24-7.org/2017/06/14/rescued-pit-bulls-now-outnumber-pit-puppies/) which if you can't tell by the eye-bleeding amount of orange and random animal social media posts strewn all over the place, just look at the owner's bios - https://www.animals24-7.org/biographies/, aren't animal experts, but is made up of a group of people who's only qualifications are, and I quote, ""an active member of many social media newsgroups pertaining to animals and habitat"".  
  
2. The other sources come from https://www.dogsbite.org/, owned by the conspiracy theorist who, aside from having no actual qualifications to speak about animals, gets her ""statistics"" from random newspaper clippings and thinks the CDC is ran by a shadowy lobby to secretly cover up killing children. Don't believe me? Here's her about page:  
""We are the primary 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to putting the safety of humans before dogs and the principal source of information on this topic that is not owned, controlled, or funded by dog breeders, dog advocacy, veterinarian or animal welfare groups."" (AKA, no actual animal experts have written or contributed to any of the info on this site.)  
  
""DogsBite.org is also the primary whistleblower combating well-funded animal “expert” groups that manipulate the truth about dangerous dog breeds, primarily pit bulls."" ""We are the public's countervailing force to these well-funded animal groups that have no mission or duty to protect human lives."" (The well funded animal groups she's talking about are the actual animal organizations and CDC research)

Look on the bright side, even if Star Citizen does eventually fail, the modified Crysis Engine and the tech they created will lead to more games being made with it that can keep moving this stuff forwards.

"auslaw","t5_2stjv","&gt;Dr Iliadis says the most common concern among victim survivors was the potential for body-worn cameras to misidentify the primary aggressor.

There's that word again!

&gt;Another victim survivor in the survey reported that they could be mistaken as the abuser in these moments when they are triggered and acting out of survival response.

&gt;""When the body-worn camera footage is used as evidence, it doesn't show the full extent of the emotional, verbal, financial, or control and manipulation that occurs within the context of that relationship,"" Dr Iliadis adds.

Again, the fact that we've come around to 'you made me hit you' as any kind of defence boggles my mind. You are certainly entitled to defend yourself if you fear for your physical safety, but giving your partner the back of your hand because they won't stop nagging is something I thought we'd agreed was Not Okay some time ago. 

DV can be an extremely tricky issue because it can certainly be two people who won't stop 'triggering' each other. I agree that we focus too much on the purely physical aspect of DV or a purely victim-abuser dynamic, and in doing so, ignore that many of these relationships are *mutually* abusive. That's not misidentification. There's a [fun study](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/domestic-violence-is-most-commonly-reciprocal/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07) on this.

&gt;In recent years researchers have approached populations without preconceptions as to the direction of violence. Large epidemiological studies have demonstrated that domestic violence is most commonly reciprocal and that when only one partner is violent there is an excess of violent women. Whitaker et al, Reference Whitaker, Haileyesus, Swahn and Saltzman2 in a study of 14 000 young US couples aged 18-28 years, found that 24% of relationships had some violence and half of those were reciprocally violent. In 70% of the non-reciprocally violent relationships women were the perpetrators of violence. Reciprocal violence appears to be particularly dangerous, leading to the highest rate of injury (31.4%). This may be because reciprocal violence is more likely to escalate.

Moving beyond the victim-abuser binary is something we're working towards, but I find the suggestion that an objective capture of testimony and events by BWV is 'harmful' blinkered at best.",1667260852

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","Thank you for taking the time to share your story with me and everyone here.  It makes me angry to hear your mom do this to you and your bio sibs at such a young age.

Here are the kickers with my stbxw.  Her father left her mom and brothers at a young age for another woman who had her own kids.  She told me that she suspected for years that her dad was cheating on her mom but didn't say anything until my stbxw and I were dating.   She even told her mom about her suspions infront of her mom infront of me and her mom told her she knew all these years. 

Over the years of being with my stbxw I realized that her mom took her dad to the cleaners in the divorce.  She got a lot of money, a good amount of his retirement and pretty much a good amount of custody with the kids. 

As her feelings towards her father,  I heard nothing but resentment towards him from her over in our relationship.   It would be comments like, ""he was only around when I was in trouble.."" when she talked about him. 

Now she is the wife and mom...doing the same as her father...leaving us to start a new life with her AP with the mentality that she can shove me aside and scoop our kid away and be a happy new family that she didn't have when she was 7....which coincidently is the same age our daughter is now.  I guess she think integration is going to be easy as he as 2 daughters of his own....but in Germany.

I have played the role of mom and dad since the seperation and spending that quality time with her which her mom is welcomed to do things with her daughter but she chooses not to.  She has started showing anger towards her mom but I intervine and remind her that she needs to show respect to her mom even though I despise her for abandoning us.  

Of course mom thinks that spending quality time with our child means that I am spoiling her and trying to make her take sides, which I am not...but am not going to let her sit around watching TV all weekend and instead taking her to do activities,  show her what the world had to offer and so on.  My daughter looks up to me and admires me for making these memories with her.

Mom is currently trying to force play therapy on our daughter.   There is nothing I can legally do.  I can't go and tell her that mom is leaving us for another man.  On my end I have been gathering so much evidence of the affair and the money transfers to the AP, her violent in home behaviors (caught on camera) and abandonment of our daughter.   Lawyer already told me I have very strong case against her and am looking at more than 50 percent custody,  possibly full because a judge may see her unfit to be a parent if she has a history of doing this shit.",1667260852

i mean, logically, if you're addicted to something, it becomes really hard to break a habit at first, but if you find other things to do like a hobby you like, or find something good to do that will be healthy for you instead of the bad thing (or thing you don't want to do), then eventually the want fades?

i mean, it requires knowing techniques on how to deal with the urge when you have it and resist doing it, but IMO once you get over the fence it's home run?

This is not the outlook for the future. At all. Now Facebooks faces completely different challenges. Their current performance against the new challenges has been abysmal.

I've already implemented and/or tried all the accommodations, modifications, and general suggestions they gave me at the onset, plus anything I've been able to think up or I've read online that might be beneficial and nothing has made a significant difference in this particular behavior unfortunately.  Beyond what they did/said when he was first enrolled, they've not been willing to assist further.  I've made both district and local teams aware of the issue.

After this happened a couple times, when I started sensing a meltdown was coming, I tried contacting our on-site SPED teachers and their support staff, to see if someone could come down and assist, or at least observe the behavior.  They essentially told me tough luck, its lunch break and they have things to do.  District said they could send someone in to do further evaluation and observation, assess whether he needed to be in a contained classroom, but it would take 6-8 months on average to complete the process.  By then, the school year will be over or nearly over.

I've spoke with my administrative team numerous times about him and the SPED team's response. Admin's idea is that I just need to build a better rapport and everything will be okay.  They essentially demand that a food tray gets sent to the classroom every lunch period he refuses to leave, which further enables the behavior and doesn't motivate him to go.  They expect me to spend every lunch break, prep period, or in-school event he doesn't want to go to, in my classroom with this student.

Aside of him bolting after the PE teacher screamed at him, nothing has persuaded him to leave the classroom.  With admin minimizing it to a rapport issue, and SPED acting like I'm inconveniencing them, I'm stuck between a rock and hard place.",1667260854

You can argue that this family has given us free this and that, but those are nothing but carrot on a stick to distract the majority from this silent corruption.

If the family had taken less, maybe 5-10% only, and the rest is used to spend for Brunei, we would see a better Brunei.",1667260854

"Piracy","t5_2qmox","It's a trap! You chose the wrong flair and removed your own post. You can't request for specific pirated titles here.

We have [**a Wiki**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/wiki/), containing a Megathread of pirate sites / apps / tools / FAQ.

You may also use [**the search bar**](https://i.imgur.com/F8HqRgX.jpg), or [search the subreddit **via google** for better results.](https://i.imgur.com/1jA767u.jpg)

If the wiki, or searching the subreddit, did not yield answers, you may re-submit your post with the `Question` flair if your post does not break rule 3:

### Rule 3. Do not request for specific pirated titles (ie. a specific movie, book title, software title, etc.); do not link to pirated content. [Why?](https://www.reddit.com/r/piracy/wiki/subfaq)
 * 3a. You **may ask** generalized questions such as ""Where can I find 4K movies, children's books, sci-fi books, etc."". You **may not** name a specific work's title in your content request.
 * 3b. Do not link to specific pirated media. You **may link** to the top level of a site, eg. https://1337x.to but **never** to a specific pirated release, eg. http://1337x.to/specific-movie-torrent
 * 3c. Do not encourage rule breaking by asking which specific title someone is looking for when they make a request

Blind, ignorant hate is poison…. but hate due to a reasonable offense? It can exist to protect us from further interacting with a source of bad feelings.    

I used to feel bad about hating a certain pedophile in my life, because they MADE me feel like I was bad for disliking them and being vocal about it. Because they were trying to cover their ass.           

Fuck that. Sometimes having self respect and not bowing to the expectations of being a ‘quiet and agreeable woman’ means unapologetically hating someone. 🤷🏼‍♀️

"ValueInvesting","t5_2rndg","Arnault owns LVMH through a series of holdings, and Dior is the big holding above LVMH. This is a leftover from his empire building early days where owning 51% of a company that owns 51% of another gave you effective control of the whole thing with just ~26% total ownership.

Because it's a holding you get a small discount compared to owning LVMH directly (I think about 15% but haven't checked lately) but for all intent and purpose they are essentially the same asset as LVMH.

Arnault is old and has been busy simplifying his web of holdings to pass on the business to his kids. Dior nowadays serves no purpose, and a lot of people expect it to be eventually liquidated, which would allow shareholders to receive the LVMH shares and pocket the holding discount for themselves.

Edit: [the Arnault web of holdings as of 2019](http://ekladata.com/iplySal_SONVOogN5K7s79faozs/OrganigrammeGlobalArnault2019.pdf) (PDF), a sight to behold",1667260855
"Eldar","t5_2ug1c","I'M NOT SAYING THEY AREN'T GOOD! I keep saying that! And I keep saying that their effectiveness in gameplay situations is irrelevant to the argument at hand! What I'm saying is that the effects the mask has are mostly things that happen *whenever* ***any*** *unit* charges a target. And if the *basic equipment* is supposed to have an effect, it is irrelevant what effect possible upgrades have.

And once more, just so we're being clear:

* In most cases, a charging unit *will. fight. first.* 
* Denying OW means that if the unit either doesn't have good enough guns or the player doesn't have enough CP, *the effect doesn't matter*.
* Denying Set to Defend means that the scream is somehow dependent on the target being inside a building (the most common type of Defensible terrain, there are others, moving on) in order to provide its stunning effect (or lack of it).

But in fairness, I suppose the effects, though lacklustre in terms of execution (not effect, because *that isn't what this argument is about*) are similar to what other books with supposed stun effects have. They, however, don't have these effects only ever activate on the charge, which is what is making the banshee mask look so pointless.

The only effects I could quickly find that differ are mostly stuff like losing Obsec (which I wouldn't think fits), reducing move and charge (which is irrelevant) or providing a -1 to hit (which we already have).

&amp;#x200B;

And just to reiterate: The difference between these effects and the banshee mask is that the banshee mask only activates on the charge, which usually provides one of the mask's effects already (the Banshees striking before the enemy does) or prevents the enemy from using rules and stratagems that they might not have had access to anyway (refer back to the existence of units with poor ranged weapons and units that aren't sitting in defensible terrain). The stun effect seems to function by taking away things that some targets *don't fucking have*. They *can* have those and they *might* have those, but if they don't, then the banshee mask's effect is nonexistent. I can't be assed to think of a proper analogy for how mind-bendingly stupid this is and strawman arguments are bullshit anyway.",1667260855

BigLaw sucks in many ways, but if your goal is to learn an area of law by working on sophisticated matters, and develop some lawyering skills in the process, that is achievable in BigLaw.  That is the approach I tried to take, and I always thought it would be transferable to some other context if I didn't make partner.  I also enjoy writing articles, speaking, etc., which made it easier to try to market myself within and outside the firm.   People in other practice groups started coming to me when their client had an issue that related to my niche.  At a certain point I become comfortable advising clients (on some things) without having to run it by the partner first.  After awhile, I found myself basically acting like a partner.   I know people who ""gunned"" for partner a lot harder than I did, but I definitely do not know anyone who had an associate mindset for 10 years and then magically made it.",1667260856

Still, the intent of the two conductor cable is to use one for (+) and one for (-), with the shield not connected or (better) connected to (-) at only the source end, which grounds the shield without using it to pass a signal.

Somewhat surprisingly there is a cheaper model that sleeps six, the most expensive one of the size pictured that could be a 3 bed. So let’s say it’s that one, they’ve dropped €60,000 on it if it’s brand new.

It's influence was felt by Bilbo, Frodo, and Smeagal as nothing more than a desire to keep the Ring to themselves. Which served Sauron fine, because as long as it was in their hands, it was safe. Being immortal, Sauron could afford to wait for one of his servants to find them and recover the Ring.",1667260859

I respect the different opinion but I actually disagree with this. To learn physics properly it is actually almost *all* math. Yes there are some concepts that can in principle be explained without the math, but you fundamentally will not understand physics properly without calculus. 

If you're going down the math rabbit hole anyway you might as well wait until you start calculus to start college physics courses.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Also, is it worth learning Algebra based Physics before Calc based?

I would argue no, it is not. But it is perfectly fine to take calc simultaneously with your first physics (mechanics) class. The calculus in an introductory physics (mechanics!! not E&amp;M!) class is very basic.",1667260859

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I was about 20 or so when that happened with Reagan.

That and the trickle down tax cuts. I pointed out some of the ""fuck you I've got mine"" to the folks about 15 years older than me.

I said that they were basically stealing money their kids would have to pay for. Things got quiet, and people got angry.

Now I'm almost 60 and have had to watch it play out. I've  been watching this happen over my whole adult life, like a gory slow motion trainwreck.

I almost didn't have kids because of that, it's ramifications, and global warming which scientists were talking about even then.

The info was there. Most ignored it, grabbed the cash, and said we'll worry about it later.


Well It's later.

Did they reduce when they wasted the soup or when they wasted the cleaning supplies to clean that shit up?

They opened a new can, they didn't even reuse it. And they sure as fucked didn't recycle it...

So the ads that as you said are already common knowledge, are the opposite of what what they are doing and saying. 

Everyone knows recycling exists people been talking about it for like 40 years. Probably more.

How many people know about the ozone layer? Literally fucking everybody. On the news, it's an ads, it's in children's cartoons it's in TV and movies... And it has been for decades now.

Awareness is not a solution. You have to raise awareness .**of the solution.**

If there's nothing you can do about it, then it doesn't fucking matter how aware of it you are. It doesn't fucking matter cuz we already fucking know and there's not shit we can do about it we are already aware. We are fully fucking aware.

I did educate myself before the conversation, which is why I was able to have the conversation and keep up and be able to talk about exactly what was wrong. Exactly what they did. Exactly what they said and why it wasn't anything new...

You on the other hand have yet to actually explain anything. Did you actually read into the articles or hear anything they had to say?

I even asked you in another comment to explain what exactly you thought they were accomplishing. And you didn't have an answer. 

Which is why I went ahead and answered for you, you and I both know that they had nothing to say otherwise you would have been able to point out exactly what they had to say. Because they would have said it.

They didn't, so they didn't, so you didn't, because they didn't.

It was pure and simple vandalism by some shitty kids who probably aren't getting enough attention from daddy, and decided to commit some crimes with a very very thin veil of ""activism""

The Commodore was actually killed by Jimmy. He stepped when Jimmy was trying to choke Gillian to death. In the ensuing fight, Jimmy gets the upper hand on him. When he looks to his mom, she says something like, ""End it, goddamn you"". So he does. Gillian probably enlisted Leander in covering it up.  Even if she doesn't, he would have known for sure that Lewis didn't just die in his sleep. Personally, I feel this motive was pretty contrived, but the writers needed someone with means to enlist the Pinkertons(?). Roger, the Jimmy lookalike, was a kid from a middle class family in Indiana. My guess is Leander first tracked down faux-Jimmy's identity, then found his parents and persuaded then to seek justice.

"diabetes","t5_2qhsj","So, making cells that can evade the immune system — and if they become cancerous or infected with viruses, what is to stop them? Just asking. 

Mice and humans have different numbers of chromosomes, and mice are engineered and cloned and poisoned to have diabetes. They don’t necessarily have autoimmunity like Type 1 diabetes. The attack on inserted beta cells is 2-pronged for Type 1 diabetics: As foreign bodies that need to be destroyed and as malfunctions of the self (or whatever actually happens with autoimmunity that no one yet understands). 

So, if this works, maybe it would work in Type 2 without immunosuppressives but they might not work in Type 1 as well because of Problem #2. If they are going to avoid all immune cells, then that could be a solution, but mice have very short lives and humans live about 40x longer, so then would need an exit strategy if something goes wrong. Maybe encapsulation would be okay — inserting and removing pouches of cells, so long as they don’t escape and cause unpredictable issues.",1667260862

That is the first thing you’re going to tell the listener, that serves as a cue for them to actually listen and not just read your note and pretend to listen. You then do a quick one liner, and say why they are here / what needs to be done / followed up on  for them to leave.

**AITA for telling my wife, she only had her self to blame for my mothers actions.**

Hi there everyone. I never thought I’d be asking strangers online for an opinion but here we are. 

I’m Rod (35M) and my wife is Cat (26F). Also involved are my parents, Cat’s parents and our son Jack (16 Months) 

A bit of background. 
So my mother can be a bit overbearing. Because of this her and Cat have always clashed. My mother has strong opinions on what’s best and I’ve often had to ask Cat to let the little things go and compromise. 

Cat is no contact with her family. She hasn’t seen or spoken to them in 6 years. They weren’t at our wedding they have never met my son. I do know the reasons but Cat is insistent my mother not be told.

My mother doesn’t approve of Cats non relationship with her family. She believes Cat doesn’t know what it means to be a mother if she can so callously abandon her own. 

Cat also won’t let my mother be alone with Jack. Anytime my mother comes to visit Cat will not leave them alone. I do believe this is disrespectful. 

I convinced Cat yesterday to let my mother babysit. An hour is all I asked for give us some time to go get coffee and be a couple. She reluctantly agreed. However, when we got home, we walked in on my mother video calling Cats family. Apparently my mother has been in touch for a while and secretly sending them photos of my son along with our address and wedding photos.

Cat was furious. She demanded my mother leave instantly and told her she was never welcome in our house or near my son again. My mother left, but not before telling me to fix this and Cat was over reacting. I told Cat that my mother was simply trying to help And she didn’t have a right to ban her from our home or my son. Cat lost it and told me she had been dealing with my mother’s disrespect for years, but she would not allow her to put Jack in the middle. 

I got angry, and told her this never would have happened if she had simply told my mother the truth, and she is the one who chose to make things harder for herself. She has nobody to blame for my mother getting in touch but herself

Cat walked away and began packing some things for her and Jack . I kept talking, and she just ignored me as though I wasn’t there. She didn’t say another word to me until she was at the door before telling me she wanted a divorce and leaving. 

She’s been gone all day and I haven’t heard anything except for a text saying that they made it safely to her friends house and we would talk more on Wednesday. 

Am I truly the asshole here? My mother shouldn’t of gotten in touch but she had no right to be as disrespectful as she was. Is this really divorce worthy?


Edit. Since everyone seems to need to know this. My mother did not know why Cat was no contact and did not see it as a big deal. I have since called her a few hours after Cat left and told her the full story of why Cat reacted as she did and is no contact. She feels absolutely terrible about her behavior and wishes she had known sooner. But that was a decision Cat made

EDIT- CAT WAS NOT ABUSED SEVERELY. HER PARENTS ARE SEVERELY RELIGIOUS IN A SMALL COMMUNITY AND WANTED CAT MARRIED AT 18 WITH AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE TO A KNOWN FRIEND OF THEIRS AND HERS. SHE WASN’T TORTURED OR ABUSED.

All of those ""mistakes"" you safe trying to arm chair GM is why we have back to back division titles for the first time since the 60s and are looking likely to go 3 in a row.

I’ve seen examples of people helping where they do get taken to court over it, it’s a crazy world we live in.

A gay man who worked at the bar my girlfriend also works at was taken to court for sexual assault when a younger woman fell down the stairs and he grabbed her to stop her from falling and potentially seriously hurting herself. She was grateful in the moment but then decided to try to press charges? It was on CCTV in a public place.

For me, this is my response when I am feeling my inner Catholic come out -- harsh judgement of myself as a way to deal with perfectly ordinary fears or anger. 

Buddhist do all the normal human things, we are not superhuman, we are are not celestial beings, we make mistakes, we break precepts.  The important thing about taking refuge and keeping to the path is that we take responsibility for our thoughts, words, and deeds.  We try to be present with our afflictive emotions, use techniques of metta and mindfulness with others and with ourselves.  To practice Buddhism, for me, is to be willing to look at myself and my reactive mind.

But at least they get a decent wage towards the end of their careers.  EAs didn't have a decent wage before inflation and absolutely need to be a couple percent ahead of inflation.  If the government is so concerned about making sure kids are in schools getting an education, how is that going to happen when EAs have left for jobs with less risk or more money or both?  An education system needs qualified adults in order to function.  I have often wondered why people remain as EAs ànd so do many of my colleagues.  The pay for what they do is outrageous.

"projecteternity","t5_2v1qz","**On the lack of shield:** I'm not sure I really see the point of playing Unbroken without a shield. Without a shield you're not getting their ""Shield Mastery"" bonus, your lowered Reflex defense won't be boosted by Weapon &amp; Shield-style so you'll be vulnerable to a lot of spells and area-based attacks, and you'll move slower. All for getting better disengagement attacks? Now don't get me wrong, that +10 penetration on DA's is pretty sweet. But in order to get the most out of that you want to maximize your engagement slots, and that generally means using a shield. Generally I don't think that taking two maluses for a single situational buff is all that great. Especially not if enemies aren't disengaging from you because you don't actually have high enough defenses to deter them from just beating you down. If you're not going for the specialization of the subclass, the standard version of the class is usually better. Subclasses aren't generally stronger than the pure class, just more specialized. If you're not leaning into the specialization you're probably getting more maluses than bonuses out of them.

**On Great Swords:** If you like Greatswords, you could go for a Devoted instead which will help shore up the lack of penetration. While I think a character doing the same thing with a different weapon type could do more, I also think that Greatswords are absolutely good enough, and the fact that they are so widely available is very useful to someone who doesn't know where to find all the neat items for their build, and their dual damage type makes them good for a devoted or someone not used to paying attention to the resistances of enemies. Dual damage type also means that low penetration is less of an issue against enemies with different armor ratings against slash and pierece attacks. Penetration doesn't always need to be as high when the weapon is automatically picking the lower of two defenses. However, slashing and piercing armor values don't tend to be too far apart most of the time. Crushing is the one stat stands out, so from that perspective a Pollaxe would be better. But all the other 2H weapons have two or three unique options each which may or may not fit your style. Great Swords have nine. So there's that as well.

The other dude isn't wrong in that Greatswords could've done with a bit of a buff at the base level, but you can absolutely wreck face with a greatsword-focused character.

You could also consider dual-wielding one-handers as that's usually the strongest option for damage on paper, but don't feel forced into it. The game is pretty dang well-balanced. When people are talking about certain options being ""weaker"" than others it's usually very small differences, and the strength of any weapon or spell tends to depend quite a bit on the specifics of the encounter. And like hey sure being slightly more powerful is important but also that monk/priest over there is swinging a greatsword shaped like two snakes and heals the team whenever she kills something. Sometimes the biggest theoretical numbers are important. Sometimes it's important to just be metal as *fuck.*

Edit: The other dude's advice is absolutely correct. If you wanna be an unbroken/trickster tank, then getting a shield and Kapana Taga is a great idea. I just wanted to offer a different perspective in case you like the idea of a Fighter/Illusionist/Thief-style character swinging a big-ass sword and conjuring up illusions and shit.",1667260866

That´s interesting... But for a native it sounds pretty normal. ;) 

It´s not our fault that English makes such a weird use of auxiliaries, word order... \^\^ and developed different forms to express the subjunctive.

^(A similar expression is ""Wären wir mal eher gekommen."" but it expresses more regret, pity about a missed opportunity than the other sentence (which is more about a missed appointment, deadline, because of the ""sollen"" in it, and could be translated as ""If \[only\] we had come earlier"".)

Wir (we)  hätten (3rd person, plural, subjunctive II of haben) eher (earlier) kommen (infinitive come) sollen (infinitive shall).

Seeing the hard-right our country has done in the last 20 years, I wouldn’t be surprised the infection of white supremacy hasn’t already spread to many of our universities. Malevolent admission offices will favor the poor white kids, and ignore the poor Latin/Asian/black folk.

"cheating_stories","t5_3kcu1","He is definitely cheating. Also condoms aren't sold in 2 packs often..... so he already used some. Might have been a box of a hundred. He is a liar so every single word he says should be considered a lie. Get tested he could have given you something. You need to leave unless you want worse pain later on, because it will only get worse. The things you don't know are far worse then what you now of. Run don't walk because he is looking to use you like a throw away towel.
 Seriously though I am terribly sorry this happened to you. I know the pain and it is awful. If you need to talk or even scream. Dm me I can relate to your pain. Just remember everything is 100% his fault. He made many conscious decisions saying yes to cheating on you everytime to reach those points. He is just a pile of shit plaguing you. Wash him off and thank God you didn't find this out later. Cheaters never change, they only get better at hiding it. It is who they are to the core as a person. They are selfish, narcissistic, scumbag assholes and they will manipulate you if you let them. Remember he is not the person you thought he was, that version of him in your head doesn't exist.",1667260868

"trees","t5_2r9vp","Yea I'd prefer to free the people that we locked up after we made what they did a far less punishable crime, over someone from another country for breaking their laws.

I'm confident if she was freed, I'd be okay with her staying in a US prison for a related ""breaking laws of another country in that country"" charge. Idk

I don't think she did anything terribly wrong, but I also chose NOT to bring my weed pen on a trip to an illegal state, so imho it's kind of whack and would just be another example of the rich being able to do what they want with no real punishment if she was released and faced no charges.

If I'm missing a big part of this story, then by all means, fill me in. I just can't grasp the concept of thinking she should be freed just because like a quarter of the states in the US legalized it. If you get caught with 2 carts in my state you can get arrested, and charged with a Felony...Punishment for weed is too much, but why should she be freed and face no punishment when the laws are readily available and it's not like people are stupid enough to think what she did would not face punishment if caught.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","The fact that I entered multiple matchs of qp, just to be met with people whom I initially thought were just amazing shots. Headshotting my entire teams in 5 seconds, then finding people posting videos online of people using aimbots. And the fact that I never ran into this really when I played ow1, made me stop playing the game completely for the last week or so. So, lately, noticed it hasn't been as bad. But, when you watch your entire team die to a Hanzo in 5 seconds,(and he doesn't hit em with his dragon) he's either a god, or cheating, js.

Which, made it hard for me to want to continue playing.
 

(Not saying that ISN'T possible for someone to do without cheats, cause I've gone against some beast ass snipers.)

So, essentially, wish they cracked down on cheaters earlier. And I'm sure they were doing there best. Not a stab at the company or anything. Just made me a lil sad to see people cheating.",1667260868

"quittingkratom","t5_2xty7","I can relate. I’m 10 months off but towards the end of my 3 year habit I had a few full blown paranoid episodes unlike anything I’d experienced previous. One had to do with my wife. She drove away from our house one evening and I completely freaked out thinking she was off to some cheating situation which there’s never been a whiff of in our relationship and I’d never been the jealous type. I had a whole story told in my head. When I blasted her with this she calmly told me, “dude, I’m going to pick up our son at his friend’s house”. I also thought my boss was spying on me at work through leaving the intercom in the room open so that she could listen in on me. Needless to say, also ridiculous. Those episodes and my general misery were springboards for me to finally get off of it. The paranoia and the way it generally ruined me almost wrecked my 12 year marriage. We’re better now but still not where we were and still a bit tenuous. I damaged my family over the damn green powder. It’s hard not to feel like an idiot for doing that.",1667260869

To fix this, I have the following recommended steps for you to follow:

1. To make sure the regen brake throttle is really up all the way, as it might be getting stuck just a little bit before being all the way up which is causing the brake sensor to stay engaged.
2. If issues persists, you could loosen the brake handle and move it to see if it solves the issue as it is possible that the wiring inside is being pulled and causing the sensor to stay engaged.
3. If issue still persists, then final solution would be to replace the handlebar assembly. I could check if we have some in stock, and you really need it, I could have one sent to you under warranty.",1667260870

And in the meantime keep having discussions about what makes a good friend.  Natural consequences will come in for this particular kid in 1-2 years. It’s a long time. Tell me about it.  But honestly focus on your kid.  Ours happen to be neighbors and it’s a nightmare.  I am pretty sure something is off with the kid and parents are inattentive and inconsistent with discipline/boundaries soooooooooo.  M
Easier said than done but I get ya.  The demands of school will catch up to your sons friend I promise you.  But ultimately you need to be hands off and let them handle their friendships.  I’m still kicking myself for not just telling our neighbors my kid doesn’t want to play with theirs bc he’s mean and hits but of course I hadddd to say more.  Kid did stop hitting…. Til now.  So I’ll just keep reminding my own kid of his personal space and how to say no and come tell me if this kid ignores his requests. Model the behavior you want to see.  And if I need to set myself up for success we will prob avoid outside of school interactions where possible bc I’m too stressed out watching them play. I should be able to zone out and be relaxed while watching my kid play. But with this particular kid I can’t. Frustrating as hell",1667260870

"space","t5_2qh87","Thanks for posting the article and summary. The [paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ac8cff) (by Scott Shepard - one of the world leaders in finding small solar system bodies - not to mention other planetary luminaries) is pretty readable by the standards of such things. I'll quote this passage for general interest:

&gt; One way to estimate the true number of small NEOs better is to include more objects found interior to Earth's orbit in population calculations, increasing the completion of orbital NEO types.  

&gt; Currently the population models are biased toward NEOs found exterior to Earth's orbit as they are the easiest to find observationally. Only about 25 asteroids are known that have orbits completely interior to Earth's orbit and have well-determined orbits (called Atira or Apohele asteroids). This is compared to the thousands of known NEOs

&gt; Understanding the relative populations of objects with orbits interior to Earth versus exterior to Earth will help us understand how objects are transported throughout the inner solar system

In other words: understanding more about each one of these ""inner asteroids"" is much more important than your average one for the safety of people on this planet.

Unfortunately, some of the earlier comments in this thread explain why more scientists won't engage with the public outside carefully-managed events. I mean, some seem to have been removed, but there were literal Facebook/Daily Mail/Russian troll-quality comments in here like

&gt; scientists find rocks in space, who cares
&gt;
&gt; After successfully sending a probe that knocked an asteroid off course (direct perfect hit), these articles don’t bother me anymore.

I know people are going to shrug and say ""That's Reddit for you"", but this is r/space. We have literal astronauts and astronomers posting here all the time. If people care enough about this stuff to look in this sub in the first place, I think we can expect better. Scientist or layperson, I think we can all agree that curiosity should be respected.",1667260870

In my area, parents are still brainwashing their kids to follow the family tradition of coal mining. There are kids in high school choosing a dying industry to bank on, with years of brainwashing telling them that *it's the only job they can do.* Had they been better educated, they would be able to see that it's dad and grandad making a shit decision for them.",1667260872

Another got off on causing pain.  

I assume I have had sex with a lot more men than you have.  I am an old lady after all.  I was age 50 when I finally had great sex.   When I was finally with a man that learnt how to pleasure women.  

He had a harem of women.   I thought I was his girlfriend.    It is that hard to find.  And it took a chymidia scare to put me off.  It was so beautiful it was addictive.   

He would not wear a condom and I could not tolerate the risk.  I have almost doubled that number now, and have not had anything close to that beautiful again.   It doesn't have to match.  Just provide even half the pleasure he did",1667260872

"AzureLane","t5_3p20d","Depends on what ur back line is. If you’re running the current metal of shinano+hakuryuu+parseval/musashi/ark, then survivability of your front line probably isn’t an issue, u should be able to kill the arbiter boss before your front line dies. So ideally u want 3 supports. 

Helena and kazagumo are definitely high priority. If you have musashi in backline, Bellona can replace kazagumo. In a pinch, ariake can sub her out too. 

If the enemy is dd Cl or Ca, Sirius would be a nice pick for avi boost and damage modifier. If enemy is dd, also consider using aurora. 

If survivability turns out to be a problem, put pearls tears on Sirius since her ability is still active after sinking and put the damage control on Helena. If this still doesn’t do it, consider using anchorage or agir",1667260873

 In US you have corruption but not like US. In US ""socialism"" means healthcare and job security, here it means Venezuela. They use the poor as shield to hide corruption behind. I am PT but the corruption is too much. However to put perspective I voted for Lula.  People in US don't believe it's true but you have decent politicians who are least try to do good.

Some tips for learning a new language:
Watch English movies to learn how to engage in a conversation and the “norm” of a conversation 
There are dedicated playlists to learning English on YouTube go through some people and see which on your mom can engage with the most 
Don’t rush in and try to learn everything all at once, there are a lot of rules in the English language which can be overbearing 
Get a Punjabi English dictionary and slowly go through it  
Writing simple phrases in a notebook helps also with general format and grammar 
Hope this helps and good luck",1667260874
"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","The point that I believe he's trying to make is that things like the above video are not happening all across America. America is a very large country and shootouts are not common in most places. I've lived in Texas for almost 25 years. We may not have the most amount of guns versus the other 49, but we are some of the proudest and loudest about owning firearms. I have never been in a shootout or been involved in any situation like the above.

If we're gonna play a statistics game then let's play a [statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/accidental-injury.htm) [game.](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/03/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/) 45,000 people died in the US in 2020 due to guns. Over half of them were due to suicide. You have a higher chance of tripping and dying than you do of being shot in the US.

120 guns per capita in the US doesn't take into account that most people that do own guns own more than one gun. I'm sure you already know that there are more guns in the US than there are people. Less than a third of Americans own guns.",1667260874

"wargaming","t5_2qthz","DBA will work great with blocks (actually seen some battle reports played with blocks). Never played any of the warlord games, but I bet it would work too. 

I was going to recommend [Ancient Pub Battles](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/304599/ancient-pub-battles) for quick and simple block system, but from your choices above it seems you're after a more granular army building, so it might not be the perfect fit for that.

I usually play pretty rules light games, and if you're not afraid of giving them a try I'd recommend [Project10](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFUOJR_kjPqHKR7FdKfcqQUB7ocBmkjL0SEZjFPaF6g/edit). It's an work-in-progress ruleset from one of my favorite designers, technically designed for 10mm fantasy, but can scale to blocks easily (movement is done in base/block length, so you can use blocks of any size) and [the author has some thoughts of how to apply it to historical games](https://www.bastionland.com/2021/10/historical-project-10.html). However, nothing is stopping you from ""designing"" your own units, the system makes it easy - just choose two special traits to represent your unit. It should be a breeze if you already know decent amount about the period, and if not, you can easily ""port"" the units from something like DBA. This is one of my favorite mass battle systems and I highly recommend at least checking it out.

Edit: Oh, and I just remembered about [Triumph](https://www.wargamevault.com/product/196955/TRIUMPH-v11). Its a DBA-like, but streamlined compared to the original, and while I haven't had a chance to play it, I keep hearing good things about it from people who are into ancients.

Why would I want natural red meat when eating it twice a week would triple my chance of heart disease before 55?

Why would I want natural chicken when it's pumped so full of antibiotics and random antivirals that we get shit like avian flu killing a large chunk of the UK wildlife to sustain it?

Why would I want natural pork when 30% of British pig farms have been sanctioned for porcine TRENCH FOOT in the last decade?

Why in hell would I want natural beef when methane from cow farts alone produces more greenhouse gas than the world's international flights? Do you know how many cows that is, produced on a ""natural"" conveyer belt to keep hardcore big man carnivores like you feeling like big boys with their big steaks?

"KGBTR","t5_12t6sw","İlkokul 3. sınıfa kadar abimle aynı odada uyurduk. babamın ranza yerine alttan çekmeli tekerlekli bir yatak tasarımı vardı ve ben alttan çekilen yatakta uyurdum, abim esas yatakta uyurdu. 8 yaşımdayken abime ayrı oda verildi ve kısa bir süre sonra dedem öldü. Abime başka bir yatak alındı ve benim alttan çekmeli yatağımın olduğu yer bomboş kaldı. Her gece odada başka birinin, abimin olması güvencesiyle uyuyan ben, artık tek başıma uyuyordum ve cenazesine katılmama yaşım küçük olduğu için travma yaratır diye katılmayan ben artık tek başıma uyuyordum. Cenazeye katılmamıştım ama cenazenin ne demek olduğunu az buçuk filmlerden dizilerden biliyordum. (89'luyum ve Star TV Parliament Gece Sineması ve Korku Kuşağı sayesinde Freddy Krueger dayımın oğlu gibi olmuştu amk nasıl bilmeyeyim)

Her neyse sözün özü, geceleri uyurken dedemin cesedinin ve tabutunun varlığını o yatağın altındaki boşlukta hissediyordum. Orada olduğunu düşünüp korkuyordum demiyorum bakın, orada olduğunu **hissediyordum**. Dedem severdi beni. ""Matara kafa"" derdi rahmetli. Ama gözlerimi her kapadığımda aklımda beliren görüntü ""*matara kafaaa*"" diyerek tabuttan elini çıkaran bir cesetten ibaretti. Annemler yan odada uyuyordu ama ben sesimi bile çıkaracak cesareti bulamıyordum. Bu korkuyu nasıl yendim, nasıl atlattım, ne ara normalize ettim hiçbir fikrim yok. Ama hatırlamak istemeyeceğim kadar uzun bir süreç olduğunu biliyorum.",1667260875

I am 30M. My wife Lila is 28F. My friend Zach is 25M. 

Zach is my best friend. We met at work a couple years ago and it was like an instantaneous connection. I’m quiet and introspective and he’s loud and the life of the party. We get along really well. Because of Covid and our jobs being in person we spend a lot of time together. Lily was jealous of Zach and kept trying to control my time with him.

They met once and Zach thought Lily was funny and sweet and quite pretty. Lily still thought he was interfering in our marriage. I don’t like sex because of all the fluids and gross actions which has been a point of contention in our marriage. Zach offered to scratch Lily’s itch so to speak and so I suggested they hang out one on one to see if they would be friends and they kind of did. From then on we were all friends with them having a purely sexual relationship.

The problem is that Zach is too affectionate to my wife. My wife is a cuddlebug so she loves all that stuff. He hugs her, kisses her, and acts like her husband. I feel like kisses are something romantic between a husband and wife. While it’s fine occasionally in the bedroom if they get carried away, I don’t want them to be kissing. He initiates most of the contact. 

I told him I didn’t want him to kiss my wife. He was outraged and kept making bad faith comparisons. I told him he couldn’t hang out without me if he was going to continue acting affectionate to my wife. He said my wife liked it. I said I didn’t and his opinion didn’t matter because he wasn’t a part of the relationship. He stormed out. Our mutual friends who know of the situation are torn. My wife doesn’t know of the situation.

See the thing with this is that even in the old games this detail is inconsistent. In a lot material in XX, it's made pretty explicitly clear that Bridget doesn't really have any issues presenting feminine and living as a girl, but *does* have issues with the fact that her parents essentially forcing her to do this causes them great amounts of pain and guilt. Bridget then leaves the village to prove the superstition wrong to help *them*, and less so herself. 

There's also a decent amount of nuance in Bridget's story in that it's not ever hidden from her that she was born male. She's aware of that fact all through XX, and is aware of her circumstances that make her have to present feminine. 

Like it's not exactly the most unproblematic backstory for a trans character, but imo it's a far cry from the ""literally grooming"" a lot of weirdoes on Twitter make it out to be.",1667260876

The FDA requires products labeled as light cream contain between 18 and 30 percent milkfat, which means it is fattier than half-and-half but not as rich and creamy as heavy cream.Jul 8, 2022",1667260876

It was never a coup, it doesn't even come close to the definition, unless you want to say Yanu-b*tch kidnapped himself to Moscow.  Is that what you're saying? He was possessed of himself by a secret CIA psychic implant that made him walk himself to his helicopter and leave his ostrich riddled palace? 

I'm not speaking propaganda, because only one of us is spouting absolute garbage nonsense. 

You're the a$$w*pe suggesting ruzzia has legitimate claim to the territory of ukraine and ukraine should concede so it can stop being killed, as if it would ever stop with ukraine or ever stop with giving what the bully wants.

Go f*ck yourself. You're literally the one legitimizing the torture, rape, and genocide of ukrainians. And yeah, I don't think you give a single shit about civilians.",1667260877

I chose 50 because the first tier of printing was something like up to 26 cards, and I wanted more than that. The next tier was up to 54. I could have done the full 54, but to be honest I ran out of ideas at that point!

Loki (series) set up Kang, I don’t see why it wouldn’t be about them (Loki or thor) . Loki was obsessed enough with himself long enough until sylvie and her/ his ? Disagreement on what path to choose that he seems to have a redemptive state to correct things having come to terms with the pos he was in the infinity saga. Thor has lost everyone close to him over and over and over again, he has adopted a celestial resurrected daughter of gorr who wanted to end all gods (higher power) , and even used the bifrost to uncover eternity. Kang wanting to be above all else is a tell all like thanos desire to wipe half of universe because it is “right” . Now I really don’t know anything about the comics but this is my theory and it’s the only tangible hold I have on this posited question. I really can’t see any other characters in mcu since black widows release in theatres to present that would have a deeper rooted connection to being key to defeating kang personally .",1667260877

During my whole life i never had problems with my grades in school, actually i did very good but was never top of the class beacause i would always be distracted and doing other things in class than rather study or doing my task. When the covid lockdown came in i really had problems with my concentration and it affected my grades so i went to a psychiatrist and he told me something that blew my mind: ""Yes, you have ADHD, it seems pretty obvious to me because of how you describe yourself but that doesnt mean that you need medication. You have gone through your whole life (im 22) without it and you were perfectly fine, now with the lockdown you find yourself in new life circunstances that may require you to take medication to compensate while you go trough them but why i would medicate you for the rest of your life when you dont require it, you are a as functional as someone without ADHD.""

Yes, some art would take into account the fact it would be displayed using a low quality connection, but I'd say most would not. Dithering is done as a normal pixel art technique per se when you are confronted with a limited palette.

The N64 and PS1 used dithering because of technical reasons, namely to save bandwidth, but also because to avoid banding. If you are doing a smooth gradient in 16bit colour you'll easily notice banding without dithering. 

RGB connections were a thing in Europe and Japan since the 16bit era... And when showing people the difference in image quality on the Mega Drive, I've yet to find someone who prefers the blurry mess that is composite.",1667260879

Notice how FtM transitions never play in the men's league? Hmm, wonder why? Could be because it harbors zero competitive advantage? Almost like all of the MtFs switching leagues has nothing to do with anything besides that gigantic advantage it offers them. 

By forcing women to play with biological men, you've literally erased as safe-space that was designed specifically for women. You are propping up trans people as more important than that, based on the internal feelings of that individual, instead of the shared reality we all inhabit.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","One of the main arguments I've seen is that rent control is bloodletting masquerading as a bandaid fix for a misdiagnosed symptom (colorful imagery mine, ec*nomists would never be this entertaining).

Basically the claim is that the real issue is ultimately housing availability. They argue rent prices are high predominantly due to zoning regulations forbidding the construction of new housing. Things like ""only single-family homes in this area (no multi-family). These regulations not pertaining to safety, but rather supported by existing homeowners that want to keep the value of their home high (the so called NIMBY's). No idea how pozzed this sub is, but it has some examples of [kooky regulations](https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanplanning/comments/s3ddb2/what_are_some_of_the_most_ridiculous_zoning/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button).

Rent control can actually make the problem even worse because it's a disencentive to construct housing that isn't extremely profitable. Rent control often sets a limit on how much rent can *increase* and exempts new housing. So there's a big incentive to build condos and other shit that can charge more before being limited. I guess it's a ""Capitalism hurt itself in it's confusion!"" moment where greedy people are limiting even greedier people from inadvertently helping people gain access to housing.

As for why not build homes in all the empty space in the US? Because people don't want to move or life there. That I believe undoubtedly. Imagine living in Gary fucking Indiana lol.",1667260879

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","You have asked us to change your view that the reason you are apolitical is that you don't have knowledge. What we are all saying to you is you don't NEED knowledge to be or feel anything. 

Voting and choice are personal values and preferences. They are emotional decisions that we make as humans. They are not rational nor are they based in knowledge. You yourself are taking a step back and saying I don't know so I can't have an opinion. That is one of many choices you can take. 

NO position is CORRECT. Who is actually correct? What is truth? 
There is data and facts, and those can be used in a multitude of manners. The Devil can cite scripture for his purpose. Does this mean you cannot have a stand? Make moral and ethical choices for yourself? Choose a way of life and have a meaningful purpose to that life?",1667260880

I was never more attached to anything else :D He was in relationship what he said is not working that much and also liked anther girl, but I have must ignored 3D believing he was just into me bc we were talking for 6 hours every day. It took 6 months. I decided to tell him one day that he is great friend and if he is interested I would be interested in relationship bc I coulndnt sleep, eat, lost so much weight, couldnt study at all. I had no choice just to tell him finally. He said he doesnt want to be in relationship right now and day before he decided he is going to break up with the girl he was with. But told me to wait maybe few months bc he likes me and maybe we will end up togehter. Next day he kissed me and we started relationship. Kind of crazy circumstances. He was with a girl for maybe 8 months, very liked another girl he was talking to and meeting, telling everone not to touch her haha, told me he is going to break up with the girl he is with and wants to be alone for few months and next day we are in relationship. How crazy is that? lol. I just believe I must 1. totally ignore 3D 2. persuade myself he likes me no matter what since he is talking to me ever day 3. after telling him i am intersted in him somehow drop the desire/obsession or give trust to universe no matter what will happen I will be ok but believe me I was never more obsessed with anyone in my life and it still came out to 3D sooo easily just a day after I told him i want to be in relationship bc I was obsessed that I was not able to function properly!

Our city is very loyal to our Spurs and our loyalty will also be to Any home NFL team, taking away millions of dollars away from the cowboys which is why we don’t have a team. Jerry is too smart and a very good businessman, he would not allow that to happen.  So the disappointment in revenue from past d league football ball is the excuse that is given to potential investors.  The closest we came to getting a NFL team was after hurricane Katrina when the Saint played in the dome.  All games were sold out.

"Muln","t5_5mtdc4","No idea TBH. I think you'd need someone familiar with battery technology to give you a legitimate answer regarding that.

I'm completely clueless about batteries but I think it could go either way for them in general. On the one hand - assuming the battery technology they claim to have is as good as they make it out to be - then it could be a benefit to them and set them apart from others. Yet on the other hand, due to the deep complexity when it comes to engineering and developing a new battery technology, it could be something that slows them down. Compared to other car companies (and everything related to them) this is not a company that has a long history with what they're aiming to do. They have a fairly small team of people and they don't exactly have very deep pockets that can allow them to pour tons of money into innovation when compared to Tesla or GM.

Time will tell what happens. They could turn out to be a huge success and revolutionize electric vehicles, essentially becoming a unicorn. They could remain small players: producing cars, but not bringing anything drastically new to the market. And they could just turn out to be a complete failure. There's honestly no way to really know and no way to predict.

For investors, the best thing to do is to treat them for what they are: a brand new company that has some ambitious goals in a realm that is very complex. I think people on this sub need to take the posts from people like /u/MyNi_NotYourNi seriously. He speaks a lot of truth and understands the market. He gets way too much hate and downotes for that reason: he can see through the BS and the hopium. There are a lot of posters here that act like they know for sure Mullen is ""going to the moon"", will get everyone invested rich and produce some amazing vehicles. And they very well might do that. But right now that hasn't happened so patience, observation and strategic choices are what matter right now. Until you see Mullen vehicles driving around, nobody here knows what will happen to their investments or desire to own and drive one of these things.",1667260882

I don't think they have any excuse for being so mean-spirited though, if they feel upset about their love-lives that's not on you, maybe they need to look inward. 

Boundaries are hard, especially when you're trying to get better at not people-pleasing and it sounds like they don't really respect that either. I'm happy you're seeing a therapist again soon and I think it's really insightful that you understand that your behaviour or however you try to make them happy will never make them happy. 

As for this guy, I would be wary, maybe take some time. I understand you don't want to end a friendship over a dude, but it also sounds like this friendship has an expiration date regardless of whether this man is present or not. Him being around just exposed it more overtly, unfortunately. 

honestly i am surprised that i am not being more critical of this man as I am first and foremost a critical hater of men, however, only when it's appropriate.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","My kid is a bit younger and has had a bit of anxiety around medical stuff.

What helped was letting him choose some strategies that he felt would help, and giving him the choice to stop halfway through and come back later if he needed to. He had a couple of dental appointments that he got overwhelmed, so we left and came back a week later. Now he doesn't feel the need to leave.

The other things that helped were watching his favourite show on my phone during the procedures, as a distraction, planning a treat to look forward to afterwards (milkshakes ftw). Also practising breathing techniques, and for some things watching an information video beforehand to understand what was happening and why. 

It's so important for the dentist to explain what they're going to do and why, and wait for consent before starting. Being forced to continue with something that feels unsafe can be traumatic and make the next visit harder.

Once my son felt like he was in control of the situation, he had strategies to distract and motivate himself and he knew why it had to happen, he did a great job. The hardest one was a blood draw, but with all the support and plans he managed beautifully and was incredibly proud of himself. We so tall about how ""the only time you can feel brave is when you're scared"" and a lot of focus on ""you can choose to do hard things"".

"BBallShoes","t5_1e5qkd","Not at all. Much better than people say. I've noticed regular ppl/other reviwers think its a solid shoe/like it but specifically youtube reviewers trash the shoe. Reviews arent always right and this is a shoe that's super popular to hate.  A youtuber isn't going to say these are a solid shoe and risk people saying they don't know what their talking about. Especially if the big boys (like weartesters) say the shoe is bad. Does it have issues? Yes! Traction isn't the best. Boost isn't as good as other Boost. Its stiff but after its broken in, it's a solid shoe also unnecessary parts of the shoe that make it heavy. But after wearing them for about 4 days, the upper bends so easily when I walk or run.  When I first tried them, they were super stiff but after a few days they become way more comfortable and easier to move.  Nba players are still wearing this shoe. For example; Jalen Green, who has hooped in multiple pairs for multiple games. Why would he continue to wear an old 'trash shoe'? Makes no sense esoecially since theyve been out for a while and arent even the current Hardens anymore (the 6 is and soon to be 7).. So try them out if you can, youtube reviewers aren't always right. Plus they look absolutely 🔥🔥🔥. I have the purple tint (it's stunning!) and red polka dot and I f****** love them! They look so dope when wearing them with joggers! Also RunRepeat is my go to for shoe reviews...I love them but they gave the 5 a score of 76 which is decent. Hoop geek a 6.9/10, Amazon 4-4.5/5 stars, Google reviews 4/5, Adidas website 4/5, Dicks 4/5, etc. I'm sure there are other places that give it poor scores but really if you remove yourube reviews, the shoe has solid  performance scores. 

PS: reason I keep mentioning YouTube reviewers is everyone I know or spoken to who's into hoop shoes watches weartesters, solebrothers, etc and specificzlly youtube reviews are super popular in the hoop shoe community so I'm just assuming you watch them too. Yes I know assuming things isn't good lol.",1667260884
"TikTokCringe","t5_mvcq5","Well yes and no. It does effect you, because now when you talk about them there is less information given to those you are speaking too. The point of he and she isn't to bennifit the person of interest, but to bennifit the people speaking about the person of interest. By saying she you infer a women with all the traits naturally given to a woman while when you say he it is all the traits naturally given to a man. By removing this information the people being told info in the conversation may mis-interpret or conjecture information that would alter their view on the topic at hand. 

I don't care what you identify as, but if I need to talk to another person I will use vocabulary that gets the needed information across. If sex has 0 role, then fuck it they/them, but if it does have a role I am ignoring your request. I don't see that as wrong, people call each other way worse daily and they are fine with it, so ""mis-gendering"" this is a sex thing not a gender thing anyways, to me is not a big deal in the slightest. 

If my boss says who is working at lower end of doc and I don't know the name right away (often) it is the ""girl with"" or ""The guy with"" so my boss can get the information needed to make an informed decision.",1667260884

My other favorite teaching on this is from Lama Tharchin. When we join the lineage it's like picking up two high tension lines. One leads upwards to the enlightened beings. The other leads downwards to all sentient beings. We complete the circuit, the bodhicitta flows through us, and that lights us up. Without being grounded to sentient beings the current can't flow through us.

I was thinking about this at the corner store the other day. Walking up to the counter I was hoping the guy was having a nice day. Relative bodhicitta. But when I was up there I was inspired to do a ""quick glance"", to let go of thoughts and relax into vast awareness. A space opened up where, for a brief instant, I could just be in the present moment with the clerk. His eyes sparkled. Absolute bodhicitta.",1667260885

Me and my guildies have tested this multiple times and zahhak with 100 crit rate, crit all the time against senya or choux even with anti-crit buff.

"Quebec","t5_2qhh9","À 19 ans c'est pas mal difficile de choisir une carrière pour les 35 années à venir. À ta place, voici ce que je ferais :

- Sans flusher ton ex des réseaux sociaux, tu peux masquer les publications. Tu as probablement besoin de te recentrer sur toi-même. Quand les souvenirs avec elle te feront sourire, tu pourras les démasquer. 

- Fais ce que tu veux. Travailler à l'hôpital te rend heureux? Alors voilà t'as ta job. Tu te vois pas faire ça toute ta vie? Ya pas d'âge pour l'université. Continue alors au point suivant.

- Occupe toi. Si t'as des amis qui sont ailleurs, bin mon gars ya pas 36 solutions. Commence à planifier ton voyage. T'as besoin d'objectifs réalisables pour te changer les idées. Si entre temps tu trouves quelqu'un pour embarquer tant mieux mais ose te lancer même si t'es en solo!

- Le soir, soit content de ta journée. Le matin, pense à ce qui t'attends, fais des plans. 

Le temps arrenge les choses, c'est vrai. Tout ce que j'ai eu à vivre, malgré que des fois c'était dur, font parti du passé. C'est clair que ça façonne comment tu es aujourd'hui, mais une relation n'est jamais un échec. Tu va finir par rencontrer une autre fille qui va autant te faire tripper.

But I understand that not all users of those platforms are scammers.  Declaring all users of a particular platform to be scammers is just stupid and lazy.

Literally everything is being replaced except the tweeters.

To answer your second question it really depends on the head unit and your standards. In general, you'll always get more power and cleaner audio with a separate amp, but whether it is worth it to you will depend in part on how good the amp is in the aftermarket head unit. Many will do a good enough job. It comes down to your preference. For my system, I'm using an amp for the sub but the rest of the system will be powered by my new head unit.",1667260887

I SBRed mine just because the stock is cool, but after spending some time with it at the range just pushing out against a sling, I can totally see how this was the preferred setup for the MP5k.   


You can run it two point, using both sling points, or single point using just the rear.

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","Considering the prices of pre-tied flies at my local fly shop I definitely have come out ahead by buying just the most basic materials (hooks, thread, wire, beads) from them instead. I source maybe 90% of the rest of my materials from hunting or from friends who hunt or have farms. So I pretty much have a lifetime supply of deer hair, elk hair, squirrel tails, grouse feathers, pheasant feathers, waterfowl feathers, and chicken/rooster capes and saddles. I can tie most of my go-to flies with those materials which are essentially free to me. I even use dog hair for some flies. 

I also keep an eye on local or online auctions. At one auction I scored two big plastic totes full of cigar boxes filled with dozens of different types of fly tying materials and fly tying tools - I’m talking hundreds of dollars worth for like $30. 

So there are definitely ways to do it on the cheap. It just depends on things like the type of fly patterns you’re interested in tying and how much you value your own time. I try to stick with natural materials because I have them readily available and they work for my needs. If I want some really good dry fly hackle I’ll ask for it for x-mas/birthday gifts - yes, I’m that cheap/thrifty. A good vise will probably be the most expensive part of the initial investment.",1667260889

If you see a guy with armour and get scared and think “he needs to be stopped immediately”,do you also see teenagers in trench coats and get on alert and try to “stop them immediately”? 

Because after all the two Columbine shooters wore trench coats and they actually shot at police many times throughout their rampage.

I've heard of second owners getting it done. The key is to go through FCA and get the star claim started, then you take it to the dealership for visual inspection so they can say (yep, that happened... to FCA) and then FCA sends the parts to the dealer to have them install it.

The Republican movement here in Australia (as in, those who believe we should split from the monarchy and become a Republic) is currently undergoing consultation for how an Australian head of state would be elected and dear God I hope we don’t end up with some electoral ~~collage-y~~ college-y nonsense.

"DetroitPistons","t5_2sgpl","I don't think that's true in any capacity. 

He's a fairly strong defender in simple one-on-one situations but gets torched in the pick-and-roll by the average guard who's quicker than him, and he isn't a particularly good team defender. 

He can't find the open man effectively, and that's because there rarely *is* an open man when he's handling the ball. He struggles to gain separation, and defenses have no respect for his ability to attack the basket. Nobody comes to help, so rarely is there an open man for him to target. This severely reduces the value of his offensive IQ and his ability as a passer. 

He's also such a terrible scorer as to render himself a dreadful liability to the offense as a whole when he's on the floor. He's impotent from both on and off the ball ([this](https://i.gyazo.com/58f6d83beb655172dff67c5aa6f3b7f4.png) is what happens when he's off the ball). 

His defense comes nowhere near to compensating for the cost of fielding him on offense. Even defensive specialists the likes of, say, Thybulle are often of questionable overall value because of their cost on offense. Thybulle is one of the best defenders in the league---much better than Killian---and he's a better scorer than Killian, but his bad perimeter shooting makes him an offensive liability in a game that does not tolerate offensive liabilities. The same is true of Simmons, who is arguably the best perimeter defender in the league. He is a much better scorer and defender than Killian, and he, too, nonetheless has his value severely eroded by his shortcomings on offense. 

All told, Killian was one of the worst players in the league last season and he's continued that thus far in the current season.",1667260890

"n64","t5_2s34r","This might be redundant information since you implied you're a retro gaming enthusiast and you're on this sub and this isn't new info, but I'm mentioning it still just in case: The N64 is probably the hardest original console hardware to make look ""right"" on modern TVs. I'm not nit-picking here, it's far from the intended vision of the developer and can severely distort you or your GFs impression of the games.  And since your GF is not *yet* into retro gaming, she might not have the tolerance to bear 20 fps games and unfiltered, scanline-lacking, composite-blur-ridden 240p early 3D games blown up on 4K television (.. I love the N64, I swear 🙈). Just saying it because the experience and her enjoyment *will* vary immensely depending on how much you wanna spend. 

If you have a CRT at home, then forgot all I just said and just buy a cheap original console! This will be the best experience and imho even beats emulation (but that last point might be subjective). And if you want to experience the whole excellent (and manageable) N64 library, get an Everdrive!

If you only have a modern display but insist on playing on OG hardware, at least  look into something like a *retrotink* to have the way better experience. And if you're into modding, look into RGB modded consoles, or if you have the money (and if you're lucky) maybe get the *N64digital* or *ultra hdmi* mods.

If it's just those two games that you and your GF are looking into playing and if you have access to a Switch, there's nothing wrong with playing those games on the N64 Online app. It's 30 fps, a clean image and an uncomplicated/inexpensive process. In my opinion, it's a way better experience than playing OG hardware on modern TVs without mods/image processing, period. Sure, it's emulation, it's not the original experience, but in the special case of the N64 it's better than the ""OG hardware + modern TV"" experience. 

But, again, can't stress this enough: if you have a CRT, don't worry about anything I just said and have fun!",1667260890

The problem with eliminating br is that it basically removed the whole game content, as all of the new features we are supposed to get can only be accessed with battle royale(dragon claw, battle pass, even fruits), so it's like what's the point of releasing an update we can't play.

And then I always end on an easier trail.  And I definitely think about my energy level. The more tire I get the more error prone I get.

-They are both heavily connected to fate, Mario was fated for greatness as one of the seven Star Children and Diavolo was obsessed with controlling fate with the Requiem Arrow. The predictions of his Sub-Stand Epitaph are also fated to pass, King Crimson being the only thing that can change them.

-They're known for their OP powers (Diavolo's Time Skip and Mario's Power-Ups)

-The sidekick of one of their enemies, Fawful the assistant of Cackletta and Polnareff the Jobro of Jotaro, would come back from what seemed like certain doom falling from a great height, and became an even more dangerous opponent with a new power they tried to stop them from obtaining, the Dark Star and Silver Chariot Requiem. This power threatened the entire world, the Dark Star (as Dark Bowser) wanting to cover the world in darkness and Silver Chariot Requiem fusing the Earth with a different dimension.

-They both have a twin who can also use these OP powers. Luigi is Mario’s twin brother and uses his Power-Ups, Doppio is Diavolo's twin soul and has access to Epitaph and King Crimson's arms.

-This twin is their greatest ally, Luigi having aided Mario on many adventures and Doppio being Diavolo's other identity and keeping his hidden and relaying information to him through their link. It was only with their help they defeated Fawful and Polnareff, Luigi aiding Mario in the battle and Doppio allowing Diavolo to get in undetected.

-Mario is famous throughout his world while Diavolo tries to hide his identity at all costs.

-They are at the top of society, Mario dating the Princess and attending many high level events (and being at the meeting discussing the Blorbs epidemic) and Diavolo leading Passioné, which controls entire towns at every level.

-If you buy the ""Mario was Rosalina's father"" theory then they're both terrible parents, Mario basically being criminally negligent to Rosalina and never bothered searching for her and Diavolo trying to murder Trish

The name of the track would be ""Crimson Cap"" and the art would be Mario’s hat with Epitaph in place of its M emblem and the Time Skip effect in the background, causing the ""Crimson"" part of the title to distort.",1667260895

Also research is usually funded by organizations that have certain agenda.

Women are more receptive to ads and ate emotional spenders. So yeah I do believe single women are happier than single men and no research isn't a fact.

Funny part about this is that you think I care about upvotes or any opinions, I just write what I think and usually try to help people in my way. I comment because it's entertaining to see people react this way. Did I just rap?

Why are you even replying to me if women are happier being single?

Just convince op that she should never get in relationship, you don't need to convince me, I don't care, be happy, sad, it doesn't matter.

Imagine you convinced her of her stupid want to have relationship, she would be way happier alone all her life! Look at the research queen, you don't need no man, it will make you happier being alone! 

Dude you can actually save her from herself! 

Go ahead help her cope with inability to get relationship now, by telling her she will be happier without it.

In my opinion, debates should be cut and dry, 3 minutes followed by 3 minutes as an example. I almost can’t watch his debates because it’s almost all interruption and him dunking on his opponent.

With that said, I hear a lot of people say that what he is saying is facts. But they don’t agree with him. I guess I find it difficult to understand how someone hears his Facts, and still not agree with him. Because that would mean they are against the facts and therefore are wrong…",1667260896

"Thriller","t5_2r14h","Marnie is a 1964 American psychological thriller film directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The screenplay by Jay Presson Allen was based on the 1961 novel of the same name by writer Winston Graham. The film stars Tippi Hedren and Sean Connery.  
  
The music was composed by Bernard Herrmann, his last of seven critically acclaimed film scores for Hitchcock. Marnie also marked the end of Hitchcock's collaborations with cinematographer Robert Burks (his 12th film for Hitchcock) and editor George Tomasini (who died later in the year).

The main issue here is that OP would need to spend a substantial amount of money to hire someone to really truly make a nice parametric script to generate things like this at the size(s) desired. Its a TON of work. 100% possible, and likely how the linked source material was designed. but that was probably someone getting paid hourly from a design firm, or even a intern desperate to make it over the designer threshold.

I've done a bit of Gh script work for an artist before, and ill tell ya, it wasn't cheap and those were static objects, not requiring conformal joints to drape, and were basically essentially highly ordered ngons, not this organic flowing stuff. takes a lot more to make things like this look good at every viewing angle.

Not to mention the poor sap that has to print and clean and track and assemble alllll those tiny parts. probably need a part ID system in that Gh script to I guess... add more $.",1667260897

"Comcast","t5_2rnei","Hi Tech from Miami. 

So if you’re having packet loss issues one thing can be a determining factor is called noise. Now think of noise as interference. Say for example if you’re asleep around 3:30 in the morning and your spouse comes in an screeches to the top of his/her lungs. Obviously you will wake up distorted and confused and wonder what the heck is that coming from. The same thing is what noise does. Now you’re probably wondering what does that correlate with your problem? 

As an Xfinity customer each account is connected to what we call a node. A node is basically a powerhouse that allows you to have service. Your node is what gives you basically everything. From a stable connection. To high download speeds and incoming traffic for packets. If your node has what we called an “elevated noise floor” that can cause issues to your service. That can be what we called “node impacting”. Meaning it will not only affect you as a subscriber but everyone who is connected on that node. Now each equipment connects to what we call carriers. Each carrier has to be within a certain spec of “noise” and signal so everything can function properly. If your carriers are having an elevated noise floor and all the carriers are affected by the noise then that’s what is causing your issue. The tech that will service your call is suppose to check the node on their work phones and verify that it’s not a maintenance related issue. If it’s a maintenance problem then they will need to create a “refer to maintenance” ticket and it will be thrown into the pool for a maintenance technician to pick up the job. Keep in mind those tickets generally take between 48-72 hours to get resolved. 

Hope this helps OP. Good luck and if you have anymore questions I’m more than welcome to help.",1667260897

I believe that grades are weighted differently at different universities at Hons entry, so you might end up with a weighted GPA of 5 elsewhere, but at what universities is a Credit average sufficient to get into Honours?

2. He was just playing games on his phone. If this is the case, you two may just be a bad match. Because again, why bring you there and then proceed to ignore you while playing games the whole time without explaining himself?

"FloridaGators","t5_2qv2r","Thank you and makes my point. You probably gradually moved up to that and didn't go feet instant wet. I grew up on imports before the fnf days. The first time I drove a a charged v8 pushing 500 red, I almost killed myself because I wasn't ready for that difference.

 I was looking to buy a 392 scat after deployment (before I factored insurance and cost of premium) and that's was nuts. They happened to have a hell cat and the guy let me drive it.. White knuckles are legit a thing in traffic

Your wife is NC with her family because of a significant violation.
Your mother didn't care they were no contact and put your family at risk.
You sided with your mother because she didn't know why they were no contact, even though any reasonable adult should assume that someone wouldn't go no contact without a big enough reason to. This means your wife has now been violated by her family of origin, her in-laws, and her husband.
You further violated your wife's trust after this massive betrayal of her safety and comfort by telling your mother the reason she is no contact with her parents, which you knew she didn't want to share with her mother, and she is probably currently even less inclined to share things with your mother because of the previous violation.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","“*You piece of shit*!” Cold howled in blind fury, wheeling around as Zelgius tried launching at him for another attack. Faster on the draw, the alien surged towards his armored foe, decking him across the face with a wild punch and launching him off his feet. Quickly, Cold grabbed onto the flying knight’s leg, before slamming him down and cratering him into the ground. Zelgius was beset by a barrage of punches from Cold, burying him further and further into the concrete terrain as the alien king had lost practically all reasoning by this point.

“That could’ve gone better,” Marco just said as he watched the beatdown commence.

“At least you did something,” Merlin consolidated, bringing his staff forward again as he focused on the raging Cold. With the alien distracted, the wizard incubus let loose with another beam of energy from his staff’s tip, surging across the destroyed terrain as the rest of the group paused in the middle of running to Zelgius’ aid. So blinded by his anger, Cold didn’t notice in time before getting a rather painful reminder of the fact that Merlin was still a present threat as the beam plowed fullforce into his back. Howling aloud as he was launched off his feet, King Cold was sent flying into a distant building, crashing through the concrete walls and leaving a huge hole in his wake.

His head spinning as blood flowed down his face, Zelgius rolled over onto his chest and proceeded to prop himself up to his hands and knees. Undyne and Hector were by his side, helping the knight up before Max came running by. The trio looked over towards the rabbity creature…

…Just in time to see him scarfing down Cold’s severed tail as though he’d hadn’t eaten in weeks.

“Wha-what the hell are you doing?!” Undyne exclaimed in shock, Zelgius looking rather pale and feeling as though he might faint.

“...Can I have a bite?” Hector nonchalantly asked, though his question fell on deaf ears as Max devoured nearly the whole portion of the detached limb.

“Max, I already told you not to eat the crime evidence,” Sam spoke as he approached his little buddy. “We’re still not done subduing this guy.”

“It was calling to me, Sam!” Max retorted, his mouth coated in purple blood. “I just had to try it! It’s like nothing I’ve ever tasted!”

“In that case, I better make a note to do space travel more often.”

Undyne and Zelgius just looked at each other in bewilderment.

An eruption of fire and debris flew outwards from the desecrated building as King Cold burst through its walls, surging back into the fray as he stretched out his arm. “I am two hundred and ten percent done!” 

With a bloodlusted roar, the alien king fired a purple energy beam from his palm, aiming towards the gathered protagonists as he was hellbent on ending them. Everyone each braced themselves for impact: Merlin raised up his spear again, Sam, Marco, and Big Boss all had their guns out, Undyne held his spear ready for a throw, Omori hid begin Hector who stood tall with his brother’s spirit by his side.

But Max?

Max was already acting.

Another purple beam came flying forth, colliding with Cold’s own discharged attack to create an explosion that surged through the air, forcing the alien to bring himself to a halt. “What?!”

“Check it out, Sam, I’m an alien too!” Max declared this loudly, and with no small degree of excitement, as he now stood surrounded by a violet aura of power. Armor covered his body, a long lizard like tail lashing about eagerly behind him, with a set of horns sprouted from his head. Everyone stared at Max’s new transformation mostly in shock, Sam, Merlin, and Hector moreso proud of the lagomorph’s achievement. King Cold, meanwhile, was especially flabbergasted as he stared at Max.

“You…you look just like…” For just a moment, King Cold saw his own son Frieza standing in Max’s spot.

“Well done, Max,” Sam congratulated. “You’ve successfully become the ultimate lifeform. What are you going to do now?”

“First thing’s first…” Max grinned eagerly as he faced down Cold. “Take care of our assignment.”

Before anyone could say anything, Max launched from the ground, rocketing through the air as Cold braced himself for impact. Though the alien raised up his arms in defense, Max landed a hard kick to his gut, launching him backwards through the air. Zooming after his airborne opponent, the alien/rabbit hybrid brought his fist slamming into Cold’s cranium and sending him crashing through the top half of a nearby building. Concrete and metal rained down to the streets below as Cold crashed into the street, tearing it asunder and digging a deep trench in his wake.

Launching back into the air, Cold met Max in a clash as their punches collided with one another with such force as to create a shockwave that shook buildings and shattered glass windows. Bellowing in hatred, Cold swung his leg around to kick Max in the head, giving him a taste of his own medicine as he was sent careening into a building, caving the structure inwards and sending it crashing down into a pile of concrete debris. Cold wasted no time as he fired an energy beam from his hand, striking the rubble to create a massive explosion. Even then, Max flew back out from the flames as he plowed into Cold’s abdomen, smashing the alien through a series of buildings one after the other as they traded blows with one another.

“Shouldn’t we help?” Marco asked Merlin as they and the rest of the group watched the brawl going on.

“Nah,” Merlin replied. “Max’s got it under control.”

“No, I mean, should we help King Cold? Even he doesn’t deserve this.”

“Word of advice,” Sam said to Marco. “It’s best to be on Max’s good side if you’re not me.”

“Definitely banging…” Hector quietly commented as he eyed Sam suspiciously.

Another clash of fists created another shockwave as Max and King Cold kept up their battle. Springing forward, the rabbity creature clamped his jaws shut around the alien’s arm, bringing out a pained cry from him as Max pulled his head away, tearing away a chunk of purple flesh. Enraged, Cold fired away with a succession of Death Beams, Max bringing up his arms to defend himself as the lasers lanced against his armor, creating a succession of explosions. Seeing the ineffectiveness of his assault, Cold tried launching a larger beam from his palm, only for Max to dive downwards, letting the beam instead blast through a building and blow up the top portion of it.

Flying up before Cold could react, Max kicked him hard in the gut again, sending him flying back and striking the top of a building hard enough to tear it apart in an explosion of rubble and dust. King Cold had nary any time to recover, before Max slammed into him, sending both fighters crashing through every floor of the tall building, tearing it apart from the inside and bringing it crashing down as a wave of dust blew everywhere.

From within the newly formed pile of rubble, a purple glow emanated from within, right before an explosion blasted it asunder from inside as King Cold was sent flying away. A purple beam of power was tearing into his chest, blasting away his armor as he crashed into yet another building, causing yet another explosion as the skyscraper-like structure crashed down upon the streets. This beam was courtesy of Max, the vampiric hybrid having fired said attack from his toothy jaws, never losing his grin throughout the battle.

Pushing himself up to his hands and knees, King Cold panted heavily, struggling to rise as his body was wracked with pain. Blood flowed from his wounds, further weakening the alien throughout the battle and draining him of his strength. Max, meanwhile, was in better condition; though Cold got his licks in, it was clear that Max was better off in comparison to the ruler. This fight’s outcome had already been decided the moment it began. The question was, did King Cold know this?

“Y’know, this doesn’t *have* to end in death,” Max stated way too casually for a situation like this as he landed down before Cold and began approaching him. “You could always surrender and go into hiding, start a new life with a stolen identity. Wouldn’t be nearly as humiliating, and you’d still be, well, alive.”

“N-never…” Despite his wounds, Cold managed to force himself to his feet, drawing out the remainder of his power as a purple aura engulfed him. “I’ll never give up to the likes of you! Stealing my power for your own, insulting my people with your newfound form! You and your friends will all die by my hands, no matter what it takes!”

“Well, so much for trying this peacefully,” Max commented with a shrug.

Howling as the raw power flowing from him formed a crater in the street he stood upon, Cold launched himself at Max, his fists raised above him as he aimed to deliver an overhead strike. But the smaller rabbity creature made no effort to try and dodge or escape such an incoming attack. 

No, his grin unwavering, Max merely put up his dukes and braced himself. 

Swinging downwards, King Cold slammed his fists upon Max’s raised forelimbs, the kinetic force wrought with the impact creating a powerful shockwave that stretched out for several hundred meters. A massive crater roughly the size of the former arena was formed almost immediately within the street they stood on, a few buildings toppling over as they fell within the crater. Even further away from the immediate area, buildings quivered and shook as though in terror, with even a few smaller structures collapsing on the spot.

But Max remained standing, even as King Cold strained to overpower his smaller opponent. Even as the alien ruler applied as much strength into his own two hands, the lagomorph began to push back, moving forward with a step. His eyes widening in shock, Cold felt himself being slowly but surely pushed backwards by Max, unable to hold his ground as the small mammal/alien hybrid vampire continued walking forward and gaining ground.",1667260899
"flatfeet","t5_38u2r","To be clear this study does not make that implication. The conclusion is literally this. 

The results question the relevance of the Root assessments in the prescription of foot orthoses.

They’re saying you shouldn’t diagnose based on that static model. They’re not saying, “a deformity is not the reason you have pain.”

Edit

Not to say this study isn’t important. It is actually kind of upsetting that PT and Podiatrists use this model to assess your disfunction and subsequent progress.

Edit 2

I figured out a much easier way to describe this conclusion. If you don’t have a problem, but this model says you have a problem, then you still don’t have a problem, which frankly is trivial.",1667260899

If she blows you off, or reacts badly, then you do have your answer. And I'm only suggesting a letter because of how you said how much family means to you. But, if you have a pretty clear idea already and don't want to write a letter like that, just reach out one last time explaining that you've tried your best to mend the relationship, but you're not willing to put up with her outbursts anymore and that you'll still be pleasant (for the sake of your mother), but she shouldn't expect to rely on you anymore.

"schizophrenia","t5_2r828","Yeah I suffer from religious psychosis and have schizo affective disorder. So I hear where you're coming from on this. Most of the time lately though, I can differentiate between real spiritual wisdom and my own illness telling me demons are this or angels are that type of beliefs. Basically anytime my mind starts wandering and thinking ""hmm maybe..what if this person or that celebrity is actually not human but is an angel working for God ...or what if they are Satan on earth already!"".....basically I used to fall prey to these belief (odd as they may seem) all the time. I once was convinced that Billie eilish (who I love also) was working for Satan....Yeah, I know, sounds Uber crazy but that is just what schizoid illnesses do to a person. It makes the bizarre stuff seem rational and even likely.  Anyway, so nowadays, whenever my mind goes in the direction of starting a tbought/sentence with anything along the lines of ""well maybe they are an angel &amp;/or demon in disguise ..."" Or anything involving demons and angels in human form on earth, — I straight away can know it's just a delusion from my illness and it's just my sickness talking and that helps a lot. Because since I can recognize the fact that it's not a true fact right away based on such context, then I can simply dismiss the idea and even sometimes can find humor in the fact that my mind plays tricks on me and goes there from time to time,  despite me being an otherwise very grounded in reality type of person.

It seems like it would get challenging to differentiate between your faith (as I am a Bible believing Christian and DO believe in God and not as a delusion), — &amp; the sickness or the religious type things the sickness tells me. However, it actually for me anyway, is usually clear, at least after a good while of considering it. Maybe at first it's hard to distinguish that line separating my true valid beliefs/ spirituality from something created out of my schizo affective brain's psychosis, but through praying about it and really just using critical thinking and common sense and life experience, 9/10 I can tell the difference so there really isn't any overlap.. 

Well, other than assuming God is angrier at me than He really is. That one is hard to shake. Or feelings of guilt and stuff like that. But I don't classify those as delusions in the same sense that the whole angel/demon situation is. 

Hope that addition provides some  interesting insight!

Glad this thread exhists! 

Peace!!

Appealed on what grounds? you admit that you were doing it, and that it's illegal. Ignorance isn't a defence. 

There is a program in some states where you can apply to have a fine revoked, but it's usually only if you haven't had any other fines in the proceeding few years... and it's only for things like minor speeding, it doesn't cover suspensions

You're going to have to wait it out, and be more careful in future.",1667260904

Some climbs around here are significantly less work on a competent climbing 16kg enduro bike than they are on my rigid XC bike.

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","The space that I can devote to pedals has decreased quite significantly recently and I've switched to using a Pedaltrain Nano in conjunction with two Nano+ boards. The Nano (visible in the second picture) is permanently connected to my amp and usually hosts a Fredric Super Unpleasant Companion, Boss RV-500 and something else (a Moog MF Chorus at the moment). I have a Cioks 7 under the Nano which can power auxiliary Cioks supplies under the other two boards.

I like to change the two Nano+ boards quite regularly and thought I'd try to make a Halloween board. I partly chose these pedals for their aesthetic value, of course, but they're all good in their own right and I tried to assemble a combination that would be good for drone, doom, goth, etc! Chain below:

Fredric Super Unpleasant Companion: This contains the Shin-ei FY-2 and FY-6 circuits, both of which are pretty brutal octave fuzzes. I think it sounds best first in the chain, like a lot of fuzz pedals.

Boss RV-500: Very versatile and powerful, I'm often happy to use this for reverb and delay.

Moog MF Chorus: This is also pretty versatile and can cover flange, chorus and vibrato. I've tried to set it to emulate John McGeoch recently.

Fredric Unpleasant Companion: This is another FY-2 clone and would be superfluous unless I wanted to switch from FY-2 and FY-6 easily. It actually sounds pretty different to the Super Unpleasant Companion's FY-2 setting, presumably because it's later in the chain. Good for Halloween!

Caline Ghost Rain: This is a delay rather than a delay/reverb but is still good value at about £40 new. It's apparently based on a PT2399 chip and is very lo-fi.

Boss HM-2: Most people here will be familiar with this legendary distortion pedal! I have it set to the custom setting and rarely use my old MIT version now.

Zvex Sonar: I would use this pedal more if it had presets. It can produce a wide range of tremolo effects using it's hidden controls but I don't find it very intuitive. The Machine distortion circuit it contains is a good bonus effect too.

Nobels ODR Mini: I included this because of it's ghoulish slime green colour but it's also one of my favourite overdrive pedals. This mini version is very good value too at about £80.

Caline Enchanted Tone: This is another overdrive but sounds very different to the ODR and had to be included due to its colour and graphic design! It's apparently a Dumble style OD and costs about £35. Definitely worth having around.",1667260905

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","This is the comment I was looking for. 

This is not just about the current incident. Its about *years* of disrepect by OPs mom. Disrespect that it sounds like he's been pushing her to ignore the entire time. The current incident sounds to just be the straw that broke the camel's back.

I find it interesting that OP knows about his wife's family history, but was still bothered by the fact that she did nor want his mom babysitting. It's pretty easy to read between the lines, put 2 &amp; 2 together and realize that trauma from her past likely plays into why she didn't want grandma left alone with her son. And thats without knowing any details.

It also looks like OP just does not get that his mom did not need to know the gory details. She just needed to know that her DIL was NC with her own family, to the extent of not inviting to the wedding or telling about the baby.

That alone should have been enough to tell her to stay out if it. If that wasn't enough, what would have been (other than what his wife didn't want revealed)? Mr. Samuel L. Jackson coming to her door and telling her ""Leave it the %/=$#@ alone!""?

Yeah, OP is TA.",1667260906

Casino Royale isn't some complex arthouse film but man it is miles ahead of GoldenEye. A more realistic villain, less cliched plot and an actual exploration of human relationships and emotions, wow it's a low bar but still. I watched other films as well, rewatched The Matrix, it's a pretty good film, high concept but it can be quite silly and the acting can be quite wooden.

Now I have many years with Unity behind, but I have found Jason's Youtube channel to be decent, so I decided to go through the course just to see what it was like. Since it was so expensive I was curious about the course.

I will say that it is ok. For the $30 I paid for it. If I had paid $1000 for it I would expect so much more. It covers the basics of game development in Unity and introduces some of the systems a beginner might not know about.

The coding is a level above many other beginner tutorials, but for a $1000 I would expect even more. He is really just winging it during his videos relying on his experience. I would expect the videos and code to be more structured. The code works for those small prototype projects made during the course, but the scalability of those projects into fully fledged commercial games it questionable at best.

There are free resources that will teach what is covered in this course so don't bother buying it for the full price. If you can get it for $10 - $30 then sure. It's ok and depending on your skill level you can learn something about game development in Unity.",1667260906

"druggardening","t5_2uggx","Powdery mildew will actually affect the entire plant. You can suppress it but you won’t actually get fully rid of it. Here’s some tips for powdery mildew in the cannabis industry:

Remove the worst of the infected leaves, usually at the bottom. This minimizes the amount of spores and also helps the other leaves get more air flow and light. All mildews/molds grow best in dark, damp conditions. A fan will help this, too. 
Be diligent with fighting during the beginning to minimize spores. Once cannabis is 2-3 weeks into bloom you can’t use as many pesticides because you might get it on the buds and then they’ll taste yucky. The facility I worked in used regalia (a systemic product used to increase the plant’s resistance to pm), Vegol crop oil (basically you’d mix it to be 1L water with like 18 mL canola oil + 2 mL soap) and zerotol (peroxide + an acid) which is the only one recommended for use pretty much until harvest. I’ve also heard of people using alkaline water (water with baking soda) and other remedies. 

Honestly for what you have I would say pick the worst leaves off. Then get some Vegol and use it every day or two days. You can see it wipe away the pm when you’re spraying. Depending how big your crop is you might want to spray it all over or spot spray daily instead of removing infected leaves. If you do use Vegol (or any pesticide) use it lightly the first time. If you see shiny spots/build up  it’s easier to sunburn the leaves. If this is happening every time you spray then dilute it more or spray then wipe away. It will get the pm off and won’t spread the spores (unlike if you were to wipe it away with a dry hand)",1667260908

If it's like 'we'll pay you a chunk of cash, and in return you do x, and y, oh and don't let MS give it away for free to their users' then I can kinda see why they might do a deal like that.

I have no idea what this 'MS putting down gauntlet, Sony have to step up' stuff is all about. They're both just companies trying to maximise their profits, however good their PR speak might be. They're not your friend or champion.",1667260909

"microbiology","t5_2qirk","Well there are only 9 variable regions in the 16S and certain regions vary more in certain taxa than others. This is why you may use different regions depending on what you are sampling as you would know microbes of interests thus would select for them (if that makes sense). Theoretically fewer variable regions would imply you are sequencing less of the 16S so more variable regions in sequencing (or the whole 16S gene) is best in identifying bacteria and is more specific.  HOWEVER it should be noted many bacteria have multiple 16S gene loci that may have sequence variation so to truly differentiate you should sequence all loci (Somehow) or do a full genome sequence of an isolate.",1667260909

Ideally with a continuing appointment so you can eventually just trust them to exercise academic freedom appropriately...

For adjuncts, yeah, idk, that's tough. Drop only the ones with clear-cut rock bottom numbers? Bias isn't going to make a 5/5 teacher get 1/5s from the whole class. Don't punish people for a single off class or semester. Get rid of the ones with valid student complaints or multiple damning qualitative comments (valid as in ""he said I shouldn't major in math because girls are bad at math,"" not ""he gave me a B+ instead of an A- so my mom is going to call the university president!"").

"OLED","t5_2r8y3","Probably more of one. LCDs are backlit and image retention is unlikely due to the nature of liquid crystals, but each OLED pixel is, essentially made of three different colored lights, and they can only glow for so long. As I understand it blue also fades faster, because it is a higher energy wavelength.

What's worse, the story treats quirks as pre-requisites to being at all competent in combat, no matter how irrelevant or straight-up worthless it might be.

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.  This post we didn't see your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification

Noh's defense is already crazy high (he himself says that just a little more and nobody will be able to beat him) but he needs even more experience and speed. Only one of his attacks was not parried/dodged, it was when Go got surprised by his hardness and Noh broke his wrist. (Not counting the attacks after the qi-stealing failed)

Idk if he has a shot against 2 finger-demon for example, his attacks are not that great, and they are simple. He can surely tank his divine snap with his body, but he will hardly harm him IMO. (idk if 2FD is fully healed tho, maybe he is not)",1667260910

"memes","t5_2qjpg","The problem is the definition of ""race"" has a very shaky foundation. For example, in the US and Canada, people from Latin America are considered ""latinos"", as a single race (even the term refers to the language roots, not the people itself). Which is very weird considering that different regions have been colonized by different people, by different migration fluxes, some have interbred with natives, some have not.

So what is a race? Is it a skin tone? Is it a set of physical attributes? If this is the case, which ones? A white middle eastern, for example, has the same race of a white swede? Are Slavs and Spanish the same race? Africa is a bigger than 3 Europes, with very diverse regions and populations... Are every African of the same race?

Therefore, I'd not consider wrong someone equating Islamophobia with Racism, since culture can be also a factor when you distinguish ""races"", ""ethnicities"" or whatever.",1667260911

And since we know Lumumba wasn't there and the account is not true, it's unlikely Amanda was having some emotional response to recounting events. What's much more likely is she is reacting to the pressure being applied to her by a bunch of investigators, speaking in Italian, pressing her to remember, to stop lying, and to tell them ""that which they already knew to be true"".

BTW, you are correct about one thing... I do read biased sources, both for the pro-guilt and the pro-innocent perspectives. And then, to form my own opinion and confirm things I went back and read the actual source material. I did this for all key aspects of the case. Can you say the same?

"TheWalkingDeadGame","t5_2tzww","Conrad taking Gabe as a hostage, who is totally innocent to what they are talking about and you have to betray Clem to let Conrad live. The situation is so bonkers, because there is Clem that we wouldn't betray easily and Conrad keeping a kid hostage, so many people will shoot Conrad, including me. Then they give you the big middle finger as they make Conrad the most survivable side character ever and give him awesome lines like you ""you are not a man, you are nothing"" if you don't shoot him. That sucked ass.

Gabe telling about Conrad to everybody. You can't even tell Gabe off properly and after that Javi just accepts what happened and isn't that angry the moment its over. I would have liked to have some options to give that little shit a reality check. This dude has you on gunpoint and is threatening to kill you. Javi saves you by shooting this dude, then you took that against Javi for your own ends. I think i was never mad before when i played the game, but this scene just made my blood boil.

The action scenes were out of place and felt like they were from some cheap ass action movie. Clementine shooting them walkers on top of the forklift with the Ak-47 and on automatic...it hurt to watch that. I mean if i would have known [this would happen](https://youtu.be/bQ8LyFC-3mU?t=3328) when i first played S2, i would have laughed my ass off. It's so out of place and doesn't feel like the other games at all.

Ava/Tripp dying. We have got to know them somewhat and then we got to kind of pick which one will live. Then they kill them in under 10 seconds, it was just over, the end for them. It was so sudden, simple and plain stupid.

Kenny's death in S3 was so bad. We knew him all the way from S1 and he was a liked character. After all he has gone through, he dies because of a car accident? That was so lame, at least he died in a heroic manner, giving Clementine time to escape with Aj.  
Jane's death was fitting, she was selfish, escalated the situation before, by lying to Clem and making Clem to shoot her friend. Kenny goes with you and is fine with the his fate, no matter what you choose, even if you decide to kill him afterwards. Jane does no such thing. Jane's death is fine, sue me!

This is not a ""scene"", but the idea that the little S1 Clementine dragged Lee from the middle of the walker herd to safety is just so unimaginable it's painful.

Luke dying by getting under the ice is underwhelming, it was too obvious of how it looked like the devs just needed to kill him. Some better death would have been much better, like Luke holding off the walkers so others can cross safely or something.

Sarah's second death didn't have any logic to it and the way they immediately kill her if you save her at the RV is a low blow. They only used couple of bullets to keep walkers at bay as Jane alone tried to take off the blanks, which were on top of Sarah. They had ammo against the Russians, but they didn't have ammo to give time for Jane to get Sarah out? Also multiple people could have gone to help her. It felt kind of unreal how they conserved the ammo, but later ammo dumped the Russians and people just watched there as Jane was trying to do at least something. Icing of the cake is that they didn't even have the audacity to put Sarah out of her misery, when she was about to get eaten alive.

When Lee gets to the bell tower with the help of a ladder as the others are just standing there with a thumb up their asses. Before you go and you examine the ladder, Kenny actually say something like ""we keep it secured on our end"". They don't secure the ladder in anyway, they just stand there. I mean it goes without saying that you try to hold the ladder or something, when somebody is climping. Then when Lee is about to jump back on the roof, he has to drag himself up and what the others do...Well of course they just stand there doing nothing. Lee has only one hand and is jumping a long jump to the roof, barely making it, but hey, Lee got it all under control, no need to help and pull him up or anything!",1667260912

It was banged up, dented, and ripped. I could see the rim and spokes inside through a gaping hole. I could see where someone had tried to repair the box along the way.  


I feared for the worst, but when I finished opening the box, I discovered that all of the parts were included and nothing was damaged. The shop had packaged it very well.  


I gave the seller a positive review for excellent packaging!",1667260913

As a side note, green (special) ammo weapons generally do more damage, so try to have one equipped for beefier (yellow bar) enemies and bosses if you run out of heavy ammo. You can never go wrong with a fusion rifle, although there aren’t that many you can equip in the first slot if you want to keep using Riskrunner.

3 ½ cups (17 ½ oz/497g) all-purpose flour

1 cup (8oz/225g) granulated sugar

4 teaspoons baking powder

2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice

1 teaspoon salt

1 cup (8oz/225g) pumpkin puree

½ cup (4oz/115g) sour cream

2 large eggs

2 tablespoons (1oz/28g) butter melted

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

Vegetable oil for frying (canola, safflower, etc.)

Powdered Sugar Icing or regular sugar

Instructions

In a large bowl, combine your dry ingredients: flour, sugar, baking powder, pie spice, and salt.

In another bowl, whisk your wet ingredients: pumpkin puree, sour cream, eggs, butter, and vanilla extract.

Combine the wet and dry ingredients thoroughly to make a dough. Cover the dough and let it chill for 30 minutes up to overnight in the refrigerator to firm up.

Set up your frying space: pour oil to a 3-inch depth in a heavy-bottomed pot and set over medium-high heat and insert a thermometer, if using. Place a baking sheet next to the stove, either lined with paper towels or a wire rack. Place the bowl with the glaze near the rack.

On a floured surface, roll out the donut dough to ½ inch (1.5cm) thick and cut using a 3-inch (7.5cm) round cutter, cut circles of dough. You can reroll the scraps to make more circles.

Using a 1-inch (2.5cm) cutter, cut holes in the center of your dough circles.

When your oil is hot, roughly 350°F (180°C), drop 2 or 3 donuts (or 5-6 holes) at a time in the oil. Fry for about 2 to 3 minutes, until lightly browned on one side, then flip and fry until the other side is browned.

Remove to the wire rack and immediately dip both sides of the hot donuts in suger or icing and set on the rack to dry before proceeding with the remaining donuts and holes.

Enjoy when just cool enough to devour! Donuts are best eaten the day they are made, but you can store any leftovers in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days. 

Powdered Sugar Icing: 

Mix together 4 cups powdered sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, and 2 tablespoons milk. 

For thicker Icing use less milk, for thinner Icing use more milk. Add 1 tsp at a time.",1667260915

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","Hiya, I worked at a movie theater for 3 years. The answer is they don't, usually. 

American movies generally do not have intermissions, but there are exceptions. Older films frequently get rereleases here, the original King Kong is an example from when I worked at the theater. It received an intermission, I assume because it originally had one or because the audience was generally &gt;50 years of age.

Another exception is when multi-part series release together. For example, with each release of Harry Potter or The Hunger Games, viewers were given the option to watch all the existing films and the new film -- which, for Harry Potter for instance, is an all day thing, so there were several intermissions.

Edit: Also, we have apps like Run Pee which tell you when to go pee during a movie, highly recommended.",1667260915

As for which mods, the only reliable way to be frugal is to bid for less popular mods. The most common question is CTRW vs VUCA. Easy save there. Others include less popular core modules.

MC. A good Prof makes the experience more enjoyable and if you click with the Prof it can be really fun. But grade-wise it doesnt make much of a difference imo.

I feel it is a misunderstood mod with some just dismissing it as just ""fluff"" when they are just not used to the structure and content. It is a lot more application and execution compared to other mods which most are not used to. There is only so much a Prof can do even if they are the best in the world.

Id suggest shelling out for a Prof you heard is enjoyable - really makes a difference during the class. But at the same time it depends on your other modules and your preferences. Id rather spend more for a good stats Prof for example. It depends.",1667260916

"MushroomGrowers","t5_37713","I am the r/MushroomGrowers AutoModerator. I'm a little like [Heimdallr, the gate-keeper](https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp3640969.jpg) for this community. Your recent submission was bounced back by my filter for one of the following reasons:

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ← these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

Ideally you should make sure the cars maintenance is up to date before you go stage 1.

- upgraded charge pipe 
- colder spark plugs 
- transmission fluid for zf8
- brake fluid
- transfer case fluid
- front and rear diff
- good oil and get an oil sample done and then do an oil sample every oil change 

These are all probably good things to get done before. Technically, you can just go stage 1 and be “okay” as long as your charge pipe is good. I believe stage 2 you need additional things like a downpipe.

Also there’s LOTS of threads on this you can check on Reddit and bimmerpost. You can also run the oem spark plugs until 400whp I think. After that you probably want upgraded, don’t quote me on it I’m sure someone else can chime in",1667260917

"Pixel6","t5_3fy38","I'm gonna get the s23 Ultra. Tbh my P6P has been pretty smooth since Android 13 stable came out, but I really miss GoodLock and being able to tweak everything. Had a Note 4, Note 7 (RIP) and a Note 9 before I jumped ship. All of them were absolute beasts of a phone, but Samsung isn't without their own problems. On their respective subs you'll find loads of valid complaints coming from Exynos only devices - in most cases Snapdragon users weren't affected. Then there's the fact that there are large differentials in benchmark tests yet the prices are the same. Had an unfortunate year with a Sony 1ii before I got my Pixel 6 Pro. Vanilla Android is just that, to Sony. If they'd only just spent a bit of time with the software on that phone it would've been ok, instead of leaving it as is. Pixel Launcher is pretty decent tbh but I really miss GoodLock. It was nice to be on the beta before Android 13 came out, but the first year with the phone was beset with problem after problem and although most of them have gone away it has been a bit much for a phone that has levelled out as being alright I guess. The camera on this thing is amazing though. Did a side by side comparison with a buddy who has a s23 Ultra and this won hands down every time. I was seriously considering the 7 Pro when it came out, but was underwhelmed when it was unveiled. Gonna take a look at the s23 Ultra when it comes out, hopefully it will have what I'm looking for and One UI 5.1 should be peng.",1667260918

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I absolutely believe it's possible to break generational curses. For me, I spent time thinking about the way I was raised. Not all of my childhood was bad, but there were some traumatic issues that carried into my adulthood. I think if we find something we didn't like, we can change it and try a new approach. As long as we as a parents continue to work on ourselves, and understanding what works best with our families, we can begin to heal our inner child while loving our families in a healthier way. I don't believe in perfection, but I do believe in growing and doing the best I can. 

One thing I don't do with my children that my parents did was argue and discuss adult issues in front of children. My husband and I make sure not to discuss bills, car troubles, or relationships in front of the kids. The reason for this is that when I was a child, I heard the arguing and thought I was the reason things were going badly. My parents would even say it at times. Today, I don't think they meant it literally, but more so didn't know how to deal with stress well and took anger out on me. 

Has anyone else practiced the opposite of what they grew up in, and is it working effectively with your family?",1667260918

Which is fine. You know the old adage two Jews three opinions. 

I appreciate your steadfast commitment to self improvement. Truly, I do. I also work on my own self and try to do better as well. But I can’t end just at myself or my Jewish community. Because it’s not about me. It’s about acknowledging that other people aren’t always behaving at their perfect level and I can’t take that on as an indication that I’m the one that needs to change. Back in grad school I had roommates who I wanted to get along with. But when my Jewishness came out and they realized I was religious they began taking my things or lending them out, saying things behind my back. It culminated in them being openly Antisemitic and posting about it online so they could encourage others to come teach me a lesson. I had to emergency move. This happened years ago but for a while I wondered what I could have changed about how I conducted myself. Only now do I realize that there isn’t anything I can change that would have changed them. In fact it was my inherent nature they had a problem with. 

And from that I learned sometimes I can speak up and get loud and other times I need to pay attention and stay alive. I have no doubt if I hadn’t advocated and made my landlord concerned and actually stayed in that living situation that I would have been hurt physically. Especially as I later found out that one of the girls has become an actual Nazi. Like swastikas and all. 

I’m fine now. In fact I’m feeling happy and safe and whole since then. But it didn’t come from asking what I needed to improve. But acknowledging it wasn’t a reflection on me.",1667260919

"popheads","t5_39nwj","I think the key factor here is the rollout. 

With Lover, she had a long, drawn-out rollout with a questionable lead single that no one really liked and a second single that was better received but nobody really loved either. 

She was doing the traditional album promo cycle that by 2019 was already considered passe and outdated. In the streaming era, it just isn't feasible to build hype for months and months on end, and do the ""first single, release album a few months later, drop second single a month later, drop third and fourth singles all throughout the year"". It just doesn't work anymore, and I think Taylor was getting a little behind the times in that regard. 

I think she realized that she had to change how she rolls out albums after that. 

With Midnights, she simply announced it a month in advance, and she released no singles until release night which gave fans plenty of speculation and hype as to what this album would sound like. Then she created even more hype by embracing TikTok and releasing videos every night teasing a track title. 

It was a very simple rollout, but also one that paid off clearly.",1667260919

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","It sounds like your mental health was nearly eating you alive but you had it under a check because you had your world all carefully controlled to try to limit the amount of pain your mental health could cause you.

Now, here is another person who is not under your control and situations that can't be predicted and all of your mental health monsters are coming out to haunt you.

It sounds like you could really use some therapy. It might also be helpful to talk to your doctor about OCD as well. Try to schedule this as soon as you can, for many there is a waiting list.

You should also understand that not only is this exhausting for you, but it is very exhausting for your girlfriend and it can very quickly burn out a relationship on both ends if your partner has to constantly soothe and comfort you.

"Truckers","t5_2t90b","This happened right in my home state in an area I drive frequently. Some of you may not realize but southern New Hampshire is by and large an extension of northern Massachusetts. Except with a lot more guns and a lot less gun laws (though, very harsh penalties for violating those existing laws).

My understanding is the driver (who had 2 kids in the truck) got out to approach the driver of the car who had been throwing things at the truck and repeatedly hitting the brakes in front of him on the highway. When they finally got off the highway and stopped at a red light, the driver of the truck approached the car (yes, we know, ""shoulnda dun that"") and presumably gave him an earful before being shot point blank in the head by a guy who was later caught and found in possession of cocaine (make what you will of that bit). 

So yeah, a mistake was made by a driver who had literally had enough being screwed around by 4 wheelers. Because I'll tell you this, NHSP and MSP sure aren't watching out for us. They'd rather give you a ticket for violating a noise ordinance or something when you blast your air horn at the 4 wheelers they just watched cut you off.",1667260919

"oddlyterrifying","t5_2yo6b","There isn't really an urban setting in VT. Burlington is a close as you'll get and 30 miles outside city limits is very rural. That said, rural rental prices have skyrocketed in the last couple of years. 250K gets you very little, even in rural VT. My friend is renting a studio apartment less than a mile from this structure for $900 monthly with no utilities included. I bought my house just before the housing market turned and paid 150K for 900 sqft on 7 acres in a town of only 4300 people. Four years ago this was considered a very good price. The market value has almost doubled since then. Another friend of mine just sold her 1200 sqft cabin on two acres for $260K in Halifax, VT. Halifax has a population of less than 800 people. 8 hundred... there is not a missing zero in that number. Halifax is just a couple of towns over from Brattleboro.",1667260922

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","It is hard to pick which 5 years were the most influential in the last 75. As people have said, your first five years was like getting a new computer, blank ad putting everything in as you started life as a new being. Then along came school and learning many new things as well as being brought up by your parents and setting the foundation blocks for building your life on.

School over, you had to start working with others and getting along, learning new skills, becoming an adult, look for partners and how to balance work &amp; pleasure, save money, buy cars, house or learn the ""joys"" of renting and taking responsibility.

Each person then has different experiences with work, trying to find the ideal job for your situation, settling into possibly life with a family, debts and child illness/accidents. all learning experiences. I was lucky finding my 2nd major job was what I was looking for, spending 20 years travelling the world and experiencing different cultures, cuisines &amp; peoples.

The next years until I reached 70, were varied, hard and influential periods varied, but at 70, I think started 6 years that have had a great influence on me. I packed my life up, and moved to live in SE Asia, where I still live. I had to learn a new way of life, moving from a medium city with all conveniences &amp; amenities. to a rural village that doesn't even have a shop as such.

I had a new culture &amp; cuisine to learn, another language, learned to ride a motorcycle &amp; drive on the opposite side of the road, new currency, way of shopping, and how to get electricity &amp; mains water along with internet connected. Getting connections sounds simple, but you have to be a resident national, not a foreigner. Luckily the local people were kind enough to let me use their details to get services connected to comply with regulations. I also had to learn my way to the nearest municipality that had shops &amp; offices I needed, where the local wet market was located, find a bank that would let me open a bank account as a foreigner ad many other things. Luckily my ex. had a lot of family living in the area and helped out greatly, from showing me around, introducing me to residents and tradespeople so I could get the house I bought, revamped and more senior friendly. The property in in two relatives names, as again I can't own land, but I can own the house on it, but that will be useful when I die, as we won't need transfer of title &amp; all the taxes that go with it, as it is in their names already.

Possibly this last 5 years hasn't been so much influential, but it has been like starting again and learning a new lifestyle. I am happy living here, it is a simple life, the house basically suit my needs &amp; the 5 cats I have along with other strays that come and go, especially at meal times. If I become invalided, I have a lot of relatives to help and find ""staff"" to help look after me, and at around USD8/day wages, I can afford even being on a pension. Life here is a great way to wind down at the end of my expected life cycle.",1667260923

First of all your wife does not have to compromise with your mom regarding her personal relationships.  She doesn’t have to inform your parents of the reasons for her relationships or lack thereof.

More importantly any rules regarding the children require two yes or one no.  If your wife wants to be with your mom when she’s with your kid, well it turned out she had very good reason not to trust her.

What your mom did was not a little thing.  You enabling it was also not a little thing.  Those were massive breaches of trust and now because of that you aren’t going to be married much longer.

It's a free game, so when people see others around them playing, they'll download it and try it out but very few who onboarded based on hype but didn't really have that initial interest level to carry them through more than a few weeks would've bought welkin and/or bp, and even fewer would've bought crystals. 

If you look at this [trend graph](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/xyk110/genshins_popularity/) you'll see a huge spike in interest with genshin when it first released, which then dipped back down to a more reasonable level and has since maintained that average level cyclically with a very slight but noticeable upward trend which reflects my own impression of the game's ongoing success. Obviously this graph is only relevant to searches of ""genshin impact"" in English so it's hard to say if it's reflective of other markets but given the sheer size of the English-speaking playerbase, I'd say it's a decent (if imperfect) sample. 

I got another comment suggesting the growth might be partly coming from other countries which didn't expedience that initial hype wave which is probably true. But I think it is also true that genshin did release with a massive wave of hype in a lot of places and that hype did likely contribute to the game attracting more than just its own suitable long-term audience, which inflated the player numbers during the early days. Obviously there is no way to definitively prove this but then the fact that there are players who either dropped the game early on but came back recently (or just never came back at all) is easily verifiable.",1667260923

To be clear I'm fine with a quirky character, but it just felt so off when ever single other character was acting with a lot more professionalism than she was. Where I really started to dislike her was when the series started focusing more on personal stories and I feel they made her character too whiny. I get they work an intense job and everything I just could not stand when she started doing that thing where every line sounds like she's about to start crying. You're an FBI employee in an elite unit - I'm not here to see you be sympathetic and be upset. I would've much rather they made her character more desensitized to the crimes and kept her being goofy. I will say I do have bias against the latter part of the show because I really didn't like how the writing style shifted. I vastly preferred when we only got tiny little snippets of their personal lives and opinions and all the cases were focused on unsubs that were unrelated to the main cast.

I also get that this is an unpopular opinion and people can feel free to disagree. Her character just wasn't my taste and she is the first of the team I would let go of if given the option.",1667260924

^(By: Pearl S. Buck, Gianny Buditjahya | 418 pages | Published: 1931 | Popular Shelves: classics, fiction, historical-fiction, china, classic)

&gt;This tells the poignant tale of a Chinese farmer and his family in old agrarian China. The humble Wang Lung glories in the soil he works, nurturing the land as it nurtures him and his family. Nearby, the nobles of the House of Hwang consider themselves above the land and its workers; but they will soon meet their own downfall.
&gt;
&gt;Hard times come upon Wang Lung and his family when flood and drought force them to seek work in the city. The working people riot, breaking into the homes of the rich and forcing them to flee. When Wang Lung shows mercy to one noble and is rewarded, he begins to rise in the world, even as the House of Hwang falls.

"Paleontology","t5_2qvjo","I think another idea could be something to do with speculative evolution. 

Like what the complexities of evolving specific musculature would be in regards to evolving a pseudo-pteranodon that can express with lips whilst still having a beak. Presumably the creature would be flightless too due to its small wings and perhaps use them aesthetically to deter predators in some kind of display, or perhaps the length of vestigial skin on the arm is a symbol of virility amongst their species. They are sexually dimorphic too but seemingly only in regards to whether an individual has eyelashes of not, making them the only reptiles to achieve such a trait unique to mammals. 

If we take these characters in the image presented to us as real and accurate depictions of these particular specimens. 

I wonder how dense the skin would have to be to get that 3D generated appearance. Or how a creature could evolve enough traits to resemble a small tyrannosaurid, but retain a uncanny cartoon appearance in a realistic ecosystem. How powerful would its bite actually be? 

Would it’s head be able to be supported by its body if the bones were dense enough? If so as the creature aged would its giant head wear out the spinal cord over time? Leading to its fossils being identified by chafing around the vertebrae nearby its huge skull.

"Beekeeping","t5_2qtzm","Guelph is roughly the same latitude as Bend Oregon, FYI. 

I live in Canada just like Paul Kelley, but I’m as far North from Guelph as how far Guelph is North from the South edge of the Grand Canyon. And I’m very much in Canada’s South. 

And therein lies my biggest pet peeve in beekeeping: **beekeeping is local**, and most advise is not qualified to geography when being given. Moreover, the entire beekeeping world seems to have simply ignored that Charles Langstroth lived in Philadelphia where it rarely gets below freezing.

We’ve already had almost a foot of snow this season, and Langstroth hives are not meant for freezing weather. Sure, with a little effort the bees can usually survive, but what sort of animal care is that - providing an environment they can only ***usually*** survive?!?!


 To your point, there are hundreds of variables in beekeeping, and no single one is make-or-break for winter, but once you understand the thermodynamics of bees, combined with understanding what environment bees **prefer** (not just survivable), two facts become clear: 

1.	Cold-weather hives (freezing or lower) should be heavily insulated, and
2.	They should have only a lower entrance. 

I recommend reading Charles Dadant’s book (free in the public domain) - specifically the section on overwintering, and Thomas Seeley’s ‘The lives of bees’ for more info.",1667260925

"bettafish","t5_2udkc","Now I've added pygmy and albino corydoras to his tank, my guy has decided he's a bottom-feeder and hangs out with the corys eating their food too. Although he remembers to feed from the top when I sprinkle his Bug Bites flakes or dried daphnia (his favs).
When I first added the corys, he would hang around hovering over their little flat glass plate that I feed them their frozen foods on (Even though I'd feed him his own portion from my finger up the top), chasing them off when they tried to grab a bite. He fortunately got over that pretty quickly when he realised there was enough to go around, and now he just picks through the substrate with them like he's not huge and flappy and bright blue and is in fact a teeny catfish.  For a minute there,  I thought he was headed to pig-fish jail too. He actually seems to prefer feeding with his little buddies now and is less tame with me :( It is cute to see him do his excited dance towards the corys when he sees them though. Idk what they think of it, but they seem unfazed, just doing their cory thing.",1667260925

"kpopthoughts","t5_2730wn","The problem is that a ton of BG stans are in fact very misogynistic. 

I’m primarily a BG stan and a lot of people I interact with on social media are very possessive over these men/boys.

I wouldn’t say the majority of stans are, but I would definitely say that a noticeable amount have unhealthy kpop addictions/attachments, and we have normalized the behavior that comes with that, which is why: 

A) I think it’s important that this behavior is called out, and

B) if as a BG stan, you can’t find ANY value in any female Korean entertainer or gg’s, not even ONE where you can add a song to your current playlist, or like their style, or think they are funny or entertaining, then I do think there is some misogyny at play.

For example, when it was announced that Jin would be on My Alcohol Diary and while a lot of fans got excited for this content, I saw a few comments being weird, talking about “youngJi isn’t even his type, so I’m not worried” or “Youngji if you make a move, we’re coming for you” or “why can’t they do a male drinking show instead.” 

I don’t stan BTS and I also don’t necessarily find YoungJi to be as charming as a lot of people do, but I wouldn’t feel *threatened* like these fans did if my biases were to come on her show.

There is definitely a reason behind the sentiment in the OG post and again, I don’t think that all BG Stan’s are misogynistic, heck, I don’t even think 1/2 of them are, but there are enough of them that it’s noticeable and problematic.",1667260925

Kids hearing about your relationship increases the chances of a malicious accusation that you would need union support for. Membership is cheap.

Whilst I would do whatever the union says, personally I think you should also lock down your social media and unfriend anyone you work with. It's not worth it.

Having a car is a taste of independence, but when a girl starts talking about the lease, the energy bill, buying furniture etc. your not going to be able to keep up and she’s probably going to feel like she’s more mature than you. Definitely save up for the car, but if you can go cheap and use the extra money as a security deposit and go rent, even if it’s just a room.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Using Thinkpads as an example, since they are the ones that I have been buying in recent years, the price difference is about $300 in the models I looked at. Prior to that, I had been getting Intel in my laptops. Also, since my AMD Thinkpad is quadcore, while the previous Intel Thinkpad was dualcore, the former definitely seemed faster and gave smoother performance. Not too sure about battery life or heat since I use the differently. The AMD turned into a desktop replacement, so it is always plugged in, so I have no idea about battery life or heat (it is not on my lap). Also, at the time of purchase, the AMD iGPU that is built into the AMD gave better performance than Intel's. The Intel Thinkpad could be relatively cool and had great battery life, but it was the last of the Thinkpads to have a combined close to 100 watt battery. To me, the Intel premium is no longer worth it.

&gt;I'm sorry which country has no homelessness, and which charges $2500 for an ambulance ride?

Two totally unrelated things. People in the US enjoy a way higher quality of life than Cubans, just because the US has its own share of problems it doesn't mean Cuba is way better, specially if you're gonna guide yourself by statistics shared by a highly corrupt government with a terrible record on human rights. Have you ever even cared to see how the average Cuban lives? You might as well have 0 homelessness and most of the population living in awful houses without clean water or electricity.

&gt;You clearly don't understand the embargo or how capitalism works. The embargo prevents trade with other countries too.

It doesn't, it prevents trade with the US-based companies in anything that isn't food or medicine-related. [Cuba trades with the rest of the world](https://oec.world/en/profile/country/cub), but what makes you think that if they were able to trade with the US they'd suddenly become some sort of very developed nation? Back in the days of the Cold War, Cuba received massive amounts of money from trading with the USSR and other Eastern Bloc nations and even back then they had an awful economy. When the government takes literally all the money from exports, spends most of it in corruption, and then leaves some bread crumbs for the Cuban people, your economy is *never* going to get better.

&gt;Not true. Doctors can earn way more. When they go abroad to help out countries like Italy, doctors get paid the salary of doctors there, minus a 60% tax. If doctors were so poor why do they have the third highest number of doctors per capita

That's when they go abroad, and a 60% tax on their income is insane. There are so many doctors in Cuba because the Cuban government literally pays for their education abroad then basically makes them work in Cuba for pretty much the rest of their lives, paying them miserably. The fact that there are more or less doctors is irrelevant because there's no competition, all get paid the same by the government. Argentina has the most psychologists per capita in the world, yet psychologists aren't the best paid profession, not even the best paid in the region, it's really a worthless comparison.

You're literally justifying highly trained professionals being paid jackshit, and on top of this, they don't even get to choose where they work; they're assigned to a place by the government and they remain there until the government says otherwise. In any other country, medical staff tend to be able to choose whether they want to work in the public or private sector, and generally choose where to.

&gt;Umm I must admit this is the first time I've ever heard this. Please can I have a source.

[Here](https://www.cubagrouptour.com/blog/is-killing-a-cow-worse-than-killing-a-person-in-cuba), the article talks about the myth of it being worse than killing a person, but that's obviously not true, but still, people do get punished by killing livestock without prior authorization, because people can't legally own livestock (or anything for that matter).

&gt;""Why can't a tropical island of 11m people completely self subsidies, and have all the privileged luxuries I'm used to""

This is quite literally the point of communism, to not rely on international trade with capitalist nations because that only benefits bourgeois interests. Communism seeks to be mostly autarkic, so it's ironic that this is unachievable.

Also, ""all the privileges and luxuries I'm used to"", lol, at this pace my country is going to be like Cuba in a matter of a decade or so, I'm not American or European, I'm a third worlder who has also met Cuban escapees who decided to come to my country, which isn't any sort of paradise, because anywhere is better than Cuba for them.

"solar","t5_2qq8l","Here in Texas most of the retail providers have cut back on crediting outflow. As of late they typically cap your credit to only the kwh you consume from them, LEAVING any base fees, taxes and all of the fees for the TDU.  (Texas Deregulation).  So you can no longer achieve that zero bill no matter how large your array is. So a battery starts making more sense.

At any rate, given what you just said, I would recommend a solaredge system with the largest inverter you can get, so 11.4kw.  And a hefty 5 string DC combiner. BUT, size your panels lower for now.  This gives you the super easy ability to later add panels when you need to drive that inverter harder.  I have done this on two houses now and have always DIY the string additions.

Purchase the larger optimizers so you can later upgrade the existing panels. And I would very much suggest an oversized east-west install to maximize the generation curve throughout the day as opposed to only South.  So if you want 8kwDC (which I think is on the 'why bother' low side) Install 5kw East and 5kw West and now you have a passive tracking oversized array where the East wakes up, both operate at Noon, and the West keeps it going into sunset.

I have an 11.4kw inverter, 4 strings of 14 South and West, and I am about to DIY add a 5th string to the exact same inverter on the East side to bring the curve up in the AM and to lift the overall curve just enough to matter.  As your panels start aging, you have more headroom to add another string or slowly replace panels with better ones. The Solaredge stuff is awesome and super easy to use and you can drive that inverter with 15k DC STC which really equates to higher if you oversize for passive tracking or if you have aging or second-hand discount panels.

DIY will save you a butt load of cash. And you can engage a licensed electrician for guidance, paperworks, final inspect and cross connect.",1667260928

The hardest thing to learn is the shoulder tackle, but even that should come naturally after some time.

And once she perfectly grasped the weapon and beat the game, the sunbreak move and scroll-swapping allows to completely change the feel of the weapon similarly to hunting styles in generations, allowing you to rediscover the GS and have a lot of fun even after playing it for the entirety of the base game.",1667260928

Only complaint is that 5th and 6th are very close together. Really wish 5th was 6th and have a longer gear for highway speeds. I understand that this would probably mean I would have to downshift more on the highway to pass quickly, but I feel like 1700-2000rpms is the sweet spot for this truck and 2500rpms at ~75mph just seems a bit too high. 

No issues to report, one other note is that manual trucks have the clutch fluid reservoir mounted in the spot that a lot of popular mods use the same mounting hole in the engine bay. But there are extra on the opposite side of the engine bay.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA. There’s a solid chance you’ve just lost your wife and family. Once trust is broken, it’s really hard to get back, and you doubling down on this betrayal has made her realize you won’t think to be on her side, or to protect her, immediately. Your mom is a real piece of work giving our your address to Cat’s family as well. Guess what? She doesn’t NEED to know the reasons Cat isn’t talking to her family, but she needs to RESPECT the boundaries set. You’re quite a pair, and I have a feeling you’ll be spending a lot more time with her than your wife and kid pretty soon.

ETA and then you went and told your mom the reasons Cat is NC with her family even though she asked you not to. You can’t help but disrespect her, can you?",1667260929

And yes, sometimes trying real hard not to cum yet lol",1667260929

Bruh.

This may seem a difficult concept for you, but it is possible to communicate how severe an issue is without actually giving someone the details of it. With how long Cat has been no contact with her family, and with how long your mother has given her crap over it, how did it never occur to you to pull your mother aside and tell her to stop? That Cat has very personal and extremely serious reasons to not talk to them? Your mother was very apologetic about her actions after you informed her of why things were the way they were with Cat and her family, which demonstrates that it was entirely possible for you to get her to understand the severity of the issue in the first place. Of course, you would need to spend some time actually thinking about things from both of their perspectives and figuring out how to bridge them when talking with both Cat and ypur mother, which requires patience, empathy, and time that you clearly were not willing to devote to the issue until it was far too late. Stop being so defensive of yourself and your mother, sit down, and spend some time trying to comprehend Cat's thought process here. Self-reflection is an important tool that could help you after things have finished falling apart between you two.

So, in summary.

Bruh.",1667260929

"nursepractitioner","t5_2v7bm","Urgent Care work as an NP is not what it's all cracked up to be.  Sure, there are benefits such as shift length and timing, but you could get even better hours working primary care.  

I think going back and getting your FNP may be worth it is some ways, but if you're unable to quit your current position, you still need to complete significant schooling and clinical hours while working full time to achieve for you FNP.  This will be no small feat, and it sounds like you'll need this job until you find another one in the mean time.  

My take: it sounds like you're just really unhappy with your current position.  I would look laterally first before considering going back to school, as FNP certification and training is still no joke wherever you may go.  

Extra-spicy-take: Acute care AGACNP typically attracts the more a-type personalities that tend to mesh better with ICU styles of thinking.  Conversely, Urgent Care providers tend to be more b-type with ER and acute-care styles of thinking.  While I don't know you, I do know some ICU FNPs that are frequently dissatisfied with their careers in Urgent Care; they have frequent complaints of being treated like crap, and arguing with patients about the care they provide.  Having worked both ICU and ER and now Urgent Care, I can confidently say that my personality meshes with responding well to ER styles of thinking, letting crappy comments from patients slide off my back, dealing more with conscious patients, and remaining flexible and adapting to my environments.  ICU-style, while having EXTREMELY important and effective management of their patients, tend to get a little more annoyed with Jason's 3rd visit for STDs this month and Anna's ""sinus infection"" for 3 days that she gets this time every year on a schedule and just needs an antibiotic to clear it up.  Just to be clear - there is in no way that this is absolute science or fact as there are MANY providers with ICU-like background that end up loving UC and it is very possible - it is just a trend I tend to notice.  

Either way, good luck :)",1667260929

"Warhammer30k","t5_352pm","The first five novels are great.

I highly recommend **Legion**; **Know No Fear**, which made me love Ultramarines despite years of poisoning by 40k memes; **Scars** and **The Path of Heaven**, which elevated the White Scars from 'space mongols on bikes' into nuanced and interesting characters; and **The First Heretic, Aurelian, and Betrayer** which follow Argel Tal's story line.

I'm biased but I really enjoyed the Alexis Polux x Barabas Dantioch bromance: **The Crimson Fist**, **The Iron Within**, and finally **Pharos**.

As for stinkers, I think **Battle of the Abyss** is the worst novel in the series. It's a shame as I really enjoyed Ben Counter's other work like Galaxy in Flames and the Soul Drinkers novels.",1667260931

That's some weird logic. Why is a differential in tax rates between countries (or authorities) constitute one subsidising the other?

&gt;tax should be paid to where revenue is generated not where it gets magically moved to another domain. This is exactly the type of issue governments have been grappling with for some time and this is why we have the minimum 15% tax pushed by the Biden administration.

The fact that you told your mother afterwards, is also completely disrespectful to your wife. Your mother should respect her decisions regarding her family, and contacting them like that was completely out of line. The fact that you’re not outraged as well is very telling. Something tells me this isn’t the reason she wants to divorce, but probably the final straw. There’s no way this is the first time your mother has overstepped and I assume you’ve probably backed to your mother in other instances as well.

"SHINee","t5_2tmg1","Going forward, they haven't been using VLive at all for about a year (since the business side of the takeover took place), so nothing about how to access their new livestreams will change when the site goes down.

Official lives take place on Youtube now, and they were broadcasting those on both platforms for a few years before they stopped using VLive, so the past few years of official ones are archived on their Youtube channel as well, but there aren't going to be many of those until the next release - IIRC the last ones were Key's Gasoline countdown live and  the anniversary one...

Other SM artists have gone back to doing personal/casual VLives through Instagram (NCT has been using Instagram for all casual lives this year; their own accounts if it's only one or two of them and the official account if it's the whole group in the practice room, and Key/Taem both used Instagram for solo livestreams before the SHINee VLive channel got made, so they can still use that going forward)

SHINee just haven't done many this year (which is not a huge deal, because there was no obligation to do those in the first place, but it makes sense - since honestly when they had so many back in 2021 it was mainly a) Taemin starting that momentum by starting a lot of them himself, plus b) that was mid-pandemic where none of them had seen fans or even other groups in person for over a year, and c) they were also worried about their lost momentum, so they were doing as much as they could to connect with fans, so there are probably more of them in 2021 than any other year. (They were purely optional and usually the manager doesn't make them do it so I am guessing they just haven't felt like it lately - which is understandable since they are busy and seeing people in person again. I think we will see some once they are back together again though.)

Instagram lives pretty much always get uploaded by fans to Youtube. You do have to wait for fansubs but VLive relied on fansubs as well for any unofficial lives. (

As for accessing old lives before VLive is closed, it's probably easier to access old content on the non-mobile site. They have a channel, and you click on ""Star Board"" to filter out all the fan posts (the older lives were on the SMTown channel but the SHINee channel has them linked: [https://www.vlive.tv/channel/96DD0B/board/7466](https://www.vlive.tv/channel/96DD0B/board/7466) )",1667260933

Another one: https://goo.gl/maps/Jcei6rWbKhKmTK4R9, all development is away from the highway and on inside streets. If you look at the highway's street view, you'll find mostly stores and large backyards leaving the houses far away from the noise.",1667260935

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Of course there were exceptions like 4chan, Gaia and d2jsp where trolls rule the site, but that's probably an issue of sites getting too popular for their own good combined with the staff having a toxic vision on community building.

Or rather, it's not an issue at all. 4chan is a site where thousands of racists and other piece of shit people gather to talk about racism and piece of shit things. Who cares? If 4chan was removed tomorrow, racists wouldn't disappear from the internet- they would just congregate someplace else. Places like 4chan are containment zones that allow those types of people to socialize without spreading their garbage to other sites. And that was the beauty of the old internet. You had a thousand different communities, which allowed to everyone to seek out a place that fit them. One of the greatest tragedies of modern day internet consolidation is that people are being forced to intermingle with folks that they can't naturally get along with, for predictable results.",1667260935

Now to Lions. Pats are the only team to shut them out, and beat them by 20 points. And 3 of their 6 losses has been by 4pts or less.

drink amrita up saiki, the more you kill under the buff the more amrita you'll gain

might as well also temper lucky drop weapon, armour and accessory and farm for gear and accessories and lapis at the same time

This might help them get acclimated to competition sparring due to similar conditions, albeit without the higher pressure.

It depends on what you see as development. Is is coding? Or simply working on the game?

Not full hands on deck, but the game was already in development.

It just means being conscious of the enemy reaper, getting on high ground, dancing around poles and corners with your other support whilst the other half stays on another side of the map. Reaper does not counter brig. I have PLAYED games where me switching from Ana to Brig against a reaper that was shitting on our backline WON us the game, because literally a simple shield bash and a flail is all you need to shut down a character like that. You can easily play a melee character and still be conscious of range. There's also different playstyles for every character, not a set one that you have to stick to all the damn time, especially when it comes to brig. If you find yourself not even being able to deal with a reaper, switch, cuz ur not good enough to play brig. Simple.",1667260938

"Doom","t5_2qzwi","Unpopular opinion, but I hope they do something more akin to Doom 3. We all know they won't because it's the black sheep of the Doom family, but I'm just thinking out loud.

We've got Doom 2016 and Doom Eternal for all of our old-school-meets-new needs. Doom 64 has been re-released onto a more accessible platform. This means we've already got good saturation of the classic Doom experience and also good saturation of the more modern, traversability-focused take on the same formula.

The newer games (and in particular the enemies) have a shiny, overdesigned quality to them that, in my opinion, makes them a lot cooler but a lot less terrifying (don't get me started on the modern imp design though, yuck). There's something about seamlessly swinging around a giant arena doing melee executions on demons mid-battle and seeing a shower of fluorescent powerups with every other death that makes it feel a lot less dangerous and atmospheric.

I'd like to go back to being scared in the dark, treading carefully in blood-spattered hallways, listening to horrifying sounds of things to come, afraid of what might be around the corner. I like knowing that I have all of the weapons I need to take out any threat, but those same threats can easily kill you if you get cocky or too exposed. I want to come face to face with a demon and think ""oh *FUCK*"" instead of a simple monkey-brain association with it being a ""trash mob"" that equates to more health or ammo. You can still feel like an absolute badass when you manage a group of different enemies with intelligent weapon selection, even if the power fantasy is somewhat shaken by the risk of an easy death.

I love all things Doom. Have played and enjoyed every title. Doom 3 isn't even my favourite. I just feel like I'd like to see what else they can do with the idea.",1667260938

Which is a good thing to have both, and why I loved it so much.

You’re lucky you got a good one on that amp! I loved the sound so much, but I had 3 sent to me from Sweetwater all had issues. So had to give it up. But it def is a lovely amp, and I may circle back around one day. I ended up with something else in the end.",1667260939

The main goal is Buddhahood, so with the help of Amitabha teaching you the Dharma, what you mainly do is cultivate to Buddhahood with the amazing tools and environment that you have there. At one point, some people stay in the Pure Land while others choose to go back to samsara to help sentient beings, particularly the people that they used to know. I believe you will also get a prediction of your own complete enlightenment by Amitabha himself (much like in the Lotus Sutra). 
I don't know if anyone can confirm this, but I've once read somewhere that what the people in Pure Land do all day long is actually travel to other Buddha Lands of the 10 directions and give offerings to the Buddhas that reside there lol.",1667260939

But every in-verse mention of blaster bolts is consistent. Slug throwers are no faster except in fan theories. Noise doesn't travel in space either but guess what? Still does in the movies, wanna essay why that one too?

"LibbyandAbby","t5_298rgl","In my opinion, the people who are upset don’t understand how the legal system works. This case is already going to be very complicated to try because it’s garnered a lot of attention and coverage in the media. Obviously the police want to do this the right way and not come close to doing anything to messing up the case they have worked so hard to bring to this point. 

Obviously the investigation isn’t over but this is a turning point in the case where the reins will be turned over to the DA. You can’t please everyone and people have wildly different expectations about what was going to happen here. We can speculate about why things are sealed and what is going on behind the scenes but I trust that there is a good reason for all of this. These things aren’t sealed normally and that isn’t done by the police or DA but a decision made by higher ups. We’ll find out information in due time.",1667260939

"AskConservatives","t5_2yb8u","&gt; If boomers were collecting less than they paid in, there would be an ENORMOUS surplus.

There is an enormous surplus. It's just that the government has been siphoning that surplus to pay for random other stuff since the program was introduced.

The ponzi scheme works like this - every year, Dorothy pays into social security. Instead of putting it in a safe investment so it's there when she's ready to retire, the US government decides to spend it on whatever else they want to fund that year. Then, 50 years later when Dorothy is ready to retire, the US government does not have a pot of money ready for her (since they spent all the money she contributed), so they have to reach for the payments of the new generation to pay out Dorothy.

We get along well and he cares about me a lot, and he's even said that taking care of me is important to him. We have amazing sexual chemistry, too, which is another thing that has made this so challenging. I haven't had this problem before, either. Everything about our situation is new to me and it feels like we've done everything backwards. If he would have approached me in the streets to ask me out, he's not someone I would've given a chance. But I've never been shown this level of care from a man before, so I don't know what to do.
 
I agree that I am going to have to do some real searching and thinking about this. Thankfully I have a therapist that I can talk to this about, and I'm seeing them tomorrow morning. It's just so much. I don't *want* to end things but I'm worried that I might have to because of the attraction problem. I know looks aren't everything but I'm shaken.

"dragonballfighterz","t5_3ltwg","I know it may sound like a funny joke but “exist” actually is the right answer.

DBFZ is a different enough flavor that people will want to play it either as a change of pace or just because those other two games arn’t their speed.

Lots of idiots keep saying “make it 1v1”

But the fact that it’s a tag based game with assist is part of its DNA. You’re not literally trying to make it more like street fighter, just a good game that can compete.

Heck imagine if I said in order to compete with DBFZ 2, street fighter should become 3v3 and have assists, and much longer combos.

That’s just not what street fighter is and 1v1 just isn’t what DBFZ is.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","It's because consoles are dying as a gaming platform to be honest

Playstation 5 for instance was released on Nov 12, 2020. That's nearly 2 years already past for that console, yet to buy one is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. They're always sold out because there's too few in stock and they get bought out instantly, and the ones that are in stock are fucking 500 dollars. 

Then they're now putting all the PS games on PC anyways. God of War, TLOU, Uncharted, Death Stranding, Days gone, etc. There's nothing tying people to consoles. If they were readily available, cheap, good platforms to play games on that I could just go to the store and buy, then they would have a purpose. But as of right now, people would rather just spend that 500 bucks on a gaming PC or upgrading their own PC and I don't blame them. 

PS5 should be around the same price as a switch, 300-350 and be mass stocked. The switch is honestly the best console on the market because it has a niche function that PC doesn't have. Not only does it have Nintendo games but also has the portable function. PC has neither of those unless you use an emulator which you need a pretty good PC to run the big Nintendo games like BOTW.",1667260940

I really get pirating stuff i used to do it when i was younger and didn't have money i would pirate quite a bit of games, but that still doesn't mean it was okay for me to do, peoples put hard work into it, even though it's not physical. In music industry you have to write lyrics record instruments, record vocals, in gaming industry you have to code the game, then if your game is complex you have to hire motion capture actors and if not that you have to hire voice actors and animators that will animate all animations.

&gt;Может. Это лишь несколько частных причин, которые показывают, что дискуссия в школе возможна и что она может быть полезна.

Это показывает, что вы через частности пытаетесь сделать вывод об общем. Достаточно классический риторический приём.

&gt;Тогда почему уроки длятся 45 минут, а перемены, на которых дети имеют хоть какой-то шанс ""социализироваться"", всего 5-10 минут? Если школа - это место социализации, то логичнее было бы всё время общаться с детьми, а в небольших перерывах получать какие-то крохи знаний о жизни. Почему школами заведует министрество образования, а не министерство социализации?

То есть, процесс обучения - не социализация? Работа в коллективе не социализация? Понятненько.

I’ve been in such a deep depression and anxious worried I have a horrible illness. Deep down I knew it was the ozempic. I looked up the animal they model the synthetic bite after and it is frightening. I’m glad ozempic is working for a lot of you but there is a dark side being hidden.

ULA Purchases 2 BE-4 engines (at great cost) for each of those 60 launches. Blue Origin is of course owned by Bezos.

I take all this to indicate that the likelihood of Blue Origin really getting into the vehicle production/launch service game to be not-so-high. BO will be an engine manufacturer competing with Aerojet, not a launch service provider competing with ULA or spaceX",1667260944

"roastmystartup","t5_393bi","Initial feedback: 

First impression of the UI is solid. Its on the minimalistic side, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The primary color used doesn’t seem to match the product in my opinion. It’s also not a very appealing shade. 

The use of space could probably be optimized. All the parts of the top part of the player seem squished, especially the article preview. You might play around with making this part expand for more details, similar to Spotify or YouTube. 

The chat button covers part of the player on mobile. Not sure what a user would need that chat for and why they’d need to see it at all times. 

The finger scrubbing is a bit clunky. I would take notes from something like YouTube where the indicator of where you are gets bigger when adjusting. Also, previewing the time would be nice (again that’s hidden by the chat button)

I’d also be more motivated to stick around if there was a way to see related articles to spark my interests.",1667260944

"PhD","t5_2qiyl","I think your supervisors are trying to give you a realistic idea of what it will truly be like to be a PhD student. Many people START a PhD because they enjoy their research. Very few people FINISH a PhD because they enjoy their research. By that time, they are just grinding out their dissertation to get to the finish line through pure discipline and grit.

You may enjoy part of your work for part of the time. But there are many aspects that are not enjoyable. Even if you are wildly gifted and extremely hardworking, the experience probably will not be easy and enjoyable.

Why?

\- Being at the cutting edge of research means you will have questions that nobody can answer, yet you are expected to figure it out. I once ""broke"" Google searching for a research topic that had zero search results, yet I was expected to learn and understand it.

\- It's unclear if the manuscript you worked on for years will become published in a journal. The reasons could be arbitrary, e.g. office politics. Or someone published similar work just 1 month prior (aka ""getting scooped"").

\- The work you put in does not necessarily translate to reward. There will be things you try in research that will fail. That's part of the experimentation of research. You might be working for 4 years with no significant results. Frustration builds and there's no guarantee that trying again will ""work"" this time. 

\- Imposter syndrome comes from being surrounded by the world's leading experts in your field. This puts a lot of pressure on PhD students who have been accustomed to being the top of their class, A+ students all their lives, overachievers who can do anything they try. Now they're the small fish in a big pond. It can be an identity crisis for some people who have always been considered ""smart"" and now question whether they belong here.

\- Academia is full of very smart workaholics and few workplace boundaries.

\- The power dynamic between PIs and PhD students is outrageously unbalanced. The consequences for abuse of power by a PI are laughable.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are aware of those things and still want to take on the challenge, then go for it. Many people have a positive experience overall (and others don't), but it would be a disservice to lead students to think that a PhD will be enjoyable as long as they like their research topic and they do well in classes.",1667260944

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","I should have elaborated on Whispers more sorry. But its is particularly good on Doctor because you know if Whispers goes off, you know someone is in your terror radius, then use your Static Blast. Its a garunteed way of always landing at least one survivor with madness when you use your Static Blast.   
As for Sloppy, it will always probably be viable to some degree. Can't really complain about healing taking longer, especially if you already have slowdown in your basekit, which Doctor does indeed have. Imagine survivors taking 25 seconds to heal, almost done almost done almost done, then they get blasted into Madness 3 and have to snap out of it before finishing their healing. And now you know where they are, and you can smack them again before they can even remotely finish healing, and thus they wasted all that time trying to heal.   


So yes, I think they are still great perks on Doctor specifically. The reason Whispers is now so under the radar is because there are like 4000 other, better aura reading perks out there that just completely overshadow it.",1667260944

Numbers divisible by 5 are intended to be major cross-country routes.

An odd first (hundreds) digit indicates a spur (I-196 is the spur that connects from I-96 to Holland), while an even first digit connects to an interstate on both ends as a loop or bypass connector (I-496 connects I-69 and I-96 through Lansing).",1667260945

**AITA for telling my wife, she only had her self to blame for my mothers actions.**

Hi there everyone. I never thought I’d be asking strangers online for an opinion but here we are. 

I’m Rod (35M) and my wife is Cat (26F). Also involved are my parents, Cat’s parents and our son Jack (16 Months) 

A bit of background. 
So my mother can be a bit overbearing. Because of this her and Cat have always clashed. My mother has strong opinions on what’s best and I’ve often had to ask Cat to let the little things go and compromise. 

Cat is no contact with her family. She hasn’t seen or spoken to them in 6 years. They weren’t at our wedding they have never met my son. I do know the reasons but Cat is insistent my mother not be told.

My mother doesn’t approve of Cats non relationship with her family. She believes Cat doesn’t know what it means to be a mother if she can so callously abandon her own. 

Cat also won’t let my mother be alone with Jack. Anytime my mother comes to visit Cat will not leave them alone. I do believe this is disrespectful. 

I convinced Cat yesterday to let my mother babysit. An hour is all I asked for give us some time to go get coffee and be a couple. She reluctantly agreed. However, when we got home, we walked in on my mother video calling Cats family. Apparently my mother has been in touch for a while and secretly sending them photos of my son along with our address and wedding photos.

Cat was furious. She demanded my mother leave instantly and told her she was never welcome in our house or near my son again. My mother left, but not before telling me to fix this and Cat was over reacting. I told Cat that my mother was simply trying to help And she didn’t have a right to ban her from our home or my son. Cat lost it and told me she had been dealing with my mother’s disrespect for years, but she would not allow her to put Jack in the middle. 

I got angry, and told her this never would have happened if she had simply told my mother the truth, and she is the one who chose to make things harder for herself. She has nobody to blame for my mother getting in touch but herself

Cat walked away and began packing some things for her and Jack . I kept talking, and she just ignored me as though I wasn’t there. She didn’t say another word to me until she was at the door before telling me she wanted a divorce and leaving. 

She’s been gone all day and I haven’t heard anything except for a text saying that they made it safely to her friends house and we would talk more on Wednesday. 

Am I truly the asshole here? My mother shouldn’t of gotten in touch but she had no right to be as disrespectful as she was. Is this really divorce worthy?


Edit. Since everyone seems to need to know this. My mother did not know why Cat was no contact and did not see it as a big deal. I have since called her a few hours after Cat left and told her the full story of why Cat reacted as she did and is no contact. She feels absolutely terrible about her behavior and wishes she had known sooner. But that was a decision Cat made

EDIT- CAT WAS NOT ABUSED SEVERELY. HER PARENTS ARE SEVERELY RELIGIOUS IN A SMALL COMMUNITY AND WANTED CAT MARRIED AT 18 WITH AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE TO A KNOWN FRIEND OF THEIRS AND HERS. SHE WASN’T TORTURED OR ABUSED.

[Message from Dr Jordan Peterson](https://jordanbpeterson.com/contact/): For the last year, I have been receiving hundreds of emails a week comments, thanks, requests for help, invitations and (but much more rarely) criticisms. It has proved impossible to respond to these properly. That’s a shame, and a waste, because so many of the letters are heartfelt, well-formulated, thoughtful and compelling. Many of them are as well — in my opinion — of real public interest and utility. People are relating experiences and thoughts that could be genuinely helpful to others facing the same situations, or wrestling with the same problems. 

For this reason, as of May 2018, a public forum for posting letters and receiving comments has been established at the subreddit. If you use the straightforward form at that web address to submit your letter, then other people can benefit from your thoughts, and you from their responses and votes. I will be checking the site regularly and will respond when I have the time and opportunity.

**Anyone who replies to this letter should remember Rule 2: Keep submissions and comments civil. Moderators will be enforcing this rule more seriously in [Letter] threads.**

However three judges that were assigned along with the two wrongly assigned ones did had their terms over, and should have stayed. What PiS did, was throw out ALL of the judges - even those who were assigned properly - and placed their own judges instead for all five places. This was directly against the law.

Then I didn't feel allowed to those same feelings (which I wouldn't have, totally a secure poly kind of person) when women were brought up. Double standard bs if you ask me.

Edit: Not to say having preferences and limits isn't fine, but it was the reasoning why that felt misogynistic.

"APlagueTale","t5_3lwti","I would definitely recommend playing Innocence before diving into Requiem, but if you just wanna play Requiem, here are short answers. Obviously, Innocence spoilers ahead.

The Prima Macula is basically an ancient gene that is passed down through many generations, including the De Rune bloodline. It is usually dormant, but can awaken in a child early in their life. That is what happened to Hugo. To answer your other question on why Alicia barely saw Hugo: Beatrice (Hugo’s and Amicia’s mother) is an alchemist. When she discovered the Macula in Hugo, she started working with other alchemists (including some from The Order) to try to slow down its progress or even find a cure. She had to isolate Hugo because he was sick (Now that I think about it, I don’t really remember the exact reason he had to be isolated). That’s why Alicia barest saw him or her mother. 

The Inquisition is pretty much the same as the historical Inquisition, but their leader is aware of the Macula and somehow found out that Hugo is the carrier. He sent his forces to retrieve him with the goal of injecting himself with his blood to try to also become a carrier and control the plague (no idea how any of that works, they don’t really explain it). This also explains what went wrong. The Inquisition attacked the De Rune estate, killed Amicia’s father and their servants, and took Beatrice captive. Amicia’s and Hugo escaped and went to search for Laurentius, another alchemist who helped Beatrice study Hugo’s condition.

Lucas was Laurentius’s apprentice. He was somewhat familiar with the Macula and joined Amicia and Hugo when Laurentius died as a result of a rat attack. Lucas stuck with them throughout their entire journey and helped keep Hugo alive and slow down the Macula. Besides Hugo, you can say that Lucas is Amicia’s closest friend.

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any more questions. Have fun with the game)",1667260947

we were able to back calculate the geolocation  of ground objects to within 5 meters from 4500 feet altitude.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yes, it's either a ""false flag"", a cover up story or some deeper conspiracy, and with the underlying goal to deny what's evident and detract from the truth because these people ultimately feel threatened by what that truth reveals and recognizes. Theyre too insecure, fragile and obstinate to acknowledge the reality of the situation.

It's convenient isn't it? Right wing political violence can just be declared a scheme perpetrated by some deep state actor, some radical enemy or sinister organization. 

It's either that or these hopeless fanatics fixate on some arbitrary detail, latching onto whatever they can, eager to consume any piece of misinformation shared online that helps confirm their preconceived notions. They'll run with anything, it doesn't matter how demonstrably false it may be, as long as it validates their beliefs. Once they have that validation, a conspiracy forms around it, a popular narrative of a cover up story or one that accuses the victim, the media, the FBI, what have you, of lying. The victim in this case becomes the target of needless ire, scorn and scrutiny, it's absurd.

What's more, these methods in turn help these self obsessed nutjobs establish *themselves* as the victims in all of this, at the center of some grand conspiracy no less, in on the secret, the truth, ever-persecuted by their would-be oppressors, their globalist or elitist overlords, the ""mainstream media"", the cruel, draconian agencies and organizations of the world.

In situations like these, they're incapable of accepting a reality where the simplest explanation challenges the very spirit of their ideology, where it seeks some accountability, where the truth may even dismantle or threaten their identity. 

It exposes the risks associated with belonging to or identifying with their party or their group, their ideology and culture even, revealing the instability of it, the fanaticism and extremism, the delusion, psychosis and derangement that can breed and grow as a result of their assimilation. 

While there's also this sort of demand that someone or something be held accountable, and these people go to great lengths to evade any sort of accountability, often resorting to things like victim blaming and gaslighting, conspiracies and rationalizations that attempt to convey how *they're* the wounded party, *they're* the victims, ruthlessly oppressed and maligned to no end.",1667260948

husband is the bigger AH though. as you said, he KNEW why they didnt speak, and didnt tell his mother that there was a good reason. he didnt have to go into detail, all he had to say was that theyre no contact for a good reason, and she should respect that. wtf is she doing contacting the family? for all she knew, they could be rapists or kidnappers. theyd never see that kid again if shit went seriously wrong. mum really didnt consider the possible consequences.",1667260948

1. He took the case because it was originally explicitly only looking at where the line be drawn. Roe is made up of two major parts - the first being abortions are protected as a constitutional right and the second being a line for when it stops being protected. They explicitly said they weren't looking for a ruling on if abortions are constitutionally protected and are only focused on the line part. 

2. After taking the case, they requested to change and evaluate if abortions are constitutionally protected. The SC took a vote on if they would accept that change and they voted in favor. 

It's disgusting that such a subversive thing happened at the highest level of the law and the result was the stripping of privacy rights for millions of Americans.",1667260950

Em geral essas propostas terminam com uma polícia que é longe de misteriosa. Meramente a Polícia Militar se torna parte do aparato do Exército e o trabalho de policiamento da sociedade civil é feito pelas polícias Civil, Estadual e Federal. Esse é o funcionamento na maior parte das democracias ocidentais, nós só usamos a PM dessa forma como herança da ditadura militar, e não por menos quando teve os projetos de afastar os policiais militares com mais interações violentas (muitos dos quais eventualmente foram presos por fazer parte de milícias na época da CPI das Milícias) temporariamente para entender o motivo dessas interações violentas, os comandantes da PM fizeram barulho pra matar o projeto. Diga-se de passagem, nas democracias ocidentais o padrão é afastar o policial em TODA interação violenta, a PM do Brasil que é essa loucura do cara ter 10, 15 interações violentas por mês e continuar na rua.",1667260950

Guardians 1 was good. Guardians 2 was basically the worst MCU film when it was released and is only not the absolute worst one because they have done worse since.

But most of all- I alreqdy watched Guardians 1. I don't ever need to watch another James Gunn movie because I get it- I saw the only joke he knows. If I want to spend 3 hours watching a James Gunn joke I already saw I will just watch Guardians 1 again.",1667260951

Ludwig's video had the same issues when talking about missing functionality like lack of a free chat when vtubers have already figured out workarounds for that with far in the future scheduled streams.  Same with emotes and memberships that don't rely on extensions, which the 6 or so Twitch refugees don't take advantage of.

Comp’s structure before they gutted it was not that bad. The problem was the casual pve goblins on this game cries incessantly that they weren’t able to easily acquire excellent loot that was primarily meant for PvP and had the bonus of being good pve weapons.

Comp’s current state is directly a result of pve goblins not accepting that if they can’t achieve something, they don’t get the reward

I have EVERY desirable piece of loot from pve sources, but let’s say I didn’t. Let’s say I sucked so badly at GMs that I just couldn’t get adept palindromes, or atleast not consistently get them as a farm. I would, personally, accept that I just don’t have the skill or experience at the time to be able to acquire that piece of pve source loot.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; First you're not talking about rationality. You're talking about transitivity, which yes, is included in the definition of rationality.

I am talking about rationality. Rationality in Economics is defined to always be transitive.

&gt; Experiments have shown non-transitivity, but that does not contradict theory, because the comparison of two states of the world in itself alters the composition of those two states;

Which clearly demonstrates that Economics is not a Science as it rejects empirical evidence.

&gt;  in other words you're not seeing X &gt; Y and Y &gt; Z but Z &gt; X. You're seeing Z2 &gt; X2.

This is incoherent. I prefer tea to coffee and I prefer coffee to coke but I prefer coke to tea. Clearly my preference is not a transitive relation; escaping the relation by changing a subscript does no work it simply ends up in an infinite regress. That infinite regress requires a relation to be framed and then the framing to be framed' and the framing' to be framed'' - which simply creates a regression to rescue the imposition of transivity. 

&gt; Finally, most of modern economics is not dependent on neoclassical micro theory, so going from criticisms of rationality to saying that economics is a pseudoscience is a logical leap.

No. It is a valid conclusion. If you claim it is a logical leap you need to evidence the logical gap over which your claim applies. I have claimed that Economics, as a whole, does no apply Scientific Method. That claim is applied to *all* of Economics not *some* of Economics. 

Framing something as ""micro-"" or ""macro-"" simply demonstrates how internally incoherent Economics is as a Science. It is the same rhetorical technique as was used to impose transivity onto a non transitive relation. It is perfectly reasonable to call Economics a moral philosophy but Economics lack the applied disciplines of Scientific Method so it is unreasonable to call it a Science. Framing is a repetitive technique of Economics, entailed by the enforcement of transivity, and that leads to the recognition that Economics, when examined as a hermeneutic is pseudoscience. How 'modern' the 'theory' is happens to be a red herring.

&gt; You have also not understood my point about the poor model selection. I've explained it in more detail in the other comment.

Again: no. The Models at issue are frequently not 'poor' but 'wrong'. The tendency of Economics to reject actual behaviour in preference for a Model and then to reverse engineer a narrative that says people deviate from the model. The Model gets 'reframed' - perfectly reasonable for some approaches to Moral Philosophy but not for a Science. The model should be dumped yet persists and that persistence is not accidental but active and central.

Unlike Science, Economics rarely has much awareness of what the fundamental definitions in use are and that reflects in the garbled accounts given of the relationships of Economics to, say Game Theory. Game Theory has useful things to say in, for example, Biology (Evolutionary Stable Strategies). Those useful things get borne out experimentally. A lot of those Biology results contradict the unevidenced claims of Economic Models in which p-hacking has given an attractive looking result that is irreplicable. So, your point about poor model selection is largely a point about defending selection of models from a range of poor models.

Your explanation in the other comment rather suggests you have little understanding of what Scientific Models and Scientific Theories, in fact, are. Economists regularly 'critique' other Fields and expect to be taken seriously when they do. For example, there is a whole field of ""Health Economics"" in which there is a founding assumption that we participate in *""the production and consumption of health and healthcare""* which is a highly ridiculous assumption that assumes health is a transaction. Treating Health as a transaction seems of incredibly limited explanatory power until you realise that it is not about explanation but about accommodation: health economics is about accommodating healthcare to economic models.


Your comments about STEM superiority complexes seem out of place, but does show something important about Economics: it fails to address fundamental issues of science. In Science, a failed theory gets a lot of examination to work out how it fails while, in Economics it is simply restructured in terms of the rhetoric surrounding the same model. Which is reasonable process in Moral Philosophy but not Science.

Finally: if there is no connection between micro- and macro- economics then there is a huge failure of the subject as a whole. So, it might actually be fairer to say Economics is inchoate or incoherent rather than being kind and calling it pseudoscience.",1667260953

Klar, in den 90ern war Klimawandel auch schon ein Thema aber weit weniger präsent (vom Ozonloch und Rodung des Regenwaldes mal abgesehen). In den 90ern und damit vor dem Internet war der Zugang zu solchen Informationen auch wesentlich schwieriger. Heute kann sich jede Hausfrau über den Klimawandel informieren. Damals musste man Fachliteratur kaufen… also es aktiv wollen und vielleicht sogar Geld rein stecken.

Gehen meine Eltern gegen den Klimawandel auf die Straße? Nein. Aber sie haben zumindest begriffen was für ein großes Problem das ist und dass das Thema angegangen werden muss. 

Wenn sich Leute jetzt aber an Wände oder Straßen kleben und Kultur mit Suppe verschandeln weckt das nicht wirklich viel Sympathie.

F2F war der bessere Weg um etwas zu bewegen. Das was die Aktivisten da gemacht haben schadet der Sache hingegen nur, weil es die eigentliche Sache diskreditiert. Der Klimawandel ist eine schlimme Sache und objektiv kann man nur schwer gegen Maßnahmen dagegen argumentieren (alles was den Klimawandel stoppt / verlangsamt ist gut). Wenn man mit solchen Aktionen aber einen Nebenschauplatz auf macht kann man von der eigentlichen Sache ablenken… denn Kunst und Kultur zu zerstören ist ebenfalls etwas was man nicht schön reden kann.

It is fundamentally a ""for want of a nail"" story. Instead of marrying Dursley, Aunt Petunia marries a university professor, and Harry ends up in an actually loving home instead of living in a closet. He's raised as a rationalist, which colors how he ends up interacting with the wizarding world, and results in a lot of changes to the plot.

There are a few other differences to the setting than that, most notably the nature of Voldemort has to be changed in order to make him an effective foil to rationalist!Harry, but most of the differences from canon are the result of falling dominoes from that one change at the start.

And despite the story's length, it only covers year one.",1667260954

Edit just to be clear: yes, this is MORE than worthy of a divorce. Your mom did something that she should’ve known could put your child at risk because her emotions about family came first, and you blamed your wife for your mom’s selfish and dangerous actions instead of acknowledging that she’s an adult who can think for herself.",1667260955

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

- Wrapping up really warm, especially my chest (usually wearing a giant scarf)

"medical","t5_2r1b9","""Sore stiff neck"" is unfortunately a red flag - meningitis or encephalomeningitis can present with fever, feeling ill, and a 'stiff neck'. Some forms can progress rapidly and result in death (ie bacterial meningitis). Some persons with a viral syndrome can have what is called 'meningismus' which means having symptoms of meningitis without an actual infection of the meninges, so having fever and a stiff neck does not always spell doom. But how can you or some random person on the internet know what is happening to YOU?

So: go to the ER or urgent care. This is the only legitimate advice 'the internet' can give to a person with a fever , headache, and sore stiff neck!!",1667260956

I don’t remember everything ofc cause I was in 8th grade. But all I remember in the end was this poor kids parents took him out of the school to an expensive private school. The teacher had to move to another state. And then in the end, it turns out he doesn’t even know the actually know the national anthem. I threw this book in the trash it was so bad. I should have burned it. I’m so angry just talking about it it was so bad!

"Denmark","t5_2qjto","&gt;Ingen opfølgende spørgsmål omkring hvordan skattelettelser er bedre for inflationen

Det emne er blevet debatteret til døde allerede. Svaret er at skattelettelser ikke puster til inflationen i økonomien generelt, så længe de finansieres ved et nedsat forbrug i det offentlige af tilsvarende størrelse.

I felt so bad for him because he was so excited he was checking the door and the mailbox every other hour poor love :( it was very cute though. We got it through Amazon, and they made us wait until this morning to see if the courier could re-deliver it (somehow??); this has not happened, so we can finally mark it as lost package 😰 hopefully wherever you got bayonetta from will be more helpful and you'll get to play yourself soon!! 💚 so nice that you can watch your friend's playthrough in the meantime!",1667260958

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/felixmontoya92.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

About fanbases in particular, there's an overlap. As far as I've seen, most Fantasy fans are 40k fans as well, but most 40k fans aren't into Fantasy. To use your example, it's like having one group that only likes french fries, and another, smaller one that's okay with fries but prefers baked potatoes - so you, the only guy who sells potatoes in town, turn all potatoes into french fries because that makes you more money, and no one gets to eat baked potatoes ever again.",1667260958

"LessCredibleDefence","t5_2yyyd","&gt;  Also, the B-21 procurement numbers seem fairly low, as it might take over 1000 B-21s to launch enough missiles to saturate the air defenses of a Chinese battlegroup.

No, its even worse than that. 

Each HHQ-9B is capable of taking out multiple LRASMS assuming the Chinese have put a gun on it, and of course the Imperial Super Badass Dragon Army Forever has done just that. 

They can fly out, and shoot down all the LRASMS, with just one HHQ-9B, but why stop there? 

Why not just use China's miraculous technology to send the HHQ-9B at the 1000 B-21 raiders? It can shoot those down as well. Surely if the Imperial Super Badasss Dragon Army Forever can survive an attack from 1000 B-21s (realistically, as you say 2000-3000) then they can turn their HHQ-9B on the B-21s that started the attack, humiliating the American imperialists with Chinese super tech. 

After that, the HHQ-9B will likely have lots of ammo left, and so it can move on to the American Carrier Battle Groups. The US will launch missiles, but after defeating all of the LRASMS and the B-21s that launched them, surely the HHQ-9B can easily solo the entire US Carrier Battlegroup for the Imperial Super Badass Dragon Army Forever. 

After that, why not fly on to the US mainland and punish the Americans for their impudence? The HHQ-9B can knock on people's doors, wait in the bushes for them to come out, and shoot them dead - American Imperialist Dogs. 

It can then upload the video to Weibu for the Chinese people to watch and be entertained. 

Then after wiping out the entire US mainland, the HHQ-9B can return to its Type055 destroyer, and land safely back in its vertical launch tube, having accomplished its mission.",1667260959

"solotravel","t5_2rxxm","I suggest you do what I do: Plan some solo travels, plan some friend travels, and plan some family travels -- all separate. So, plan a trip with your friends (it doesn't have to be far, etc.) but book the solo trip for yourself afterwards as the ""timing was right and the deal couldn't be beat"" so you want to go as this is the season it's best to go. If they want to join you on the originally planned solo trip too, great! If not -- too bad, you got a good deal and you're taking it.

This way everyone gets to travel and not feel left out and you don't miss out on anything yourself. If anyone gets grumpy, just tell them that if you keep waiting on people/good deals for everyone/right timing for everyone/etc., you'll never see shit.

Tell them also you have a goal to country/state count (it doesn't have to be true but it establishes that you have a goal not many folks can attain). This way when you go out solo... well, you're hitting your goals of seeing stuff on your bucket list whether or not they come.

Good luck!",1667260959

It takes so much strength to go no contact with your family, and such extreme lengths is only done when there’s definitely a deserving reason. If your mother had half a brain she would know that. And you’re such an asshole for saying it’s Cat’s fault she didn’t share the reasons why with your mom. She doesn’t owe anybody the private details of her life and trauma. Also the fact that you’ve been consistently taking your mothers side for years (I.e. your sentence about making Cat compromise) instead of backing up your wife and setting boundaries.

First of all, it is none of your mother’s business why Cat is NC with her family. And Cat was right to think she couldn’t trust your mother with this information. 

Second, how DARE you take your mother’s side in this. Cat has been asking you for years apparently to have her back and you have consistently told her to just let it go. She has asked you and your mother to respect her boundaries and you just trounced ALL over them. 

Finally, did you just say in the edit that you told your mom why Cat is NC with her family?!?!?! YOU STILL DON’T GET IT?!?! That is NOT your information to share!

I hope she sees this and screenshots it for her divorce attorney.

They don't actually care about these things one bit, they just want them packaged and sold to them as entertainment. 

It's why they'll recognize some forms of oppression like jews under World War 2, but not others, like queer and black people in the 70s. One is sufficiently abstract and removed from their own lives so they never have to do anything aside from consume the story, the other is still very much relevant today and might force them to come to terms with some ugly truths about themselves and their place in the world.

"Cubers","t5_2r6a3","I’m somewhat middle age so I’m still pretty decent when it comes to learning new algs (in comparison to kids here I’m still very old). I find that my brain has adjusted to cubing and I can pick up algs much faster now than when I first started about a year ago. Like having know a bunch of finger tricks and triggers really helps. But at the same time it’s gotten me confused and I’ve been doing the wrong algs for a few of the OLL cases I learnt recently but haven’t properly consolidated yet. I’m left with 4 algs to learn for OLL. I did spend many weekends and leave days on doing nothing but cube though. I think what really helps me is cubing on the commute to work and back every weekday. Like yesterday was Monday, and I’d spent my weekend doing skewb and pyraminx and didn’t touch the 3x3. First solve on Monday and I encountered the newish OLL and I was cursing because I’d forgotten the alg again. Had to look up the screenshot for the answer… 

Slowly it does! You’ll definitely improve at your own pace as you practice, but ultimately always have fun. If possible try to say spend 5-10 mins each day just doing the new algs you learned once or twice, and then another 5-10 minutes doing a few solves to keep your brain fresh on f2l recognition and such. There was a period of time when I only learned algs and didn’t solve at all, and my f2l recognition etc definitely decreased. 

I’m getting like 25-35 second solves now, I get a bit irked when it’s not sub 30 now but since I mostly only cube on the commute I hardly do timed solves (most weekends these days aren’t spent cubing). Untimed solves really helps since I don’t feel the pressure to do thing quickly but instead I’m trying to properly recognise my f2l pieces and do fewer U moves… all the best and have fun!",1667260964

"Kingdom","t5_2sl0d","Much of your frustration comes from treating Riboku's every line of dialogue as his ""accurate"" assessment of Kanki's capability and vice versa. Rather, much of the dialogue reflects these two being somewhat vain and prideful individuals, believing their respective plan is foolproof; Riboku thinks as long as he plans out every small details then he'll win (shown in ch. 702); Kanki always tries to find a way to throw off generals trained in conventional warfare and goad them into doing something reckless and unfamiliar, as trying to one-up Kanki somehow. 

The dynamic between these two is like that of Zhuge Liang and Sima Yi(though I would say Yi had no shame/pride at all, while Liang suffered from extreme saviour complex believing he is the only one that can save Han). Although many assert Liang as the greatest political and military mind at the time, I personally view Yi as the greater of the two. For example, when Liang sent a dress to Yi in an attempt to provoke him to come out from the fort, Yi simply donned on the dress, paraded himself on the wall of the fort and thanked Liang for the ""beautiful"" dress, thus pissing off Liang.

But some part 25 transport catagory jets? A CRJ-200 for example? The min maneuvering speed FLAPS FULL can be near **150-160 knots** , and at least where I worked it was 1000ft stable unless doing a actual instrument circling approach maneuver. *Meaning, you need to do a 4ish mile final at a minimum, and plenty of people would do 4-6ish.*

So all that screwing around and you are zipping around at 160kt 500ft above piston aircraft(or zero ft above if they are 500 ft above pattern altitude themselves as many do to cross over the field) and you are still doing a 4-6 mile final. What is the point?

It's safer and easier for everyone involved in that type of jet to communicate on CTAF early and land ASAP to screw up the pattern the least amount of times.

You would either have to work for a very large company with an exquisite territory, perhaps in a unionized position, or for an iconic book that makes sales very easy due to the desirability of the wines and does not flood the market with reps. I have known wine sales people in two of the last three companies I was working on who were making $300-$400k per year. That said, the commission rates are being slashed in many parts of the industry making this very rare, so it is very hard to find the dream gig where you can get to this level. 

I’m not quite to the $300k level but I will probably get there in a few years, so it is still possible, but I’m guessing only in global cities with immense wine consumption. But generally you can’t get the dream job that pays in that bracket without either a very high level of industry connections or a wealth of experience and knowledge of fine wine, and generally both. 

Also note that commission rates on fine wine sales generally stretch from 4.5 to 10 percent of total sold, with some companies having complicated bonus structures that inhibit your ability to make the numbers required to get a particular rate—shitty corporate bros siphon off value wherever they can at big companies and hand it off to generally inept and overpaid managers. 

Also think about the numbers. You have to sell 3 million per year to make 165k per year with a 5.5 percent commission rate. If your commission rate is 8.5%, you would only have to sell just under 2 million to make the same, but if you sold 3 million at that rate you would get $255k. So there are a lot of factors at play. 

I don’t have any experience in bottle sales, so I couldn’t tell you about those other sides of the industry.",1667260966

That said, it seems like you’re the type of person/player who feels a certain way about bending the rules. My advice to you is to keep your main character/playthrough completely clean. Even though certain things like gathering extra mats for whatever are a bit of a chore, you’ll feel fulfilled and a bit of pride for having done those things without cheating.

And, if you want to explore what you can accomplish with console commands, then make a new seed and new character and go wild.

I AM DESPERATE TO READ ANY BOOK YOU WILL WRITE. you will hit the nail on the head in terms what i want to know and need to know.

for the purpose of my gay writing. and i know it could be fetishizing. but one character must be a solidified gay identity. his trial and tribulations must be based in a stereotypified gay community existence. the gay bars and the promiscuous gay sex and it all. I will exemplify these stereotypes to a frightening degree of gay pop culture and visible recognition. The other romantic lead will be the bi guy. A WORLDLY GUY. He does the woman and the boys and the men. I NEED THIS OTHER CHARACTER to complete the main gay character. His social scene is way different than that of the mono gay.

The reason the two connect is sex. Physical sex. The unison of their bodies. But also the romantic. And this is why I asked the question ... what is the difference between biromantic and bisexualism. Bisexualism implies for the connection of bodies regardless of the sex. It was the biromantic that I was truly interested in.  TWO MEN THAT LOVE EACH OTHER. Even though physically their camps can be different and even in contrast.

This is what Ellis did... I think Pia did a version of it too. Now Vlatko's doing it. He talked such a big game about brining more players in and rotating more but he gets in and nope, I'm just going to start running people into the ground.

There's all kinds of research about cognitive biases in decision making and biases of omission vs commission. We need sport psychs for the coaches not just the players. It's probably even more important for the coaches than the players because the coaches' decisions create ripples of downstream effects. We simply do not make good decisions under stress. We simply do not make good decisions with our amygdalas.

We can keep blaming individuals (in Jill Ellis's case, I'm probably okay with that) but at a certain point, we have to look at the patterns and say, ""huh, maybe there's something happening here that is causing these very different people to make similar decisional errors.""

Not nessarly, you can drive across the border, do your shopping and head back same day and get counted and as I read somewhere currently something like 80% of Malaysians are coming across the land border and most of those never go further than Hat Yai and would say its closer to 100% of the Laos and Cambodians and their respective  areas

&gt;but that's not what the ""tourist arrivals"" number measures.

Government has gone back to calling them ""tourist arrivals"" instead of just arrivals, they had stopped that pre covid because they were getting called out constantly specifically because of those 3.

Really these numbers are pretty disastrous , top 5 are circa 40% of total, 3 out top 5 are not really tourists (two have  very low incomes, Vientiane, richest part of Laos is just on average $350 per month, rest of Laos is even lower, Cambodia even lower again, so even if they were tourists most will not be spending much).

 With number 5 (Singapore) being at the 365k arrivals, it means markets like Korea,  Japan (circa 2 million each pre covid), Hong Kong (circa 1 million pre covid), Russia (1.5 million pre covid), USA (over 1 million pre covid), UK, France, Germany (all just under million each pre covid) , Aus (800k pre covid)  and China (11 million pre covid) are all under that 365k ( so between 65% to 85% down for each example, not including chinese)  and those are the main markets that built and sustained the tourist industy here for decades, not the top 5 listed (for good reason you don't see in tourist provinces menus/signs in Lao/Cambodians or Malay)

While on one hand TAT are trying to put lipstick on a pig with these misleading headline numbers, they are for good reason [extending stimulus /subsidy  programs like ""we travel together"" yet again](https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/2418418/tat-prepares-new-phase-of-subsidies), but even those seem to be running out of takers as most thais have either used up their holiday (or money) or are now traveling abroad again",1667260967

It also helps to practice normal speech too, read something out loud and go deeper until you like what you hear. How you speak also matters a lot, maybe its different in France but in my country men speak quite monotone and if you don't do that you sound more feminine, that's another thing I had to practice.

If request is granted via the returned policy, the request is then passed to the API endpoint integration - which sounds like another Lambda function in your scenario.  That Lambda needs to have a Role configured for it where the trust policy allows AssumeRole to the Lambda service, and a permission policy that provides grants to the DynamoDB table.

Basically, don't conflate the policy returned by the authorizer with the one used by the back-end Lambda.

Ringed Knight gear:

&gt;The arms of early man were forged in the Abyss

The abyss likely predates Manus' transformation.

Follower Torch:

&gt;Some forms the Abyss manifests as pus within the body

Any human soul, given the right conditions can succumb to the Abyss and undergo a grotesque transformation.

Soul of Manus:

&gt;Ancient Manus was clearly once human. But he became the Father of the Abyss after his humanity went wild, eternally seeking his precious broken pendant.

Manus only became a monster after he was driven insane by the people of Oolacile, his humanity became the Abyss once his obsession became his sole occupying thought. I believe a similar process happens to the Pus of Man we see in Dark Souls 3, they are so devoted to usher in an age of dark, or are in so much pain that their humanity goes berserk, turning them into monsters. Perhaps Gundyr was also so desperate to find his fire keeper, that he too transformed. And Wolnir's fall to the Abyss was his desire to escape death.

Manus' transformation was so much more disastrous because he was a primeval man, perhaps a Pygmy Lord, or the Furtive Pygmy himself. His humanity was simply was more powerful, and why I believe the Abyss is more of a present danger in Dark Souls 1.",1667260968

Can you cite a few technological ""solutions"" which haven't* also delivered  several negatives?

Yes, agriculture has been a serious mistake with deep problems - and the eradication of technology will greatly limit how severely we suffer for it. I.e., if people want to plant seeds or run ploughs pulled by oxen, that may be preventable (or it may not) but it is a world away from the drones and harvesters and processing mills and transport networks and oversight agencies and pesticides and fertilizers of the modern technological system. So the elimination of modern technology will hit at agriculture to a significant degree, but it is not necessary to fully prevent small-scale gardening/horticulture by eliminating rakes and trowels.",1667260969

Her and Jess didn't keep in touch that much. Also her previous relationship with Jess was toxic, but the Lorelai and Luke relationship wasn't. If anything the guy Rory consistently kept in touch with was Logan. But why does she have to be like her mom, can't she just get a new guy?

whos talking about that? Lmao, you're just making arguments up at this point.

I said ""its intrinsic value goes down which directly correlates with its value when displaying it in public.""

Why do you think people buy expensive af watches or cars or a lot of other nonsense? Not because they need a more accurate timepiece or because they need to get from A to B at 150 mph, but because they are expensive displays of wealth and success, they are flexing.

* If you are getting a message that says ""Please Wait"" before you can commment that is Reddit that is slowing down how often you post.  We cannot control this, all you can do is wait until Reddit will let you comment.  This is especially bad on the Reddit app for mobile, but again we can't fix Reddit's issues.

Hey /u/selenekiiss,

Your submission was removed per Rule 12:

&gt;####RULE #12 - NO UNVERIFIED CLAIMS OF OC

&gt;* Don't claim to be in the image unless you actually are in the image and can verify with us.

&gt;* Don't claim to know someone in the image unless you can verify permission to post the image.

[Please message the Moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpelfie&amp;subject=Verification+Request) with proof that:

`A.  You are actually the girl in this image`

#**-or-**

`B. You can verify that you have the girl's permission to post this image.`

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/pelfie/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of yourself, from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/pelfie written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

The photo does not have to be artsy or nude, but please show as much of you as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to post your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude/semi-nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

Only problem is they have no grip in wet conditions and can cause unwanted slides if carving too sharp.

&gt; I have a very simple plan, go in a very slow pace and do not move forward until I understand the concepts very clearly.

This is critical. Too many are all about the ""it took me X hours to complete this part, I'm gonna go faster on the next one"". Good developers have firm foundations. Don't skip understanding the early stuff in an eagerness to get to the 'real programming'.",1667260974

Those who defend Sakura say that to bring Ino down because she surpassed Sasuke in the end. The reason why Ino paired with Sai was because he was the only one left there and her fans started pairing her up with Sai since he called her ""beautiful"". The other Ino pairing that was popular was Inoshika but Shikamaru was going to finish Temari.  
Even the narrative of Ino's father (written by Kishimoto) makes it clear that Ino places his ties to Sakura, Shikamaru, Choji, and Azuma above his infatuation with Sasuke.  
Another clearer fact that surpassed the crush was when Ino showed romantic interest in any cute boy besides Sasuke like Naruto, Sai and Neji. Ino said that he could have fallen in love with Naruto, even though he didn't look like Sasuke.

"lastcloudia","t5_uc07t","Finish:

* Adel (your biggest physical DPS, fire &amp; light elements)
* Virgil (no-attribute physical DPS in case of high elemental resists)
* SRoland (light physical DPS, can serve as healer and damage mitigation in harder content as well)
* Maja - You will need a mage to clear some content and he's one of the best available - covers all elements in his ability board except dark.
* V - he does things in the game no one else can applying ailments with incredible speed crippling bosses that aren't immune.  He can also have infinite MP with Goddess Kiss and becomes a crazy SCT battery if you have and of the SCT recovery skills from collabs.

Other considerations:

* SGorm and/or Murren - if you want make your life easier in arena.
* Yashamaru - for item stealing, if you want to try to squeeze extra items from quests like the Grand Ability Gates, investing in him can pay off over the long term.
* Warlock Leena - You'll want to pick up SMTheria from a selector at some point down the road as you lack a dedicated support/healer.  It really isn't necessary to have one except for the most difficult content but Warlock Leena can be a very good one after her E5 unlock.

Long term:

* Mayly - Ailment and Light DPS will pair great with V, but you already have 2 top Light DPS in Adel and Roland so not a priority persay.
* GALukiel - Can be one of the most broken units in the game especially if you have the Great War of Ruin Ark, but takes a lot of building and investment.",1667260977

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA - the only person to blame here is your mother

Well your mother and you 

Your mother isn’t entitled to know why Cat isn’t contact with her family, all she needs to do is respect cats decision

Your mother is the one interfering and sticking her nose where it’s not welcome

And your enabling it

It’s clear your wife has a clear picture of your mother and your blinded by love and affection 

It’s cats private business and your mother had no right to interfere

Congrats, you destroyed your marriage because you are incapable of supporting your wife from your mothers overbearing actions

Again, your mother had no reason nor right ti know why Cat wasn’t in touch with her family

What she should have done is respect that, instead of getting stuck in

It’s all well and good her regretting it now, but she wouldn’t have to regret it if she hadn’t involved herself in the first place

Your mother needs to learn to back off and stop being overbearing and nosey

And you need to learn to support your partner

Maybe next time you won’t excuse your mothers behaviour so much and actually set boundaries

Edit: christ reading your replies and you just don’t get it, you destroyed your marriage and seriously, and negativity, affected your sons life and your still trying to blame your wife for your mothers actions. She didn’t need to know the story, she just had to respect cats choice and you had to back your wife up and set boundaries with your mother 

I hope you and your mother are happy, neither one do you knows how to set or respect boundaries and you just ruined your own life and your sons",1667260978

Renting property needs to be about a fair return. Sorry, if there’s no return on that investment, there won’t be rental property. And no, if landlords are gone house prices won’t come down, no if landlords disappear, you won’t be in a better position to buy a house. This is about living wages, this is about affordable down payments. But landlords have nothing to do with this.

This would be an annoying criticism even without knowing this source material but reading Fire &amp; Blood makes it even more mind goggling. 

Not that book Rhaenyra is anything like these two characters but it’s like criticizing Robert Pattinson’s Bruce Wayne for not acting like Tom Holland’s Peter Parker. Milly’s Rhaenyra is not cohesive with the character’s arc or actions. 

Also, D’Arcy is also more traditionally attractive than Rhaenyra is even supposed to be at this point in the story. If they had gotten a plus sized actress that matched book Rhaenyra’s description, there would be even more whining.  Book Rhaenyra is also far more unpleasant to be around, not charismatic at all. There’s no obligation for the character to “stir” anything. She’s not Dany 2.0.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","“Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.”

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; I agree. The cause of the contradiction is capitalism.

No, the causes are land speculation and fractional reserve banking.

&gt; Many libertarians seem to think that free trade benefits everyone and that's evidently not the case.

It does benefit everyone. Trade is always beneficial for both parties.

&gt; I hope you agree with me that if only I reduce prices to have more customers but also need to reduce wages to make profit my workers will just leave so that's not a way to survive the market long term with lower than average profit.

But you're still growing, even if it's slower than others. At which point do you suddenly go bankrupt?

&gt; Exactly. The two are linked but workers wage isn't directly influenced by the immediate revenue or profit of the capitalist. I think we reached a conclusion here.

But why should it be? If the capitalist finds a way to produce something more efficiently, then why would the worker be rewarded for it directly?

&gt; The whole point is that a capitalist can contribute nothing more than the capital itself and makes huge profit without ever working.

The reward is for finding the opportunity and taking the risk.

&gt; While I am a communist and I do believe all value comes from labour risk is a very real thing that must be taken into account.

The three main factors of production are labor, land and capital. Saying all value comes from labor is just straight up wrong and completely ignores the other factors. Risk is a part of the fourth factor of production, which is entrepreneurship. But why do you think that value is not produced by land or capital?

&gt; This is effectively gambling from the point of view of the capitalist and a risk reduction service paid for with part of the wage for a certain period of time from the point of view of the worker.

The capitalist earns a premium over that risk as a reward for taking it. So it's not just gambling.


&gt; This leads me to another famous contradiction in capitalism Marx observed called the tendency of the rates of profits to fall.

The profit only falls to zero if there is nothing left to allocate in the market. In that case it makes sense that there's no reward for it.

&gt; Well we already paid the guy setting up the bisness 10000$ and that's a one time cost that in the beginning will lead to half the profit but long term will practically disappear from the equation. In a few years that salary will have no effect on the average profit of the company. The end results for the two alternative ways of being a capitalist are the same.

Because they both allocated the same amount of resources. Instead of paying a guy to set it up, you could allocate more resources and get a higher reward.

&gt; Where does that extra profit beyond risk compensation comes from if the only extra factor in the equation is the existence of the wage labour of the worker? The obvious answer is that part of the workers labour time is not paid in full.

No, hiring the workers allocates more resources. That's where the extra profit comes from.

&gt; OK so it's not that only land increases its utility from roads but that only landlords benefit from that while in car manufacturing society benefits form the utility of the new cars just as much as the producers, right? I'm not sure that the benefits are equal (I still think the supply side benefits more than the demand) but I see the appeal of the argument.

The roads create an opportunity, which the car manufacturer takes. The profit there comes only from allocating resources to that new opportunity. The fact that the car manufacturer benefits from the road doesn't make the community benefit from it less.",1667260979

"AskWomenOver30","t5_2ya5k","Ugh, what a stressful situation. So sorry you have to deal with that on top of your actual job. I've had similar situations with coworkers minimizing my contributions and it just sucks. Part of the job is now unfortunately fighting to make yourself as visible as possible -- sometimes this means having discussions that might have been 1:1 in a more public setting when possible (group call, Slack channel, etc). If it's appropriate, this can be under the guise of soliciting feedback from the whole team. 

It sounds like this person isn't your supervisor, but more of a peer mentor? If so, make sure your actual supervisor knows exactly how much you contribute -- I like to keep a ""brag doc"" of achievements/good work and regularly share highlights with my manager at 1:1s (which I hope you're having). Handy to pull out at performance review time too!

I'd add that she seemed to play the other wives against each other, and also seemed to triangulate Kody in these conflicts. We'll never know what they spoke about privately, but it did seem that she quickly became his confidante in a way never shared with the other wives.

And that leads me to my vote for root cause of the Robyn-bashing: Kody's favoritism.

Kody favored Robyn from the start.  For example, he often complains about his first three wives in his solo  confessionals, but never Robyn.  Robyn got a nanny even though there were times when the other wives could have really used one. Kody voiced and showed a lot of concern for Robyn's youngest children but nearly killed Truely through medical obliviousness and refused, without a good reason, to accompany Ysabel cross-country for major spine surgery.

Start with adapting The Last Guardian (faithfully preferably, unlike the movie) and then some of the WC2 novels to show the second war.

*Then* bring in Arthas as one of the next generation of Paladins overseen by Uther who would be firmly established for everyone now. Then when Arthas takes his path it has more weight for the people outside of the general fandom.

Wouldn't be hard to work Sylvanas into the Warcraft 2 stuff honestly if you wanted to make that matter more, even though she wasn't invented until later.

Nose piercings in particular also can be perceived as something demeaning, since cattle and horses get nose rings.

I expect that you don't share those thoughts, but your mother has a right to her feelings: if she feels shocked when her beautiful daughter has a piece of metal running through her nose, and has actually chosen it, it's not surprising that she finds this incomprehensible and withdraws from you.

Now, if this piece of metal is really important to you, so that you feel like you can't leave it at home, it might be worth discussing that in therapy.",1667260981

"M1Finance","t5_3pgp6","Slow down and re-read what wrote. If you still don’t see the distinction I was making, read on. 

**You and the quote in question are conflating a drop in market share pricing with being _the source_ of the money used to pay a dividend.** 

I’m trying to make that distinction between the source of the money of a dividend payment vs market pricing. It’s kind of an important thing to understand for the op since clearly they don’t grok the basics. …. And sometime people who have moved past the basics tend to get loose with the meaning of words since they think people know what they know. 

The quote in question. 


&gt;“dividends are taken from the market price”

This is misleading, at best just imprecise about the effect a dividend payment on the pricing people place on the representation of a shares future value and that of the company. 

You own links don’t disagree with what I’m saying. You will notice how your investopidea link says _“typically”_. 

You see how that makes it clear it’s talking about investors valuations rather than being the actual source of the money? You understand how typically means “not always true”. You can go back and read what wrote before and maybe if you let it, you can see it. Same for the defiling link. 


Dividends are distributed by the company that issues the securities to shareholders of record. 

How investors price the security in a exchange can (and many would argue does) take that into account, but the outstanding shares with various holders of record **is not the source of the money that enters their account as a dividend payment**. 

That last part in bold being important. 

Or to quote Fidelity since you like them so much: 

[&gt; Dividends are a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, to a class of its shareholders.](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/stocks/what-are-dividends-video)

"Gentoo","t5_2qrnc","The kernel log output is generally indicative of _some_ hardware misbehaving. The link reset in particular is especially concerning, that has the potential to cause serious problems with any data stored on the device.

The first thing I would check is that the cable makes a solid connection with both the drive, and the SATA controller (or motherboard). Loose cables readily cause issues like this. If you’ve tried with multiple cables and/or ports on the controller/motherboard, then the most likely culprit for this particular possibility is the connector on the drive itself, which unfortunately could not really be fixed. Additionally, if you have not yet, try using a locking SATA cable (these have a metal locking tab on each end), as these tend to do a better job of making a reliable connection.

Other possibilities include:

- The SATA controller is overheating. Not easy to check, but if your CPU/GPU regularly run especially hot, this might be the issue. Make sure the case is clean and that airflow is good, and see if the issue goes away.
- The SATA controller is either faulty or failing. The only way to properly diagnose this is to get a PCI Express SATA controller card and see if the problem goes away with the drive connected to that new card.
- The power supply may not be providing clean, stable power to the rest of the system. This unfortunately not easy to test, as it could be an issue with the power supply, or it could be a problem with mains power being particularly dirty or unstable, and checking either requires relatively specialized equipment. That said, this is not especially likely, as you would probably be seeing other issues with the system as well if it were the case.
- The drive itself is faulty. Not hugely likely given that this one is brand new and replaced an older one which was showing the same issue. Also, the SMART attributes all look fine, so short of a firmware issue with both the old and new drive, you can probably ignore this possibility.",1667260981

I also saw the body hooked up to machines and saw the machines ""flatline"". I also saw the Dr. declare me deceased and then I watched the fosters and the doctor leave to another area of the hospital. I was able to repeat their argument when I returned from the rest of the NDE.

I did not have any body in my childhood NDEs for the most part. I sensed myself as a ""foci"" basically, or rarely as what I suppose one would term an orb of light--but I also sensed that I was far, far more vast than that and it was there for my own comfort.",1667260982

They told us the amount, but it was prefaced with…I can’t do too much because I’m buying a motorcycle in a couple months. 🙄 not a big deal, we were happy with whatever we got. BUT…a few years later my brother goes on to get married. We got a call around the time they were talking finances because they didn’t remember what they gave us.

2, uoft helps people understand heavy workloads and it may help you transition better into law school opposed to other schools. The competitivity can help prepare you for law school and you might even gain better study skills. 

In conclusion: any choice will have pros and cons, and uoft has them too. If you think you can handle it, then I'd say go for it,, remember there's always a choice to transfer if you find it too much. Hope this helps :)",1667260982

"news","t5_2qh3l","A reminder as well that the Bush Administration was warned multiple times of an attack by Cofer Black and George Tenet in 2001. They sat on the intelligence and did nothing. 

https://youtu.be/7EUfjGBhDTM

Ten members of the Bush Administration, notably Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz were part of the Project for a New American Century. Their think tank in 1997 called for a “new Pearl Harbor event” to reinvigorate the arms market. 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century

Bush and Cheney testified together, off the record. Multiple 9/11 commissioners have stated they were set up to fail and that the Bush Administration feared they were going to hang someone. 

https://youtu.be/HVh-Xdqar6E

Bob Kerrey a 9/11 Commissioner, has stated that 9/11 was a thirty year conspiracy. 

https://youtu.be/1OvCSVb7Uyk

The handling of the materials on the scene, was completely against every fire standard for an investigation and has been pointed out by many NY firefighters. 

https://youtu.be/TULmLtqRXZ4

There were firefighters covered in blood and soot, who said they were pushed up from an explosion below them before the towers come down. The perfect witness, primary source, expert witness, right after the event. 

https://youtu.be/0Gh3ErgMI4M

When you really research into 9/11 it becomes apparent the Bush Administration knew the attacks were going to occur and allowed it to happen. The 9/11 Commission received only 11 million dollars to investigate the largest attack on our country. The investigations were a farce and members of our government got away with allowing an attack to occur so they could fulfill their agenda.",1667260983

"ToyotaTacoma","t5_2y25j","Where do you live - is it moderately humid there?

I lived in Panama City Fla in 2008 and had a new 4Runner that would do this on the headlights - like in your photos, a light condensation like when you exhale on glass. It would happen on mornings or if I washed it in the early evening especially around spring and fall. I've since owned 2 Challengers, a Mustang, and now a Tacoma while living in Houston and Austin. The Mustang was most sensitive in the headlights especially when I washed it in the early evening, but it's always a light condensation similar to exhaling on glass.

I wouldn't sweat it. Do some googling and you'll see lots of examples where they talk about it being bad but the photos look like the inside of a hot shower with actual droplets of water - yep, bad. You'll also find lots of examples where it's common and the photos look similar to yours - light mist like breathing on glass.

Also, I think it's a lot more noticeable on the clear housings than the all red housings because its just easier to see. My TRD OR came with the clear housing (\*would much rather have the all red if anyone is in the Austin area and wants to swap). It's been up and down with humidity but I'll try to catch it at the right time of morning to share a photo.

edit: yeah I wash my cars a lot. Fall here sees some really high temp swings. I remember a few times washing the Challenger in the late afternoon on 80ish degrees days but the water was still pretty chill. My windshield fogged up - air inside the car was warm and humid, cold water hit the windshield and cooled it and caused condensation - startled me at first...",1667260983

 Fui contratada em 2021 como jovem aprendiz em uma empresa da minha cidade, escolhi o curso de ""eletricista de manutenção eletro eletrônica"". 
 O lance era, 2 anos de curso, e quando completasse dois meses de curso, começaria a ir pra empresa.
 Até aí tudo certo, fiz, comecei a ir pra empresa. Fiquei no trampo por 4 meses. Me demitiram por dois motivos: 1° cortei meu dedo em uma máquina da empresa enquanto fazia a manutenção, e não fui no ambulatório. E 2° o setor que eu trabalhava, estava com pouca mão de obra, ou seja, sem tempo pra mentor (todo jovem aprendiz tem que estar acompanhado de um).
 Pra resumir. Estou fazendo apenas a parte teórica do jovem aprendiz (que é o curso) e recebendo 50% do salario da empresa. 
 Então pra mim, não foi uma coisa muito boa. E não gostei da experiência (pela parte da empresa), mas o curso foi muito bom, é da instituição SENAI.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I’m gonna say NAH, because kids sometimes need trusted adult confidantes that are not their parents. Kids sometimes need a sounding board just like adults do. But at the same time, the parents need to trust that you will tell them if safety is a concern. It doesn’t sound like you or your sister ever discussed something like this. 

My mom has a great relationship with her best friend’s kids. They trust that they can confide in her, and the agreement with her, the kids, and her best friend is that:
1. She will not share information with their mom unless she is concerned for their safety, if that is the case she will tell the kids she can’t keep it from their parents (and often helps them figure out how tell their mom on their own)
2. If their mom asks her a question she will not lie to her and she’ll answer the question. (This comes into play when their mom suspects something is up, she’s not asking questions out of nowhere.)

My mom sticks to that agreement religiously, her best friend trusts that she will tell her if something is really wrong, and the kids trust that my mom will be upfront with them if she needs to involve their mom. 

OP, something like this could work for you, your sister, and your nieces and nephews. I would talk to her about it and see how she feels.",1667260985

you just need to find islam by yourself





i was 15/16 years old when this happened to me i didn't care about anything is islam in middle school it was just another task that i was required to do because i was forced to pray (in school and in home ) so if no one said to me go pray i won't pray even if i hear the adan i would just ignore it, this continue til the half of my 2nd year of highschool in the quarantine (2022) i started to search about all the religions that can come to mind (even old religions and abundant religions) and i started to learn about the ones that made since and that connected to historical events, literally allot of them ware the same thing and the same stories but literally all of them didn't have a clear massage/stories
and i settled on islam and Christianity, but after i learned more about Christianity i realized that all of the versions on Christianity wasn't right and every version try to delete the other. 

so i decided to learn about islam more and what is means to be a Muslim and i went to the sheikh and explain everything and said the shahada 

i don't know is what i did was right or not but i believe its better than just acting like a muslim without believe.

yes I'm still not a good moslem but trying my best and i believe in islam

"REBubble","t5_3lflvh","Nobody in this sub wants to hear it. It sometimes feels like an echo chamber. One thing a rather smart person told me is that the Fed is not going to bankrupt the US. When Volcker was the chairman and raised interest rates through the roof, the US had a comparatively small federal debt and could service that debt at the higher interest rates without risking insolvency or hyperinflation through printing enough money to service the debt. That’s not the case now. If the Fed tried to do what Volcker did, the US would either default which would be really bad or enter a hyperinflationary slippery slope where the Fed is printing to service the national debt while raising interest rates to try to tame the inflation they are stoking. It’s like pouring a lot of gas and a little water on a fire at the same time. The problem just gets worse. 

In short, that’s why I think we are going to see the Fed blink sometime around the middle of next year. They’re going to halt and or drop the interest rate and another round of serious QE.

As for the downvotes, the masses can feel free. But if they’re not watching this angle, then it’s willful blindness.",1667260985

But this one stuck around and said they'll take care of everything. And they did to the point of hiring an *independent* adjustor to argue the case. (I know he's not really independent if he's hired by the roofing company but Allstate employed the other adjustor so I feel fair is fair) 

In the end, Allstate agreed to full coverage and the roofing company did satisfactory work. My deductible was 2K but I negotiated with the company to give a honest review and allow them to put a advertisement sign on my lawn for a week for a 2K rebate. So I got a brand new roof for nothing out of pocket.

Basically, 90% of the stories were by middle-aged folks recalling events from their teenage years where they were pretty obviously either dreaming/sleepwalking/sleep paralysis. Clearly, they were all 'believers' in the first instance and let their teenage imaginations take flight on mundane events. Then in the following years, in each retelling, the story was likely augmented for dramatic effect.

I used to love AL, because there was always balance and a diversity of views with at least some smidgen of critical thinking. Now they believe everything that comes their way and what's worse attack their audience for daring to ask them to bring more balance to the table.

I WANT to believe, but for something to be magical it needs to be rare. If the answer to every question is 'it's paranormal' it just becomes...well NORMAL - just once in a while I'd love for them to say 'after looking at this it's likely a hoax' or 'they were likely having lucid dreams' or something....

Console-ward, Nintendo has two completely dead services and two more on life support.  Sony has demonstrated they want to show their old platforms the door, though I don't believe any download services are 100% axed just yet.  Microsoft flushed their original Xbox Live service, which saw a healthy amount of purchased DLC go down the pipes with it.

I learned about ME/CFS from a Twitch streamer with the illness, while I was in the process of trying to find a diagnosis (at the time doctors were leaning towards fibromyalgia). The more I learned about it, the more I realized that the symptoms fit too well, especially PEM. The way I would just collapse, exhausted beyond description, seemingly out of nowhere, eventually noticing it would happen predictably a few days after going out in the city with friends.

The problem with that and as such the problem with incentivizing trials and comp in general is that if they are better than other weapons they become tools to further cannibalize the game mode. 

Like if player X is better than player Y and then you give X a better weapon than player Y can get, player Y gets pushed out of PVP. 

But the flip side is if you can go farm spacehorse mindlessly and get a comp PVP level gun how many new players will that gun bring into the game mode?

I still haven’t seen that. I have, however, gotten some good advice on how to request a return on audible, so that was good for me.

I refuse to believe that the lack of writing about cocks of an author’s writing means that they have to write shitty books that masquerade as horror while just not being weirdly obsessed with peoples genitals. While a lot of my comments have been downvoted to oblivion, my original question is upvoted and still hasn’t really been answered. If you think this just isn’t his best work and recommend earlier works, *just say that*. His lack of writing about cocks has nothing to do with it.

If I read a Tom Clancy novel and he suddenly a submarine officer didn’t get weirdly and explicitly aroused by sinking a Russian sub, watching its fast and bulbous length quiver and tremble as it penetrated the dark depths of the ocean sea and sang mournfully for the men aboard who would not be able to join her for the long passage below, I’d be like “dafuq?”.

**AITA for telling my wife, she only had her self to blame for my mothers actions.**

Hi there everyone. I never thought I’d be asking strangers online for an opinion but here we are. 

I’m Rod (35M) and my wife is Cat (26F). Also involved are my parents, Cat’s parents and our son Jack (16 Months) 

A bit of background. 
So my mother can be a bit overbearing. Because of this her and Cat have always clashed. My mother has strong opinions on what’s best and I’ve often had to ask Cat to let the little things go and compromise. 

Cat is no contact with her family. She hasn’t seen or spoken to them in 6 years. They weren’t at our wedding they have never met my son. I do know the reasons but Cat is insistent my mother not be told.

My mother doesn’t approve of Cats non relationship with her family. She believes Cat doesn’t know what it means to be a mother if she can so callously abandon her own. 

Cat also won’t let my mother be alone with Jack. Anytime my mother comes to visit Cat will not leave them alone. I do believe this is disrespectful. 

I convinced Cat yesterday to let my mother babysit. An hour is all I asked for give us some time to go get coffee and be a couple. She reluctantly agreed. However, when we got home, we walked in on my mother video calling Cats family. Apparently my mother has been in touch for a while and secretly sending them photos of my son along with our address and wedding photos.

Cat was furious. She demanded my mother leave instantly and told her she was never welcome in our house or near my son again. My mother left, but not before telling me to fix this and Cat was over reacting. I told Cat that my mother was simply trying to help And she didn’t have a right to ban her from our home or my son. Cat lost it and told me she had been dealing with my mother’s disrespect for years, but she would not allow her to put Jack in the middle. 

I got angry, and told her this never would have happened if she had simply told my mother the truth, and she is the one who chose to make things harder for herself. She has nobody to blame for my mother getting in touch but herself

Cat walked away and began packing some things for her and Jack . I kept talking, and she just ignored me as though I wasn’t there. She didn’t say another word to me until she was at the door before telling me she wanted a divorce and leaving. 

She’s been gone all day and I haven’t heard anything except for a text saying that they made it safely to her friends house and we would talk more on Wednesday. 

Am I truly the asshole here? My mother shouldn’t of gotten in touch but she had no right to be as disrespectful as she was. Is this really divorce worthy?


Edit. Since everyone seems to need to know this. My mother did not know why Cat was no contact and did not see it as a big deal. I have since called her a few hours after Cat left and told her the full story of why Cat reacted as she did and is no contact. She feels absolutely terrible about her behavior and wishes she had known sooner. But that was a decision Cat made

EDIT- CAT WAS NOT ABUSED SEVERELY. HER PARENTS ARE SEVERELY RELIGIOUS IN A SMALL COMMUNITY AND WANTED CAT MARRIED AT 18 WITH AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE TO A KNOWN FRIEND OF THEIRS AND HERS. SHE WASN’T TORTURED OR ABUSED.

No problem - 

the Main colours were:

* Vallejo dark Purple - I think it was extra opaque Heavy Violet
* Citadel pale lilac - think it was citadel dechala lilac layer paint
*  Citadel bright green - Moot green layer paint

The intense green on the body and the horse was highlighted by increasing mixes of moot green and flash gits yellow 

the pale green (skeleton and was mixes of moot green and white to a make a pastel moot green

Other colours 

* the leather straps, bridle and sword hilt and roses were citadel Volupus pink contrast paint (over white) - highlighted with fulgrim pink
* The vines and tiny gems on the bridle were terradon turquoise contrast (over white)  
* The wood and the base coats of the metal bits (weapons etc) were slightly watered down cygor brown contrast paint over white (or light grey undercoat tbh).
* the metals were then heavily stippled with troll slayer orange (layer paint) and then the blades were touched with a dark grey right at the blades edge.

highlihts to metal and wood were varied, generally mixing in a yellow or a white to the brown or the orange.

Cheers :)",1667260991

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","Nice try, but you are so incorrect on so many fronts.   


Firstly, the gender clinics will take any child that says they believe they're the opposite sex. That does not equate gender dysphoria, that would entail an assessment as per the DSM. Which, once they're over 10 needs only a few of the criteria (under 10 it's a lot more) to diagnose gender dysphoria. In my step daughter's case it was enough that she wanted to wear boys' clothes and said she didn't want to be a girl. That is literally what they diagnosed her on. No other signs.   


Secondly, I never said they were going to administer hormones. I said they were going to put her on hormone blockers. They do NOT just do what they say on the tin, and they do NOT just stop puberty. This is a drug that is used to chemically castrate sex offenders in prison, and is also used off label on women with endometriosis, but considered so dangerous that they can only be on it for six months. You're lying through your teeth when you say they have no side effects. They do. The gender clinic copped to bone density and height side effects (they do a bone density scan to track degeneration) but what they were cagey on was the impact on cognitive function, anxiety and depression, fertility, endocrine issues in the future and sexual function. They know fertility is potentially compromised because they also schedule 'fertility testing' during the process.  All issues that are coming to light worldwide. All the gender clinic would say, much like you, is that the puberty blockers are reversible and 'buy time'. Our question was 'how?', when the cognitive function is impacted, hormonal changes aren't experienced, the child is kept in stasis to explore whether they want to be the other sex (which is physically impossible to achieve in its entirety so needs mental health support...which isn't offered by the gender clinic) and most importantly, no one was actually assessing her for co morbidities (mental health issues have predated this episode, trauma, family dynamics etc etc). What time do they need that puberty couldn't also be part of? The only rationale they gave us is that a trans kid is better than a dead kid and that this would save them having to remove breasts in the future. And yet, if she'd been 14, not 11, they'd have had to tackle this without puberty blockers, so what happens to those kids?   


This 100% IS the wrong thing for children, and it's compounded by a system that is so righteous about the obviously flawed methodology that it's circumvented normal medical practice of care standards to take away parent consent, experiment on vulnerable people and send this cause spiralling backwards so badly that it's the trans people that are being hurt. If anyone actually cares about trans people, they will examine these systems. Something that some countries are now discovering and setting right. I really hope it happens here soon before one more child goes through what my step daughter did.   


It's time the lying stopped. I don't know how anyone could read what my step kid went through and not be horrified. She was entranced by an idea, and her body was nearly altered for life. We're so thankful that she got her head around the impact puberty blockers would have on her and her life and desisted. She's not out of the woods, she has a lot of things to deal with now that she's proclaimed to the world she's a boy and has to backtrack. I can't imagine having to have done that when I was her age, I admire her guts, that time of life is brutal regardless. It's not helped when seemingly well meaning people don't know what the hell they're talking about but will fight the fight anyway. This thread is absolutely chocka with disinformation, and it's clear that because we're all too afraid to pipe up, that this is only going to get worse.   


I'll add one more thing. It's easy to pretend that the people opposing kids going through gender clinics are the bible thumping, right wing nut jobs. I couldn't be any further from this stereotype. As the daughter of a gay man, who has only ever voted Labor and thinks Dan Andrews is the second coming, it's a shock to me that more people can't see what's going on with this topic. Perhaps it takes having a kid you love go through it? I don't know. There is a lot of performative empathy that goes on in the Left. But what I do know, after working in health related fields most of my life and coming from a long line of health professionals, is that this is not good health care. By the gender clinic's own admission, there is little data, there is little ongoing data keeping done by the gender clinics in Australia and there is no evidence based care going on. Think what you like about the topic, but in any other discipline that would elicit a royal commission.",1667260992

YTA. 

Man up and defend your wife from your mother.

&gt;Edit. Since everyone seems to need to know this. My mother did not know why Cat was no contact and did not see it as a big deal. I have since called her a few hours after Cat left and told her the full story of why Cat reacted as she did and is no contact. She feels absolutely terrible about her behavior and wishes she had known sooner. But

And your still blaming your wife for being upset that you and your mother crossed a very clear set boundary. She shouldn't have known sooner, rather she shouldn't have known at all.  Just.... I can only imagine, y'all, how many times this women's been treaded on by her spouse and MIL.

"MtF","t5_2ub9j","I'm going to use the gender neutral ""they"" since you don't know what their preferred pronouns are.

Hopefully they are going through a Dr for their estrogen now, but, if they are doing it DIY then they really need to find a way to get their blood tests done. A small percentage of people have an affinity to estrogen such that they can reach dangerously high levels of E on a moderate dose. (The much more likely occurrence is that levels will be too low, and they will hardly get any effects from it, but, they won't know without getting a blood test). Depending on which country you live in, it may (or may not) be easy for an adult to get onto HRT officially with a Dr.

Also, if they're not working with a therapist already, then they should probably find an accepting one, because, being gender diverse can be very mentally taxing.

Sadly, this will probably have a negative effect on your parents relationship if one is no longer attracted to the other. (Being an ace, I don't understand why people would break up just because of a lack of sexual attraction, but it seems to happen quite often in these situations)

The best thing you can do is be supportive and accept that they will always be the same person, even if some things will change. I'm conflicted on if you should tell them that you ""accidentally overheard some of their phone call and that you support them no matter what"" or if you should keep quiet and let them choose to come out to you when it's right for them. 

It's going to be a bumpy road with lots of rough patches, so, be prepared to be adaptable and try to help out or be supportive where possible.

Good luck",1667260994

"MarvelSnap","t5_6a6mlb","here are some questions you should ask yourself to help you improve try asking yourself this after every turn. 

1. Am I vulnerable?

 if yes retreat or check. 

2. Is my opponent vulnerable?

 if yes snap.  check only if it will make them retreat and you think they will stay till the end.

3.  why did my opponent make that play?

 this will help you play counter cards effectively and help you predict your opponent's important break points.

4.  Am I in a winning position?

  If yes snap unless it is the final turn.

5. Do I need initiative?

if yes overplay if not underplay.

&amp;#x200B;

  Snapping early when you are in a strong position will more often than not pay off unless you stay for the 8 cubes in a long shot position.",1667260994

Like many challenges, it is designed around something that has a limit in a match. It can be completed in a non disruptive way by simply doing it when people aren't using boons, just breaking extra ones in bad or useless places, or breaking totems after gens are done.

Last I checked he hasn’t posted religious videos in a while and now posts gaming stuff. Last I saw of him was when he was at the GCW death match hall of fame thing for Nick Mondo a couple years ago.

The engine feels like it has to be different for licensing/legal reasons and it is chock full of jargon as the setting feels it has to be different mostly for novelty's sake.  Every character is so alien that there's no way to interact with them in a way that feels like you can gauge whether or why they're telling you anything truthful or untruthful.

There aren't any NPC images because the game was never completed, so there's yet another separation between you and who you're talking to.  The game/combat engine is built around options which are DEFINITELY better than others, and if you guess wrong (because the game isn't going to give you enough information to figure this out logically), you're going to have to give up and start over.

The game was a complete chore, half-finished, built on undelivered promises, and was clearly rushed out the door once they realized it was either ""release what we have or throw the work away and be accused of taking the Kickstarter funds"".

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","1. If all you need to do is literally just play your finished track, all you really need is a phone and a TRS cable. Or even better, just bring a USB drive the sound guy can slap onto the mixing board and play. You only really bring your gear if you want to make a show out of it, and however you want to perform this music is up to you. It only feels ""incorrect"" perhaps because pressing play on expensive ""real"" equipment is one of the open secrets of the trade and it looks like a ""proper"" show, while pressing playback on what is essentially invisible seems amateur (like one would do in school).  What I would suggest then if you really just need playback, is to just bring the finished track over, do a normal playback, and just find something else to make a show about. Maybe dance, do tricks, make fun of DJs, have a light show, whatever. Anything to take away the focus from the fact that you're just pressing play like David Guetta.
2. Electronic music artists play their music through a DAW due to several things:
   1. Most do it for show. They only really press play.
   2. Some use the DAW with controllers so they can control groups of sounds and individual stems, as well as have a hold of effects live. With this, they can rearrange the song on the fly.
   3. Artists who play other instruments or have a band with live instruments have the DAWs set up like 2.2, but also it allows them to have a click track reference for everyone, use plugins, and switch sounds at will on their controllers from the same DAW that controls the playback, it also allows the DAW to control external equipment like MIDI-equipped keyboards, and even lights, and it allows them to basically have all the tools they need on stage even if they won't use anything they previously prepared.",1667260996

Even scientifically based social rules are completely made up and enforced by biased research and medicine. 

So many people don't enjoy sex. My own sister thought she was a lesbian because she never enjoyed sex with men, but oops, she doesn't enjoy sex with women either. Everyone's different! 

Tbh I find myself not very interested in sex. I can get into it once it's happening but I don't usually think to initiate and it isn't something I NEED in my relationships.

**Teen accidentally hanged while trying to make hayride scary**

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**SPARTA (AP)** The state of Michigan generally does not inspect or certify haunted attractions, a state official said following the accidental hanging death of a teen-ager working at a haunted hayride.

&amp;#x200B;

Caleb Rebh, 14, of Sparta Township in Kent County died Saturday night at a Sparta horse farm that offers Halloween-themed hayrides. People who saw him desperately struggling with a noose around his neck thought he was acting, his mother said Monday.

&amp;#x200B;

The sheriff”s department is investigating the death as an accident, Capt. Dan Krajewski said yesterday. The county medical examiner has ruled that asphyxiation was the cause of death.

&amp;#x200B;

The Michigan Department of Consumer and Industry Services has opened an investigation to see if youth-employment standards were being met, said spokeswoman Maura Campbell. The department”s report probably will take at least a month.

“It may be that it will just turn out to be a horrible tragedy,” Campbell said.

&amp;#x200B;

The only time the department would inspect a haunted attraction would be if there were an amusement ride involved, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

A telephone message seeking comment was left yesterday at Alpine Ridge Farms for co-owners Thomas and Rebecca Bradley.

&amp;#x200B;

Rebecca Bradley told The Grand Rapids Press that while she and her husband were devastated by the death, the accident did not mean the hayride is unsafe.

&amp;#x200B;

The event will go on as planned next weekend and the first weekend in November, with proceeds on Friday benefitting the victim”s family, she told the newspaper.

&amp;#x200B;

Kathy Rebh, a teacher and counselor at Englishville High School in the Sparta school system, said a friend of her son who works at Alpine Ridge Farms had recently called Caleb to say there could be a hayride job for him at the horse farm.

&amp;#x200B;

“It was something that was right up his alley because he loves Halloween and running around in the dark,” she said. “Trying to scare people was the perfect job for Caleb.”

&amp;#x200B;

Kathy Rebh said she took her son over to Alpine Ridge on Saturday and spoke with Thomas Bradley about a possible job. Thomas Bradley told her that he had all the workers he needed that night and to check back on Sunday, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

“I went back and told Caleb that, and he said, “Well, can I just stay and hang around?” He said, “I”ll work for free. I don”t have to be paid,”” his mother said. “I mean, he wanted to do this.”

&amp;#x200B;

Caleb stayed and later telephoned her twice: to say he had been allowed to take part and to tell her that he wanted to be scarier to passers-by.

&amp;#x200B;

“When the wagon went by, he didn”t know what to do, so he just turned and looked at it and said boo,” she said.

&amp;#x200B;

He started the evening by working at a post featuring a coffin, then switched with another worker who had been at a station with a skeleton hanging from a noose tied to a small tree, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

Caleb spoke with another teen about replacing the skeleton with himself, Kathy Rebh said.

&amp;#x200B;

As he let go of the rope with the noose around his neck, the tree whipped back and pulled the rope taut, choking him as his feet remained on the ground, his mother said.

&amp;#x200B;

When he started scrambling to get the tightening noose off his neck, fellow workers and hayride participants seemed to think he was acting, she said.

&amp;#x200B;

“That”s why we know he didn”t try to hurt himself,” she said. “He thought he was safe because he was on the ground.”

&amp;#x200B;

Hayride employees and participants tried to resuscitate Caleb, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

&amp;#x200B;

Caleb was active in his church youth group and enjoyed reading, writing and listening to music, his mother said.

&amp;#x200B;

“He loved people and he had a huge heart,” Kathy Rebh said.

&amp;#x200B;

“He loved his friends but he would also go into our family gatherings and sit down and play games with older people. He loved to talk to people.”

&amp;#x200B;

She said she and her husband do not understand why those who saw their son struggling with the noose did not realize sooner he was in trouble.

&amp;#x200B;

“We just can”t make any sense out of why no one would go over there and try to help him,” she said.",1667260997

Trickle down economics is not a real thing, it's a made up buzz word to get votes. 

There is no shortage of funding in any of those categories, we don't spend the money appropriately.  Based on history, if there are any new funds collected with this tax, and I am doubtful that we net any additional revenue, but if there is, some majority of the funds will be used for additional employee compensation and not additional services.  In the 90s, when there was a great deal of new funds put into education, a large amount was put into higher salaries, not into better resources or more teachers.  An argument could be made that we want the average teacher pay over $100,000 across the state, as it is in many towns in MA, but it doesn't result in better education.

"medicine","t5_2qhff","&gt; They think “if these stupid doctors would just find the right combo of medications, Dad would be like he used to be again.”
&gt;
&gt;Meanwhile I just want to grab their adult kids by the shoulders and explain to them “hey, your dad’s never going to get out of the bed again. He’s not going to pop up one day and join you at the dinner table for thanksgiving or Christmas. He’s demented and dying and that’s just the way it is. You and your siblings should have had this conversation years ago when dad could still talk to you and you should have maybe made some plans then of what to do when it got to this stage

Just as some counterpoint...my dad developed a degenerative neurological disease in his early 60s. He had been a vibrant, charismatic, and extremely physically fit man. When I was a resident in the midst of surgery training, the writing started to appear on the wall what his condition was, and I remember telling my mom that even if we did find out what it was, it would be a primary progressive neurological disorder with no meaningful treatment. And she burst into tears. I felt terrible. But she did understand and was never expecting a miracle. For some reason though, his well-educated sister clung to the idea that we could find some combo of diet/lifestyle changes that would turn it all around. It was magical thinking. He eventually died, and my mother and siblings put in unbelievable hours to keep him at home, which is where he died. He had one palliative procedure as an outpatient in his final 3-4 years.

And just a few weeks ago, I had a dream that he somehow stabilized and recovered a bit, and I was crying for joy. And then I woke up and cried for real. And my eyes are watering now.

It is *really* painful to watch that decline. We kept him out of the hospital and really had minimal physician interaction for him in his final years, but it took so much effort on the part of my mother and family to do so.",1667260998

If CQB is someone's concern then by all means, choose the most efficient/effective setup for that.

I have my handgun for indoors (not perfect but few things are) my carbine for 0-500, and my precision rifle for long range and hunting.

The ones I really don't like are Murrey and Chris... and Rock's pants... but they are his pants and I'm not wearing them. If he is happy, I'm happy for him.

And for some reason Celia, but in her case is more about the art style. Talking about that, big heads look good in chibi style, but the new style is not chibi at all.

"Everton","t5_2qpfg","Lampard qualified Chelsea for CL in the 19/20 season under a transfer ban. The next season when they won the CL, Chelsea were undefeated in the group stage which Lampard was manager for all of. 

He was sacked when Chelsea were 9th in the league, partly down to the failed Werner signing, as well as Ziyech and Havertz not doing great. It’s hard to compare the threshold of sacking and standards at Chelsea to Everton. 

I do take your point on his tactics not wowing. I agree they’re not amazing, but I believe that’s because he’s working hard on building a strong foundation to build from. That strategy isn’t very sexy and takes time. Last thing Everton needs is another manager who buys a million average attackers with the goal of playing “attractive football” and we end up losing every game 5-2. 

There’s also a positive mood around the club and fans with an understanding of building toward a future. That’s something that’s been missing since Moyes and a first under Moshiri’s ownership.

"Starfield","t5_3g41m","Personally, I feel like I'm just existing in limbo, waiting for Starfield to rejuvenate my life with new meaning. I haven't been so excited for a game in a very long time. While I understand there is no point rushing a game on which we all place so much importance, every delay feels like a prison sentence, condemning us to a few more months of pointless existence ⌛😵‍💫

My dream has always been to unravel the mysteries of the universe, to experience what it would be like to be capable of interstellar travel, explore new worlds and discover real answers to several of my deepest questions, namely the true value of intelligent life across the universe, and what should be the ultimate goal of humanity's legacy ✨

I realise that I am living in a time before my time, but at least we have the technology to enjoy a convincing experience of what the future may hold... 🛸

I am not religious but I pray that Starfield can serve to fill a void in my soul, at least enough that I will finally make peace with being born in this damned century, a time where humanity is still at war with itself, where our differences remain the focus rather than our commonalities, and where we are yet to overcome our biological limitations, forced to accept death as an inevitable fact of life ☠️

It is my hope Starfield will teach an entire generation that when you look at the bigger picture, we are barely different from one another, that nobody wins in war, and that there are greater concerns in this universe which far outweigh the petty squabbles on our planet as we fight over its precious resources. 

Yet above all else, I hope that this project will ignite a new fiery passion for space exploration, blasting it back into the mainstream like it was during the Space Race era, triggering a chain of events that will change the course of humanity for the better 🚀",1667261000
"steelers","t5_2r526","We’ll see how it goes in year 2. Every fanbase in the league does exactly the same thing with rookie quarterbacks. It’s the head coach’s  fault, it’s the coordinator’s fault, the receivers don’t fight for the ball or get open, it was windy and on and on. For most people, no level of bad play will be his fault this year. 

And I’m fine with that.

But if he produces a full season of this level of play, there has to be MAJOR improvement next year. 

Don’t get me wrong. I’m not knocking the kid or saying that he can’t or won’t get a lot better. Just that he has to.",1667261000

[Cookie’s Caffé](https://www.cookiescaffe.com) here from Chadds Ford, PA with a couple new coffees available and my winter gifting special that will start tomorrow. Discount code REDDIT will get you 15% off any order, and orders over $50 ship for free automatically.

My new coffees are from Brazil and Sumatra and are available for $18 and $22, respectively, for a 12oz bag. The Brazil has notes of brown sugar, granola, and milk chocolate and is recommended as a medium-light city+ roast, and the Sumatra’s notes are pomegranate, tobacco, and molasses with a medium full city recommended roast.

My [winter special](https://www.cookiescaffe.com/buy-online/p/pay-it-forward-special) (that will be available from tomorrow through New Years) is a gifting sort of special. For $10, you can gift a random 12oz bag to the next person that orders. So if, in theory, everyone participated in the special, everyone would receive an extra 12oz bag. I’ll do my best to match the random bag to the person’s preferences (so if they ordered a bunch of fruity light roasts I’d make the extra bag fruity and light, too).",1667261001

Annual expenses = car repairs, WOF, Rego, insurance, rates etc… All budgeted plus a bit more.

Savings = any amount left over from your pay which isn’t needed in the above two accounts. I use this for holidays, house improvements etc…

If you don’t have an emergency fund then I would recommend that you set up a forth account to build that up for about 6 month with no income.",1667261001

Half flips are similar but you don't do it at an angle and after the initial backflip you have to cancel the flip and airroll.

What you're describing is front flipping, canceling while upsidedown (half way through the flip)  and airrolling (to land on your wheels) which would ultimately make your car end up backwards (so just a weird half flip that may be useful in rare circumstances.)",1667261002

Credible scientists don't,  in general,  dismiss any evidence during an investigation. It's not the scientists and scientific bodies I'm talking about.  It's journalists, talking heads,  and normal people that have been the most reactionary. Science does not yet know the origins of covid,  therefore *neither does anyone in this thread*. 

The investigation is ongoing,  and should be supported for its duration without ideology or politics muddying the waters. 

The facts are that as of today we do not know the origins of covid.  We have evidence for two distinct origins, and they are being investigated at this time.  Throughout the investigation,  evidence and information is going to change and evolve.  That's how science works.  The best we can do is follow the lead of researchers by following the data where it leads, not gunning for a specific outcome because that's the one ""our side"" believes happened.

"RealTesla","t5_3mgxy","I agree, day 1 and 2 of my Tesla rental my wife said ""We should have bought one of these when they first came out!""

Days 5-7, and my wife's like ""I'm kinda glad we're getting the Ioniq 5""

It was a full week of her saying ""So there's this thing ..."" and me explaining that's a known Tesla ""quirk"" (she thought the trunk wasn't closed properly, no it's just that badly aligned with the other panels)

But I'm not surprised about the kid's toy's lawsuits.

My other hobby is souping up Power Wheels Jeeps for my nieces and nephews using drill batteries. It's actually really difficult to ride the threshold between ""fun"" and ""dangerous"". Too slick of tires and they get stuck easily, add grip and it's now prone to rollovers (or looping it when accelerated suddenly facing uphill).

I make them wear helmets now, and it's now a supervised activity lol.",1667261004

Cat saw all this coming, and I'm having a hard time believing that you didn't. Cat has been holding the ""no unsupervised visits"" line because she knew that your mom would find a way to trample her boundaries. Your mother had ONE HOUR of babysitting, and she immediately did the thing that she knew would hurt Cat the most. 

People don't cut contact with their family just for funsies. It's a difficult, often traumatizing decision to have to make. Your mom just betrayed Cat's most fundamental boundaries by **feeding Cat's personal information to her abusers.**

&gt; I have since called her a few hours after Cat left and told her the full story of why Cat reacted as she did and is no contact.

Reddit isn't a dedicated website for a specific hobby, it is an aggregate social media website with every topic that caters to the lowest common denominator in a much bigger way. 

Bodybuilding specifically is an interesting case because there's been a lot of data sharing for things like diet, workout programs, and notably drug cycling. Before the internet guys would get gear from local gyms and they didn't really have a way to know if it was ""good"" or the best way to use it besides asking That One Guy They Know. And because enough people were rightfully concerned that random drugs might kill them or shrink their dicks or whatever, they documented what they were doing and shared the data to try to figure it all out.",1667261005

"Capitalism","t5_2qiyc","I'm going to need some sauce for that statement.  That sounds like something that might've been true in the 80s when taxes on the highest bracket were 70%, but I need sources.  Current rates for the highest bracket are 37% for reference.  I don't think lowering the tax rate will result in uber rich just voluntarily paying more, it'll just result in less tax revenue, and the higher income for the ultra rich will likely end up in some off-shore account or investment where it does little for the US economy.

The solution is simple.  The tax system is wrought with loopholes that everyone knows about (or 'design features' depending on your side of the argument).  The issue is that closing those loopholes and ensuring proper audits and oversight would require every politician to vote for something that every donor would vehemently fight.  

Here's something interesting, the lowest earners receive that vast majority of audits.  https://trac.syr.edu/tracirs/latest/679/
This could be because they do the dumbest returns, but it also shows that highest earners are legally getting taxed less, meaning, everyone at the IRS knows what the loopholes are and if they really wanted to increase the tax base, they'd plug those holes",1667261005

The car is being used in the scene like it's almost a living beast, growling in the shadows. That's it, thats the imagery it was going for. It didn't stall. The sound dropped out for us, the audience, to break the near 30 seconds of tension that was just built up as the Penguin and this *beast in the shadows* break ""eye contact"" and start the chase.

&gt; it’s implied that it’s his first time driving the car 

In the prequel novel it's revealed he has experience driving and customizing that same car and it becomes the Batmobile over a period of many years. I think it's close to a decade.",1667261006

"Eesti","t5_2rffn","Moment käin psühhiaatri ja psühholoogi juures ning võtan sertaliini, püüan ka mediteerida. Ma pole enda arust üldsegi funktsioneeriv täiskasvanu, ma väsin paarist koolipäevast ära ja ma nõjatun enda pere ja poissõbrale nii palju, et ei tee süüa ja ei suuda korda hoida (kui üksi elasin, ei teinud ka süüa endale ega koristanud). Mul on selline tunne, et isegi depressiooniga inimesed suudavad minust rohkem, inimesed mu ümber on koguaeg pettunud ja ma kardan, et mu põissõbra pere viskab mind välja nende juurest. Keegi ei mõista ja kõik on nagu ""saad hakkama!!! Jee!!"", aga nagu probleem on selles, et ma tunnen, et mul on puue. 

 Ma tunnen ennast vigasena ja nagu ma pean ennast ära tapma, kui ma edaspidi nii väsinuna end tunnen, kuna olen koormaks teistele. Mu perfektsionism p9letab läbi, ma tunnen, et ei saa lihtsalt elu nautida. See sitt on terve mu elu kestnud, depressioon on juba 7 aastat olnud. Tunnen, et elu pole kõigile elamiseks mõeldud ja mina olen üks neist.",1667261006
