I'm sorry your friend is having a rough time, they sound like they're skilled, but I don't see why the civilian employer is at fault here when your friend clearly got dicked around by his military superiors. They told him he was getting an AWS equivalent certificate, knowing full well it doesn't work that way in the civilian world. 

I don't think this is a case of every civilian welding company and union unifying behind the idea of depriving experienced vets of jobs. That would be ridiculous. I think this is a case of not wanting to play by the rules of civilian life, and misdirected frustration over being lied to.","1351728000"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","DISCLAIMER: Be careful not to read any additional propositions out of my following statements. When I say, for example, that ""ignorance"" is the cause of suffering this does not mean that I am making additional claims about what people are ignorant of. What I mean is exactly what I say **ignorance** - that state in which we do not know or think we know but are deluded. Not ignorance of a particular truth, but ignorance itself. This explanation has nothing to do with sky-daddies or floating pasta. This is more of a psychological analysis or philosopho-spiritual analysis of the ""one path"" doctrine as it appears in many religions.

We are all born into *ignorance*. That is, when we are born we do not possess explicit or conscious *knowledge*. We have certain tendencies and a base temperament but we do not even know that we have them. We are actually born largely unconscious and over the course of the first two years of life we gradually become more conscious and our sense of self comes online around age 2 (Source: Psychology/Neuroscience).

When we do become self-conscious and begin constructing autobiographical memories of our lives the manner in which we think about ourselves and our relationship to the world is primitive. Throughout our lives we experience many difficult situations that cause us to become depressed and in our depressive state (aka despair) we are more prone to *self-reflection*. We generally all experience a number of these in adolescence and childhood that we colloquially term ""growing pains"" (Metaphorically related to the physical condition by the same name).

By adulthood many of us share a basic model of reality with other adults that take various truths as axiomatic. Some of us go on to be scientists or philosophers and further challenge our world-models and self-concepts on the basis of great philosophical thought. However this process can yield a variety of different results just as typical involvement in society engenders and offers a variety of different personalities and viewpoints. Philosophers of a given age also tend to adapt their philosophies to the philosophical spirit of their time so they rarely push the bounds considerably enough to cause a major shift in perspective either in themselves or in others.

However there are observable changes in individuals from 18 to old age that are attributable to life experiences. Thus an individual does not stop experiencing ""growing pains"" upon reaching adulthood but is likely to experience them for the entirety of their life. Some worldviews and choices in life can cause a person to become more insane, that is, more delusional about the actual state of existence and thus experience more despair and depression.

The narcissist offers a good prototype of the individual bound for hell (so-to-speak). The narcissist cannot bear to reflect upon themselves in a worldview in which they are not admired and held in high regard. The emotional experience is far too potent for them to accept and instead they remodel their world-view to be consistent with the claim that they are wonderful. The narcissist's attempts to alter their own perception are well documented. The narcissist has a tendency to avoid criticism by avoiding close interaction with people who are critical of them. The narcissist has a tendency to surround themselves with people who are willing to at least feign admiration and approval of them. Many people are willing to pretend to admire and approve of the narcissist because they fear rejection and disapproval from the narcissist (their own narcissism).

The Yale professor of Psychology, Paul Bloom, said in his youtube lecture series on psychology that ""You think you are terrific"" and this is basically the core of narcissism. What Bloom is saying however is that we are all narcissists. The clinically identified narcissist may just be more bold than the rest of us or less subtle and nuanced, less capable of manipulating other people to view us as how we want to be viewed.

So what happens is people surround themselves by like-minded individuals who shower them with support, approval and praise. ""Birds of a feather flock together"". Social polarization results and people compare their own self-worth within a group by comparing their group-value against other groups. It is no longer about one person's individual narcissism, but becomes a mob of narcissists who have **ignorant** or **deluded** world-views.

This ultimately brings about the kind of chaos we regularly observe in the world. The multitude of wars and battles waged in the name of one delusion against another. *This* is hell!

Hell is an experience caused by one's own ignorance and unwillingness to fully determine what is true. It is caused by one's own narcissism or ""self-idolatry"" and allegiance to delusional self-constructs and one's relationship to the world and others in it.

Throughout a person's life their score on the narcissism personality index declines considerably. They are most narcissistic and most ignorant when they are born, but true conscious narcissism involving a self-model and delusional self-concept arises at age 2 and can either take a decline in narcissism or increase in self-concept clarity (i.e. becoming more self-aware or truthful) or it can go the opposite direction and people can become more self-absorbed and delusional.

The one true path is in recognizing this fact, that while people do grow and become more truthful, honest, compassionate and self-aware the processes (or ""path"") is the same regardless of how it is dressed up in ideology or language. And that path is of the relationship of one's own self-consciousness to the world, whether or not it is tending toward greater clarity and accuracy or toward greater ignorance and delusion.

I personally have studied many religious texts and find that, though often expressed in myth and fable, this is one of the things they all agree on when it comes down to it. But this is not the religion of those mobs of narcissists who call themselves ""Christians"" or ""Muslims"" and who start wars on the basis of those delusional self-concepts. This is the religion of Abraham, Jesus and Mohammed.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","You are attached to your boyfriend and (I am assuming) love him, so you wanna spend as much time with him as possible. It's ok to want that. And all you can do is communicate your desire (which you have done). So yey.

Your boyfriend has his own level of attachment and desire as well as ability to spend time with you and right now your desire and his availability doesn't seem to match up. That's ok. That MAY or may not change.

Don't try to manipulate the situation or change it. Accept it for what it is and focus on YOUR reaction to it (the only thing you HAVE control over). Focus on what you have and whether or not you NEED more. If you need more than he can/is willing to give, then you need to find someone who can (maybe a primary partner for you), or maybe you realize that you are just lonely and that if you filled your life with more things for yourself, you'd be completely satisfied with the time you do get to spend with each other. It sounds like you usually like alone time, so maybe your desire right now is a manifestation of the fact that something else is missing in your life?

And a word on the ""other side"" of the coin:
Being the primary in my own relationship I have to tell you that situations like yours SCARE the hell out of me. While I can UNDERSTAND your desire, I also don't see how *I* could be ok with my partner seeing his secondary every single day. That takes up so much of his time (he only has a few hours after work every day) that I would feel neglected myself. I don't know how your boyfriend's wife feels about this. Just saying that if you were MY partner's secondary and he communicated to you what he was able to give you from the start and you agreed and then you started ""DEMANDING"" more, that would be a dealbreaker for me. But you are not demanding. You are merely communicating a desire. So it's different. I'm curious to see what other ppl will tell you...","1351728014"

"2X_INTJ","t5_2sw4h","I must admit I was amused that someone took the approach of asking a bunch of people who are all introverted small talk hating loners for their numbers. Especially a guy in a female meeting and discussion focused forum. 

It is like a reverse psychology strategy or ultimate shock card. Unfortunately, even if someone were to take him up on this offer I would guess it would be after months of consideration planning and debate so time wise it seems ineffective. (Each answer requiring hours if not days of careful consideration on both parts. His in order to keep the interest of the person he is trying to clearly learn from and her  in order to answer his question completely and in a quick manner to not waste words.) That is if she doesn't get sidetracked with something far more important or bored with the idea of introduction small talk. Maybe even far more likely; chicken out because it might go badly and it can't be planned ahead properly. After all, this person has shown to be fond of unorthodox methods of getting results. 

An even larger problem would be that most of us dislike strangers and prefer to spend limited time spent talk with people we are already close to. Which I assume is what he combating with this greatly random and unique style of attention grabbing. 

That said if someone actually got around to texting him the conversation might go something like this:


Girl INTJ: What did you want to discuss or learn about?

Male,21: Oh hi.

....

...

...

(Hours later)

Girl, INTJ: Did you have a topic in mind?

Male, 21 : No

The end


Seems like a lot of effort for someone to go through just to chat up a random stranger. Especially for the sole purpose of learning more about this particular personality type. I would assume if he had any other method of research, maybe google, then he would just search for whatever specific info he needed. Since that seems like it can't be done since he clearly must be on plan c or d in order to use unorthodox methods. Plan a would be the obvious of google, plan b being youtube or any large video collection website, maybe even psychology websites like psychologytoday which can show in-depth studies, both cases of individuals and the group as a whole, plan c might have even been to go outside and look for someone of the female human like type that was sitting alone and go ask her whatever he wanted to know. Although I will assume that he skipped plan c in order to spare someone the stress. Plus if he had tried this method he would have realized that directly talking to a person with an introverted inclination might not work well if they aren't particularly there just to discuss what he has in mind so clearly he would never have made that request on a larger scale. Since it wouldn't work on a large scale if it fails on even a small scale.  

It is a real bummer that he most likely will get no results from such a clear cry for assistance in furthering his education on personality types in this particular categorization style. I mean if we take into consideration how nice he was with skipping plan c he must be a swell type of guy. Although I think he is just taking advantage of a higher concentration of more isolated women in the hopes that someone will want to talk to him. Completely missing out on the whole personality type he attempted this with. 

Either way, I laughed.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","&gt;I fully understand the beauty of RPGs is to give the players a sense or illusion of freedom with their choice, but when they simply refuse to enter an abandoned city where the entirety of the adventure takes place, I have no idea where to go from there.

Bring the danger to him - and give him a choice, fight unfavourable odds, or enter the city. Its very easy. Live or die.

&gt;I'm worried that in future sessions, I may drop other cues for adventures like screams or mysterious letters that lead to some destination that will only be ignored because they all seem ""suspicious and dangerous.""

I've had players ignore blatantly obvious clues for the piece of paper I gave them 6 sessions back that they suddenly remembered was left in a bag at the house they had obtained... Of course it was easy enough to use this to drive the plot forward, as it was yet another clue and piece of the puzzle, but I still face palmed. The only solution is to speak very clearly that - they are adventurers. Adventurers go tromping through old abandoned, trapped to the nines runes for the sake of finding glory and wealth. They do not go on adventurers to be pansies that wish they had stayed home knitting (not that I have a problem with knitting).

If they want a social based campaign - then they need to say so. Death in the party is going to happen sooner or later - and there is nothing more to it.","1351728027"

Those games happen and I don't like it no matter which side of the game I am on.  Games where you are completely dominant mean that it was a bad matchup.

For me anytime the govt uses force on a citizen when that citizen has not enacted force on another party you've robbed that person of freedom. The majority should not get to choose what freedoms we have (although in recent us history that is certainly the case). This country is not a democracy despite what many people think. It is no majority rules. It's a republic and that means we have laws not the whim of a majority. Democracies inevitably breakdown into anarchy, which is something I do not support. However if people insist on taking away freedoms for comforts, please support such measures at a state or local level. The federal govt has its powers limited explicitly by the constitution, but that has been ripped to shreds for a long time.  Whenever you have the federal govt meddling you cause the whole country to be robbed if freedom because there is no accountability. With power grab after power grab we end up with dictators not presidents who issue executive orders and regulation through cabinet departments without the consent if congress. I mean during the foreign policy debate the candidates were asked if they'd bomb Iran. How is this even a valid question???  The constitution require congress to declare war but that has gone by the wayside and now one person holds all the power designed to be held by a large group of people.

I still have a lot of love for the Jewish community, though. One of the warmest people in my childhood was my Rabbi's brother, who helped prepare me for my Bar Mitzvah. If you remove the religious and sexist components of Orthodox culture, I'd say their community has some of the bro-ist and most awesome people I've ever met. 

My brother (also gay) has a hatred for the Orthodox community, though. Just last month, we were on a plane to Israel around the time of the High Holidays, and the plane was full of religious people.

B. the choppy calls might be a signal issue of location(cellular towers) or the type of walls around. or you might have a bad radio (built in)

C. yeah for the battery, you have to turn off the apps that you are not using by holding the home button and swiping off the apps. Also try this app [one power guard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onexuan.battery) to help with battery.

D. Yup buy better head phones. i got [munitio these](http://store.munitio.com/Store/Product/Sku/CPFA000334-01?CategoryCode=Billets) when they were on sale they are so Awesome or get wireless Bluetooth headphones.

and lastly try Google chrome mobile browser, its pretty good. i was using the default browser for a while and switch to GC, the thing is sometime flash movies do play with in the GC, but sometimes the YouTube app will launch in order to view flash/movies. well msg me if you have any more questions, i may not be very knowledgeable but it it helps a user. cool =D

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","The paperclip things I eventually decided against. You CAN do it to say which pages you do/don't want included, but with this method the book is cut up down the middle and glued so you lose some margin. Instead, with the method I used, you can get each comic individually sewn down the line where the ~~paperclip~~**staples** would be which means that there is no loss of margin compared to with your standard comic.

Obviously, with a cutting-each-page-out method, you couldn't remove an ad if there was story on the other side (which is usually the case). With this method, there are 4 pages which need to be content-free for it to be removable - two on either side of the center of the book - so it's really not worth it.

The initial plan with the paperclips was to remove promotional stories at the back of books or sections which I was considering including in other binds etc. but I'm glad I chose against it.

That's the reason I eventually went for this instead of for the other method - I didn't want to lose a vital handful of millimeters in the middle of pages (they couldn't be that specific on how much would be lost and it would ruin spreads).

It seems pretty sturdy to me, but I'm being very wary as of yet and haven't given them a proper read through.

The pages seem to lie perfectly when the book is open so far (although like I say I haven't gone through them all yet).","1351728038"

The only thing you can use to decide this is whether you believe it's worth it to find out if he'll stay true to his word and true to his change. Is it worth it to you, weighing in the risk that he might cheat on you again, and he might break your heart? 

If it is and you decide to get back with him... Don't hand out all your trust TOO easily, but you do have to give him some sort of trust for the relationship to work. Work on your self confidence and independence, so that no matter what happens, you will be happy.

Also, I was trying to better understand what factors someone pointing at Coleman Young as the answer would cite.  

As for my characterization of sprawl: I mean that people who wake up, commute for hours per day in their car, live in fenced off suburbs, and return home to their television must have less chance to speak to others, despite being surrounded by dehumanizing traffic that has a good chance of harming them (by accident and by its nature via cardiovascular disease).

"wow","t5_2qio8","I was speaking of all DPS characters as being disposable/interchangeable, though I agree that the glass cannons do the best DPS when played properly.  

I have raided as tank, healer, and DPS, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that a DPS, at least a ranged DPS, requires the least preparation.  Additionally, DPS characters dropping out of raids usually affect the raid makeup the least.  There are far more adverse possibilities that could occur if a tank or healer switches out, rather than a DPS.

I needed to drop my responsibility, (I was a class officer before, as well), so that if my RL time commitments required me elsewhere, my new role would have the least negative impact on the guild's raid.  Speaking of which, I was in an AWESOME guild back then, &lt;CEB&gt; on Bronzebeard 2006-2008, and at least 50% of the main 40 man raid became RL friends.  I still talk to a decent amount of those people today, outside of WoW.  Also interesting, about 20% of our raiders, myself included, were prior or current military.

"programming","t5_2fwo","C's initial\* inability to express ""`x` is not aliased by anything else"" is a good example of one of the few abstraction costs that conversion from C to machine code does incur.  Fortran TTBOMK doesn't allow you to express the opposite.  So you get faster code in the (common) case where this assumption holds, but certain logic (e.g. `memmove()`) that could be expressed in machine code can't be expressed at all.

There are other examples of abstraction penalties in C.  E.g. the x86 instruction set computes division and remainder at the same time, so if your code applies both to the same variable, whether this instruction is called once or twice is up to the optimiser.  It could miss the opportunity.

\* Modern versions of C have `restrict`, which does allow this.","1351728049"

It sounds like it because it doesn't address a single thing I said.

&gt;The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women.

This seems like your changing the context quite severely.  I am not trying to make women into *instruments of production* any more than men.  Marx saw the species being of humanity as a productive being, as proactive productive, rather than an *instrument*.  This is the crux of the meaning of the quote to mean (a Kantian), it sounds like the problem here is reducing women to an *instrument* of production, rather than seeing them as productive beings in their essence. 

&gt;Anybody who knows anything of history knows that great social changes are impossible without the feminine ferment. Social progress can be measured exactly by the social position of the fair sex (the ugly ones included).

And?  This quote could easily be read to say that Marx believed that women need to join the workers movement, that without their aid the workers movement is futile.  Furthermore, he could be read as saying here that the further along we make progress to a Communist society, the better standing women will be automatically.  Or, to see this in the reverse, do you think Marx would say that social progress could be measured in a bourgeois society that treats women well?  I suppose that's progress over a bourgeious society that treats women poorly, but no one would say that Marx's goal was only to increase the standing of women in society, but rather, as I read it, he's suggesting that women's standing in society is a means to an end, as ""social changes are impossible without the feminine ferment."" He *needs* them to bring about the changes he wants.

&gt;The modern individual family is founded on the open or concealed domestic slavery of the wife, and modern society is a mass composed of these individual families as its molecules. In the great majority of cases today, at least in the possessing classes, the husband is obliged to earn a living and support his family, and that in itself gives him a position of supremacy, without any need for special legal titles and privileges. Within the family he is the bourgeois and the wife represents the proletariat.

And this has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  But since you brought it up, how is Engles discussing women's domestic rights in terms of class struggle not an indication of how they saw sexism and racism as symptoms or manifestations of the larger bourgeois/proletariat struggle?  He literally calls them that, the man *is* the bourgeois and the women *is* the proletariat.  He may champion women's rights, but as a manifestation and extension of the larger class struggle and an end to exploited labor.  

It's nice you took a seminar on Marx and feminism, but I don't really see (1) how any of this is relevant to my earlier points [you said yourself it's copypasta from another thread and (2) how any of those quotes prove that Marx, Engles or any of the other thinkers thought that class struggle wasn't the primary struggle of history.

Certainly modern feminists have attempted to interpret it this way, projecting reward through history their beliefs onto Marx (somewhat ironically, since feminists despise the Other projecting their vision onto them, and yet they're happy to use show that everyone they agree with throughout history was really thinking what they think, just in disguise).  But where in Marx's writings does he endorse the progress of women's for women's sake?  Where does Engels say that gender equality is an end in itself?  Where does Lenin say that we should set aside the struggle of the working classes in order to promote women's standing in society, for the sake of women *qua* women, and not as productive beings?

As *I* said elsewhere, you can prescribe a painkiller, but you have you to address the cause.  Otherwise, you're just concealing the real problem.  If I have cancer, sure, give me a painkiller.  But if that's your priority, and you think that people who prioritize curing cancer just don't care about my pain, then I don't understand you.  Doctors can emphasize different parts of treating the patient without flipping shit, but as soon as a socialist says that he or she thinks that workers rights' issues need to be addressed at large (as an extension of women's rights), then the feminist socialist flip shit and start accusing them of sexism, racism, you name it.  Workers of the world unite, indeed.

  About Berani and Dumai


**Berani**

What is he? A Malayan tiger ( Panthera tigris jacksoni). Native to Penisular Malaysia. Only an estimated 500 remain in the wild. There are 55 Malayan tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America.

Name: Berani (pronounced Burr-ani) means “brave” in Malay; he was named by the veterinary staff at Tulsa Zoo.


Born:  Aug. 26 at Tulsa Zoo.

Birth weight:  Approximately 2.5 pounds

Current weight: 12 pounds, 15 ounces.

Parents:  Mother, Jin, 4; father Gahara, 7.
 
His litter: He was a single birth.
 
Why is he being hand-reared? He was not getting enough milk and his mother was inattentive, Tulsa Zoo veterinarians said.


Why is he coming to Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium? It’s best for hand-reared tigers to be raised together. They’ll acquire tiger behaviors from one another and learn to socialize and 
behave in an appropriate way with humans and other tigers in zoo-based populations.

How different are Malayan tiger Berani and Sumatran tiger Dumai?
 
Malayan tigers are a bit bigger, lighter in color and lankier in body formation. They are native to the tropical forests of Peninsular Malaysia. The Tiger Conservation Campaign estimates that fewer than 500 remain in the wild.

·         Sumatran tigers are the smallest subspecies of tiger. Their fur is a darker orange than that of Malayans. They are also the only remaining tiger subspecies that lives on an island.  They are critically endangered, and as few as 300 live in the wild.


**Dumai**

What is he? A Sumatran tiger (Panthera tigris sumatrae). Native to the Indonesian island of Sumatra. There are 74 Sumatran tigers in Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums accredited zoos in North America and about 375 as part of the Global Species Management Plan. Only an estimated 300 remain in the wild.

Name: Dumai (pronounced doo-my). Dumai is a city in the Sumatran province of Riau. Members of the public picked Dumai in an online survey of six names submitted by members of the Asian Forest Sanctuary staff who care for the cub.

Born:  Aug. 22 at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.



Birth weight:  Approximately 3 pounds.

Current weight: 14.2 pounds – a 425 percent gain since birth.

Parents:  Mother, Jaya, 9; father, Malosi, 4.

His litter: He was a single birth.
 
Why is he being hand-reared? Zoological staff and veterinarians decided to separate him from his mother when it was clear that intervention was crucial for his health. Within days of his birth, he was not getting enough milk, was dehydrated and his temperature was low. He is now thriving.


**General questions about the tigers**

*Is it rare for two subspecies to be reared together?* Yes. It’s not common, but it does occasionally happen.
 
*What do they eat?* Each of the cubs is fed a special formula designed to give him the nutrients he needs to thrive and grow. Their teeth are coming in, and they also are beginning to eat a type of ground meat.

*How long will they be hand-reared?*  It depends on the tigers’ growth and the zoological staff. Zookeepers will know when the tigers are big enough to thrive without round-the-clock attention. That likely will be when they are 4 to 6 months old and weigh around 100 pounds.

*How long will they live in the Cub Den?*  Until they outgrow it. Then, they’ll be shifted to the Day Room in the Asian Forest Sanctuary.

*How big will they get?* Each may reach 275-300 pounds when fully grown.

*Will Dumai return to Jaya or Berani to his mother at Tulsa Zoo?* No. The two cubs will remain together as “brothers” as they are cared for and shifted onto exhibit at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium.

*How long will they stay at Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium?* That decision is up to Species Survival Plan® officials. Typically, they remain at their home zoos until they are sexually mature, which occurs at about age 3. Then, a decision is made about where to place them for breeding purposes to increase their numbers and maintain genetic diversity in the subspecies. Berani will eventually be mated with a Malayan tiger; Dumai with another Sumatran.
 
*Do other zoos have Malayan and Sumatran tigers:* Yes, but only two other zoos in the United States – Dallas Zoo and San Diego Zoo – have both.
 
*What are the threats to tigers in the wild?* Poaching and habitat loss due to human encroachment on their native lands.
 
*How can people learn more about the tigers?* Go to pdza.org for information on tiger conservation, awareness and fundraising efforts.","1351728068"

Some trains will be running, but those will be delayed too. I'm probably going to work from home tomorrow! Good luck!!!! Let me know how it goes! ","1351728075"

This is all I am saying.

Edit: Just to add, Romney knew about the rules, he asked the Red Cross to break them. So Romney, knowing that, still bought the shit, took pictures (can't take pictures with a big check after all, it'll look fake) and sent them that shit *knowing* that it's going to cause problems.

Okay, so you expect me to believe that you were the very best that your generation of Navy SEALs had to offer? I highly doubt that. If you were as good as you say you were, i don't think for a second that you would be browsing 4chan. This is mostly a place for jobless neckbeards that still live with their parents, and nerdy high school kids that don't have any friends. It really isn't the place for highly-trained assassins to be hanging out in their spare time. Even if it was, something far worse than a troll being mean to you probably would have set you off a long time ago. What about the slew of gore and child pornography that gets posted here on a regular basis? Isn't that something that deserves a person being hunted down and made to regret their actions? Yeah, you're just not the 4chan type. Sure, there's a wide variety of people that browse here, but you're far from the core demograpic if you are who you say you are (which isn't the case). Even if it were true that you're an incredibly talented soldier, I think all the military dispiline would prevent you from getting mad enough to murder some random idiot on the internet. I also doubt that even the best SEALs have a ""secret network of spies across the USA"". Why would all of the most expanisive Big Brother network in the world be willing to help a troubled PTSD-sufferer hunt down some random kid on the internet? That doesn't even make sense. If you're gonna try to scare somebody, make it more believable than ""IM A SUPER SOLDIER HURR DURR"". You might frighten a thirteen year old who doesn't know any better, but to must of us you just look like a kid with an anger problem and a very active imagination. Hopefully things will be easier for you when your puberty's over. Best of luck with that... kiddo ","1351728089"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","&gt; Hey guys,

So we’re going to be doing a big reveal on this stuff soon, but I wanted to give you a quick gameplay peek of the next champion – the Shadow Ninja.

We’ve worked hard to make a cool gameplay loop that is really ninja-y and lets you be pretty clever. Let me run you through it real fast;

• He can make a stationary shadow of himself that then copies his skills when used. For example, you can throw a skillshot shuriken and he’ll also throw one. If they both hit, then you hit with two!

• He can swap places with his shadow to be elusive, set up ganks, or dodge skillshots

• All his skills can double hit!

• Yes, he uses energy

Shadow Ninja’s gameplay isn’t about deceptive clones, but instead copying himself to extend and increase his power or mobility. And since his moves deal with areas or skillshots, setting up the right positioning to double-hit and maximize your damage is really important.

I have a lot of socio-economic advantages and I work very hard.  I have been in the office, working, for the past 45 hours.

I am not yet a member of the capitalist class, but that's a likely destination for me to end up.  I understand that hard work alone has not been enough to get me here, or the rest of the way.

I am extremely privileged.  You may be this privileged too.  I have never experienced hunger outside of fasting.  I have always known where I'll be sleeping.  No one has ever assaulted me.  I have always been safe.  I have never suffered meaningful discrimination.  I have never worried about paying a bill.  I have greater education, career training, and cultural exposure than the statistical average.  By all accounts I am privileged.

So when I look at my neighbor - a decent person with a criminal record and a highschool degree, a person with two kids and the same steady, long term partner, s person who can't get steady work and has had to move in with their parents, a person who just can't catch a break, but always helps the community - when I look at my neighbor I can't say that I earned mine and they earned theirs.

I know that I have been born and raised with a strong advantage, and my neighbor disadvantaged and raised only in the loosest sense.

Just because I was born on third base doesn't mean I hit a triple.  So it's not that impressive that I'm stealing home.","1351728096"

As for getting in store credit right away, doesn't that just take away the whole point of having people buy stuff? As you can only really use 3 skins and 1overlay/UI its only THAT much to be bought and prices can't be high cause then no one would buy outside of the initial credit and without it people wouldn't buy cause they don't want to spend more then the initial 75+60+60Dollars payed already for the game.

My own thoughts are that this would be a terrible idea which would only benefit Blizzard themselves, i think a system where you earn points with a formal as it is win(X)/lose(Y) * a game time looking something like this 

Lets say X would be 1 and Y would be ,5. Game time in this instance would be 53minutes. 

X*53=53

Y*53=26,5

This is how you would earn shop points or we can call it gold. And you get more the longer the game lasts. And double the amount if you win the game compared to lose it.

Yes, which destabilizes the market value artificially. Can you manufacture more? NOPE! And that's a good thing whereas you are limited by how much you can mine at one time, governments can't print more gold to make up for their budgetary needs.

&gt;and human-created jewelry grade diamonds are a huge threat because DeBeers doesn't want the value of their hoard of diamonds to plummet.

This is irrelevant, but Debeers is actually buying the companies that create artificial diamonds, they want to control ALL of the supply artificial and naturally occuring. But the fact remains this is not a stable economy nor would diamonds be a strong basis for economic transactions in general, there are simply too many variables.

As I said earlier, before you ever open a book to study, you should identify before hand WHAT CONCEPTS you are trying to learn.  NEVER read a textbook like a book (unless it really interests you), instead, be strategic about identifying what information you *need to know.*  Here's how.

All courses have THREE types of information you need to know.  Those are:

Explicit task information -- the stuff in the syllabus, deadlines, lab topics, etc.

Implicit task information -- the ""why"" stuff.  The connections the teacher is wanting you to make through the course material.  It's important to use slides and lectures to see what parts of content the teacher is emphasizing, as that's what will be on the test.  

Socio-contextual information -- the department specific ways of learning that you must be mindful of.  English department looks for you to express your learning through writing, while engineering through mathematics.","1351728104"

It's this heat that keeps the plumbing from freezing.  The former owners of our MH didn't know this, and kept the heat real low to save money.  But they paid the plumber a lot more when everything needed to be replaced down there.

Worked out great for us--we got all new pipes down there--but there's a lesson to be learned.

Another protip: NEVER let your faucets drip on a cold day, if you're in a mobile/manufactured home.  That keeps the water moving in a stick-built home, but it will destroy the sewer pipe in a crawlspace or (worse!) a skirted foundation.  The trickling water freezes more easily, and the ice builds up until it ruptures the pipe.  Big, big repair bills.","1351728105"

Only a small amount of Muslims are ""death to western culture"" Muslims, but unfortunately they are nearly the only group who speaks.  To people outside of Muslim circles with little to know contact with Muslims, the inevitable conclusion is ""Muslims hate western culture.""

As an unfortunate consequence, Muslims have an ever growing negative stereotype attached to their religion even though the majority of Muslims have done nothing wrong.  (If you doubt this feel free to flip through the comments of any Muslim related thread on reddit...).  If moderate Muslims wish to not be associated with these stereotypes, they have to find a way to distance themselves from radicals.  Saying nothing won't realistically make people forget those stereotypes.

I'm not saying that this is fair, but it is the way of things.  Obviously everyone should strive to never stereotype any race/religion/group of people.  Everyone but true saints stereotypes to some degree, and its not going to go away (it would be nice if it did), humans are built to think that way.  If moderate Muslims wish to be treated separately from radical Muslims, the only realistic way this will happen is if they make an effort to distance themselves in the eyes of the public from radical Muslims.","1351728106"

You can give it a go with kale - it's ridiculously sturdy. You might be able to get in some radishes, arugula, and some mustards. It's the perfect time to plant garlic as well. 

All you're going to get is greens. That's how winter gardens work in the North, since we don't get enough sunlight/heat to sustain things like eggplant, tomato, etc... If you'd been able to plant at the end of summer, there would be carrots, beets, rutabaga, turnips, and scallions (parsnips and leeks hold well over the winter but need a long growing season of usually ~100 days), but even for greens, they need some shelter, like coldframes or little plastic tents or mini-tunnels along with straw or leaves for insulation.

I expect that a devout Hindu would react to the proof in the same way that certain fundamentalist Christians react to proof that the universe is billions of years old.

What *would* happen, though, is that freedom of religion would become untenable. The concept makes sense only because the government has no way to determine which religion is right.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Here was your initial statement:

&gt; It's just crazy how people hate anybody that supported the doxxing of a Redditor that created a breeding ground for pedophiles.

You seem to think doxxing is okay if it hurts ""the nastiest and most reviled segment of a population"". I'm explaining to you that it cuts both ways, and why there are better solutions than doxxing.

But I'll reply to each of your points one by one.

&gt; Let me point this out: I did not claim VA was distributing CP. But I did claim that he promoted a place where this could have happened (which is just as bad).

I work for a company that promotes the Internet. The Internet is a place where it's possible to distribute CP. Should I be doxxed?

&gt; I admit that my subjective view of the righteousness of this, completely cutting a person down because of this, has nothing to do with the actual law (and we are most likely in different countries anyways).

You probably do something that somebody in the world finds reprehensible. Should you be doxxed?

&gt; But it seems that there is a consensus about this not being acceptable at all (if it is legal or not!). If I was wrong the subreddit would not have been taken down, but rather been used to attract more users to visit this site.

If there's consensus that VA's actions are not acceptable, it's peoples' moral responsibility to make his actions illegal. Therefore, it's more fruitful to put your effort into *changing the law* so actions such as his will result in prosecution.

The subreddit wasn't taken down because VA's actions were not acceptable but because Advance Communications, the company that owns Reddit, did not want to deal with any PR fallout. By the way, /r/jailbait was taken down months before VA was doxxed — not afterwards.

Prior to /r/jailbait being taken down, it *was* used to attract more visits to this site. 

And there lies the pitfalls of being a corporation. Should something that it is borderline morally reprehensible but still legal be used to make money? Or do ethics trump profits?

I tend to believe in the latter, but that doesn't keep companies like Phillip J. Morris from reaping in the big bucks — moral qualms be damned!

Once again, social change rarely happens because people get doxxed. It happens because lobbyists lobby, advocates advocate, voters vote, and consumers consume. 

Disagree with what VA did? Here's better solutions than doxxing:

1. Write letters to government bodies
2. Create social awareness 
3. Vote during elections for politicians that share your views
4. Stop visiting Reddit

These suggestions for you are not for the lazy, but they're more effective.

**TL;DR: The ends don't justify the means, and doxxing is a terrible means.**","1351728115"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","Have you ever noticed that the religious art and music of any given era/region matches up almost exactly with their secular traditions? Consider, for example, Irish Catholic imagery - the Book of Kells was beautiful, but guess what? The druids were already making art just like that *before* missionaries came and told them to use it for Biblical manuscripts. (And yes, they were also a deeply spiritual population, but that wasn't really an organized religion as much as it was a culture including some rituals and mysticism. Their art didn't necessarily have to do with their metaphysical beliefs.) Just because religion becomes a *vehicle* for cultural activity doesn't mean it was necessarily the *source* of that culture.

I think that if humanity evolved never to even invent religion, there would still be plenty of local and regional artistic traditions (and masterpieces), just because that's what people do. Humans are driven to create, because we have feelings we can't express in other ways. It might be *different* but I don't think it would be *less* to the point of becoming a ""con"".

And if we're talking about abolishing religion from this point forward only, then I don't think there's anything wrong with cherishing the legacy our ancestors left us - they might have created for different reasons, and their creations may have different messages, but they are beautiful nonetheless.","1351728117"

JPS18 is indeed juice from the same distillery (Stitzel Weller) that produced the original Van Winkle bourbons. The VW are low on the SW stock and the newer bottlings of 20 and 23 will slowly (if they haven't already) begin to include Buffalo Trace juice into them. 

However, just because was distilled at SW doesn't make it heaven's nectar. SW made high end stuff like Very Very Old Fitzgerald and it made bottom shelf stuff like Cabin Still. It's just like the same Heaven Hill distillate is used to make Elijah Craig 20 (that was named whiskey of the year by Malt Advocate) and regular old Heaven Hill and Evan Williams. So don't go only by reputation of the distillery.

Regardless, I think JPS18 is very good and you can't beat that price.","1351728119"

"circlebroke","t5_2tnz9","I've been on the internet, where intent is really difficult to figure out sometimes, I know it's hard to see that over on smug asshole island. I don't think all of Paul's positions are all realistic, but what president brings us all his promises? I expect if he were to be elected he'd talk to enough advisors and other lawmakers that he'd be able to find a way to reach his ultimate goal of making our currency stable. I expect that because I trust this guy is incorruptible (call me gullible, but it's depressing to view everyone trying to run our world as suits). Don't assume I agree with everything he says, if you want to assume anything assume I like him over the other choices (barring Jill Stein and Gary Johnson, who are both a little less radical about fiscal policy and maintain the bits of Paul's platform ). I think you aren't considering that our current economy with an unchained currency has led us to an addiction to overconsumption and overproduction. We think a healthy economy is an ever growing economy, but that just isn't feasible on a finite planet. We need to start thinking about sustaining rather than growing, and I think our future economy needs to be directly tied down to what we have to physically work with. Granted, the market of ideas brings problems into this, but ideally someone would figure out how to make the art and ideas free while still supporting the creators of the works allowing us to exponentially accelerate the growth of science and the arts rather than restrict it for the gains of the few. I'm sorry if this doesn't really hit at what you're saying, but I really can't understand text through three layers of sarcasm because YOUR VOICE IS ALL THE WAY OVER THERE.

Good to know it was a joke, I agree my request wasn't really possible since I'm asking for proof of the subjective. Also your article shows that although slightly misguided, at least Paul is pushing for the issues that economists agree need to be addressed but NO MAINSTREAM CANDIDATE WILL EVEN MENTION.","1351728122"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Quick explanation for you to have in the future:

This particular church, the Crystal Cathedral, was built in 1980 at a cost of $18,000,000.  The entire outside surface is made of over 10,000 panes of glass.  The church was part of the religious branch ""The Reformed Church in America.""  This church has no ties to the Roman Catholic Church, and only has a total of ~250,000 members.

(Since its founding in the 1950's, the religion has gone through many official belief statements (several of which contradict each other), including the [Belhar Confession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belhar_Confession), the [Nicene Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed), the [Apostle's Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed), the [Athanasian Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athanasian_Creed), and the [Belgic Confession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgic_Confession).)

They are fairly strictly against abortion, gay marriage, the death penalty, and euthanasia.

In 2010, the proprietors of the Crystal Cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy, citing over $43,000,000 in debt.  The church was purchased for $53,000,000 in cash by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange County, California, most noted for its Bishop [Tod Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tod_David_Brown), who reached a $100,000,000 settlement claim in 2005 over a sexual abuse case with 87 alleged victims.

So, TL;DR: the Crystal Cathedral was built by reformed Dutch Protestants for 18 million dollars in 1980.  In less than thirty years, they managed to rack up nearly 45 million dollars in debt, and they had to sell it to a Diocese whose most famous publicity event was a lost sex abuse case.","1351728133"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I'd actually like to counter-argue against part of point #3. While of course the historical context and prevailing opinions of a person's time must be taken into account, it is also fallacious to assume that the present is inherently more ""enlightened"" than the past and that a person of a certain time period couldn't possibly be expected to recognize the ills around them.

For example, today's thread on ""terrible historical figures"" included some criticism of Woodrow Wilson's avowed racism. There were many comments attacking this criticism on the grounds that racist views were exceedingly common at the time.

Coincidentally, a couple of days ago I happened to be browsing some American newspaper archives from 1916 for a project. I was struck by the diversity of thought found in many major newspapers' opinion sections. There were spirited discussions about the rights of minorities, the rights of women, the literal truth of the bible, the validity of capitalism, and other controversial subjects.

Now, it is safe to say that a prominent politician faces more ideological constraints than a (sometimes anonymous) letter writer. But it seems to me that if Wilson's racial views could be attacked by his contemporaries (as they were), there is no reason we can't make similar critiques today.

Is context important? Absolutely. Personally I still consider Wilson a top-tier president. And hindsight bias is a consistent problem that must be called out, primarily among laymen but also among some historians.

Yet I can't subscribe to the idea that presentism is any more of a threat than chronological snobbery.

**TL;DR: Criticizing historial figures for racism, slavery, etc. isn't always ""presentism."" Sometimes people are simply on the wrong side of history.**","1351728138"

For drag racing, I soften the suspension up a bit, otherwise you get something called torque steer, which causes the whole car to veer off to the side into the barrier.

For gear tuning, you essentially want  to redline on the longest straight in the top gear. And keep a smooth gearing all the way through. However, some people go for a higher acceleration in gear 1 to get more traction off the line, and out of tight apexes like hockenheim. (I essentially go from about 5th gear, hard on the breaks downshift into second take the turn, drop it down into first, get the revs up again and shift through the gears again)

A lot of people are scared of tuning the alignment, because it's easy to mess up. For the most part you are fine stock, If you find your car feeling a little heavy in turning, add a little bit of toe in at the front. And the opposite if it's too light turning.

Aero is massive in this game. For tight tracks like ladera, it's almost a must have. It needs to be perfect though, so the car can get enough power out in the straights, but enough grip in the corners, leave it stock at first and test drive to see how you feel.

It's not all about power.. for the most part a good driver can defend their line in a slower car. For example, on le mans, I can hold back SSC ultimate aeros and BugVs in a slower car, because I look in the mirror and veer off to where they are attacking from, a good suspension set up will allow you to veer at high speed and out manouver opponents.

Cornering is the main part of racing, you need to be able to defend your line, and attack the line infront of you whilst cornering. Light cars with downforce and a decent engine work well. Look at the leaderboard cars, they all have good handling levels, and turn well, but they dont have massive top speed.","1351728143"

And if your face was covered (I have no idea what a morphsuit is) then you could be in violation of state statute or local ordinances against wearing masks in public -- though it is Halloween, if you're being a dick (which you probably were, given your description of what happened) the cops can still make you remove a mask or arrest you for refusing.","1351728143"

&gt;Bill Walsh's West Coast Offense differs from traditional offense by emphasizing a short, horizontal passing attack to help stretch out the defense, thus opening up options for longer running plays and longer passes that can achieve greater gains. The West Coast Offense as implemented under Walsh features precisely run pass patterns by the receivers that make up about 65% to 80% of the offensive scheme. With the defense stretched out, the offense is then free to focus the remaining plays on longer throws of more than 14 yards and mid to long yard rushes. Paul Brown, the head coach of the Massillon Tigers, the Cleveland Browns, and founder of the Cincinnati Bengals, was the originator of this playbook; however, he did not name it the West Coast Offense.

* The laws of physics have inherently random processes that cannot be predicted even in principle.

It wasn't necessary to have so many hundreds of different jewels, since I was already swimming in money (which no longer really had a use) and didn't need housing.  It got to the point where sifting through all the jewels in each chest or container of loot was a distraction and annoying.

"exalted","t5_2sgtt","If you're looking for combat advice, you probably want to buy a combo with an unexpected-attack defense, a perfect defense, and a 'move-out-of-the-way' defense, all reflexive, inside.  If you can afford to fit an offensive reflexive charm in there too, that'd be great.  This is called paranoia, and it can either make you too hard to kill, or be required to survive, depending on how tough your GM is on their players.   

Basically what it boils down to is such a combo could be used every turn, since the charms are reflexive and don't have to be used when you use the combo.   This actually makes combat very boring though because you essentially are invincible for however many turns.  If you stunt a lot, gaining motes back, you might even be invincible endlessly, but that's unlikely for a Solar.  Late-game dodge lunars are *really* hard to kill in 2e though.

If you don't want to be *that guy* who min-maxes, I recommend you take the beginning charm in a lot of trees that sound interesting to you.  Definitely take at least Ox-Body technique, and one perfect defense.  

Decide what area you think you would like to focus on, and what area the campaign is likely to focus on.  If the campaign is going to be combat heavy, STRONGLY consider making physical your primary stat, and definitely make it no less than your secondary stat. 

Avoid making a sorcerer, but don't necessarily avoid making a twilight, their anima power is way awesome.  There are rare exceptions - sorcery as enhancement is decently good.  Invulnerable Skin of Bronze and Unbreakable Bones of Stone are both useful defensively, though they're essence-inefficient.  Water Dragon's Claw is good in combat against other Exalted, while Disguise of the New Face and Peacock Shadow Eyes are *very useful* in supplementing social combat.  Also, Cirrus  Skiff is super fun for traveling.  Try shouting ""Nimbus!"" or ""Kintoen!"" when you cast it for facepalms all around. 

But overall sorcery is pretty meh, so I recommend avoiding it as a primary pursuit.

"toronto","t5_2qi63","Let's start with what an online system is. 

A good example is your ATM card, you put your card into the machine and the transaction you want is transmitted to your bank. The bank checks if you have the money, and if so deducts the money and sends a message back.

This requires the ATM to be online with the bank, either directly or indirectly, and can be implemented with dumb cards, and it's relatively secure, as the security logic lives on the bank. 

An offline system doesn't have this connection to a central system. Each reader is self-contained, and you can't use dumb cards, you have to use smart cards. The balance is stored upon the card, and when you tap the reader tells the card to deduct the right amount of money. If you don't have enough money on the card, then it's denied. The central system isn't involved in transactions at all.

With Presto the readers store a record of every card which is read, and each night when the vehicle is serviced the reader is plugged into a network, when the logs are uploaded to the central system. At the same time any payments you've made are downloaded, and if the reader sees the card then it applies the payment to the card.

The advantage for Presto being offline is that giving every vehicle a communications link to the central system would be quite expensive, especially for the smaller transit agencies.

They do take a small risk in that if someone hacks the card, then it would in theory be possible for someone to get some free rides. This however would get caught when the logs were sent to the central system, as the balance on the card would no longer match the value that the central system thinks there should be, and the card could be disabled, again by sending out a message to the readers.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I'd certainly like to stop using the word ""rights"" altogether, it is such a loaded word.

If i had to define it, a right is something that no one should be allowed to take away from you.  While at the same time something that no one should be forced to provide you with either.

An example, you have a right to learn things and retain information or knowledge. No one should be able to take away your innate ability to learn.  But just as importantly, you don't get to force someone to teach you things. 

We throw the word ""rights"" around a lot.  And it does all these weird things, like we get ""gay rights"" and ""women's rights"" and ""Patient's rights"" these are a joke.  There are only one kind of ""rights"", and they should be universal for all people.  No need to sub-develop these groups of special rights.  Even so much that we have ""property rights""  which if we follow the pattern, for some reason sounds like property has rights.  Like my couch has special rights. That are different from ""human rights""  What?  I don't even....

It's also co-opted for any purpose that people want.  It conveniently has that word ""right"" in it.  Which as propaganda goes, is a good one.  ""Its right because its rights.""  So any time someone wants something, they go off about how it is their right.  Which leads to all sorts of weird entitlements, and systems of control.

So, I'd prefer to stop talking about rights, and start talking about ethics.  And what is ethical behavior.  If people simply understand what is ethical behavior, and act ethically.   We would have no concern about any sort of rights we should have, or rights being respected or not.

If you want to criticize Churchill, Gandhi, Columbus, Caesar, George Washington on moral issues, the decisions they made, and why they made them, you must consider what they knew, when they knew it, and why it was that way. Don't criticize Columbus for human rights concepts that wouldn't exist for another 250 years. Don't get upset at Gandhi for doing something that was perfectly normal culturally for him. Don't criticize Churchill for acting completely within the Victorian value system he was raised in.

Thank you!

And there are A-Z as (year codes?) for the registrations. 

I guess this is why Top Gear made a joke about how they allow the sale &amp; auction of personalized plates, then charge you a penalty fee for re-arranging the number plate. 

From what I read, that's correct. You can have a personalized plate from the 60s on your 2012 vehicle, but if you get a personalized plate based on a newer registration from 2012, can't be put on a vehicle from the 90s. 

But you can put a registration plate from any date up until the 90's on there. 

""*Just remember you can make your vehicle look as old as you wish but you can not make it look newer than it actually is. For example you cannot put a Y registration number on a T registered vehicle but you could choose any prefix range from an A to a T. For more information, please see the following question What are the original issue dates of registration numbers? to see the dates of issue.*""

First, around this time last year I was at a frat party with a few of my friends. One of them was in the bathroom and called for me to come inside. I opened the door and she slammed it shut on my finger, and then the blood started. A few brothers wrapped my finger in paper towels and duct tape, gave me a sombrero and some light-up glasses, and sent me on my way. Went to the ER the next morning... no stitches, but hurt like a bitch while it was healing and I couldn't use my finger for a while. Left a pretty cool scar too.

Second one's not that exciting; after a night of drinking everclear punch I came back to my building, went to a friend's room, sat down on one of those demon rocky chair things, and promptly fell off and bruised my entire upper arm. Fun stuff.","1351728172"

Talib, knowing that Wright's suspension was coming, chose not to use his option to appeal the suspension while allowing Wright to appeal his own suspension. This way, Wright was still around to shoulder the burden of Talib's absence and when Wright starts his suspension Talib will be back on the field.

That's a pretty intelligent move coming from a couple of idiots. So maybe one could speculate that the Bucs organization *did* know and directed the CB's to take this course of action.

There is a real thing, which is often called hypnosis, which is a sort of guided meditation. Entering this sort of ""trance"" does result in repeatable changes in test scores taken afterwards. There is absolutely no change in suggestibility (hence why the use of hypnosis to quit smoking never caught on), no loss of consciousness, and no memory loss. Real hypnosis is like a good massage.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","If I was going to kick someone from the party at the last boss (which I would rarely do) then I would make it known in party chat the reason they're being kicked, not in a blunt manner however, as people can get offended easily. The only reason I have ever kicked someone from a dungeon group at any point in WoW or GW2 is because they're behaving like a complete asshat, or have been afk/DC'd for a while.

In these cases people are kicked abruptly before the last boss and are not told why they've been kicked, and no response is given when they ask why they were kicked. However, I don't believe it is against the rules to kick someone if they're preventing others from enjoying the game. 

I agree though that even if the reason for the kicking was announced in party chat there could be abuse of this rule although it would be easier for the support staff to ascertain whether the kicking was unjust if people stated why the person was being kicked.

I have also been in the position where there is a member of the group who is being 'carried'. As long as I can see that the person is trying their best and is willing to learn/listen to advice then I am more than happy to continue, even though it can be frustrating for the other group members. If they really are trying, the other person is going to feel hurt if they're just kicked for 'being bad', nor will they really learn anything to improve their skills so that they can enjoy doing the harder content without having to constantly have the thought that they're ""dragging the group down"" at the back of their mind. 

Tl;dr: Yes, reporting people for this could be abused, so if they're being kicked for a legit reason then make sure they know why they're being kicked. (but don't be rude.)","1351728180"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Not really, plasma can be replaced, in a number of ways, more readily than RBC's and platelets.

Now, that's not to say plasma isn't important, it allows us to fractionate out albumin, which is a large blood protein that helps with volume expansion in surgical and trauma patients, and it contains immunoglobulins that can be used for patients with auto-immune disorders.

It cannot carry oxygen in any capacity that matters unless we get into hyperbarics, nor can it aid clotting.  

I'd far rather be able to give a trauma blood, and ringers or NS or anything else, than be able to give them plasma and no RBC's.  Other physician's may feel differently, but I don't know many that do.

That isn't to say that trauma patients are more widespread, or more valuable, it's a tough thing to truly evaluate.","1351728181"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Remember when Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he'd wipe the jews off the face of the Earth?

He didn't.

Time and time again our Western governments make Iran (and the Iranian people) out to be plotting a nuclear holocaust.

Time and time again we accuse them of arming terrorists, of having nuclear and other WMD desires.

But we don't say anything about Israel's actual nuclear weapons (roughly 300 devices and the missiles to deliver them, which Iran lacks) nor their constant baiting of the Iranian government.

If there's to be another war in the Gulf, mark my words, Israel will start it and we'll all get sucked into another war we have no hope of winning.

And for what?

Because they're the one global theocracy we're not aligned with?

And why the fuck did we sell the Iraqis weapons in the 1980s when they were the ones who started the war with Iran?

Remember - Saddam gassed the Kurds, not the Ayatollah.

And do we really think punching a bear in the nose and belittling them on the international stage, not to mention closing down embassies and shutting off diplomatic ties (which Canada just did) will help bring about stability and peaceful relations?

If we do, we deserve the calamities we bring upon ourselves.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt;My only point is that Vick isn't the main problem or the only problem and replacing him doesn't make the Eagles better instantly. 

I don't think anyone believes that Foles would somehow save this season. If Vick is benched, they'd essentially be seeing what they have in Foles so that they know what priority they should place on drafting a qb next year. This is the same reason why a qb on a winning team (like Cutler) is hard to bench. If the Bears wanted to try out one of their backup qb's they would have a lot more to lose than the Eagles do.

&gt;My only point is that Vick isn't the main problem

Eagles have the 9th ranked defense by DVOA. Their offense is ranked 24th. I can't think of a single player on the Eagles squad more responsible for the Eagles' poor performance than Vick.


* Odds that the Eagles make the playoffs: 5.8%
* Odds that the Eagles make it to the NFC conference: .3%
* Odds that the Eagles win NFC Conference: .1%
* Odds that the Eagles win the Super Bowl: 0%

Furthermore there are no controls, or scripts. Sometimes sample presentations are written down regarding specific subjects or magazines. But Bible Students are free to speak an interact with householders however they want... 

Some find Jehovah's Witnesses focus on the bible boring. But Jesus foretold that before the end of this old broken system of things, there would be a great preaching work throughout the entire inhabited earth.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Actually, I don't, and one of my reasons for browsing MFA is I'm hoping to find an answer. Maybe we need a hybrid subreddit /r/fashioneconomics or some such.

There was a story recently on NPR about Hermes, and their silk scarves. A reporter wanted to know why the price was $200 (or whatever it is) and he set out to do some research. As it turns out, they control the whole process; they own the land where the silkworms live, they own the silkworms, etc. They want to own the whole process so they can guarantee quality control.

I bought a shirt from Ermengildo Zegna once, at a half off sale at a Men's clothing store in Knoxville, TN. The shirt *felt* like quality and fit was nice. At 50% off, the shirt was $115 plus tax. I believe it was made in Italy, but I don't have it now to check. Compared to other shirts I've owned, it was better (though it didn't seem *better enough* comparatively? I spilled oil on the shirt, so I don't wear it anymore to know how durable it might be for purposes of a fair comparison).

I would imagine that items produced in Europe or America would have a higher price tag due to labor, among other factors. I've been inside a Burlington Coat Factory and I've been inside Hermes, and I know there are aspirational consumers who are only buying the brand name or whatever the hell. The Zegna shirt that I had *looked* like any plaid type casual button down shirt. I doubt that any ten people on the street could have identified the maker. I think people who are buying the names are buying names that are more obviously identifiable. TOMMY! and the like. I dunno...","1351728188"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","First off, keep an eye on those bites. Puncture wounds from animal bites usually get infected without extra care.

You'll probably bring down some reddit wrath by suggesting that the breed is at fault. Either way, its not important. Any dog thats kept specifically as a guard dog, and is not socialized, has the potential to be dangerous to strangers.

I'm going to take a pragmatic approach here. You aren't in a position to train this dog, and while you can ask your girlfriend to put some effort into training the dog, that may or may not be a viable option. Its my opinion that you should work with the issues, and work on fixing the issues with training and socializing at a later date.

The most important thing you should be doing in the beginning is have your girlfriend with you when you are around the dog. Hug your girlfriend around the dog. Feed the dog with your girlfriend. Walk the dog with your girlfriend. Any of these things will help the dog recognize you as family rather than a stranger. 

If he is nipping at your hand, this is a problem, you shouldn't brush it off. Most people will advise you that you shouldn't scold the dog for that kind of thing, since it will build a negative association with you. Thats an important thing to consider. If I were your girlfriend, I would scold the dog if it nipped at anyone, but that would be situational, and it would need to come from her, not you. 

Does your girlfriend seem like she has good control of the dog? Does it seem like she's the one in charge?","1351728189"

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","There are more grad (Masters) CS-like folks out there looking for work, with more work experience than you. Especially in the Bay. 

**Review your resume against someone who has the job you want.** Do you see gaps or differences in language, or abilities? If you don't have the abilities they do, get them. If you do, really take a step back and see if an ATS (if you submit online) or a recruiter will view your resume the way you WANT them to. 

**Do you have a website/online portfolio?** If not, claim your domain name on the web and get cracking. It doesn't have to be fancy, just an easy way for people to get to know more about you VERY quickly. 

**Where are you searching for jobs?** If you have no referrals, then it doesn't matter where you came from or what you've done (unless you are the foremost person in your field, and then you wouldn't be working for ANYONE). Are you meeting people/going to happy hour &amp; networking events focused on CS or the job you want to have? If not, get some business cards, get your name out there. You'll go further when everyone knows who you are, and that you're looking for a job. 

**Are you still in touch with your school/program?** Do they have alumni/exit career counseling? If not, it's worth a shot, particularly if you graduated from a school in the area you're living now. If they have a mentorship program, try to get one in your field. 

**Interviews seal the deal.** Practice speaking and putting together answers to the common interview questions, and look up a few that are CS focused. Whenever you get an interview for a company, find out EVERYTHING about them: salaries for the position you're looking for, people who have them (see what their experience is like), and *especially* any crazy interview questions that might throw you for a loop. 

Even after all that, it may not be you. Employers have enough leeway to be really picky. Your best bet is to get face time by referral and knock the interview out of the park.

After level 31 I put points into the sniper tree to increase critical damage, one shot one kill, and bore.  You are limited to weapons such as Hyperion shotguns, SMG's, Vladof assault rifles, and Jakobs or Vladof pistols. You need the high rate of fire to get the most out rising shot. Throw your decoy at enemies, hit them with the kunai, and detonate your decoy with you gun for massive damage. Also one shot one kill applies to all weapons so your first shot coming out of deception does massive damage.  When I was leveling Hyperion shotguns were my best friend and when you hit 50 farm for conference call and the infinity pistol which will do 110%  damage due to it only having one round in the chamber and it's rapid rate of fire.  The downsides are you will need a health regen mod and a cool down relic and mobs will down you fast as hell if you get careless.  You will be constantly running using deception and shooting.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Can get enough current: yes.   Will get enough current: no.

The phone company uses how much current you are pulling off the line in order to determine if the line is on-hook (hung up) or off-hook (in use).  The maximum current available to a subscriber circuit is on the order of 80mA at 5V-12V, and that's an off-hook condition.   Most cell phone chargers want around 500mA.   You may be able to slowly charge your phone's battery this way, but you would need to keep your phone in an off-hook state to do this.  If you try to pull too much current on the line, the phone company may detect this and shut down the circuit, thinking there's a short somewhere.  

Additionally, doing this will violate Part 68 of the FCC rules (at least in the US).    

Trickle charging a phone without taking the line off-hook I believe limits you to 1-2mA at 48V.  

When you call a POTS phone, you will get a ringing voltage.  This is typically as much as 100VRMS AC, and can provide a lot more power (5 REN, or about 50mA).  68VAC RMS is a more typical number at the subscriber circuit. In the US this is 2 seconds on, 4 seconds off.  It would certainly be possible to charge up some capacitors with that.   However, I'm not sure how much real power you could get out.  Assume 68VAC RMS and 50mA maximum draw.  That's about 6.8 J of power per 2 second ring.   

A typical 1000mAh cell phone battery has about 13,000J of energy in it.  

If we had a mystical battery charger that was 100% efficient, it would take 1955 rings to charge your phone.  That's not too bad-- only about 3 hours of ringing.   The downside is that real battery chargers are nowhere near 100% efficient.  You're really looking at as much as 6-10 hours of ringing your phone to charge a cell phone battery.","1351728208"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Long story short, Dragoneer, owner of the furry website FurAffinity and CEO of the FurAffinity: United convention (aka FAU), was harassed at this past Furfright convention by a member or two of the [Dorsai Irregulars](http://www.di.org/). The Dorsai are at best described as an inflate-a-cop volunteer security force hired on by a few furry conventions including the biggest one (Anthrocon) and a few sci-fi conventions. They have been known to act like enormous dicks as if they have some authority wherever they are hired to police. They have gotten many complaints from wherever they've been hired, but nothing has ever come of it.

However it wasn't just Dragoneer. At least one attendee was physically assaulted by being shoved, others were stalked and followed to their rooms, one Dorsai claimed to be the hotel manager demanding identification from someone in the lobby, and a couple of others during a fire alarm engaged in actions that could have put a lot of people in danger.

Dragoneer here is a big voice that finally stepped up to the plate to publicly voice the shit that's going on and bring attention to the issues. In turn, the CEO of Anthrocon got hold of his fiancee and him by misusing Anthrocon's attendee database to get their personal email addresses and told them they need to knock it off. Negative reactions ensued on that part due to that being a major breech of privacy, etiquette and professionalism. ","1351728214"

I can say diet A is better than diet B if I study them long term under constant conditions, but I can't say food X caused disease Y that group B got less of.  Looking at cholesterol levels without total mortality isn't adequate, especially when trans fats are involved.

If you eliminate meat, you eliminate lots of trans fats, but going organic does the same thing.  You also improve the omega 6:3 ratio b/c of more veggies.  You also get a ton of vitamins/minerals that you were deficient in.  So is it the meat, the trans fat, or the omega 6:3 ratio or the deficient vitamins &amp; minerals, or is it the meat?  Well, there's a good chance it's not the meat.

Show me a nutritional comparison of the vitamin and mineral content of someone who is on a paleo diet and someone who is on a vegetarian diet.  Also, show me some diabetics who follow the diets because if you're diet is not applicable to everyone, chances are it's not a good diet.

Alternatively, show me people with serious chronic diseases (e.g. MS, Chron's disease, IBD, fibromyalgia, etc.) that follow a vegetarian diet and follow a paleo diet.  Does anyone get healthy?  

Also, paleo is technically plant based.  You should be getting 100+ grams of fiber per day.","1351728221"

Angles are measured relative to the horizontal axis. So suppose you have a ray with angle theta intersecting the circle at a point A (as illustrated). You can draw a line tangent to this point, meaning the line and ray form a square angle. This line will intersect the horizontal axis at a point E and the vertical axis at a point F. TAN is simply the length of the segment AE, while COT is the length of the segment AF (all relative to the length of the unit circle).

All the trig ratios just relate triangles which are constructed using a ray, the unit circle, the horizontal axis and the vertical axis.","1351728223"

One benefit to CO2 is if you're in a hot climate most of the time, like Florida. The heat in the atmosphere makes CO2 more consistent. In colder weather, it's not nearly as good since it has the opposite effect. 

HPA is just more consistent overall, since it's gas in the tank and it's gas in the gun. The phase shift with CO2 makes it variable how much pressure you're getting. ","1351728223"

"cringe","t5_2r6rj","Every suggestion that this kid will be somehow harmed by his pursuit is *probably* misinformed. He's actually in excellent condition, and building great habits for a healthy life and a successful athletic career.

There is a whole world of mythology surrounding the dangers of weightlifting for youth. Handling heavy weights is not dangerous for children, otherwise millenia of heavy farm labor would have disabled most children over the course of human history. There is a theory advanced that heavy weight can warp growth plates and stunt growth. There is no medical data to support this claim, and logically: if pressure could damage a growth plate, wouldn't a break be worse? If so, everyone who ever broke a bone before they were done growing would have some noticeable asymmetry from the injury; the lack of a massive adult population with this issue proves that breaks are not dangerous. [More here.](http://www.lonkilgore.com/ssyouth.pdf)

Further, one doctor in the video suggests that the child would have to be on steroids. Steroids are incredibly detrimental to the development of any pubescent, no question, and if he is using them he is being abused. However, there is no proof that this child was on steroids. Frankly, his actual muscle mass is unimpressive; I would believe that it was possible with dedicated training for a child to achieve that amount of muscle. Some people will suggest that it is impossible to add muscle without significant testosterone levels; if this were true, women at any age would find it impossible to add muscle.  [Jennifer Thompson would like to discuss that with you.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34XRmd3a8_0)

It is important to note that most of what gives bodybuilders ""the look"" is an incredibly low body fat percentage, typically around 6-10% for males. That's what makes you look ""ripped"", not muscle volume. [Consider the famous Brad Pitt fight club photo.](http://bradscottfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Brad-Pitt-Fight-club-Workout.jpg) That's actually a really small man, as far as muscle goes. It's just a very lean man. There is no danger whatsoever to this child having a low BF percentage (though catastrophically low percentages are dangerous). If anything, he bucks the modern trend of children becoming dangerously obese before they are even old enough to make their own dietary choices.","1351728224"

She's a person. Her weight is only one thing about her, and you're focusing on a very superficial detail. I get the kind of tone that implies, ""Well, for a fat person, you're pretty decent-looking.""

You're also making a lot of generalizations about ""fat"" people here, and unfairly implying there are distinctions for what qualifies as ""pretty"" by weight. Stigma about overweight people is unfortunately rampant these days, and a lot of what you've said here comes across as very unfair: 

&gt;That pic is fat, and yet I'm drawn to it like any other sexy slim pinup girl 
&gt;
&gt;The word ""beautiful"" might fit best
&gt;
&gt;Often when someone is fat it significantly interferes with the standard sexual cues, where she loses her shape, and the face gets undefined

You may have been going for a positive vibe, but IMO it doesn't shine through very well in this case.

Also, ですが sounds a bit strange since you have the です in the middle of the sentence. You could use just が or better still, けど.

あまりあつくなかったけど、ちょっとさむいです。

Finally, the tenses are different. Your original sentence has an implied ""was"" since it's a combination of two sentences in the same time frame -- ""It WASn't very hot, but [it WAS] a little cold."" Likewise, you'd want さむい to also take the past tense.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","The difference is that there is ONE tape confirmed by everyone involved (that aren't even on the tapes) to have a legit explanation. That was given right then and there. PdC never even acknowledged his involvement, nor did he explain anything... Because things can be taken out of context (even though... in those... I hardly think so).

The sports you mentioned, some lacked investment (and were on the brink of closing) and just recently were brought back. Just take in last season. Benfica won almost every sport (but handball, I admit). And winning two championships in a row is not an anomaly. Not even 10 if you're the only team investing on the sport. But winning more championships than every other team combined while they all invest heavily, for over 30-35 years, that is an anomaly.

And by the way, befica won 3 of the last 4 Basketball championships.

And glad you only mentioned 2 sports where Porto is clearly besting Benfica has over 15 professional teams. On the others, some Benfica dominates, others are even, but THAT is normal. They even out, but Benfica manages to win some and lose some.

Miles worse, by what measure? Apart from the team Mourinho built, no other team was miles ahead of any other. They have been even through and through. And reaching an European final does not prove anything. Ask Sporting and Braga that did so with mediocre teams.

You say the nationwide titles prove the teams were better, but that's exactly my point and a huge fallacy. There are many reasons for Porto to have won more championships, and only one is a better team. If you steal the trophy every year, you're not the best team. At all. It's logic 1 o 1.

The difference with stability is that Porto sacks managers right before the start of a championship and they still win. They lose them to Chelsea and still win. They lose key players, and they still win. And that happening once or twice, it's fine. That happening every single time, it's not. And, in my opinion, it proves there is something fishy.

And I don't doubt for a second they might all crooks. they also might not. But PdC has irrefutable evidence that he, indeed, is a crook. It is not word of mouth or anything else. That, tied to the statistical anomalies I've been talking about is enough to convince me that Porto has not been playing fair. Have the others? That's for you to prove otherwise. I'm sure they've been stealing them one way or another.","1351728237"

"Diablo","t5_2qore","Diablo 3 is run on a rather large server.  Most likely there are multiple processing threads at work each dedicated to a different aspect of play experience.  Let's say we're dropping quite a few items in one go, the drop calculations are likely done on their own thread but what if there is another drop going on at near the same time on a different thread with the same or similar seed, there is potential for duplicate drops.  This explanation of course only works if drop processing can exist on multiple threads at once for a single game instance and that some of the random generation has to do with a game or character ID (otherwise the time an item is dropped would be the only significant factor in item generation).  That is certainly possible but you would need to get both to drop within a small timeframe to ensure both drop threads still had the same seed (call me crazy, but I'm wagering seeds for item generation would be refreshed pretty frequently).

Also none of this has anything to do with the current issue.  This entire fiasco reminds me of the account hacking incident shortly after launch, everyone is blaming some wildly complex attack method being the source of the problem while it is in all likelyhood a very simple method.  Peoples accounts were not hijacked due to a complex widespread session hijacking attack then and items are not being duplicated by a complex manipulation of the item generation scripts now.","1351728238"

I do know that it's possible to be ""strategic"" with your investments in order to minimize your tax liability.  You can write off investment losses - so some people hold onto bad stocks *on purpose* so that when they sell them, they get a big tax write-off.  Somehow, this balances out so that in the end they save more money by not paying taxes than they lost on the bad stock.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I am glad to hear that some of the problems that have been mentioned over the course of the last few days are actually being addressed, but the main points still kinda... aren't.

Clan support is good, leveling is okay, I guess, assuming they find worthy prizes for the points you gained (little pictures next to your name that nobody cares about? Pass.). Stats sheets never hurt, but is more of a competitive player's feature. Blizzard already has the ability to give certain players custom models (such as the pre-order Thor) so why not give small style changes to some of the models and make those available as things you can buy with the level experience. The technology is already basically there.

But they still didn't address major issues with their custom map, and non-ladder scene. Likely the largest amount of players in the brood war days were the people who played and created custom maps using the map editors (technically most people relied on third party map editors, but the first party one was pretty good too). Honestly, I think somewhere around 80% of my time playing broodwar was in the map editor, playing around with things, or playing custom maps. I probably only played 10 or so legit games on back then, and usually it was just ""Blood Bath 1v1v1v1"" and I just ling rushed every time, even if the rules said ""No rush 20 min plox"" or BGH 2v2v2v2, where I would just unconditionally ling rush my neighbor and use their base as my first expansion. I don't recall ever playing an official Blizzard ladder game back in Broodwar.

The custom maps scene is just bad, and everyone knows it. To do the simplest things in the map editor that Blizzard released with the game requires a lot of work. I think it is neat that there is a lot of power in the map editor, more than the original, but at the same time, the ability to do even basic changes to a unit have become incredibly more difficult. That isn't even talking about Battle.net 2.0's lack of game lobbies, which make only the absolute most popular few maps the only maps anyone ever plays. Non competitive play lacks a lot in SCII, and I think this is the real issue that has to be addressed. The other things, including the ones that they have done, are kinda superficial. Obviously, these changes are way more complicated and won't be made any time soon.","1351728241"

"mwo","t5_2t1w0","Firstly,  I would say you have a tendency to be a bit too trigger happy; when you see someone even briefly, you tend to commit to firing your medium laser only for them to go around a corner. On that note, be aware of what part of your body each weapon comes from with respect to buildings and natural obstacles eg. at one point you shot your autocannon into a wall that was rising well above your torso height; just because your targeting reticule(s) can see something doesn't mean it's going to be something you can hit, unlike older FPS games where your weapon would be in (generally) your right hand and to the side, but in reality it (and your first person viewpoint) were mounted on your chest.

Also, don't take the 'lone wolf' concept too far (especially early in that match). Your team may not type a single thing but if people are converging on a target together, it's best to join them. They're effectively signaling ""Let's light up Foxtrot"" even if they aren't explicitly typing it out. Safety in numbers and efficiency and all that jazz. 

As you are packing an autocannon, check your fire! You were so desperate to score a kill and get that raven that you blasted your teammate instead (for confirmation, none of his parts showed that they had been damaged in the targeting screen, as opposed to while you were painting him with the medlas). A big ol' autocannon like that hurts like a motherfucker and that centurion was already really damaged. 

Think about your targets. After your first medlas shot in plain sight of that Dragon, a large las hit him from behind and melted his right leg. Your next medium laser shot went a bit awry and then converged.... on the left leg. So you didn't miss, I think you just got confused. But after that you then tried to core him through armor... if you want to be financially better off, get some extra money by legging him first. It would also have made your job a lot easier, and an autocannon shot to the leg or even a few well-painted laser shots would have blown that sucker off (not sexually). 

I had to stop watching after that and I have to finish writing this right now as I have to bail. 

As for autocannon aim, you'll get there and I can't criticize you on that; I've spent all my closed beta experience in a swayback with lasers. Now I tried the standard hunchy with an AC 20, and at 200+ ms it isn't perfect but you learn to adjust. I'm sure that will be just fine.","1351728252"

* [Valerian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuNVTHr6hy8) (note: slightly different from the album version)


* [Xarella Almandyne](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGn4ZcUldjA)

* [Mother of Pearl](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CKHSvEU8F8)


their other albums are good, but not as nearly as interesting as Xuvetyn. 

Astrobrite is also the guy from Lovesliescrushing, but I think that project's a little too up MBV's ass. If you really must get anything by them, Boombox Supernova is decent in that it's closer to Lovesliescrushing.

also: Monoland. Sounds like MBV with a more electronic/trip-hop-ish bent to it. All 3 of their albums are great, though I would start with Manouva (a.k.a. self-titled) or Cooning.

Plus dropping from an airplane on any part of the map you wanted to go to was so amazing, if you were stupid you could drop right into enemy territory for god's sake! The whole gun upgrade system also was great because it made you feel like you were gaining so much from using the crummy Kar at first cause you knew its upgrade would be awesome.

"Minecraft360","t5_2tjtf","remember to keep your map in a chest when you aren't using it (one death and it is gone -unless you can race back to the spot in time- to make a new one you need redstone and iron and paper), and take a bed and some torches with you when you explore overland.

When night comes in the wilderness, dig into the dirt forming a stairway 3 deep, put a torch on the wall at the bottom, plug the entrance, and dig out a room big enough for the bed and a walkway around it. You can do this without a bed but then you won't know when morning comes. Sleep in the bed, and when you wake up it is usually safe to emerge and keep exploring (remember to take your bed again!) 

If you don't have a bed the safest way to deal with night is to jump-place a block underneath you over and over until you are about 30 blocks up, then, go get a snack while night passes. It isn't as nice as a cozy den but you can see when daytime comes. If you do a den with no tower, wait for the sound of burning zombies in the morning, if none are around though, you won't get that clue.

Lastly, if you have a torch, you have a compass. Put a torch on the ground and move around it so that the orange square is in the top right, the white square is in the bottom right, and the two yellow squares form a stripe down the left hand side, you are now facing north (also the sun actually rises in the north, who knew?). This is really helpful underground or when you get turned around and forget which way is what in the forest and you want to race back to your sanctuary before nightfall and you don't have your map because it is safe in a chest so you won't lose it when you die..","1351728263"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Well, it is a little different here because Luther believed  he was helping the Jews. Hitler had no pity. At least at his core, Luther wanted every person to experience eternal bliss and was altruistic (though very misguided), he did not hate the Jews, he wanted to free them from damnation and thought people should stop at nothing to do so. The idea of religious tolerance really had not even been considered by western people at that point. Hitler, on the other hand, was motivated by selfishness and hatred. He offered the Jews no redemption and did not believe he was helping them. Hitler simply wanted them removed.

"LetsNotMeet","t5_2t3t8","Hey you!!! I cannot believe that you remember all of this! Just so you know; Jon's mad at the moment. I sat here and read this and cried like a little girl. He was curious so he read it too and now he's out in the garage and hasn't talked to me in the last hour. I started to just email you, but I decided that I wanted to post this on here for everyone else to see too. 

I want to address those who had negative comments about this story and parts of it being unimportant or impertinent. For the two years that ""J"" and I were together we both learned and discovered a lot about life. I don't know how to explain to you how it felt to be so loved by someone. The thing I remember that touched me the most is that we would be doing homework or something and I'd catch him just staring at me out of the corner of my eye. If I asked why he would always tell me that he was memorizing me, remembering my face and smile. You simply can't imagine the effect that has on a 14 year old girls' heart. It was love in it's purest form. It was love for me. Moreso, it was adoration. I know that now and hold it all the more precious to me because of that knowledge. J was also my first love and kiss and everything else. Furthermore, I know how he felt to be with me. I know that in loving and sharing our time together that I helped to shape and form the man who is pouring out his heart in these stories. You people should be honored that he is giving this to you instead of bitching and whining about how it's too long or unimportant. To you, it may be unimportant, but to him and me, this was our life. I was privileged to have known such love at such an age. I too used that kiss and that love as a measuring stick. And while I know that my husband loves me and I love him, J will always be my first ""true"" love. Better yet, our love has survived almost 30 years now. It has changed, yes, but it has also deepened and grown into something that I personally feel you should be honored to have shared with you. 

J, I want to thank you for this. I will have Kinzie and Becca read it later. Don't worry about Jon, he's always been jealous, but he has read these too and understands that you're simply telling about your past.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","What concerns me the most about a Romney win is the validation of the absolutely no compromise model the Republican's adopted in 2010. It will have shown that you can remain obstinate, refuse to compromise, and still have your guy elected. I can think of no reason that the Democrats wouldn't adopt this salted earth mentality to help clear Romney out of the White House and minimize his legislative agenda at the same time. After a Romney win, it would show the idea works.

Now, there is no reason to expect the Republicans to give up on this tactic if Obama wins. In fact they have already stated that they plan to keep it up even if he wins, but, I do expect a major blow up in the Republican party. There is going to be a ton of finger pointing if Romney looses, and it is going to dredge up a lot of that bad blood that was present in the primaries. Libertarians are still pissed at how they, and their candidate were treated at the convention, and the far right will pull out the ""I told you Romney couldn't win"" card. It might serve as the final straw between moderate republicans and the far right. I'm not 100% sure that Republican leadership in the house and senate can hold together their coalitions they need to sustain their take-no-prisoner approach.","1351728265"

Mid-range jumpers are either a) granted to centers and power forwards because their defenders stick to the paint or b) are scored by guys like Dirk who use their athleticism and length to get space where there isn't any.

Post crossover pull up mid-range jumpers are pretty tough. A guy like Harden (who is extremely creative and athletic near the rim) doesn't need to attempt that tough of a shot. And no defender in their right mind will leave him open from 15 feet, so most of the time that he finds himself about 15 feet from the basket, he's on the run and using his momentum to get to the rim.","1351728266"

Are you saying that if you hit someone with your car, but you were trying to be safe and it was an accident that you shouldn't have to pay for that person's hospital bills because it's not your fault? 

I'm at a loss for words that people don't get this. That you were trying to drive safe doesn't mean an accident isn't your fault. If you were trying to drive safe but still accidently hit a pedistrian you would still be accountable for that persons well-being.

That person is in the hospital because of your actions and in real life it doesn't matter if it you were trying to be safe or not (try telling that to a judge!). It's still your fault and you're responsible.

&gt; Ah, yes, well, bringing us right back to square one - yes, it is a risk of pregnancy. But it isn't a risk of carrying a pregnancy to term because we've developed technology (abortion technology) to eliminate that risk.

So then the fetus is the one that should pay for the mother and father's decision to have sex? To me, that's a twisted way of looking at it since the fetus isn't the one responsible for the fact it exists. 

Granted someone would only believe that if they didn't think the fetus had any value (which it doesn't sound like you do). I don't see why it wouldn't and the graphic you posted doesn't really prove anything.","1351728269"

"BarefootRunning","t5_2rp0r","There is some restricted side to side movement for the toes. I have a pair of NB Trail Zero to compare, and there is more side to side movement in those but not a massive amount (as the toe box is reasonably narrow - I had a better toe spread in the original Minimus Trail)

Judging by other runners' comments on this issue it will affect some people a lot more than others. 

I think what VFFs are incredibly good at is providing bend for the toes as the foot leaves and meets the ground - and I've not found a shoe with a continual sole that allows that in the same way - perhaps the other toe shoes on the market allow this too. Personally I would much rather sacrifice some side-to-side movement for the vertical flex of the foot than vice-versa.

I found that running in the Trail Zeros my right foot became sore around the ball of the foot due to associated muscle strain of loading the foot differently. 

Another thing to note is that the restriction of side-to-side toe movement varies a lot from model to model. This is precisely why I didn't buy the Spryidon as the toes did feel rather too constricted in those in the side to side, and the shoe just felt too bulky. 

With time I've noticed that so long as I'm not fatigued, I can run any length of trail in KSO Trek Sports and don't need more protection than that. I use my classics for shorter runs, and am about to trial the Seeyas on trails once I get them (understanding that I don't want to destroy them). ","1351728274"

I'll assume you read what you posted, and noticed yourself that this article did not specify that the word ""gaijin"" is derogatory or discriminatory. 

For others, the gist of this wikipedia article about the word gaijin is :

- it's a old word, nowadays used as the colloquial form of Gaikokujin. It's particularly used for non-Eastern Asian ethnicities.

- second paragraph is about other words that were used for westerners (nanbanjin, ijin, koumoujin, etc.)

- and third paragraph is what this is all about, how non-Eastern Asians, and specifically Europeans and Americans, feel that this specific word emphasizes the ethnicity rather than the nationality and is discriminatory, and is sometimes indeed used in discriminatory situations (eg. school playgrounds). It finishes by stating that even if used without such intention, there is a growing feeling in the non-Eastern Asian foreigners living in Japan that this word is discriminatory. Which I assume is what you feel.

TLDR; ""gaijin"" is not discriminatory, unless you make it so.

The same objection can be used to justify skewing the results towards a higher GOP turnout. While that may be true, there's not enough data to warrant making an adjustment.

Also, all of the polls claim to randomly sample (and the best ones make allowance for cell phones and internet usage as well). I can't help but think that this would help to overcome this skew.

But the real answer is I don't know.

This is further exacerbated by Consumer Reports, in which comfort/handling are supreme, not capability. Chrysler want to be CR recommended, so they sacrifice capability for comfort.

The one who cleans makes $8.50/hr. The other three make $15/hr. We have a fully stocked fridge for the employees and I bring them lunch everyday (real lunch, like they order from chili's, fuddruckers, the Latin restaurant around the corner, sushi, etc. And i pay for it, every day). We pay and give off most major holidays, and don't give you crap if you can in sick. 

You have no idea how ridiculously hard it was to find employees. People would show up for a day or two and never show up again. Other ones would show up late and not do work. It was a nightmare. I was this close to actually putting up an ad like that. I finally found a staff I'm happy with, and they all bend over backwards to do stuff when it's crunch time without hesitation. 

I do however run a business and not a charity. We are almost always very busy and I strive to be as efficient as possible with my small staff (we get stuff done faster, better, and more efficiently that companies much bigger than us). If you want a job where you sit on the computer on facebook all day, you can fuck off. My employees do not have time for Facebook even if they wanted to. 

Edit: honestly I think it's a problem with younger people and entitlement mentality. I'm 26 years old, own the fucking company, and I am the youngest person by about 10 years. Every young person I've hired has been nothing but problems and hasn't lasted more than about six weeks.

Acetaminophen, caffeine, some kind of opiate like Morphine, Fluoxtetine for sanity's sake, Lansoprazole, [To help repair your esophageal lining from eating things you shouldn't] and antiemetic like Dolasetron, [Metformin,](http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/health/120706/diabetes-drug-may-help-regenerate-brain-cells) an ACE inhibitor such as Benazepril for heart failure, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, chloride, zinc, iron, manganese, copper, iodine, selenium, molybdenum, vitamins A-K, some form of steroids, Flurbiprofen, possibly Gabapentin for seizure prevention, Mefliam to fight the inevitable blood infections, Meloxicam or another NSAID, Vesicare for bladder control, Fioricet for muscle tension, and Ciprofloxacin is almost always a good idea.

And depending on if it's a virus or an infection;
A heavy-duty anti-biotic like Penicillin, Methicillin, Amoxicillin, or a heavy-duty anti-viral, like Ganciclovir, Stavudine/Etravirine/Darunavir [Depending if you want and NRTI, an NNRTI, or a Protease Inhibitor] 

And more recently discovered; [DRACO](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2011/antiviral-0810.html)

That being said, the person would likely have to be in an induced coma, and on a ventilator, dialysis, a ventricular assist device [VAD], and many other, with IV's coming out of every pore. They'd probably be better off with a blood transfusion, a splenectomy and an appendectomy, and probably removing a few limbs and possibly other unsalvageable organs. They probably still would not make it. Even if one were to cure the virus, depending on how long they were dead, it is more and more likely that curing the virus will kill them, because with all the damage one takes as a zombie [all their organs shutting down, muscle deterioration, the initial bite, infections, parasites, lack of hygiene, exsanguination, possibly missing limbs or organs all together, etc.] the virus or infection is the only thing keeping them alive in that condition. If somehow this cure works and they live again, they probably won't ever be able to move on their own or live without machinery keeping them alive, let alone go back to a normal life.

Hope this helps.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","No, you're a laymen for saying that NuSi only found faults with some of those studies because it goes against what you think they stand for (NuSi's objective is to find answers not to prove that low-carb is superior).  Go read the studies for yourself, they're poorly conducted and they should be mostly dismissed.  They aren't being dismissed because of biases in this specific case, but rather, because they are a disgrace to the scientific method.  It's irrelevant if you believe in Taubes theory or not in this specific case because the vast majority of the studies in that list are inherently flawed.  In fact, i would say you're bias _against_ Taubes if you actually find those studies compelling and proof of something.  

Also, 'mainstream' science has done no such thing.  Claims like these further prove to me you're a laymen that doesn't understand how real science is done.  I eagerly await the day that nutrition and dietary science steps up the quality of research such that is comparable to other fields (such as physics and chemistry).  Until then, we're stuck with no conclusive answers and the only thing we can do is speculate like Taubes has done.  And to further prove you have no clue how science is done, there's no such thing as right or wrong answers in science.  Even a wrong answer is an important piece of evidence that leads to the correct answer in the end (because that wrong answer tells us what the right answer can't possibly be so it helps narrow things down).  So even if Taubes is wrong, his book has helped open people (especially researchers and doctors) up to the possibility that we don't know everything yet, that the science is mostly fairly poor in this field, and there's a lot of work to be done to get to the right answer.  So in the end, it doesn't mater if Taubes is right or not, he still helped contribute to the definitive correct answer.","1351728305"

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete"," Please note that the bias here is thick enough to slice. City Journal is the publication of the overtly conservative Manhattan Institute, and Bruce Thornton's famous for being on the Catholic right. Reading on...

* As flawed as his arguments were, Malthus was decidedly *unpopular* by the time of the Great Famine. Before the 1840s however it was used to justify the workhouse system and laissez-faire ideas. That's why people got pissed at Darwin for mentioning Malthus later on. It's a familiar British trope of blaming government screwups on the dead or foreign (the mythologizing of Rommel for example).

* Darwin was a devout Unitarian for part of his life, then deist, and finally agnostic. This implies that he was always a hardened secularist for fuck's sake

* The weeding out quote is from Zubrin, not Darwin, and is a blatant paraphrase of an essay from an *Anglican theologian* attacking T.H. Huxley. That's selective editing on the part of Thornton, if not Zubrin outright.

* While Darwin definitely did not like aid to the poor by the time he wrote *Descent of Man*, he believed it was a necessary evil (from the same paragraph quoted!). 

* DDT? Oh come on. Stockholm banned field and crops spraying due to bioaccumulation-related effects, and vector control around housing is still legal. Keep in mind that within 30 generations, *Anopheles* spp. mosquitoes became DDT-resistant in the targeted areas in south Asia. This endless corpse-roasting of Rachel Carson by the right seems invulnerable to evidence.

* Not surprisingly, this is followed up with a furore over AGW. Is he really saying that that's nothing but anti-humanism? Amazon reviewers compare it to *State of Fear*. That sounds like he's shooting himself in the foot, considering how big backers of near-earth colonization tend to worry about environmental trends and resource depletion.

I think radical environmentalists are wrong-headed but this seems like a screed. I'd fully fisk this, but it seems like reactionary ""old man yells at cloud"" book #5000. Neo-orthodox theologians and 'cultural critics' like Theodore Dalrhymple (sp?) have said much the same before, but they're pessimists to Zubrin's optimist. I know Kenan Malik's *Man, Beast, and Zombie* goes after these kinds of historical trends with nuance than hinted in this review.","1351728310"

"moderatepolitics","t5_2s6h3","To be clear, I majored in politics back in college, I'm pretty sure I know the differences. 

Liberalism is a social platform. It's progressive, and has a wide range of social beliefs that very throughout the scale. However it's specifically around social issues. Then there are party affiliations, which are concerned with the concept of government and it's role in society. Again, there is no firm ""Republican"" belief, but it varies from person to person, however, there is a general idea of what the party supports.

When it comes to economics, a party can choose economic policies, but they are not necessarily inherent within the party. In fact, parties would often change whether or not they are progressive or liberal, as well as it's economic policies. Even further, until recently, Republicans weren't all required to be conservative, and Democrats all required to be liberal. Looking back, Clinton would have been considered a moderate Democrat with a fiscally conservative economic policy (not to be confused with social conservatism). 

So there it is, Liberalism is not inherently an economic policy. If you ask some Libertarians, they would consider themselves liberal, but have radically different economic convictions. ","1351728311"

Thing is, Tebow's wonky skill set is good off the bat for a team that's willing to build to him. But there's no potential for improvement. When he lands with a new team, he's as good as he'll get within a couple games. You could argue he hasn't been given the chance, but anyone with a little football knowledge can see that it wouldn't really work out. In this NFL, that's simply not the most effective way to play.

So if you're trying to find Gabbert's successor now, stay the fuck away from Tebow. Pick yourself a good solid Luck, or an RG3 triple threat type QB. Potential is there in leaps and bounds. Not a pure athlete who makes things happen by dicking around near the line of scrimmage, with an occasional deep ball. 

I don't really get your point. Are you saying Tebow is better than a lot more QBs because of what he did in Denver? For one, I don't think it'd happen again, and two, his supporting cast was all there. Lots of the underperforming QBs in the league are surrounded by shit.

In his first season with a team, Tebow ought to be better than half or so of the leagues' starting QBs' first seasons, providing their offensive coordinator is up to the challenge. However, many teams at the moment already HAVE well-adjusted quarterbacks. My statement was that only a few offenses would stand to gain NOW from switching to Tebow NOW. Maybe I can expand ""a few"" to ""5 or 6"" (on top of KC and Jax, I'd consider adding Cleveland, Tennessee, Arizona, and if I'm allowed to, the Jets themselves).","1351728314"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","#49 polt vs jinro in the round of 16, I'm so excited! Just need to type up a paper and then I will watch the games. 

Alright, actual matches. 

Game 1-jinro opens 11/11 and puts on pressure vs a 1 rax hellion opening. Only causes a little damage, but expands behind it. He holds of polt's attack while teching to cloaked banshees. Polt only had 4-5 marines, and the cloaked banshees win it. 

Game 2- Really weird build order by todays standards, but polt opens 1-1-1 and gets reactored vikings to meet jinro's cloaked banshees after expand. Jinro fails to do damage, and polt has a decent advantage. Polt then proceeds to move into jinro's natural and gets shredded by jinros seiged tanks. ""biggest blunder in all of GSL""-tasteless. Jinro pushes and wins. ","1351728314"

"canada","t5_2qh68","It's hard to be sure, but I think he/she is genuinely angry at ""cisgender"" people.  Perhaps the anger comes from his/her perception of cisgender people being unable or unwilling to understand the issues of gender.

I still need to do more research, but the impression I get is that the community of people who dislike ""cisgender"" people is a very small minority.  Their movement appears to be quite exaggerated (in terms of scope) on places like reddit and 4chan, where general contempt/intolerance for the movement can be found.

The whole movement is an offshoot of academic studies in the topic of gender orientation (which is considered as something distinct from sexual orientation), and from what I gather is the last ""frontier"" in bringing public awareness to LBGT issues.

The point of faking death with DR is to trick enemies into thinking regardless of your class, you're dead, and hence not a threat. If you're not a threat, their awareness of you is lower, and your chance of a successful kill on them is therefore higher.

"science","t5_mouw","some degree of ductility is good to have with reinforcing, yes.  as you said composites like FRP reinforcing do fail suddenly, as opposed to steel which yields at 400 MPa and then continues to handle stress before failing.  But that's just a good property of the material, not the reason we use it.

We use the steel reinforcing to handle any tensile (pulling apart) forces that the structural component may experience.  Compression is easily handled by the concrete, but concrete itself isn't good with tension.   To give you an example concrete's ultimate compressive strength varies based on several factors (mix, curing environment, etc), but is generally somewhere between 20-40 MPa.  Its ultimate tensile strength might be 3 MPa.  Steel's tensile strength is 400 MPa, so you don't need a lot of it to handle quite a bit of stress.

but we like steel for other reasons, too.  concrete and steel have similar behaviors in terms of thermal expansion.  Steel is ubiquitous and is easily manufactured in a standardized manner.  It's highly rugged and isn't easily damaged in transportation.  It doesn't cost all that much, relative to composites.

But it has its problems too (corrosion, mostly), and its limitations.  Other materials have advantages - FRP reinforcing doesn't rust, and can have incredible high tensile strength (thousands of MPa).  But its expensive as hell.","1351728325"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; I don't have statistical backing, but I would think it would be positive for a growing child to have role models from both genders. Is that false?

Not false, but a bit misleading in that it presupposes that 1. all role models will be parents, and 2. all role models will be the same gender as the child.

Can you really say that your parents were your only role models?  I doubt it.  I'm sure there were plenty of other people who had a profound effect on your life.

And can you really say that your role models were always of your same gender? Can't a boy learn about hard work from a mother with two jobs? Can't a girl learn compassion from a father who takes care of others?

&gt;Are you talking about surrogacy? I like the angle of that argument.

That's within the argument, but hardly all of it.  Simply put, being homosexual does not mean you never have heterosexual reproductive acts of a wide variety, the most common being actual heterosexual sex.  

&gt;Can you hit me up with some sources on that. I know Greece was a prominent one in history, but I never knew if it was a positive or negative impact.

How long did Greece last?  And how long did a lot of the core principles of them last?  That's a pretty strong culture, so at the very least it didn't have some sort of incredibly detrimental effect that the other good things about Greece couldn't overcome.  Are you implying that America isn't as good as Greece, so we don't have enough virtue to make up for the possible vice of accepting homosexuality?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A more impoverished area will have more crime because the people within the area have less of an opportunity cost to engaging in crime. There's less infrastructure and weaker institutions in low-income areas so rising out of your income-class through hard work is less of a guarantee. And education is poor because public schools are funded through property taxes locally.

High crime rates means more police officers needed to watch the area. Lesser tax revenue means straining police budgets. Overworked police means greater propensity for police to operate over-aggressively or become corrupt. Insufficient or corrupt police, weak infrastructure and poor education motivates low-income people to become close-knit and seek control over scarce resources - Gangs. 

With no guarantees for better lives through the legal route, gangs operate extra-legally, creating a high tolerance for crime within their own communities. Likewise, law enforcement attempting to interfere with gangs' extra-legal operations while being overworked and increasingly corrupt provide the justification for a low tolerance for police.","1351728341"

They're saying ""we have no empirical evidence for god, but you don't have any empirical evidence about a lot of things in the subatomic world either, and yet you say it's true, so why can't our god be true either?""

But they forget that the atomic structure, electrons,  magnetic waves, and anything else they argue can't be seen came from a RATIONALIST model. This says, we have no idea what exactly an atom is, but we can describe it this way (for high schoolers its plumb pudding, for those completists who are fans of extra math, it could be a string vibrating at just the right frequency in a higher dimension).

However, God is not a rationalist explanation for anything in the universe (except MAYBE the origin of the universe itself, and we're coming up with other, more rational explanations, all the time.

"Eesti","t5_2rffn","Estonia was the last county in the EU to adopt anti-human trafficking legislation, I believe.  There are likely shelters or support options - but I imagine the majority of human trafficked prostitutes are tightly controlled and would have difficulty finding out about/reaching these groups for help.

As far as the blame is concerned - I think the largest share of blame goes to the politicians who make prostitution illegal (as well as those that lobby for them to do so).  In countries where prostitution is legal, there is often some degree of oversight, with support programs aimed at curbing STDs, abusive pimps, etc.  When prostitution is legal it also makes it more difficult for criminal elements to prosper from it.

Demand for this will always exist, I see no reason for the average customer of prostitutes to share any more guilt or responsibility for prostitution/human trafficking than someone using gas is responsible for global warming.  Of course, those using child prostitutes or someone that's clearly a slave/trafficked person is obviously in the wrong.  I don't think there's anything inherently immoral about prostitution or buying services from a prostitute - but it definitely isn't a black and white moral situation.

Traffickers/Abusive pimps, etc. are to blame, but they're capitalizing on a black market created by making it illegal in the first place.  If prostitution were legal, I feel like these types would make up a very small percentage of those involved in managing prostitutes.

You can also farm wraiths/wolfs if you are having a hard time in lane. And you can also roam. Being countered in midlane isnt as bad as being countered in top lane. As a top player you never know if you will get gank or not, many junglers only focus on ganking two lanes, and its either gonna be mid and top or mid and bot. Nobody only goes for top and bot and skips mid. If you get zoned out of your lane top, you might be able to farma a few wolfs or golems but its not as easy as it is for a midlaner. Roaming as a top laner is pretty hard aswell, you can pretty much only gank mid unless you wanna quickly loose both your towers.

Unfortunately, like you've mentioned, just taking blockers forever is not at option, and wouldn't really help me at this point anyways since I'm already finished puberty. :( It would be so nice, though.

I've heard of some people (obviously, estrogen-producing folks) who've taken testosterone for just long enough to get to the point where they aren't automatically read as female, but it's a bit of a gamble - you don't really get to pick and choose what traits will come through first, and while I'd love a deeper voice and a more masculine shape I can do without the facial hair.

It could be possible that she is just texting her parents about what happened.  Maybe she doesn't know that people were killed yet.  I've watched a couple of car crash videos (I'm not much of a gore person) and I am usually surprised by the death toll because it often doesn't look that serious at first.  Obviously there are cases like ferrari girl where it is blatantly obvious what has occurred, but that isn't always the case.

From dialogue with NPCs in Whiterun you can tell that the war hasn't really affected them too much despite them being smack-dab in the center of the province. Also I think that the fact Jarl Balgruuf had not taken a side before initiating the civil war questline means that his hold as a *whole* hadn't been touched much by it. If say some of Whiterun citizens had been attacked, who would it be initiating the attack? 

And from ALL I have seen in the game, I have never experienced any Imperial soldiers say anything against Talos (not saying its not there, just some how haven't seen it after ~400 hours) And I know that most Nords (the **REAL** true Nords of Skyrim) still worship Talos in their own homes, and maybe Heimskr just hadn't gotten the memo or he REALLY wants to be able to do it openly. And the Jarl hadn't done anything about it... ever.... so he obviously doesn't have a problem with it.

Once the engine hooks to the OS are changed to work on Linux, the engine itself should behave the same.

If you're allocating a lot of space in local variables (like, say, a 50 KB array--I know, I know, but I've seen it done) in the recursive function, it just got a lot riskier.

If you're working in, say, a memory-constrained embedded system, just don't do it unless you know strict bounds on how deep your recursion might go and how much space each call will eat.  Even then, you'd also better also know approximately how deep you'll be when you make the initial call.  By the time you've done all that, you might as well have just written an iterative implementation.","1351728362"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","Absolutely, there are shoulds. She *should* date someone that she is attracted to and wants to date, just as I *should* date someone that I am attracted to and want to date. That's where the ""shoulds"" end; it is entirely up to her, just as it is entirely up to you, me, and anyone else, just what those qualities are. If someone doesn't care whether their partner has drive and ambition, then why shouldn't she date him? If I'm really attracted to women who at least a few inches shorter than me (the shorter the better), then why should I message those women who are as tall or taller than me if it only means that, in the long run, I'll always be on the lookout for someone short. 

I would argue that, if you are very picky or if your type range is exceptionally narrow and you are totally unwilling to go outside of it, then maybe you shouldn't complain when you can't find someone who fits those very specific criteria, but you have every right to hold those criteria. It isn't shallow to want to date someone who is as close as possible to your ""ideal"" mate (in looks, mannerisms, education, whatever else).","1351728363"

Then my ex-wife chimes in with a few comments about what idiots we are and that it is probably a Mexican restaurant!

It wasn't that the food was bad or anything, just not right. My friend got into an argument over what a quesadilla was. What he got was a  tostada and the waiter just couldn't understand the difference. 

We also ordered nanchos and we got a large flat bowl filled with salsa with corn chips carefully lined along the edge. Not heated let alone melted cheese... or any cheese for that matter.

If you're having a hard time imagining this, imagine a rubber balloon. Draw four dots on it an inch apart in a square. Now blow it up. This is analogous to what the universe is doing. It's getting bigger in all places at the same time.

On a small enough scale, like the kind humans interact with on a daily basis, it doesn't matter and on a planet like earth the masses are close enough together to hold on and not float apart. On a more massive scale like looking at the light being emit from other galaxies we notice the light is shifted a little to the red scale (red shift). This is analogous to the shift of sounds to lower notes as you hear a car drive by. If something is accelerating towards you, the light shifts a little blue (sound gets higher pitched) and as it moves away the light shifts a little red (sound gets lower pitched).

For the most part we've observed that pretty much each galaxy is moving away from every other galaxy like dots on the balloon as it blows up. Of course galaxies aren't stationary relative to eachother like the dots are so there are exceptions such as andromeda and the milky way (us) on a collision course. What makes this even stranger is they're not moving away at a constant speed, they're actually accelerating!

It's all very interesting stuff, but I'm no expert. Just a guy who sometimes reads about this and watches Nova. Here is some links to get you started of you're curious:

* [Expanding Universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space)

* [Red shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift)

I went into college (specifically philosophy looking for answers).  I walked out of college, holding my diploma as a full blown nihilist: existential, moral, epistemic, etc.

I consider myself flexible enough to follow what evidence we do have, and religion just doesn't seem to make any sense.  It doesn't solve anything that isn't already solved by science, and it doesn't avoid most of what it criticizes in the scientific explanation.

Moreover, (my strongest emphasis in Philosophy was logic {and meta-ethics}), religion begins to border on the illogical (that isn't to say it isn't real, just that it requires a suspension of logic.  I am pulling my hair out to try and remember it, but an 18th? century philosophy noted the immediate conflict between an omnipotent, omnipresent, and omnibenevolent god.

Another issue with judeo-christian teachings is the belief in free will and God's omniscience.  Aquinas addressed this inadequately, and his philosophy, at least on this matter, is still the go to for the catholic church, and I would imagine most christian intellectuals.

PS
Have you read ""Why I am not a Christian"" by Russell?

If you are interested in a little intellectual conversation on this, I would be curious on your thoughts to anything I mentioned above.

PS Sorry if I come across as aggressive.  I blame that on philosophy too.  I expect arguments to be defended.

We modern-day people call it ""self control"". It's where you don't do stuff you know is stupid just because you're feeling lonely.

Edit: okay, to be fair, it's probably not an issue of self-control. Usually, with these kind of things, it's that your judgement gets impaired and you start thinking that it was wrong to break up, and it could probably still work out. I dunno if this was the case with you when you got back together, but if it is... well, you should be able to work a way around that.","1351728377"
"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Okay, so I understand your thinking, but here's why you need to stick with the car you have:  For one, you need a car, Metra/Pace/CTA doesn't cut it.  You bought without enough down to put you in good standing out of the gate, but that's life, you needed a car and you got a car.  Next time you'll be in a better position.

Unfortunately, for right now, you probably cannot realistically lower your payment without dramatically increasing your risk.  Right now you have a reliable car with a fairly high payment... but not an unreasonably high payment.

If you were to replace it you could, at very, very best, save yourself that $100 per month.  But you will sacrifice any warranty coverage that you enjoy now, you will own a vehicle at least 3-4 years older and/or with much higher milage, and not likely one that has as durable a reputation as your Mazda.

To prove that let's run through a handful of scenarios in which you buy a cheaper vehicle, for now we're going to assume that you throw in your $2000 cash and that covers the negative equity you've got on your Mazda, and that then you're paying (and financing) all taxes and fees on a new car as well:

If you were to buy a $5000 car it's going to be a turd.  Coincidentally, I work at a dealer in the Chicago suburbs and anything you can buy for $5000 (after taxes and fees) is going to be a piece of shit that will require constant upkeep.  Maybe, just maaaybe, you could find something that will last you for the same 4 years you'll be paying on your car but you will have to put money into it and you'll always have to worry that it's going to shit the bed on you.  What's more: you will find it difficult to find a lender who will finance (a) that small an amount, (b) a car that old / with that many miles, or (c) for any length of time that it won't be the same as what you're paying now, just for a shorter term.  I.E. Paying 360/month for 2 years instead of $360/month for 4.

Now, let's say you buy something better than a $5000 car, let's say you get something decent that's a $10k car.  Still likely to have more miles than what you have now, not likely to have warranty coverage, and best-case scenario you're going to get your payment down a little bit, maybe like $50 per month by the time it's all said and done.

The last thing you could do is to buy something else brand new that's hella cheap.  Like a $16k (after taxes) Nissan Versa or something, finance it for 6 years, and you can maybe get your payment down $40-$50... but you're in the same position of being waaaay upside-down for at least the first 3-4 years of the car's life.

Probably your best hope is to do something like this:  Take out a 3 year lease on something with a high residual value, like a Corolla / Civic / Sentra, and pray to god you can put enough down to cover most of your negative equity and have good enough credit to get their best lease rate.

If you PM me I can give you the information and you can come in to my dealership and work with someone trustworthy to try and put that together.  It's no guarantee, but it might help.","1351728377"

Don't build stuff without production efficiency V (IV in some cases) otherwise the wastage of your skills makes profit almost impossible. With that skill, simply go to the bill of materials, buy in the stuff required (by ""You"" not perfect) and build the item in a station with manufacturing facilities. Sell for profit. (Check before hand that there is a profit, ofc).

Both modules should be profitable with the skill to level 5. It takes a long while but if you want to manufacture it is worth it.

&gt;Planner_Hammish knows not of what he brays. The Southern Poverty Law Centre does amazing work for the poor and disenfranchised.

I'd like to thank you for presenting a proper argument. What I know of the SPLC is not from personal experience or extensive research, but rather convincing hearsay from multiple voices. 

To summarize the complaints:

* SPLC takes advantage of minorities and disenfranchised to further their ideological goals; 

* they are stacked with far-left Feminists and academics, [cultural Marxists](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Jlk1frpWrI) and Jewish Supremacists; 

* their typical mode of operation is to deliver personal attacks (libel, character assassination, smear campaigns, hyperbole, disinformation, greed, distortions, and outright falsehoods, and labelling organizations ""hate group"") against those who oppose their viewpoints, [Example](http://www.cis.org/immigration-splc);

* and of course, the reason that it is relevant to this discussion is that they have labelled MRAs a ""hate group"" and list them alongside the KKK, Neo-Nazis and other such extreme and outrageous groups. 

And in relation to using brains, and being ignorant etc, I will point out that at least one person believes that the SPLC success is based on duping gullible liberals into giving them money:

&gt;[The Southern Poverty Law Center’s behavior isn’t reckless as such. It’s far worse than that. It is calculated and malicious, intended to foment hatred and raise oceans of cash by bamboozling gullible liberals into giving money to what is one of the wealthiest nonprofit groups in the history of the United States.](http://frontpagemag.com/2012/matthew-vadum/smearing-conservatives-raking-in-cash/)  ","1351728380"

""Correctly attributed"" means ""this guy wrote it"", which doesn't make any of it actually *true*, it just means ""it's true that that guy said it"".

&gt;Barack Hussein Obama was my college classmate. ( Columbia University , class of '83)

I don't know how many students were at Columbia in '83, but today there are 27,606. Being in school the same year as another student doesn't mean you know them. It means precisely dick. And in fact, we **know** it means precisely dick, as Snopes points out (in the link your brother provided) that neither he nor anyone he knows has met Obama.

&gt;He is a devout Muslim; do not be fooled.

If Barack Obama is a Muslim, he is the world's worst Muslim, having never been to Mecca, [eating pork so often doctors have petitioned him to stop](http://now.msn.com/doctors-want-obama-to-stop-eating-deadly-hot-dogs), [drinking alcohol](http://sandrarose.com/images10/barack-obama-beer-294.jpg) (and he even has his own [beer recipe](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-09-01/business/sns-rt-us-obama-beerbre881000-20120901_1_beer-american-homebrewers-association-number-of-craft-breweries)), and by all appearances not praying to Mecca five times a day. To accuse Obama of being a Muslim is to have no fucking clue what a Muslim even *is*.

Aaaaaand at this point he cites Glenn Beck. I'd go on, but what's the point? This guy has already established himself as *intentionally* misleading, and willing to bullshit about things he knows *nothing* about.

Regardless, I feel that pointing out the mistake illustrates an important point, and nermid hit the nail on the head by bringing up the God of the Gaps. Gods were once able to control the weather, turn night into day, summon lightning from the heavens, and shake the ground beneath our feet. At every achievement of man to better understand the world around him, his gods have become a little less powerful. There are very few places for gods left to hide, and some people will search anywhere they can to try to find their gods, even searching in places that aren't really there. But worse than these people are those who either unashamedly, or perhaps ignorantly, attempt to convince others of the possibility of their god by pretending to know more about the world than the average person. We've all seen it before, people using a perceived authority stemming from a supposedly superior intelligence or education to contrive some manner by which to trick others into believing there are gaping holes remaining in the collection of human knowledge for their god to exist. They try to trick you into think that they are smarter than you in an attempt to convince you that they are right. These people are con artists and charlatans.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Shame that top voted post in that thread is mostly wrong.

Glycogen reserves in muscles are depleted by anaerobic exercise not by being awake for a long time. Typically your body goes to reasonable homeostatic lengths to maintain glycogen stores in muscle. What they would have to do with mental tiredness is anyone's guess.

The neurotransmitter explanation is also wrong. Neurotranmitters are continually produced and destroyed by the brain in a semi-steady state cycle in the brain, there isn't some store that you're using up as the day goes on. The rate of production and hence the relative concentration of neurotransmitters during the day is indeed principally influenced by a circadian daylight-night cycle. But most neurotransmitters show complex daily patterns of brain concentration with few following a model when they are at their peak in the morning and ""get used up"" as the day goes on.

Figure 2 in the following paper measures the levels of 8 neurotransmitters in rat brains over a day-night cycle. For Arginine, Glutamine and 5-HIAA and dopamine there is no significant difference between night and day.  DOPAC and HVA show a pattern where the are at their peak level at the start of the night and then fall steadily through the night and into the next day until the middle of the day where they begin climbing back to their highest point at the start of the following night. Glutamata and GABA are perhaps the only 2 that show a pattern where they recover during the night before being depleted throughout the day.

**Edit** I found these 2 articles on the role of glycogen in neural activity.

a) neurons do not store glycogen and it's accumulation in neurons can initiate apoptosis (programmed cell death) 
http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n11/full/nn1107-1341.html

b) Glycogen is instead held in nearby astrocytes where is can be mobilised as a nerual energy store in periods of

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","This is actually a suggestion I posted:

I think minecraft is too easy. Like, REALLY easy. The night isn't supposed to be easy. It is the second out of 2 hard parts of the game: Caving and the night. So, I thought of a few ideas I had to make the game more challenging.
Right now, you can just walk throught the night and see some mobs and stars and say: Oh hi creeper! You gonna blow up? Well not today :D
Admit it, you have talked to mobs.
But that is not the point. They point is... You should be SCARED of the night. It should be hell. This is what you should say: Oh sht, oh sht oh sh*t creeper!

Or

Are you really gonna go into the night without armor and weapons?
What? Are you scared of this creeper? He can't do anyth... BOOM!
In this post, I will be telling my opinions on what shall make minecraft nights harder.

More aggresive zombies a. nearly as fast as the player running. b. can climb 2 block tall walls and fences. c. attack in groups d. since they are brainless, they should take whatever risk to get you, whether if they have to fall 100 blocks, or go through lava. I think zombies should have kept their senseless AI.

Less aggresive, and more tactical creepers. a. they will always sneak up behind you. b. as fast as zombies. c. bigger explosion. d. a more camouflaged texture. Maybe they spawn with camouflage acoording to their biome.

Sneakier skeletons. a. they will try to cover and shoot you. Maybe add the feature to crouch. b. longer range. Their aim and range is ridiculous. They should shoot you from 32 to 64 blocks long. c. Due to that, their shoot rate should be lower. d. When you come close to them, they back away from you. c. keep their speed.

Spiders a. nothing to say, spiders are the most well made monster in the game. They are fast, agile and they can climb. They are a great challenge.

Ocelots a. They act more like sissy little cats rather than big badass ocelots. b. should be aggresive until you tame them. Therefore, taming them should be a pain.

Bats a. This is kind of a lame suggestion, but they have a rare chance of habing rabies, and if they bite you, you die.

Darker nights a. They are really lit up. I think they should be darker b. Unless you walk with a torch. Now, this is not suggesting dynamic lightning, well kinda. Instead of dynamic lighning, make it so that each block you walk with a torch, blocks will iluminate around you. So every block you walk, the light changes.

So those are my opinions. I know I shouldn't post suggestions with many in it, but I'm not gonna suggest everything separately. So, to make it easier, just downvote if you DON'T think the night is easy, and up vote if you think it is! I'm just sharing my ideas. Just remember, not everything will get added eventually.","1351728387"

It is, pure and simple, Call of Duty 26: Modern Mech Combat.

Having enjoyed World Of Tanks beforehand, I found myself un-enthralled. The combat is based on reaction time and strafing, as opposed to positioning and precision. There's no real difference about where you shoot your enemy, since the damage system is completely simplistic. Shoot AT the mechs to win.

I found more the once the game's slightly murky brown-and-grey-shade aesthetic to be getting in the way of combat. It is not simple to tell the similarly shaded gritty mechs from the grittier still environments. There's even some sort of a gritty grain filter over the whole picture; purely by accident I managed to disable it once, and found my experience improved tenfold.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","There's a difference between caring about someone and taking advantage of her. If you're comforting her simply in hopes that it'll make her feel better, it's the right thing to do and you should do it. If you're doing it with the expectation of getting something in return, then you're taking advantage of her and you need to step away. But beware, if you pursue a relationship with her, it's going to be very tough for her to open up to you. The way you feel about her now and how you hope she feels about you (which you should get confirmation of BTW) is probably  the exact same way she felt about this guy at some point. Stop and think for a moment how much that would fuck with your head. Now ask truthfully ask yourself if you're really willing to deal with that.

All that aside, don't poo poo this guy off. A knife doesn't give 2 shits about how tall or muscular you are, it will still kill you in less than 5 seconds so long as the guy wielding it is crazy/determined enough to do it.

Though she placed only third in the competition, her cheerful diligence and persistence resonated with many Japanese viewers, making her an overnight foreign celebrity in Japan. Lynn, a peace activist, was repeatedly seen flashing the V sign in the Japanese media thereafter.

I understand what happens.

You're still arguing semantics. 

Either way, earlier you said this:

&gt;Numbers are a complete human construct. Yes those things will still be true wherever you go, that does not mean that any other civilization would find them significant in any way. 

Which is still just plain wrong, and well, kind of stupid to be honest.

 &gt;I don't really know how we can continue having this discussion 

That's fine with me. Ending this conversation will surely be the most pleasurable part of it.

Also, we're so far buried in the comments now of an aging thread that no one is ever likely to read our discussion.

Although, if you still think that you're not babbling nonsense, I would love for you to understand how one would describe the physics of radio waves without using any kind of number system.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I don't think he's a skinchanger either, but I wouldn't say he's *definitely* not. The Ironborn, while they don't worship the Old Gods, are derived from the First Men, which means some of them could potentially be skinchangers. Now there's next to no evidence about Euron skinchanging, but there is one curious line he utters:

&gt;“When I was a boy, I dreamt that I could fly,” he announced. “When I woke, I couldn’t . . . or so the maester said. But what if he lied?”

^AFFC ^29: ^THE ^REAVER

This bears a striking similarity to Bran's dreams when he was discovering his powers. Some have wondered if Euron may have been a greenseer candidate and the Three-Eyed Crow was contacting him as a boy. Of course dreams of flying aren't uncommon and based on this single line alone I'm not inclined to think Euron a skinchanger. He's interesting enough without the superpowers anyways.","1351728412"

A little known bit of information is that you can buy the [Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade Family Pack](http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Windows-Premium-Upgrade-Family/dp/B002MV2MG0) with three licenses for around $120-$150.  I was able to buy two packs at OfficeMax when they were on sale for $119, that's $40 a license.  You receive two DVD's a 32bit edition as well as the 64bit edition.  If you have 3 older copies of Vista or XP laying around and you want to upgrade to Windows 7, this route is cheaper than buying three Win 7 OEM licenses at $92 a pop just to do a clean install.

When using these disks, it allows you to do a full install on a blank, unformatted hard drive without asking for older Windows disks or searching the hard drive for a prior installed version to upgrade in place.  In addition to that, depending on which product key you enter, you can install a full version of Professional or Ultimate from this disk set because it contains the Anytime Upgrade feature.

When I installed the Win 8 developer's preview almost a year ago, I immediately ran out and bought two of these packs.  I'm glad I did because I think Win 8 is horrible.","1351728418"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Remember that RAID-0 is called that because you'll have ""zero"" copies of your files if any of the drives in the array die. Having two drives in an array doubles your chance of failure. Three, tripled, and so on.

RAID-1 is more redundant but is no substitute for proper backups.

RAID-5/6 are only useful for light loads and huge storage requirements. The write times can be crippling, and re-building a parity drive after a failure can be really painful.

Remember as well that if/when your RAID controller blows out you'll have to get one that's compatible if not exactly the same in order to recover your files. That means buying yet another card or motherboard that you've already found out will fail. Instead of one crappy controller you'll have *two*.

Basically, don't bother with RAID unless you hate life.

It shouldn't be too hard to plan your install so that you load things on to particular drives and manage them the old-fashioned way. The advantage to this is you can always migrate files to a bigger/faster drive at any time by duping a drive, meaning lower down-time.

Normal drives can be slammed into an external S-ATA reader at any time to access the files. RAID array drives need to be paired with their controller to be any use at all. So when you pull a drive-set from your system, it's totally useless unless you put it back in exactly as it was before. This is not the case with plain old disks. The freedom to be able to chuck a disk in a box, forget about it, then months or years later get data off of it without a worry is a big deal.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","The only assumption you need to make is that God created the universe in a way that makes some sort of sense - i.e. that what we can observe with our sense is at least some sort of approximation to reality, and that things are governed by fairly universal laws. If you deny these assumptions, then any conclusion is as valid as any other - so sure, the Sun goes around the Earth, the Earth 6000 years old, and (why not) you are an anthropomorphic marshmallow capable of internetting somehow.

If you accept that the universe makes some sort of sense - which I think you have to do if you believe that God is Good, God is Truth, and when He made the universe He said ""It is Good"" - then you have to accept that we are capable of building an understanding of the universe based on observation. And our observations *strongly* point towards the universe being billions of years old. Anyone who tells you differently either doesn't know what they're talking about, or is straight-up lying.

The evidence is about as solid as saying the Earth goes around the Sun. This is not as easy to prove as it might sound. It's fairly easy to show the Earth is *round* even with the naked eye, provided you can travel a couple of thousand kilometres north and south. But showing that the Earth goes around the Sun requires really quite detailed observations of the positions of the planets etc, and a somewhat more complex theory for planetary motion (planets have elliptical orbits and move slower when they're further away from the Sun) - otherwise your data doesn't fit the observations any better than an Earth-centred universe with epicycles.

Saying the universe is 4 billion years old is on that level. It's not obvious to the naked eye like the roundness of the Earth. Instead it's based on somewhat advanced theory and detailed observations. I think that a lot of people doubt the conclusions because they don't understand the process - because it can get complex - but if they're gonna do that, they might as well doubt the Sun-centred solar system, because that's built on the same kinds of assumptions.","1351728419"

Your assumptions about the intelligence level of some species is highly incorrect though. Many primates and also some of the smarter bird species have been know to use tools to gather food as well as wage battle on opposing groups. Elephants,  rats, pigs and dogs have been shown to show empathy toward their own species and owners while they were in distress. (I have seen this with our pet rat Harry while sick). I have also read about an octopus that was able to escape his enclosure multiple times by figuring out the locking mechanism and manipulating it. We dont even know how intelligent most upwardly thinking animal species are and are constantly finding new information to back this data. I know this is cliche, but it must be said

 ""Humans are not the only species on the planet...we just act like it.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; How do you know all this about me when I have said nothing about my beliefs?

yes you did. you said:

&gt;&gt; If god is a god, then he is the actual moral absolute for this universe

that was a statement of your beliefs.

&gt; My god is a god of Justice and Mercy, and that means he sometimes does things that look contentious to our petty minds, but justice gets done.

fantastic. yahweh is frequently unjust in the bible. if you believe in a just god, you do not believe in yahweh, the god of the bible. and, in fact, while we're on the topic, mercy and justice are contradictory ideas. either people get the punishments they deserve (justice) or they do not (mercy).

&gt; Any the point is, that if there is a god, and he has the characteristics of a god.

yes, of course. but that is tautological. if there's a dog, it has the characteristics of a dog. this particular statement is meaningless. the problem is your statement of belief about what that definition includes:

&gt; Then regardless of how we feel about it he is the moral absolute and we should live accordingly.

the fact that you define the word ""god"" to include ""moral absolute"" is a faulty assumption. other definitions exist, and that definition is practically impossible and logically inconsistent with reality, and with itself.

&gt; You seem to equate the term 'morality' with some inherent meaning that I have not agreed upon.

and you seem to equate ""god"" with some inherent meaning that the bible has not agreed upon.

this is not some kind of personal attack. you simply don't believe in god as described in the bible, and it's easy enough to show that by comparing your statements to those made in the bible. i gave several above where god himself agrees that he is not the absolute moral authority in the universe. and this isn't a condemnation of your beliefs: maybe your nonsense is *better* nonsense. maybe it's more *humane* nonsense. but it's still nonsense, and it's not internally consistent, nor is it consistent with the book i admittedly assume you regard as sacred.

That was when I learned the difference between solution providers/engineers and screw turners.

Our vendor was an AMD vendor at the time.  We approached them about getting Intel systems.  ""Sure!  No problem!""  

 - In order to make them work in their chassis, the mobos had to be installed backwards, causing huge airflow problems in the machines themselves.  We worked up an ipmi-based monitoring system that I believe doubled as the world's most expensive low-res thermal imaging camera.  The problem was bad enough that we could tell within about 30 seconds if someone was standing in front of a rack of machines.

 - They used low-end unqualified RAM in all of the nodes, resulting in frequent lock-ups of systems.  We're talking 20% of the farm would crash daily.  It all got replaced, eventually, on their dime.

 - And their CEO hit on my married boss.  A lot.

Then they bought the remains of SGI.  Fuck those guys.

I think it looks better than most of the Garmins and it is waterproof. It is fairly accurate in the distance if you sync it everyday with your computer, which you would have to do if you had a Garmin anyways. It has excellent battery life, usually lasting a few runs before needing a recharge (I usually charge it everyday when I upload my runs though.) The display is very nice, easy to read, with a clear and easy to understand menu. You can scroll through your history, including each runs splits, your records and personal bests and it has a stopwatch. when you complete a run it shows all the info about the run on the watch.

The website is probably my favorite thing about the the watch. It lets you tag your runs (put in info like terrain, how you felt, shoes you ran in) and it tells you all sorts of stats relating to pace, distance, frequency of runs, where you ran, and many others. It keeps track of all these and allows you to see trends over time. When you plug in your watch (which plugs directly into the usb port, no converters), it uploads your run and syncs with satellites, and then takes you to the website. On the website, it shows a map, showing you your speed, elevation, and splits. 

The website is also very motivational. There are different levels you can achieve by putting in more miles, there are challenges you can go for, as well as trophies, like 5 weeks in a row. It keeps track of all your personal bests for the 1K, mile, 5K, and 10K, as well as longest run, most calories burned, and most nike fuel. Every time you finish a run, you watch gives you a little motivational thing on the screen, like Way to Go, or Good Effort. It also shows a little firework type thing when you break a personal best

Yet that wasn't enough to get me to change instead I relied on alcohol to numb my feelings until I realized I was killing myself drinking everyday and gave that up but continued to smoke marijuana to do the same thing. Over the next 6 years I became more introverted, drifted apart from more friends. 

This last spring my roommate moved out and that meant no more excess money to buy weed and the loss of one of the only things that forced me to be social. Depression came and went sporadically all summer before I realized I had to make a change this September. I realized that my self-consciousness had grown out of control and was severely limiting my social interaction. By chance I stumbled onto reddit and then this subreddit and the FAQ made me realize why I was fat and what I had to do to lose it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My cat taught herself how to climb a ladder.

I moved into a bachelor apartment that had a neat little loft space above the kitchen where the sleeping area was, and it was accessible by a 10ft wooden ladder installed into the apartment. When I brought her home and went into the loft, she was puzzled for about 10 minutes before she figured it out. She got really fast at it, traversing the whole ladder in probably 1.5 seconds. To get down, she would jump from the loft onto my couch below.

Now she's devised several ways to wake me up when she wants food at 6am, every morning. She will bat at the cat door, just making it swing in its hinges until I feed her. She'll also find ANYTHING paper and rustle it until I awaken.

Also she likes to suckle on select blankets, or whatever shirt or sweater I'm wearing. She'll come up to me, bite a little section of my shirt on my belly, and gently pussyfoot with her eyes closed until she's had enough ""milk"". Usually this is followed by a nap. I don't know why she's so into the pussyfooting, she was totally weaned and on dry food when I received her. 

She'll also come if you call her name. She talks all the time. She's a sweet little thing.","1351728429"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","""trying to connect Love with Agape"" has no meaning. Last post--""Agape is a Greek word. And it means Love."" 
Look I definitely do NOT want to get into a language debate withs someone who's first language is Greek, I would only like to point this out.
The New Testament of the Bible was written in Koine Greek not Modern Greek there are words that are no longer used in modern Greek that were the commonplace in the Ancient Greek. Think of shakespeare and the modern use of language. 
There are also specific examples where words have lost their original definition from the ancient to the modern.
An example of this in English is the word ""Gentleman"" it has become ""Abstract"" as you said, but it was not supposed to be abstract. It was supposed to have an intrinsic definition there are literally TONS of these examples throughout language studies...Just think about ""Cool"" ""hot"" ""wicked"" and on and on.
Because we don't use a lot of words the way that they were originally intended to be used ESPECIALLY Christians in misunderstanding the Greek we cause confusion and communication break down.
Example: Apocalypse--From the KOINE Greek Apokalupsis which means an uncovering or revealing of truth. Yet because of bad teaching and misuse of the word most people think it means more like ""the end of the world""
I am not questioning your Greek by any stretch, but if you were to tell some one from the first century that your friend was ""wicked smart"" they may burn them at the stake. :)

Actually, I merely pointed out that since men have body hair and women don't, it's automatically a masculine feature. Let me remind you, the definition of masculine is:
&gt;mas·cu·line  
Having qualities or appearance traditionally associated with men, esp. strength and aggressiveness

Thus, by definition, body hair is masculine, since it's traditionally associated with men as opposed to women, due to the obvious fact that women have less body hair.

I never speculated on the reasons for men's dislike of body hair, but I do agree with the assertion that it's because it's a masculine trait, like the aforementioned strength and aggression. Surprise surprise, men usually prefer women to be feminine. It's not a stretch to state that men dislike male traits in women, one of which is body hair, and that this extends to armpit hair as well.

The Bears have a brutal schedule coming up (HOU, @SF, MINx2, GB, @SEA), and the Bears are only up 1.5 games in the division.

Looking at the rest of GB's games and assuming GB plays at or below where they've been the past few weeks:

* ARI - W
* @DET - W
* @NYG - L
* MIN - W
* DET - W
* @CHI - L
* TEN - W
* @MIN - L

That's 10-6, or 11-5 if they can beat @CHI or @MIN. Assuming MIN gets the 5th seed (though GB will probably beat MIN for it), the only team who has a realistic shot at beating GB for the 6th seed is SEA because they hold the head-to-head tiebreaker.

Interestingly, SEA and MIN play each other next week, which is very good for GB because they are guaranteed to gain a game on whomever loses.

A more interesting question is: who will win the NFC North? I think week 15 GB @ CHI will decide that.","1351728432"

"sandy","t5_2qimb","When I talk about a boat, I am referring to the sum of the weight of all of it's components and everything on board, and the volume that the entirety of the hull encloses.  If you want, you can say I am approximating the hull of the boat as an infinitely thin skin that occupies zero volume, but encloses some amount of space.  It is completely irrelevant how the innards are partitioned.  In the end you have a fixed amount of water the hull is capable of displacing regardless of what is in it.  That is why flipping between definitions does not change the answer, which is why I get to do it.  Boat + Cargo is indistinguishable from Boat + nothing as far as how much water the thing can displace.  You are pressing the argument on a meaningless dichotomy.

&gt;Now we're concerned with how dense that 20L part must be in order to make the entire fling float...(aka, the ""20%"" mudmaster was referring to) must weigh less than 20kg so that the 100L whole will weigh less than 100kg

I want you to read that statement very carefully.

If you are using 20% of the weight of the hull to calculate whether the weight of the ""100L **whole** will weigh less than 100kg""

***Then you are neglecting 80% of the weight of the hull.***

(Weight of hull) == (weight of hull)

Weight of hull =/= .2*(weight of hull)

The **only** way you may ignore eighty percent of the weight of any boat hull is if that weight is *supported by something*.  Water in the hull of a boat is unable to support the weight of the boat, so the 80% you are trying to ignore is left unsupported.  Your theory, as I have demonstrated with my example calculation in the previous comment, makes demonstrably false predictions.  Try It Yourself.  Boat weighing 100 kg and has a total volume of 200L.  Add 120L of water.  Boat will sink.

EDIT:  If what you are trying to say is that the 20% of the boat you are examining is the 20L of volume that the actual material composing the hull itself takes up, then you are talking about 100% of the weight of the hull.  This sounds rather specifically not like 20% of a boat.  Furthermore, this ""shortcut"" requires that you possess information regarding the actual volume of material that is the hull itself--something not even shipwrights know off-hand, or have written down anywhere.  No, they'd have to calculate it--After all, the thing is designed to displace a greater volume of water than the metal of the hull actually takes up.  At best, your method adds an unnecessary constant that requires a whole series of research and calculations to produce all on its own.  Not much of a shortcut.","1351728437"

"Diablo3Wizards","t5_2ucml","Thank you for your reply. I currently have Tal's chest, and I have been weighing getting Zuni's boots and ring for the +130 int, or Nat's boots and ring for the +7 crit chance. I happen to have Chant wand - it was a drop - but it doesn't have a socket, so I've stuck with Trium and a black weapon. My res is 700+, but 1k is a good goal. I really need more life. I know I'm lacking in that area. But, I can survive MP4 solo, and I can farm MP6 in a group and do MP5 ubers. 

My priorities in terms of item upgrades:
Witching Hour with Int, Vit and AR
Amulet with Int, AR, CD, CC, IAS and LoH
Better bracers

Possible purchases include:
Zuni's boots and ring
or
Nat's boots and ring

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I can't find any details for liver fatty acid conversions, but the conversions are unbalanced in general it seems, you lose more stearic to oleic (14%) than the palmitic to stearic (4% net when also considering reverse):

&gt; Overall conversion of 18:0 to 18:1 was approximately 14%, whereas that of 18:0 to 16:0 was approximately 2% in plasma up to 144 h. Conversion of 16:0 to 16:1 was &lt; 2%, whereas conversion of 16:0 to 18:0 was approximately 6%.

*Rhee SK, Kayani AJ, Ciszek A, Brenna JT* [""Desaturation and interconversion of dietary stearic and palmitic acids in human plasma and lipoproteins""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9022530) *Am J Clin Nutr. 1997 Feb;65(2):451-8.*

So this likely results in a shift in the balance.

And even if the above wasn't true, stearic doesn't have to change form, stearic could be oxidized (or stored) to a higher degree than palmitic in liver if the stearic acid isn't sent out as triglycerides. This could probably also explaining some of the imbalance. But I haven't looked at individual fatty acid metabolism, so take at face value.

Regarding the efficiency, everything I've seen points at that de novo lipogenesis doesn't happen unless glycogen stores are full and you overeat (on carbs):

&gt; Human adipose tissue, like the liver, does not make a major contribution to whole body lipogenesis under eucaloric conditions

*Guo ZK, et al.* [""De novo lipogenesis in adipose tissue of lean and obese women: application of deuterated water and isotope ratio mass spectrometry""](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10918543) *Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 2000 Jul;24(7):932-7.*

Secondary source:

&gt; Carbohydrates are rarely converted to fat (a process called de novo lipogenesis) under normal dietary conditions. There are exceptions when this occurs.  One is with massive chronic overfeeding of carbs.  I’m talking 700-900 grams of carbs per day for multiple days.  Under those conditions, carbs max out glycogen stores, are in excess of total daily energy requirements and you see the conversion of carbohydrate to fat for storage.  But this is not a normal dietary situation for most people.

*Lyle McDonald,* [""How We Get Fat""](http://www.bodyrecomposition.com/fat-loss/how-we-get-fat.html).

And even when carbs do get stored you still lose 25% of the energy, unless people eat to compensate (or reduce activity) this won't make them fat.

The problem with the idea that keto has an metabolic advantage (like peeing out ketones) is that studies fail to show any practical difference for fat loss (when factoring for caloric intake and water weight).","1351728439"

Check for yourself! http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/pages/dsm-iv-tr-ptsd.asp

I meet at least 2, 3, and 5 from the numbing section, so your claim that I can't have PTSD because I am now capable of talking about my trauma is ignorant and false.  Feel free to claim the DSM-IV is a scientific text, it's irrelevant, as you are still incapable of using it properly.  Something motivated you to shitpost about this, and I'm going to assume it's cognitive dissonance as a result of some baggage you carry, although I can't speculate on the specifics of your problem.

Woah. [Not even *close* to reality](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/syr/en/figure-spm-5.html). *One* IPCC model has an increase of +6 degrees C at the high end of it's confidence interval for 2100 (the other end is +2 degrees C). The models differ on both the rate and magnitude of the temperature rise, but all do predict an increase, most likely between +1 and +3 degrees C. That's not to say such changes wouldn't be very bad for some regions of the world, they would, but stating incorrect facts seriously undermines the credibility of one's argument, especially when you're taking your argument to the extreme of:

&gt;It might not eradicate us as a species, but it would sure kill most of us and torpedo human civilization entirely.

Note: You didn't provide units for your ""degrees"" - it's natural to assume you're speaking in Celsius since that's the traditional scientific measurement unit as well as being what the IPCC makes projections in (also because 0.84 C is about how much the Earth has warmed since 1900 to date), but if you did mean +6 degrees F it's about right (although it assumes the high end of the ""likely"" range).

While one can reload brass shells, it is harder as the shells wear out over time and you need primers, etc.  Remember, this is years after the lights went out.

The show isn't great, but I am enjoying the interaction of the characters in the new settings.  The lights didn't go out by ""magic"".  Remember, magic is technology we don't understand.  I find their gritty interpretation of human interaction interesting.  While I am not inclined to believe the federal government will collapse so easily, I certainly see factions/militias cropping up.  And, I don't think the acting is that bad.  The lead young lady is getting good.  The young boy (her brother) is good.  The African-American captain is pretty good as well.  I especially enjoyed seeing his transformation from a human with optimism and hope to someone forced to become a predator in order to survive.  It was moving.  Yes, Google Man should be skinny.  They all should be skinny.

No, not a great show, but neither was Jericho (and I watched it religiously).  Both have good and bad.   But, I do think Revolution paints a better picture of a collapse than ""The Walking Dead"".  Yeah, zombies are much more believable than power going out by some technological discovery. :)

I am but one person and though I could create minor change, that is all it would be at my level. Where I live, I'm surrounded by very liberal people. I have no problem as I'm friends with a good number, but I also feel I have no voice when it comes to what I think about certain topics.

Ugh, I reread my comment. I'm not erasing it because that is mostly what I wanted to say, but I want to add one more thing. I did register as a republican because at one point I did feel that I would fit better there. I got defensive because I always see Republicans getting a bad reputation.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;Because of where the violence leads to. The risk of a woman being killed by a spouse or intimate acquaintance is higher than that of a man being killed by a spouse. Women are more likely to be killed by their husbands than any other person.

Some 8x higher. However, that does not diminish the need to care for men. Whilst dying over a domestic dispute is obviously horrible, cohabiting with someone who demoralizes you daily is also horrible. 

&gt;As well, due to victimization women who do kill usually do so in response to threats by men against their lives and their children.

This struck a cord with me. Are you seriously telling me that men just kill their wives, but women who kill their husbands were *driven to it by their husbands*? I think it's ideologues like you who work in and run these programs are the reason why men are not cared for. 

&gt;greater emphasis on women and they're seen as primary victims rather than men. This could possibly be because women are more likely to seek help, rather than men

That's the symptom. The cause as to why men seek less help is because men are not given the support women are given. Not to mention society is generally ignorant that men can be victims of DV. There needs to be more awareness that men are just as likely to be victims of DV as women are and there also needs to be support for them. 

The main driver for DV seems to be poverty &amp; lack of education, however the current zeitgeist and you yourself blame ""masculinity"". When men are victims equally of DV, how is ""masculinity"" to blame for DV? Could one not argue that ""femininity"" is not equally to blame for DV? Namely the aspect of nagging?

I do not actually believe this, but I'm just making this point to indicate how sexist your comment is about blaming masculinity. ","1351728463"

"GetStudying","t5_2tl44","Some specific study tips:

Use your identification of implicit task information to narrow down the content you need to study.  Avoid the ""seductive"" details of courses, aka, the interesting factoids or asides that are not core to learning the course.  You don't need to know that.

The human brain learns by categorizing and breaking down information into bits.  When learning terms, definitions, lists, always break things down into categories and use techniques like mnemonics if necessary (especially for stuff like biology).

For a tip on knowing how to simulate test questions, here's a cool strategy:  Take the subheadings of textbooks, and make them into questions.  Aka, ""Some Animals are affected by biodiversity."" becomes ""How are animals affected by biodiversity?""

Think about it this way, if you're in a test, and protoss and zerg(I'm just saying, honestly I think they're more or less balanced) had extra time. Terran, on the other hand doesn't.

"mctourney","t5_2t4zh","I left out command blocks because it's a big topic and best practices haven't entirely been established yet, but they are definitely useful. You could make a randomizer with them, but its use should of course be optional. Here are some other common uses:

* Using a tripwire grid to teleport players away from the real spawn to a fake one, that can be indoors and not affected by spawn protection. You will probably also want to set their spawn points at the fake spawn, possibly in team-specific locations.
* Setting gamemodes, which can ensure players are fully healed when the game starts
* Setting time of day and butchering when the game starts. If you set difficulty to 0 (peaceful) initially, and then switch to difficulty 1-3 at game start, that has the same effect as butchering. You may also want to allow players to change the difficulty with a button panel.

The problem is that AutoRef also does all these things, so you might have to provide a way to disable the command blocks, or have a different version of the map for use with AutoRef.","1351728485"

The whole point of concrete design is to ensure that the steel will fail (in tension) around the same time that concrete will fail (in compression). If one fails before the other, then it leads to catastrophic (unpredictable) failure of the system, which is what civil engineers work to prevent.

Micro-cracks are technically permissible in concrete design, but they do create an easy path for water/air to reach the rebar. Corrosion of steel causes an unpredictable loss in tensile strength, which, even though there are many factors of safety built into the design, puts the entire system at jeopardy. By ""plugging"" those micro-cracks, you aren't so much increasing the compressive strength as you are protecting the integrity of the tensile strength. ","1351728494"

I think she may be confusing the consumption of yams with the cultivation of yams. Humans ate yams 50,000 years ago, of this there is little doubt. We have remains of yams associated with human habitations from that period. But humans ate a lot of stuff, and just because they ate it does not mean they cultivated it. The yams were wild yams, not domesticated yams. So far we have found no evidence of cultivation or domestication at 50,000 years.","1351728495"

Again and again I say that the scientific definition of evolution is the change in allele frequencies. So far, there has been no refutation of that claim. Artificial selection is one mechanism of evolution because it causes change in allele frequencies. I honestly don't care who you interact with on a daily basis. Especially after you did the whole, *snicker, you used wikipedia* thing right before quoting another redditor. 

I'm interested in your argument, not whatever you claim to be on the internet. So far, you haven't given me a good reason as to why artificial selection shouldn't be considered a mechanism of evolution. 

&gt;So, the organism's allele frequency has changed, but the theory of evolution is not needed to help us understand why.

This sentence in particular makes me doubt your claim that you come from ""a place of expertise"". Allele frequencies of organisms do not change; the allele frequencies of populations do. When a population's allele frequency changes, we do need an explanation as to why because there are multiple ways allele frequencies can change. Thus, the many mechanisms of evolution. ","1351728501"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","First off, I tried to state that, at the start, that I agree with the statement (and similar):

""rinsing toothpaste off after brushing, could be considered counter productive, because it does not give the flouride in the toothpaste enough time to properly absorb into your teeth.  This is why many dentists will recommend NOT doing a final rinse when brushing teeth."" 

Secondly, what I am really trying to say,  is that the [magnitdue of the benefit of not-rinsing toothpaste off is TINY in compared to the brushing itself](http://dentalhygienehaven.com/the-truth-about-toothpaste/). Therefore, one should listen to their personal preferences about the taste of toothpaste and their health in general (not just dental health) BEFORE they listen to this 'tip,' which is really only adds a 'tiny bit' of benefit to the process (of cleaning your teeth). Furthermore, this 'tip' should not be considered an essential component to dental health care. 

The most important word is 'necessary.'  It is not necessary to leave the toothpase in your mouth after brushing to have good dental health.  However, IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY, to brush ones teeth to have good dental health (regardless of whether or not toothpaste is used). 

Thirdly, let me quote myself from the last comment (as I am not advocating you change anything about what you do, I am only saying that those who typically rinse after brushing will NOT expereince any new adverse affects by continuing to do what they are already doing): 

&gt;P.S. All that being said, you probably have great dental hygeine and I think you should stick to what you have been doing/prefer!

Finally, 

&gt; There is no benefit to rinsing after, but there is a benefit to not rinsing after.

Not having to walk around with flouride-ridden toothpaste in your mouth for ~30 mins after brushing is the most obvious benefit.  The flouride in the toothpaste is ONLY good for your teeth.  So by rinsing, you don't subject the REST OF YOUR BODY to [flouride, which is toxic.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_toxicity).  The reason you make sure kids only use a little bit, is because the flouride will make their (humans) stomachs feel uneasy if it's swallowed. 

-------------------------------------------
Maybe, I am a just lucky to have good teeth, but my 3 'qualifications' are that,

1) I have good teeth, yet I rinse out the toothpaste everytime I brush, 2) my personal dentist from HS days explained why toothpaste (nor leaving it on after burshing) isn't *necessary,* and 3) the article I linked backs up what my dentist told me and what I am telling you now.

For example in the eyes of me a utopian society would be different to yours. This is because we have different logic which stems from our different personalities. 

Finally I wanted to rase the point of physical attraction. You said that an ability to use facts and logic will get you further in life. Im not going to argue on you with that because I agree. However it is beside the point because we are not talking about how far you go in life but how your relationship goes. When you are walking down the street and you see two women (one beautiful and one ugly) without knowing anything about there personalities you are much more likely to approach the beautiful one. This is because physical attraction does matter. It is what causes us to approach someone! Physical attraction is huge! And we should defiantly base it over religious views. ","1351728510"

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt; I have raided as tank, healer, and DPS, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that a DPS, at least a ranged DPS, requires the least preparation. Additionally, DPS characters dropping out of raids usually affect the raid makeup the least. There are far more adverse possibilities that could occur if a tank or healer switches out, rather than a DPS.

That's a tad bit arguable as one tank can perform the a job well enough if they know how. Same with healers, but to a lesser degree because Blizzard doesn't seem to know what they want healers to do at times. Thus I mentioned my BF and his tanking as a Warrior. He's damn good at it and has been since when they needed to be.

&gt; I needed to drop my responsibility, (I was a class officer before, as well), so that if my RL time commitments required me elsewhere, my new role would have the least negative impact on the guild's raid.

I'm not arguing against this, too. Sometimes you need to take a break from doing what you like to sort your life out.

&gt; Speaking of which, I was in an AWESOME guild back then, &lt;CEB&gt; on Bronzebeard 2006-2008, and at least 50% of the main 40 man raid became RL friends. I still talk to most of those people today, outside of WoW. Also interesting, about 20% of our raiders, myself included, were prior or current military. Great people, great times!

I miss that kind of community, to be honest. Your best friends end up becoming your colleagues in life, in Star Trek: TNG was anything to go on. xD","1351728511"

So, because of my underprivileged situation, I should be denied the right to play this masterpiece of a game?

I will, however, remark that I have bought almost every game that R* ever made, including every Max Payne and every GTA. I will probably buy GTA V for Xbox, but I won't be particularly happy with shoving out $20 shy of a hundred for it...

And I understand that it takes a while to develop these games and that a lot of people have to be paid, that's all fine and dandy, but I feel that the high price of games is game developers robbing us as much as we are robbing them by pirating -- and even if pirating stopped tomorrow, the price of games would still be stupid high.

We spend about as much as the rest of the world COMBINED on military, and half of the rest are our allies.  Us plus our allies account for fully 75% of global military spending, but we Americans are now the world's de facto police force, which means that we Americans effectively subsidize everyone else by providing stability, stability that they do not have to pay for, which is money that they can then use to provide social services or not go fucking broke.

It would be nearly impossible to invade America even with a third or a quarter of our current military.  Want to know why?  Because there is one gun for every American in this country.  No other country has as many guns as we do, and short a full-scale nuclear or biological/chemical assault, an invading army would face a shitstorm of gridlock, guerilla warfare that would make Afghanistan look like a fucking paintball match.

Also, is this dog up to date on shots? You need to find this out now. If its not, get thee to an ER! To be honest, the dog needs a vet visit and a full check up. If its not sick, a behaviorist needs to come in quickly. Unfortunately, if the dogs shots aren't up to date then the dog may end up put down anyway because your bites will be reported. And yes, you must go to the ER if the dog hasn't had shots.

Your girlfriend needs to take responsibility for her dog. That's the first thing. Second, you need to decide if you can come around her with an aggressive dog. Eventually that will be a big problem if you decide you can't. You already said she would choose the dog over you so I (sadly) think you have an answer.

"hcfactions","t5_2ti8z","My opinions:

I would not be a good PVPer if there wasn't an arena.  Sure, there are servers like shadow that help people practice, but people would like to practice on the server and that's why the arena was essential.  I think Lazer should give the server another try and recode the arena plugin which was amazing.  It really was a shining beacon on the server.

Every post I see here is right.  We need a basic power system that doesn't take studying to work well.  The last system was a great example but a few buffs could have been used for smaller factions (1 or 2) because dying in one death was terrible for those factions.  You needed at least 3 to survive or it wasn't even worth it to claim.  I remember going with a friend and we had to bring in 3 more people to even stand a chance.  Maybe add an extra death (or 10/20 power buff).  That was what was so great about the last system.  It's simplicity.

Another thing, we need to start having polls on the website.  Like others have stated before me, threads with upvotes just aren't organized enough.

Leaving posts shouldn't be allowed either.  They just clog up the subreddit and are bad publicity.  People may say free speech blah blah blah, but if you really want announce that you're leaving, tone down the ego.  You can tell your friends but not everybody gives a shit.

Combat enchants:  They're what's in the vanilla game and they're what people are used to.  They should be allowed because of that and they made fights more interesting and made them last longer too.  Prot 2 limits should still be put in place (prot 2 at level 30).

Potions:  I think all potions (besides maybe regeneration [that could use a poll]) should be allowed.  It sucks to be a noob and having potions you make not to work.

Deathban and Lives:  Deathban should be scaling and needs to be shorter.  2 days at max in my opinion.  Noobs are turned off by too long deathban and veterans never wait it out.  Lives need a day cool down.

Events and KOTH:  Koth is good as is, and the admins did a great job implementing not being able to go back in after you died.  Good job.  Events are okay, but we need more than just evil mine.  I've heard nothing about the cube.

I'll end this post with some final words:  **Nobody wants to read the website.  People should be able to jump right in and not have to study everything.  Potions, if they aren't allowed, should have a better system that prevents them to be made when they aren't allowed.  A big goal should be being as vanilla as possible without making PVP to unbalanced.  I hope you guys listen to my suggestions.  I started playing very late map 2 and I think I know a lot about this server.  Thanks for taking this into consideration.**

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I think you're selling evolutionary arguments short.  I don't by any means think they're a decisive argument against moral realism, but I do think they raise an important skeptical worry that the moral realist needs to respond to (the skeptical worry being: here's an explanation for your moral beliefs that doesn't appeal to moral truths.  Moral truths are thought by many to pose ontological difficulties.  So why, in light of this competing explanation, should we believe that your moral beliefs are true?)

I think moral realists have plausible responses to both premises -- they might deny that this explanation does effectively explain our moral beliefs, or they might claim that we're committed to moral truths anyway.  But I still think it's worth considering insofar as I think it calls into doubt *common sense* morality, and forces us to theorize more rigorously.","1351728526"

fwiw I've signed and shared the [change petition](https://www.change.org/petitions/at-t-verizon-cablevision-time-warner-cable-comcast-stop-six-strike-anti-piracy-rule-or-provide-non-monitored-vpn-services). There was also the EFF petition from a while ago.

- [Tell ISPs: Don't Cut Off Your Users](https://action.eff.org/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8547)

BUT BUT BUT I very much feel that the wider internet hivemind is sick of petitions now. There were some major petitions that I think had significant effect during SOPA and ACTA; but the white house petitions became a fuck you and what you think system. It's telling that even a high profile account like YourAnonNews hasn't pushed this change petition much further than 30 or so signatures. 

The other problem here is the nature of the six strikes scheme. It's an extra-judicial system of corporate justice. It's not something that directly makes sense to lobby congress. It's also very much designed to side step the public justice system where traditional activists - like the EFF - are starting to get wins. 

And most troubling is that, we can't even run a major boycott because all the major ISPs are on board. It is very much a cartel where consumer power and choice has been squeezed in a corporate alliance. 

&gt;what is the action here? Action, action. Admittedly I am drawing a blank

I genuinely think we should push the anti-trust angle. It was an idea that was suggested at one point but didn't really pick up traction. 

- [We can start fighting back against the 'graduated response'! jmdugan genius plan to hit the FTC with complaints.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/r8tt6/riaa_ceo_confirmed_that_the_countrys_largest_isps/c43yy79)

But, even with a big push, this would likely be a slow affair and the hivemind is not very good at long sustained pressure. 

However, the entire scheme is retarded from a tech point of view. They are making a mistake in trying to fight on a field where we hold an advantage. Quite unlike knowing the decorum of DC or machinations of international treaty making; we know how the internet works. And we will simply evolve beyond their reach.

In playing around, I've found on Reddit at least, people readily take to a tech solution to fighting the six strikes plan. Especially so, if you can get the timing right. 

This was a post that frontpaged; it normally would have been a repost but it was playing off some six strikes that frontpaged earlier in the day. I imagine there were many vpn conversions that day.

- [With US ISPs intending to become copyright cops, its time to consider using a VPN.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/qzds1/with_us_isps_intending_to_become_copyright_cops/)

Likewise, we have been groupsourcing more diversified guides here on eR and they seem to run well.

But the important trick seems to be to make sure that the evolve beyond their reach response is part of the social media conversation; because when it is a choice, it resonates. 

- [TyphonWind: Evolve and laugh at them; seems to be the most efficient solution here.](https://pay.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/1171ih/the_nations_major_internet_service_providers_by/c6jvp2e)

I don't see the six strikes as a threat. Actually it's a god send. Without the MAFIAA's fumbling tactics, it would be impossible to move so many people onto encrypted connections. And I highly suspect something interesting happens when a critical mass of the network becomes encrypted.

Personally I think it's extremely sad when people use issues like this to divide the church. The purpose of AiG is to uphold the authority of scripture, not to say ""Oh my gosh you're wrong, you heathen evolutionists are all going to hell."" That's not the case at all; it's only by Christ's redemption that anyone can be saved. The ultimate goal of creationism (at least from my viewpoint) is to support the history in Genesis that explains the entire NEED for a savior, and thus sets the foundation for our entire system of beliefs.

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","I agree entirely, if he does have a conscience then he will feel bad for it, and that is how he should feel upon hearing that he hurt the OP in any way. It just seems wrong to hurt somebody else as a response to them hurting you, especially in this situation with all of its uncertainties and moral grey areas. 

I guess that the biggest issue I really have with this whole situation is that I have had sex while drunk before, both with sober and equally drunk partners, and it just doesn't come across that anything we did (even in situations in which we were black out drunk) could or should be considered rape if we were both consenting. Sexual assaults and rapes MUST be confronted and examined head on, but I feel like there are a lot of situations that are considered rape/assault under the black-and-white definition of the law that simply are not when considered from a human standpoint. I know that sounds cold and heartless but I do feel like it's the truth, there are situations that are considered rape that aren't always such, and there are situations that are not considered rape that should be. That is why I really appreciate conversations like this because it is helping me to gain a better understanding of the feelings on both sides of the issue and one day will one day help me to make better decisions based on the lessons I've learned.","1351728530"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Again, this is venturing into the problem of evil. I touched on this earlier. God loves the world enough to allow for free will. Because of free will, we have sin and other evil forces.

The problem of evil is a legimate problem and is not adequately explained away by free will. The problem is not just with the evil caused by humans, but also with devastating natural events. It creates a big problem in establishing the character of God in a way that it is desirable to worship this God.

&gt;&gt; then God also choose for people to be born into poverty and famine and war

&gt; Everything you mentioned besides people being born with disabilities is a direct result of man's influence on their society.

Not famine. That can be a direct result of a lack of water. We don't yet have the ability to make it rain. Poverty is not always a direct result of human influence either. It is often just a lack of resources.

&gt; You're right that God is unfair, but in the sense that he gives his children much more than they deserve.

This devalues humans by saying they don't deserve the life they have.

&gt; Also that he sent his only son to pay for everyone's moral debt.

How is this a moral action? Couldn't God have forgiven the debt without a sacrifice?

&gt; Also, the document known as Quell, which we have not found yet, was more than likely written before the time these manuscripts began to take shape.

The hypothetical Q document might not ever be found. It is posited to explain why Matthew and Luke contain text in common that doesn't exist in Mark. It is unnecessary if you take the view that the Gospels were written or dictated by eyewitnesses. My opinion is that it hasn't been preserved because the proto-orthidox church fathers had access to the future gospels of Matthew and Luke, and didn't need to preserve this collection of sayings.

&gt;  I think it's very hard to believe that every manuscript written about Jesus was later edited to add all of these elements to it.

I think the better explaination is these documents were written after the stories had started to include mystical elements.

&gt;&gt; Are you familiar with the Euthyphro dilemma?

&gt; I am familiar with it, but it is a false dilemma, as supported by the iron chariots article you linked. The first counter argument, entitled ""False Dilemma"" sums it up best.

I want to understand your position and I don't want to put words in your mouth. Are you taking the position that ""God = goodness"" and ""God would never command evil""?

&gt; Then surely some things that your (our? not sure where you're from) culture does that is considered ""immoral"" you think is moral?

Some of the things society (in general) considers immoral, I think are amoral, like same-sex relationships and sex-working. Some things society considers immoral, I think is immoral to refuse to do, like assisted death for people who are of sound mind and have good reasons to end their life.

&gt; If you do not hold yourself to a moral standard outside of your conscience (which is easily fluctuated and bent to what we want), then you necessarily fall victim to self-righteousness, that is, the belief that what I think is right and what you think is only right inasmuch as it lines up with my beliefs.

This is why it is important to revise our moral standard based on external evidence, and rational debate.

&gt; At the risk of you taking this the wrong way (please don't), let's take a tyrant such as Hitler for example.

As he represents one of the most devastating ideologies of modern times, I understand why he is often used as an example, and I take no offense.

&gt; He believed fully that the Jews, handicaps, gypsies, etc. were a lesser breed of humanity and needed to be purged from the earth.

I was going to make an argument about how his Arianistic beliefs influenced this, but today I learnt that Aryanism is not the same as Arianism. I certainly feel better about Newton's Arianistic beliefs now. We can see that his Catholicism was used to justify his loathing of the Jewish people, but I do not believe it was the cause of his hatred.

&gt; This is a moral decision that he made with likely no conviction from his heart because he believed what he did, and it wasn't tied to any standard outside of himself.

I don't understand. Is this sentence mistyped?

&gt; As a result, As a result, it is impossible to declare any action or behavior as ""right"" or ""wrong"" because these labels are subject to environment and opinion.

Almost right, but needs some correction. It is impossible to declare any action or behavior as **objectively** ""right"" or ""wrong"" because these labels are subject to environment and opinion. It is still subject to being right or wrong in each individual case.

&gt; I may think it is right to murder, and the best argument one can defend the moral wrongness of murder is ""Murder is wrong because I say so.""

How is this different to saying ""Murder is wrong because God says so.""? The argument for saying it is wrong needs to be based on reason, not divine or social fiat.

&gt;&gt; It sounds like you accepting that you can make good or bad decisions, but not accepting the responsibility of learning how to make good decisions.

&gt; I absolutely accept this responsibility. I do so by reading the Bible. God reveals in the Bible what is moral and immoral. As crazy as it is, I haven't had much problem doing what is right even in the eyes of atheists.

&gt;&gt; Yes, especially if it is possible that your guide might not be a good guide.

&gt; Thus far in my life it has been a good guide.

These are good points. I agree that many Christians are able to live good and moral lives, and from our conversation, I think you are one of them.

Do you agree that there are also Christians who do not live good and moral lives, and their immoral behaviour is also based on the Bible?

&gt; When I say I have ""no way of knowing,"" I merely suggest that I have no empirical evidence to prove my hypothesis. This doesn't mean I have no reasons whatsoever for believing my decisions were correct. These decisions are typically confirmed by some sort of peace of mind or another beneficial door opening down the road. Less frequently, when I'm wrong about something, I do not have peace of mind and wind up having to retrace my proverbial steps. From my experience, the most likely scenario of this results in me apologizing to someone for something I've said. I put my foot in my mouth a lot.

Can you describe this peace of mind? Is this similar to a calmness of thought? Does this peace of mind come before or after the decision is made? Have there been times when you have felt this peace of mind, but later regretted your actions? I would like to know if your feelings are similar to the ones I felt as a Christian and still feel.

&gt;&gt; The religious beliefs of others severly hindered his life.

&gt; Yes but that was not your argument. You argued that his own convictions would hold him back. I don't believe they did.

I think his convictions that circles were the perfect shape of planetary orbits held him back from making a better model of planetary orbits. It's not a religious belief but it's a belief that appears to be something he took on faith.

&gt; Sorry about that, I fell victim to the tyranny of rumor. 

No worries, we all do it from time to time.

&gt; How do you measure emotional and moral development? Is there a rubric somewhere that I can check off where I should be at this point?

I don't know of an object way of measuring this. We can only compare it to how we made decisions in the past, and seeing if we have improved in our processes.

&gt; Also, do you claim that you are inherently ""more"" morally developed than a Christian? 

No, but I do claim that my morality is better now than it was when I was a Christian. This could be because my beliefs changed with time, or because I have more life experience. My experiences may have been causal to my beliefs changing, or it may have been a change in perspective that lead to new experiences. It is difficult to seperate them.

&gt; Who gets to decide what a moral human being should look like in your system? What authority do they have to decide this?

Noone can determine for us what morality is. This doesn't mean that you can't have your own vision of what a moral person is, and pursue it.

You might be interested in reading 'The Moral Landscape' by Sam Harris. Here is a link to his TED talk about the same subject.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hj9oB4zpHww

If you read his book, I will give you advance warning. He is critical of faith-based morality, and gives reasons for abandoning it.

&gt;&gt; This kind of thinking is a trap that can hold you back from living a good life.

&gt; Who decides whether my life is good or not? I am enjoying my life immensely. In fact, I enjoy it exponentially more than before I had my beliefs.

This is a good point. I am probably projecting my own life, and the stories of other ex-christians onto your life. I see patterns of people acheiving better and happier lives without Christianity, but this is subject to confirmation bias.

&gt; Let's take our previous example of me wronging you in some way, and then coming to apologize. Let's imagine a scenario where what I do hurts you so much, that you can never forgive me. Am I morally crippled for the rest of my life because I don't have this forgiveness? Does my forgiveness and absolution depend solely on another fickle human being?

From the perspective of the victim, yes. You will have to live your life without their forgiveness.

I think absolution is an illusion, and an unhealthy one at that. The consequences of your actions cannot be undone, even if you are forgiven.","1351728531"

I think the pertinent question to ask is what those individuals, those materials and the capital equipment could have produced instead of just rebuilding a city.  They could have theoretically built a new city, in which case there would now be two instead of one.  It's just that it is unlikely that resources would have been allocated all in one project or in one direction unless something that previously existed was destroyed.  So in effect the army corps of engineers has come from a series of projects you weren't paying attention to, a host of carpenters has come from another bunch of projects you have never heard of and they have all congregated in one place which you can see.  So it is incorrect to conclude, ""Glory be to God, manna from heaven!""  This is progress only if you ignore the unseen costs.  ","1351728545"

I did not read for plot, and often did not remember what the book was about - it was just to focus on the words and not think.  I did not play with toys, I did not have friends - I just had books.

I believe this is called hyperlexia, and I definitely had it.  As an adult, I realize what an advantage it confers.  Law school was a breeze - I'd finish my reading assignments in half the time it would take my classmates to do theirs.  Now that I'm an attorney, patent searches are easy as well.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; Wait, so you're advocating investing in Europe and China over providing Texas with money for growth?

The opposite dillweed. You're exhausting and obtuse. American equities have exposure to Europe and China. I don't have to invest in Europe or China to suffer serious risk from them. I can just loan Texas money that they're guaranteed to pay back at a great rate and tax-free.

&gt; It shows that increasing government spending has a greater impact on growth than lowering tax rates.

Except that increasing government spending has to come from increasing tax receipts from increasing economic growth. What do you think keeps your perpetual motion machine moving when you're putting in so much friction?

&gt; Nice scare tactics. The rich aren't leaving this country, since the US is one of the greatest consumers of products. 

We don't have to leave the country to avoid taxes. But if America wants to spend money like a drunken sailor, I'll allow it to do so, but on my terms. My terms involve me getting a return on my money and not paying taxes on that return. So like I said, I don't have to leave the country, I just won't invest in it.

&gt; Taxes don't scare off investors, weak returns do.

No. Taxes that weaken the comparative advantage of returns over economic rent-seeking. Economic rent-seeking is disastrous because it allows me to become wealthy by providing zero new wealth or value to society. But that's what I'll do to preserve capital.

And why would I initiate a new position until I know what my tax-rate is next year? I could have initiated one in April, but if I sell in less than a year, I'm subject to income taxes vice long-term capital gains. I'll just wait it out until I get what I want or we see 3% economic growth for 3 quarters in a row.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Yes it does matter because you're incredibly naive. 


Just because Planned parenthood performs abortions, it doesn't mean the organization needs to be dismantled. 


Also ZERO tax dollars goes to funding abortions. Not a single penny has gone towards abortion it is a lie by the Christian Taliban to destroy the quality of life for poor people who need services like planned parenthood that keeps people healthy and keeps unborn children from being born by selling contraception, selling condoms, helping out with teaching sex ed etc etc.


And yes there is a movement you are just too naive or don't know enough about politics. 


And it doesn't matter what the fuck the people think, the supreme court ruled women's rights &gt; idiotic bronze age christian theology.



And slowly but surely Christians are making a woman's life a living hell by making them jump through fire hoops to have an abortion performed. If this keeps going they'll have to go to Canada or god forbid mexico for an abortion. People are already going to canada and mexico for over the counter medicine that is better and cheaper in foreign countries because the insurance companies and the pharmacitucal companies have bought our politicians and they own our government and they set the rules.


Just look at the citizens united ruling, the mega corporations can do whatever they want. Right now oil executives are giving out millions of dollars to their GOP hero because mitt romney is going to give them FREE money. ISn't that insane? giving the wealthiest and most profitable businesses IN THE WORLD money for free and me and you are paying for it.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","MFA is a relatively well informed community so these posts generally do pull together much higher quality pieces for the expensive outfit.  There are brands out there that are just a ripoff at almost any price point, but the comments would pretty quickly point that out if that were the case.

There are diminishing marginal returns on every extra dollar you spend. If you look at the Burberry trench coat in person and compare it to the Uniqlo anybody could see that the Burberry was better.  Comparing a $500 coat to the Burberry would be way be less obvious and perhaps only noticeable to people that really know their stuff.  A $1000 trench coat would be even more difficult to differentiate.  Each person decides at which point the extra money is no longer worth the extra quality.  I happily spend hundreds on decent suits, but I stick with $40 Levis for jeans.  Others would spend hundreds on jeans but stick with a cheap suit.

It's the same principle for lots of goods like cars, furniture, computer components, and TVs.  You can easily get ripped off on any of those, but there is likely a Reddit community that can help you  find your quality-price sweet spot for any such purchases.

edit: This particular post lists a lot of stuff from Uniqlo.  Cashmere is a more expensive material than cotton, but I don't think Uniqlo's cashmere is any better quality than their cotton stuff.  It's actually [really tough to find good cashmere these days](http://putthison.com/post/33160138133/old-cashmere-is-better-heres-the-honest-truth)","1351728554"

Try e-junkie, there are some quality products there.

Think about the problem first, then find websites that have products to solve that problem. Look for an affiliate link on that site. If they don't have one, send an email and ask if they would set one up for you.

It's better if you have experience with the product/service and even better if you have had to solve the problem yourself, because you will have much more understanding and ideas on what to write about. Not essential, but can help.

You could even chat to a local manufacturer, let them know you want to do their online marketing and all they need to do is ship to the customer. That could work much better than trying to find an existing affiliate product (popular products have lots of people promoting them).","1351728555"

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","Hi Chemicalgeekery-
I am not a scientist, but rather a very satisfied user of MMS, and a witness to the benefits it had for friends and family. I have tried many natural remedies without any success at all. I am not skewed towards liking it.  If it didn’t give me results, I would not come back to it time and again. 

Much of what you, and now the poster “onlythescience” say goes straight over my head.  I got a D in high school chemistry, although I deserved a low F (the teacher and I were friends). But, I must say that a lot of what onlythescience said seems to make sense, although he probably should have left out the name calling. I will let him defend that MMS causes no harm if used properly, and is beneficial against many maladies.

I will just offer a link to a clinical study which found that the chemicals are not harmful when taken internally (within limit of course): http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6961033

Regarding FEMA’s recommendation of adding bleach to storage water, FEMA must have changed their guidelines on bleach.  I got my data here, after a Google search:
http://www.prepareandsurvive.info/documents/WaterPurificationandStorage.pdf
It quotes FEMA as recommending one teaspoon per quart, although the link to the original FEMA document is now dead.

As far as linking to a clinical study showing the efficacy of MMS, I am sure that the proponents of MMS would love to have a double-blind study to put the debate to bed, but that could only happen if one of us wins the lottery and decides to fund a multi-million dollar study.  While sellers of MMS make a profit for their trouble (as do all people selling anything, hopefully), it won’t add up to that kind of money.  I don’t feel like it right now, but I think there is a way to look up a website through Google or somewhere else to see how much traffic they get.  I’ll bet that the websites that sell MMS don’t get a whole lot of traffic, which would mean that they don’t get a whole lot of money.

Let me quote a short paragraph from an MMS blog I frequent:

“It is ironic how we have made distrust of personal experience the rule rather than the exception, in an attempt to give dominion to professional biases and impersonal conjecture over outcomes that really happened. This appears to be the modus operandi of critics of MMS. It’s not limited to MMS though.”

We (MMS proponents) have little chance of being able to provide you with the kind of proof which would make you consider MMS as an effective weapon against some maladies.  That does not mean that it is not everything we claim it to be - we just cannot prove it.  I understand that a negative correlation between the administration of MMS and the cessation of symptoms does not necessarily mean MMS had an effect on the symptoms.  Without controlling for other potentially influential factors, correlation cannot imply causation. The only thing I can offer at this point is my own testimony, and the many self-shot YouTube video testimonials, but I understand that that is not any kind of proof.  It’s not proof, but it’s not nothing. If we were friends in real life, I could offer you some MMS if you had a health problem which is known to be helped by MMS.  But, even if it did help you, and you became convinced, you would be powerless to convince anybody online - just like I am now.

The B-17 argument is interesting.  B-17 may be crap or dangerous, but I know at this point it is not a scam.  That is because, since it is banned, the proponents advise people to make it themselves out of apricot pits.  No money trail to follow there.

Your point about MMS being profitable are well taken.  I myself toyed with the idea of being a supplier - I’m glad I never did, for a variety of reasons. 

I think one point of disagreement that the two of us cannot get past is the trustworthiness of the FDA.  I think there is a lot more to be concerned with about “following the money” in regards to powers who would not want MMS to be legal if it really worked.  Imagine what would happen if the FDA tested MMS, and proclaimed that it will cure so many diseases.  What do you think would happen to the economy - the drug companies make more than any other industry on Wall Street by a very wide margin?  There are many other reason I would offer as to why not to trust the FDA, but I fear they would fall on deaf ears.

Your final sentence: “I am against MMS because the stuff is not safe and there is no evidence that it is effective.”  I hope you see now that it is impossible to convince you that MMS is beneficial, because there is no way to produce the proof you require. I do think that you should consider the link to the study I gave which shows that internally taking the chemicals which end up in the glass after mixing the MMS with the mild acid (and not any chemicals which may offgas).

You must know how frustrating it is that I didn’t pay more attention in Chemistry class, although I doubt high school chemistry would give me the ability to fully understand what you and Onlythescience are talking about.  I do look forward to seeing how you respond to him (or her).  I clicked on his name, and this is his first Reddit post, so I guess he didn’t know better than not to resort to name calling and just let the science speak for itself.","1351728558"

I think you may be emotionally invested in your argument so this may fall upon deaf ears but ill try to explain kindly anyway. Your arguement of barrowing some cash to hold you over till your next payday is dead on accurate. However, it applies to backing the loan against a guaranteed income (asset). What happens if that investment isn't guaranteed?

 Imagine leveraging out all you got on a very valuable race horse to breed. Then that horse dies, your asset loses all value (toxic asset) and you need money to cover your rent until....your horse comes back to life and starts breeding? What about if your horse just got kicked in the dick real hard and MAY not be able to breed for 10 years. Or, what if your horse produces only mediocre horse babies like the shirtless one running during Sandy. No one wants that horse in their stable. NO ONE. That means you have in your possession an asset that has lost almost all of its value that will likely return only after a long time or likely never. Should you be able to get a loan to cover your costs till you in a cozy solvent bed with your Derpy horse baby assets? 
Now imagine those derpy horses are houses. Understand that and you'll understand why those QEs ain't working and a lot of those banks still went under or got their values smashed. Now imagine someone in congress made you guarantee those derpy horse babies values, and made GSEs (fannie n freddie) to subsidize their guarantees with tax payer dollars. Understand that and you'll understand the housing crisis. Imagine that both parties passed around this derpy horse subsidy over leveraged spending bomb for about 10 years. Understand that and you'll understand austerity, how it works in gov., and why it should happen.

Why should I change who I am and how I talk to people when this ONE topic comes up?

Will I state my views and opinions?  Sure.  Will I irrationally approach all Christians like I ""know"" that they condone killing unruly children, just because the Old Testament says it's okay?  Absolutely not.  

I think what the difference between the two camps boils down to is an intellectual arrogance and pride on one side, versus humility and open-mindedness on the other.  One group will most likely be emotional, loud, and arrogant in general (proclamations regarding their atheism included), and the other side will typically be more humble, calm, and rational in general.

After making this obscenely huge map (I meant a WORLD) I would then look to the past and see how different areas have changed, where territories came about and how conquering heroes might have marched across the land. After creating a concrete past, I would look to the future, making similar assumptions, highly powerful wizards who start feuding and fleshing out their backstories. 

I would then determine alternate timelines. If Wizard 1 didn't exist or was killed early (aka adventure 1) then how would this affect what happens with Wizard 24. Just to compensate for early party killing or barbarian hordes who just rush the castle and actually win. (This would be percentage rolled for me but you could determine your own random system)

The financial crisis was not entirely Bush's fault. The president didn't create an overvalued housing market and tell banks to give out poor loans. Again, this is the market's problem and the market will recover as it always has. Flip the order of their terms and we could easily be saying that Bush is cleaning up Obama's mess.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Trump's companies' bankruptcies were not a result of being smart, and his net worth was devastated. What saved him was having a diverse portfolio so he had assets that were not affected, but most people of his net worth have the same setup. 

It is unrelated, but if GM was left to liquidation, the assets would have been up for grabs by any entity, and would have been acquired by one, or more likely several, foreign auto manufacturers. There was no US manufacturer in a position to make that sort of purchase, were it not for the backing by the US government to create NGMCO. Were it not for the bailout it would have assigned a more accurate value to the assets and probably saved taxpayers money, but the ownership would most certainly be overseas, and many of the jobs as well.","1351728586"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","That's the issue I'm grappling with. 

It's not as though the media didn't hype this up. They most certainly did. In fact, for 4 days straight. The language used was ""unprecedented"" and the like; in all honesty, the media did enough, it's just that Irene from last year received the same amount of coverage and did 1/10 the damage. Thus, everyone was leary of all the media hype this go around; ""the boy who cried wolf"" so to speak.

But herein lies my main issue: let's assume (for sake of argument; i have no proof of anything at all) that the military could have forecasting models able to predict storms 4-6 weeks in advance and that the best public forecasting is about a week (still enough time to communicate to the public). Perhaps these methodologies warrant classification since our adversaries could benefit from them should they be unclassified. Maybe it's a cost/benefit? In this instance, transferring these forecasting tools to the public, while useful for the U.S. population, *isn't enough to compromise the competitive military advantage it grants in our military operations worldwide.*

Should i be concerned? Well, the theme for me is that the military has access to knowledge that could directly impact the lives of the population, well in advance of public capabilities.

What other gaps in knowledge am I aware of that could threaten me or my family?

More importantly, what other gaps am i UNAWARE of? Do you see what I'm getting at here?","1351728588"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;But I can understand the murdering of his father, 

I cannot

&gt;he was not an innocent man. 

Innocent until proven guilty no longer, ey?


&gt;I don't particularly like when a flying unmanned drone kills anybody

I agree.

&gt; but his father was justifiable.

I disagree. 

&gt;trial would have been nice

yes, it would have been nice, legal, and the right thing to do.

&gt; but I doubt the guy was going to prove his innocence 

That's not how the justice system works. The burden of proof is on the prosecutor to show to a group of his peers that beyond a reasonable doubt he was guilty of the accused crimes. You advocate instead of giving him his constitutional rights, we should just kill him to save time. 

&gt;and would've ended up being in guantanamo or something anyway. 

Perhaps, or he could have been absolved of all the alleged crimes and walked away a free man -- we'll never know because they assassinated him instead of giving him a trial. 


&gt;The kid being in the car was really unfortuante and yes, shouldn't have died, but it's not like this is the first time America has caused civilian casualties. 

Not the first time, therefore it's not a big deal. Doesn't show any systemic flaws that deeply need to be addressed. Move along folks. Did I get that right?

&gt;I just remember hiroshima

""Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, reflected this reality when he wrote, **""The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace.the atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in the defeat of Japan.""** 

Admiral William D. Leahy, Chief of Staff to President Truman, said the same thing: **""The use of [the atomic bombs] at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender.""**

To me that just shows how fucked up the US has always been. They've just done a stellar job at sanitizing history.  

For instance, ever heard of the book [Killing Hope?](http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Hope-Military-Interventions-Since/dp/1567510523) or perhaps the [Confessions of an Economic Hit Man?](http://www.economichitman.com/)

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Back when I introduced a new player to LoL, I gathered up some of my friends who are also level 30s, and we queued together as a full (or almost full) premade team.  We told that newbie friend to play ADC while I go support so that I can watch and help him along.  The beginning was hard for him because of the skill level difference, but he gradually got used to it.  By the time he got to the 20s, he was holding his own against level 30s.  But when he solo queued, he stomped the other people that are around his own summoner level.  And he managed all of this without runes because we told him that tiers 1 and 2 runes aren't worth the IP.  I suggest trying this with your friend since he does have some MOBA experience being ex-HoN and all.

Of course, the other option is playing on smurf as you are now.  It is REALLY hard to jungle without runes, so I don't recommend it unless you're forced into that role.  But all the other roles can be played without runes.  They help, but you can win without.  I raised a smurf to level 30 doing a mix of solo and duo queuing, and I still won around 60% of my games.  It's tricky at first, but it's doable.  Plus, I see it as a way to improve your own playing.  If you, on a lowbie smurf with almost nothing (basically at a disadvantage), are able to play at the same level as a level 30 summoner with all the runes and masteries, you'd be that much better mechanically once you move back into your level 30 account.","1351728594"

When I was in school I was of the ""well I'll just go slower and be extra careful"" view, because I didn't want to spend more than I needed to, but I have a job now and I'm able to afford them, so I figure in the interest of my own personal safety, I should go ahead with it. 

The question is just ""what models are garbage and what models are not"". I remember someone telling me the goodyear nordics from CT were awful, but that's anecdotal at best, so I'm hoping lurkers can say ""model X does not suck, and I've tried a few different models in my lifetime""","1351728595"

Bottom-line, a hatchling has a tiny mouth with tiny teeth, so you'd be fine. I'm not a zoologist or any kind of expert, but I've been feeding a corn snake for three weeks, pulling him out of his enclosure almost every day (except after feedings) to handle him, and he's never even *tried* to bite me.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Most all religions today tolerate interest, but as a theology student I would believe you would understand how religious practices have changed over time. Its tough to lay out specific dates because I would have to have one for each religion, but in Catholicism, Judaism, and Islamic religions, it was morally unsound to charge interest on loans. Especially during medieval times when needing a loan was due to misfortune like bad harvests, weather damage, etc. 
Sorry you made the assumption that I pulled this off some TIL post from the other day but this is actually a topic of interest (Ha! Get it?) for me and I have done my own unbiased research on the matter. Yes, it does require reading books from the likes of David Icke and others, but the true people with the ""tin foil hats,"" are the ones who blindly close their eyes and minds to the possibility that society may be being controlled, or herded to some final goal.","1351728595"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The main reason I am Republican is my idea that we are all Americans, we are all in this together, yet because we all have the same potential, we should all be treated equally. Though I know many Americans are honest and in the need of Entitlements, I hope for a time when they are both needed and abused less. My hope is for an America with an excess, not a deficit, an America where each individual who works hard earns an honest living, and each individual who doesn't work hard, does not reap rewards.

Recently, Republicans have been labeled as bringing upon a ""war against women"". This simply isn't true. Personally, I see abortion as killing a life, and my stance regarding this remains the same with other controversial topics (ie. the death penalty). My stance remains that no person has the right to decide whether another person lives or dies. Unfortunately, when dehumanization occurs, it becomes okay for violence to occur. 

Alternately, I see the need for abortions and birth control, and I understand these needs fully. Though, I do not believe the right to birth control or abortions are worth choosing my political candidate over.
This, I think is an issue. I have talked to far too many young women who plan to vote Democrat solely on the basis that Obama is pro-choice. These ladies say that ""selfish, man-run"" Washington D.C. is being selfish. I think they are being selfish, because unemployment and the deficit are what I think to be far larger  and more important issues, because they regard all Americans, not just women.

The reason we debate these matters is because there is no right or wrong answer. Though there is a separation of church and state, unfortunately people will always get their morals from their religion, and you cannot expect to change the minds of those who are adamantly one way or another. I do, however, hope that all young voters alike think not only of themselves, but all Americans who count on the Government for justice and strength.

I believe the original PlanetSide is gonna become Free to play once again soonish, not sure when exactly though. But the sequel plays so far rather differently, it's still huge scale (More so than the first game) and it's a bit simpler I'd imagine, it's gameplay is very similar to Battlefield 3, but there still is quite a bit of a learning curve for the meta game and such. (Honestly, the key is simply awareness.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Slap labels on me if you want. I really, really love videogames, which is why I hate mediocre/bad video games. I consider all of the series' above either bad or mediocre (honestly, I have played bits of many of them). This topic didn't ask about games we like or want to play, there are a good number of those as well. I'm loving Torchlight 2 right now, for instance, as well as Payday: The Heist. These are really well put-together games with deep gameplay and Torchlight actually has an interesting story if you care to pay attention to it. I'm also playing Crawl and Dwarf Fortress, occasionally dipping back into HoN (aside from the community, everything is right with that game), and I'll probably play Shogun 2 again soon. I love FTL although I'm not playing it anymore, and I REALLY love DayZ.

Today, for spooky games, I'm going to be playing Amnesia and Silent Hill 2 (probably the best horror game of all time) with friends who feel largely the same way I do about the series' I mentioned.

I don't look down on people who enjoy those game series' at all, honestly. People need mindless, repetitive enjoyment and that's okay, I've been there many times. I do wish more people would appreciate deeper games.","1351728614"

Yeah, it is. But in the UK/US, people make as much room as necessary to let passengers get off the train (if they can). Germans don't. If it's busy, the second people stop coming through one side of the doors, they start trying to get on, even if there are clearly more people trying to get off. It's all very fuck-you-I'm-doing-my-thing.

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","This is THE FASTEST way to get from 1-60, tested by others and confirmed by me and my friends.

This requires TWO people, one with a lvl 60 character already and one with the new character you want to level.

* Have the lvl 60 be the party leader, create a game on Normal in A3 with Monster Power 10 (&lt;- MUST have MP10 on.) , last checkpoint to kill Azmodan.
* Waypoint to Keep Depths 1 &gt; then go directly to Keeps 2.
* For this to work, you MUST be on screen with the lvl 60 at ALL times while the both of you run around, letting him kill all mobs. You will get all the XP so long as you are on the same screen.
* Proceed to smash through Keeps 2 until you reach the Breach or run into a wall and don't want to backtrack.
* Remake the game, and repeat.
* At lvl 30, kill Diablo and start again from Nightmare.
* At lvl 50, kill Diablo and start again from Hell.

Two of my buddies and I leveled fresh lvl 1's to 60 in under 6 hours using this method. Hellfire Ring/Leorics/Cains is not required, but helps quite a bit. I used Cain's with the highest Ruby in my helm that I could afford, my buddies had a hellfire to slap onto that. You'll gain multiple levels per run until lvl 50, then you'll get about 1 level per run after that.","1351728615"

If I buy a 10 year bond today in 2015 it's a 7 year bond, and if yields go up 1% over the next three years a 7 year bond loses 6% of capital value. Not a good look for a supposedly risk free investment.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","There's a group of people who say you should play the game blind first time around.  Personally, I wasn't able to enjoy it much because I was so damn confused.  It was a while before I was able to relax and really enjoy Skyrim.  If you want to play blind, don't read any more.  If you'd like a couple of suggestions which (in my opinion) don't ruin the game, read on.  These are largely targeted for PS3 and Xbox:

**Difficulty Setting:** Using the Start menu, you can adjust the difficult from Novice to Master.  It defaults to Adept.  The setting determines the how much damage you give and receive.  Adept is a 1:1 ratio.  I suggest using Novice for your first playthrough.  Some will say how eeeeeasy the game is and how they finished the whole thing on Master level wearing nothing but the ragged robes in which they started, wielding no weapon but an iron dagger which they hold in their teeth because they just punch every ancient dragon to death.  However, since everyone can't have their superior gaming skills, just ignore them and change the setting if you want.  Or don't.  Whatever. 

**Controls:** There are certain functions you can do which are not readily apparent at the beginning

* You can sprint using the upper or lower front buttons (depending on the system)
* You can ""favorite"" spells, weapons or apparel/armor using the triangle / y button.  Then, you can access your favorites list using the ""up"" directional arrow on the left side of the controller.
* You can fly using the ... just kidding.  You can't fly.
* When enchanting, you can name enchanted items using the triangle / y button
* You can ""fast travel"" from any open area to any other open area that you have already discovered using the map function
* You can ""wait"" using the menu button

**Safe Storage:** You need a place to keep the things you are saving for later or aren't ready to sell yet.  Most containers in Skyrim will respawn after a certain period of time.  When you purchase a home, that is safe storage.  However, there are certain places that will not respawn.  Rather than naming all of them, I'll give you the best one.  Right after you leave Helgen, you'll come to the Guardian Stones.  Look north and you'll see the outline of a cabin on your map thingie at the top of the screen.  Go there.  Meet the nice lady (Anise).  Check out her cabin.  Beside the bed in the back is a trap door.  Go downstairs.  She has an alchemy AND an enchanting table in that little cabin!  And everything there is safe storage, upstairs and downstairs (except the barrel).  Too bad she lives there, because you could pretty much use it for a house, right?  Anyway, read the letter on the table downstairs, but don't take it or anything else because that would be rude.  That's all I'll say. 

**Unlocking Dragon Shouts:** Before you can use a dragon shout, you have to unlock it.  You need a Dragon Soul, too.  To unlock it, put your cursor on the shouts in the magic menu, and then on the shout you want to unlock.  Press X (for Xbox) / Square (for PS3) and it will ask you if you want to spend a dragon soul.  Select yes, and then you can activate it.  Press the lower, right, front, trigger button to use it.  

**Defense:** I died a LOT when I first started playing.  I eventually figured out it was because, trying to be a pure mage, I had crappy protection from physical attack.  But many armor wearing peeps have crappy protection from magical attacks.  So, here's what I learned:

* Magical Defense: Bretons are already 25% resistant to all magic.  The Lord Stone also offers 25% resistance to magic.  There are other sources, quests and enchantments, for magical protection as well.  Wearing full super armor or using a shield with no perks for resistance to magic (or fire/frost/shock) will not help.  So a wimpy mage in black robes with shock can take down a tank of a man. 
* Physical Defense:  You're either going to need to wear armor or use one of the mage alternatives.  The Lord Stone also offers 50 points of armor (although you aren't wearing any), which is better than some full sets of light and heavy armor.  It's a useful stone, all around.  If you're wanting to play a pure mage, you should supplement your lack of armor with either alteration (the ""mage armor"" perk is a must, and means you shouldn't wear any armor at all to make it work), health enchantments (extra health acts as a kind of armor) or sneak (can't hurt you if they can't find you). 
* Restoration: It can be a lifesaver for anyone.  At least get the ""Novice"" and ""Regeneration"" perks.

**Followers:**  Get one, at least your first time around.  Some are more useful than others.  Marcurio, at the inn in Riften, is probably the best available from the beginning.  He's 500 septim and worth every bit of it . 

**Loot:** Until the later levels (where everything becomes of high value), choose what you loot carefully.  It makes more sense to carry 25 1 lb hide boots that cost 10 septims each than one 25 lb warhammer that costs 100 septims.  When I'm leaving Helgen, aside from the weapons I'm actually using, I only take armor.  Generally, light armor has a greater cost to weight ratio than heavy armor. 

**A Couple of Spoilers:** So far, nothing I've said would be considered a spoiler or ruin your discovery of anything.  What follows are some of the most useful items in game which it could take a long while to find.  I wish I'd known about them right away, so I'm telling you. 

* Fiery Souls: This is THE most useful enchantment in the game, especially at early levels.  It is essentially a dual enchantment, combining ""soul trap"" and ""fire.""  The best thing about it is that you can set the soul trap to ""1 second"" and the burn enchantment will stay at 10 points.  Always ten points.  Thus, you can get hundreds of charges even out of a petty soul gem.  It's only found in Ironbind Barrow, between and south of Dawnstar and Winterhold.  You'll have two people to help you (not including your follower).  It's a good story, and I won't ruin that part.  The final room, with the big boss (and a Word Wall with ""Become Ethereal"" ... a shout which has often saved my life) has a throne with an axe that has Fiery Souls on it. 
* Ghostblade: This is your reward for Ansilvund, an excavation south of Riften.  It's another good story, which I won't reveal.  The reward is an ethereal ancient Nord sword which, honestly, isn't that great practically, but is nevertheless THE most awesome weapon in the game.  You can improve it (with the arcane smithing perk) with three ectoplasms and it always does three extra points of damage that ignores armor.  And it only weighs a pound. 
* Rahd's Longhammer: If you're going to be doing two-handed, this is the weapon for you.  Warhammers deal the most damage per swing of any weapon, and this is an Orcish warhammer.  It is only exceeded by two battle-axes and six warhammers of all the weapons in the game.  But it's better than ALL the other two-handed weapons because it swings faster than a greatsword.  So it deals massive damage quickly, more per second than even the Daedric and Dragonbone warhammers.  But it's technically not ""enchanted,"" so you can improve it at a grindstone immediately.  And you can put your own enchantments on it ... maybe ""fire damage"" and ""health absorb"" or ""paralyze"" and ""shock"".  It is found at the very end of Liar's Retreat near Dragonsbridge.  Liar's Retreat is NOT easy.  Lots of nasty Falmer and Chaurus.  But this weapon is worth it.  I've only done one two-handed build and it was specifically to use this weapon. ","1351728618"

Given this information the only way to accomplish what you want securely is to have a computer on your network somewhere either acting as a print server (and hosting it via a service like google Cloud print) or having a computer on your network running a VPN server. Given that you don't know what VPN is, this is probably easier said than done.

I understand that his intention in this moment was to encourage education, not to promote it as limiting, but he needs to understand that ""as much as they can afford"" strikes a strong chord with America's middle class and rising tuition prices. This is a time where it is important to recognize that many recent graduates are drowning in debt and ""as much as they can afford"" is not very much at all. It's also important to note that this figure is not equivalent to how much credit they can get extended to them. This is a time where we should be addressing this very issue through the lens of making education more affordable and reducing these limitations, not just flippantly acknowledging them, which is what Gov.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well, if you weren't wearing a space suit, no matter where you started you would die almost instantly because there is essentially no oxygen at any level of Jupiter's atmosphere.

But let's say you do have a space suit. What do you mean by ""step foot on it""? Jupiter is, as you noted in your question, a *gas giant*, meaning it's made of gas. There is no solid surface. And just like Earth's atmosphere, the gas doesn't really have a ""top"", it just gets thinner and thinner as you get further and further from the planet, until at some point it is indistinguishable from interplanetary space (which, you may be interested to know, [is *not* a true vacuum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_space#Interplanetary).

But let's say you just get dropped from some height way outside of Jupiter's visible atmosphere. Once you got within about 200,000 miles (about 300,000 km) of the planet's surface, you'd [die fairly quickly from radiation poisoning](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2001/03/010329075139.htm).

But let's say your space suit has radiation-resisting superpowers. Well due to Jupiter's extreme mass, you'd quickly accelerate through the tenuous upper atmosphere at about [2.6 *g*](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/circles/u6l3e.cfm), and burn up just like a meteor flying through Earth's upper atmosphere.

But let's say we dropped you in the middle of Jupiter's upper atmosphere, where the pressure were just about the same as Earth's surface pressure (1 bar). **Now** we're getting somewhere. You'd be falling, but since you're already in the thicker part of the atmosphere, your terminal velocity will be fairly low (taking Jupiter's higher gravity and the atmosphere's lower density into account (it is mostly hydrogen, so its density is about 10 times less than Earth's even though the pressure is similar), your terminal velocity would be about 3200 km/h (2000 mph)). This is probably slow enough that frictional heating and heating from [supersonic compression](http://thesciencepundit.blogspot.com/2010/04/air-friction-myths.html) would not burn you up. 

But hell, for shits and giggles, and in the name of keeping you alive as long as possible, let's give you a parachute, a little smaller than the one given to the [Galileo probe](http://www.agu.org/journals/je/v103/iE10/98JE01766/98JE01766.pdf), so that you fall at about the same velocity initially (~100 m/s, or about 360 km/h, 220 mph). Now we're cooking. Not literally though, because the temperature at this level is fairly comfortable: The temperature is [just about 0 C (32 F)](http://www.agu.org/journals/je/v103/iE10/98JE01766/98JE01766.pdf), so you'd actually be pretty comfy. 

So okay, now you're in your radiation-proof spacesuit, with your handy parachute, falling through the atmosphere just at the top of the clouds. These clouds are made of ammonia, but let's just assume your spacesuit and parachute are okay with that. You'd actually be okay for quite a while; maybe a little bored, but hey, you're on motherfucking **Jupiter**.

After about 5 minutes, you've fallen to the 2-bar level (about twice the average surface pressure on Earth). You are now falling through different clouds, made of [ammonium hydrosulfide and ammonium sulfide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Jupiter#Vertical_structure). They don't look much different than regular clouds, but they do have a brownish tint that gets browner the deeper you go. Some people may find this surprising, but you won't feel many ill effects, even as the pressure increases rapidly. The bends are only seen with rapid *decompression*; the only ill effects from rapid *compression* are if the compression is too rapid to allow your body cavities (such as inner ear, sinuses, etc) to equalize. So as long as [your ears are clear of wax](http://american-hearing.org/disorders/barotrauma/), you should be fine.

About 10 minutes later, you have reached the 4 bar pressure level, which is about 4 times the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, or about the pressure you'd experience under 30 meters (100 feet) of water. The temperature has actually gotten quite cold, and is now around -40 C (-40 F). But assuming all the capabilities your spacesuit already had, I'm sure it wouldn't be too much to ask for a small heater. You are now passing through clouds of water ice, just like you might see at high altitudes on Earth, but it is getting very dark. You are also being whisked along horizontally by winds reaching 200 m/s (450 mph, 720 km/h), but you barely notice as they are not very turbulent.

15 more minutes go by, and you are now at a pressure of 10 bar, or 10 times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure. At bit before this level you should have changed the mixture of air you are breathing; if you breathed normal air at a pressure of 10 bar or more, you would suffer from acute [oxygen toxicity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity), which can be quickly fatal (oxygen is actually toxic at much lower pressures, but it would take much longer than our quick decent through jupiter). At the same time, you can suffer from [nitrogen narcosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis), which has similar symptoms to inhaling nitrous oxide initially, but can quickly progress to severe symptoms like coma or death. So as you dive deeper your magic space suit also changes the mixture of air you are breathing, so that the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen remain the same as you are used to breathing, with the rest filled with helium or neon, which are the only known gasses which don't exhibit a toxic effect at high pressures. But provided this is all taken care of, you are actually quite comfortable, as the temperature has risen back up to about 23 C (73 F).

Another 25 minutes pass, and you are starting to realize you're in trouble. You are in complete darkness now, and the temperature has been steadily increasing as you go further down: now over 100 C (212 F) and still rising fast. Your spacesuit's systems are starting to fail. Within a few minutes, the temperature is over 200 C (392 F), and you don't have much longer to survive. Not wanting to endure a miserable, burning death, you take your conveniently placed cyanide capsule and end your interplanetary adventure.

**But your body keeps falling**.

Down into interior regions where we have little ideas of the exact composition. Pressure and density are increasing drastically, slowing your descent to a crawl. The atmosphere of mostly hydrogen is actually a liquid now, and is now several thousand degrees, but with essentially no oxygen around your body turns into a charcoal-like substance. Your parachute cuts away, but your spacesuit remains intact because it is convenient to the story, and your compressed, dead chunk of bodily substance slowly sinks, beyond 1,000 bar, beyond 10,000 bar...

Until finally, at an insanely crushing pressure of 2,000,000 bar (and a temperature of 5,000 K, about the temperature of the surface of the sun!), you stop sinking. Because your super-spacesuit is conveniently still intact, your body is still mostly water, which is essentially incompressible, even at these incredible pressures. As such, at this level, where the density is about 1 g/cm^3 or about 1000 kg/m^3 (this is approximately the density of water) you and the surrounding atmosphere are the same density, so you will no longer sink! So there your carbonated corpse floats, for all eternity, until the heat death of the universe.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Judging from the comments here, nobody replying bothered to read the actual article. Most of the vitriol directed at those in charge of football in England came directly from Seb Coe, and the ‘run by idiots’ comment is really just a convenient soundbite to accompany it.

Putting aside your contempt for Sepp Blatter (and god knows he deserves it), the criticism is right on the money: the FA, the Football League and the Premier League have an intensely dysfunctional relationship. You can see evidence of this in such things as almost no efforts being made to bring real financial fair play and responsible stewardship of clubs into force. The way that all clubs outside the Premier League had their feet held to the fire until they agreed to new rules for financial compensation when big clubs poach their young stars that mean they get even less than the pennies they were getting before. I hate how English football works, and if it means we have to lose a few World Cup bids to wake us up to that reality, so be it.

You can't tell me you wouldn't go around trying to correct the misinformation out there.

People like me have tried the diet and exercise bullshit but it just doesn't work, Carbs and Fiber aren't satiating for us as it is for anorexics and 'normal weight' people. It takes a shit-ton of motivation, time and money to lose weight the old fashioned way, which is why it's commendable when people are able to lose weight the hard way. But for people like me, there's Keto. Fats for fuels, Protein in place of Carbs for Glucose and for satiety. It's the most intelligent and easiest diet in the world, that's why people act like it's the End-All Be-All diet, because your body naturally and gradually cleanses itself and uses up your body fat without having to count every single calorie and jog for 2 hours a day. You reach satiety easier/sooner as your body adjusts to its newer weight and wind up eating slightly less calories as a result, something that never happened to me with any other low-fat high/moderate-carb diet.","1351728632"

All but defeated but for Wooton's mistake. Didn't lead at any point till in extra time, despite playing at home with Hazard and Oscar coming off the bench and Mata starting, youth players coming off the other bench.

---

&gt;[A recent survey, albeit in Kansas, found that of the 300 women they interviewed, 92% were pro-male-pill.](http://www.graziadaily.co.uk/conversation/archive/2012/10/24/can-we-ever-trust-men-to-take-the-contraceptive-pill.htm)

Meaning 8% neutral or opposed.

&gt;of these 280 odd women, almost ¾ said they would continue to take the contraceptive pill even if their partner was on the male pill.

Meaning 3/4 of those women don't trust their men, and yet at the same time find it acceptable for men to trust their women.

I don't have time to keep looking, but all these calls of ""can't trust men"" I keep reading just reduces the public's will to invest in male birth control.

If you look, we've had _many_ promising options, they just don't get funding, because there's this view that men wouldn't take it.  And that view is primarily forwarded by women, not by men (not _all_ women, or even _most_ women, just those that are forwarding it are almost always women).

As for as your biological argument, yes, it does make sense, but it doesn't explain why the promising options don't get funding.

The vast majority of women are in favor of men getting birth control, but at the same time seem unwilling to extend the same trust to men that men have been expected to extend to women for decades.

"Ubuntu","t5_2qh62","There's a reason for this and a (fairly difficult) way to fix it.

ubuntu-desktop and xubuntu-desktop are *meta*packages, which means they exist only to install a bunch of other packages.  Unfortunately, another characteristic of them is that when you *uninstall* the metapackage, it *doesn't* remove any of the other packages the metapackage originally installed.  They just stay on your system.  They're not even marked as ""automatically installed"" so it's very difficult to even find what they were.

The solution is not an easy one: remove all packages that ubuntu-desktop depends on but which xubuntu-desktop doesn't depend on (or vice versa, if you are going back again).  The reason this isn't easy is that there will be overlap in the set of packages they install, and also because each of those packages has another tier of dependencies, and so forth, and their can be circular dependencies between those, and so on.  Even aptitude has difficulty doing it.

The cleanest way would first be to remove all dependencies of ubuntu-desktop that aren't essential system packages, and then install xubuntu-desktop.  Again, a fair bit of hard work.

Installing xubuntu-desktop in addition to ubuntu-desktop *shouldn't* be too bad though.  You will notice that xubuntu-desktop overrides a lot of system-wide things, ie it takes precedence for things like the startup and shutdown screens.","1351728634"

Rarely meet a nunu top lane but oh well. The early lvls are probably singed weakest ones, usually depends but against a high dmg person, like Xin Zhao you might wanna be careful and not go a 1v1 with him early. ( as in lvl 1-6 ish ) Usually you want to get catalyst as a first item, and maybe a couple of dorans shield if you feel its needed. 

The way to use your Q early on is just to turn it on and off if they come in for a last hit, just see what minion they are going for and go there aswell and just poke them with your Q and turn it quickly off, same concept in the bot lane as AD Carry, when their ad carry go for a last hit, you poke them with an auto attack. just try not to loose any CS under the progress.

As for item build i like to go RoA as first item, it just gives all the stats you need besides movement speed so its a great item, i've been trying hextech aswell now lately and it dont seem that bad tbh but thats probably something you can experience on if you want. 

The reason why you probably dont feel as tanky as other singed might probably be because you arent exactly like a malphite, you got a shitloads of health and mobility, you are the guy running around kiting people, and thats so to speak your job, if you are focused yeah you will go down fast, unlike a malphite who will take ages to take down. Usually you are the kite tank ish guy, use your health to bait them and then use your mobility to kite them if that made any sence.

"cogsci","t5_2qh0k","that might be. OTOH, neither my subjective experience as a True Beiever, nor yours as a former True Believer, should be considered important. As I said before, the citation list in the meditation section of that handbook is long on philosophical papers and short on actual research. Were it republished today, that would no longer be the case. However, the researchers were basing their claims mostly on Buddhist traditions, rather than tons of research, and it turns out that, just as TM research is conducted mostly by people who practice TM, mindfulness research is conducted mostly by people who practice mindfulness, relaxation response research is published by people who mostly practice relaxation response meditation, etc.

And the most vocal proponents of each technique tend to be the ones most heavily involved on a personal level. The bios of researchers who wrote that handbook section tend to have mention of how they worked with the Dali Lama and other Buddhist monks on various projects other than meditation research.

That doesn't mean that they are faking the research, only that people should want to hear from non-biased researchers before making up their minds.

Now that there is big grant money available for doing meditation research for the DoD and VA, you can expect non-biased researchers to jump in and compete for grants. The results of their research is starting to come out and will continue to over the next 5-10 years. 

It will be interesting to see what reasonably dis-interested researchers find.","1351728641"

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","You're welcome, and good luck.

I was with FEMA for a number of years and I can honestly say I've seen as much self-inflicted disaster after a storm as was caused by the storm itself.

In the stress of a disaster people seem to simply forget commonsense things that would otherwise just come naturally.

If I may, a bit of advice:

Do not be in a hurry to re-occupy your home. In a day or so FEMA will set up a DRC (disaster recovery center) in your town. Go there and register for everything, including disaster housing.

Keep all appointments and gather as much paperwork as you can. Take advantage of the disaster housing, be it an apartment, a trailer, a shelter.

In the immediate days after a disaster the predatory contractors flock in. You don't want to even be tempted to use them -- their work is always overpriced and shoddy. Take your time and find a reliable contractor to do the work. Save all receipts because you probably can be reimbursed. 

Do not believe the rumors that will circulate that the feds are handing out free money. Even though the max amounts of FEMA grants are something like $30,000, nobody gets that much. The average grant is something like $3,500. FEMA's mandate is to get you safe, sanitary and secure housing, not to make you whole. It's a big distinction. Your insurance company is supposed to make you whole, even though they seldom do.

What's most important at this time is not panic and to keep calm.

I genuinely value those moments as it indicates that my time is perhaps useful to others.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;You still have to pay taxes in Rials. People don't want it. Obviously there is something more than taxation which drives the demand and therefore price of a currency.

I didn't say that accepting currencies other than USD for taxes was the ONLY way to devalue the dollar. Taxation is a necessary (but not sufficient) measure to keep the value of a fiat currency high.

&gt;If you shape the argument as ""people in the future don't want dollars and people will obviously forever and ever want gold"" you'll never be wrong.

Your argument was that all of a sudden people will stop accepting gold for exchange, when in reality that applies more to fiat.

&gt;Probably why you shouldn't store value in a medium of exchange. Two different objectives.

It still needs to be able to store some value. Statistically, the average person will have to go through 3 different currencies in their life (assuming they live to 81) which means his short-term savings will become worthless twice.

"ChristianApologetics","t5_2t6hc","&gt; And the fact that both Christians and Islamist have spiritual experiences does not prove that all such experiences on one side are false

If I am to believe the doctrinal claims of either side, the other must be false. Anyways, I'm not asserting that the spiritual experiences are lies, people definitely have spiritual experiences, there's no arguing that. I just see no reason to believe that any of these spiritual experiences include supernatural elements.

&gt; Can you give me a reason for this dismissal that is not based solely on the assumption that materialism is true? You haven't yet.

Yes I have, twice now. Here it is for a third time; the power of the human mind is more than sufficient to account for any and all of these instances of supposed supernatural experiences. Supernatural influences do not actually need to be invoked to explain any single one. 

&gt; They are all just believing what they want to believe"" needs some justification to choose that explanation. So far you have not given me one such justification.

Just Google ""people believe what they want to believe."" This assertion is actually very well backed up by evidence. It's the reason why people are so commonly superstitious, among other things.

&gt; ""Nothing supernatural has ever been observed"", a statement that you obviously cannot justify

Burden of proof. I am not making the positive claims, you are. It's your job to back those claims up, otherwise I am perfectly justified in my assertion. If no one can show me evidence of a supernatural occurrence, how am I anything but justified to hold this position?

&gt; You say that you can't be certain that there isn't a supernatural, but you can somehow be certain that no one who ever existed has ever had a supernatural experience?

Once again, you are twisting my arguments. Please try to understand this, I am NOT certain asserting that no one has ever had a supernatural experience. I simply don't have any valid reasons to believe it is so. How can I force myself to believe in something I've never seen evidence for?

&gt; How can I when photographic evidence, personal testimony, and your own experience wouldn't be enough?

I don't know, that's up to you to figure out. This is a Christian Apologetics forum, so why don't we try focusing on this? Start by answering my questions about how we differentiate legitimate supernatural claims from frauds, hallucinations or lies and then move on to explaining how we can figure out which supernatural claims are based on correct interpretations and which are only partially correct.

&gt; You say it's my job to convince you, then you make the standard of proof so high that I couldn't convince you that Abraham Lincoln existed, or that the holocaust happened, or that the sky was blue if you subjected it to the same difficulties

This couldn't be further from the truth. All of these claims can be proven to be true because they have very strong, independently verifiable supporting evidence to back them up. Your religious claims do not, and that is the important difference.","1351728670"

Each team plays every other member of his league twice (home and away) plus four inter-league games. That would result in a 32 game regular season.

There are two options for the post-season:

**Option A**: Traditional ol' bracket.
The top four teams of each league qualify. The best team in each league faces the fourth best, etc. All games are home/away, aggregate scoring.
Both finalists would play a total of 40 games a season.

**Option B**: For that traditional footy league feeling... Hex (aka double round robin) tourney. Only the top 3 teams of each league qualify. Champions league berths are given to the teams that finish in the top three positions.

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","maybe its my 'mutualist' side talking but...

i tend to think of 'ancap' ideology as a 'macro' and 'worst-case scenerio' version of anarchism; where as anarchism is more local and attempting to strive for continued improvements to societal relationships.

for one, i dislike any ideology that claims that they can destroy hierarchy: i understand hierarchal relations as being something that need to be perpetually challenged rather than ignored or assumed as not existing or relevant.

in this sense, ancaps focus on the supposed 'reality' of this relationship; that is, in a Hobbes-like war of all against all, we will eventually enslave eachother, and the least worst type of enslavement is in terms of de-monopolized monetary relationships - i.e., competing currencies which are equivalent to barter systems.

i think that ancaps and anarchists have more similarities than both sides would like to admit..however,

in an ancap 'free society', there is a sense that the community can put their combined resources to combat any potential monopolization of property... which is i think, one of the chief concerns of ancap. they like to think in terms of a type of 'merit' that proves itself in the marketplace. 

yet, the anarchist society also has means by which monopolists, as well as hierarchy is controlled. however, instead of a 'dollar democracy' - where merit is valued in terms of 'coinage' - those who have a bigger say are those who are most affected by the issue... who decides who is most affected? well, you do, by participating in whatever the mechanism for 'complaint' may be (e.g. general assembly?).. something like 'climate change' would affect us all, something like 'how to teach in positive ways' would affect only those who care about, well, teaching..

in ancap, you basically only have one voice, the power of resources and social capital,.. anarchism does not have any one measurement for power and understands that different people care to different extents about different things... and even if some problems may be very difficult to solve, at least everyone can be heard and listened to, regardless of their economic history.

the reason why i made a micro/macro distinction is that, on the one hand, it is likely that barter systems would form between potentially rivalrous anarchist communities (ie. union/party communists and green anarchists and anarcho-primitivists ahaha).. if so, different resources will have different values for different communities, and as such, systems of power will still dominate within that level of analysis. if communities are willing and able to challenge these types of communal-power hierarchies, and value all lives rather than merely their own.. we would have something that resembles anarchism. 

an anarchist, world society, would consist of, most realistically, places where state-like formations are perpetually forming and being destroyed. i.e. barbarians rule and rome is always burning..

But we've put the screws to Black people, Irish immigrants, Chinese railroad workers, women, black people 2.0, Gay people ALWAYS, vaginas redux, now Mexicans/Latinos and the Left because they're ""not like us.""

We have also unhinged ourselves from reality on taxes again... This is an argument we lost during the Whiskey Rebellion. 

We can be smarter about this. We can lead from the front. 

We were in a completely different boat even 50 years ago on these issues. 30 years ago the descent started when we hinged Reagan's wagon to the Christian Conservative movement... And that's coming from a practicing Christian who regularly feeds the homeless.

Haha, I know what you mean. Time to break the format, for a concise explanation: It's probably because the letter s is so common, *especially* the word ""is"", which is a huuuuge part of normal-sounding sentences. Most plural words use it, so you have to contort your phrases to get around that. In some cases you can't help but use a word containing s, so you have to replace it with z or some other short-form like ""becuz"" or ""b/c"". When you read text, you normally say it in your head so that it flows well and sounds like you want it to. Avoiding the letter s fucks with that so much.","1351728681"

Who is this ""they""?

Just know that if any of the lines are still in contract and you switch plans before the contract is over, you'll have to pay a migration fee for those lines. It used to be a straight $200, but now they're prorating it, I think.

Anyway, if you're just going to wait until everybody is eligible, then it will be super easy. You can just go into a store or call customer service, and they'll get you set up. Since it's just an internal plan change, and not a true port, you won't deal with any downtime with your numbers.

If you are coming from another carrier, porting your numbers is easy. Just call T-Mobile and let them know what you want to do, and they'll take care of it. Keep in mind that porting from one carrier to another is best done a few days before your billing cycle ends, since none of the carriers prorate the last month anymore.","1351728688"

One cup alone isn't too dangerous, but as someone who used to drink around half a gallon of milk per day (I drank milk instead of soda), it can add up. Thankfully, many milk derivatives, and even heavy cream, have little to no sugar, so I can actually use cream as a milk substitute--it obviously works fine in coffee or tea, and I can even water it down to drink straight.

"cripplingalcoholism","t5_2s68b","Unless you started when you were twelve, being 22 and drinking as you describe will not have yet been sufficient to cause serious physiological dependence, although having a symptom like being unable to sleep without the alcohol could indicate that you are beginning to develop this.  

Withdrawal symptoms develop as you detox, which isn't the same as simply having the alcohol leave your bloodstream and sobering up as a less frequent drinker experiences.  Detoxing usually takes a few days, but can last up to a week.  Symptoms develop as you detox, sometimes taking a few days to even appear.  Protracted withdrawal can last much longer.

If you wake up on day two and feel great, then that's it.  If you stopped for a few more days nothing physical is going to happen.  Although you might feel weird, that's the psychological aspect (and the plain-old weirdness of not drinking).

That's what I remember from those lectures at rehab anyway.  I got forced into it, but I would highly recommend an outpatient clinic to anyone.  I drank all night, talked about my feelings all day and became a better drinker in the process.  ","1351728691"

Is it against the law to insult the police? If no, you get arrested and sue, and the police have wasted a night when they could have been catching bad guys. 
If yes, you get arrested and maybe fined and the police have wasted hours of their time.

[Here](http://wiki.budgetgallery.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#What_is_this.3F) is a very old and not very informative page, but the general gist was this: They'd pick a public space - usually one that was just a wall with a bunch of bullshit on it - and paint it white. Then they'd schedule an opening and hang up the pieces with labels. People could buy pieces at the show (which was taking place on a public street) and the money would go back to the artist. At the end of the show, anything that wasn't purchased was left up, with its label intact. There was also a label on the piece itself (usually on the back) suggesting a donation with an address to send it to. Artists were fully aware that they might not get paid for pieces, or even have any idea where they ever ended up. Steve's vision for Budget Gallery was to ""open source"" the whole concept by providing instructions for how to set up a show and all that stuff, so that people could start their own Budget Galleries in their own cities. I think he got busy with other projects and just moved on though. I'd love to see this get started up again. ","1351728700"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","I suppose this is a possible burden of once being religious. Having never been a believer myself and therefore never thinking there was a purpose to life it just doesn't bother me. 

Think of the benefits of life having no purpose - you are freed from the burdens and expectations of a higher power and are free to live your life on your own terms (as far as possible in the modern world). You never have to fear the retribution or judgement of a higher power for not making more of yourself if you never wanted to, or for indulging in pleasures that a religion might frown upon. 

As for death and destruction ... life is depressing. But to be honest I find it less depressing knowing there isn't some higher power toying with me. A deity that allows such destruction wouldn't be worth worshiping on the basis of malevolence. Get enjoyment out of life because as you mention, it is quite fleeting. I'd hate to worry so much about my mortality so much I never enjoyed life, and that is all you can do to combat your mortality. Take pleasure and fun where you can find it.

As a side note I think life is far more remarkable when you can accept that a deity doesn't exist because those wonderful views or experiences haven't been molded by a conscious being but are an artifact of chance or coincidence. 

We're sitting on a planet that is travelling around a flaming ball of gas at over 60 000 miles per hour and humans have developed the intelligence to create a machine that lets people all around the world read this message. The fact that all of this has happened without the need of a God is pretty fucking amazing. ","1351728702"

1. Thaw chicken/beans if necessary.
2. Poke holes in taters.  If you don't want to bake the taters for 40 minutes you can throw them in the microwave for 5 minutes or so, flip em around, do 5 more minutes.  Then you should be good to bake them at the same time as everything else.
3. Plop chicken in dish, melt 1/4 cup-ish butter (I don't measure anything) and spread it on the chicken.  Make sure you flip the chicken around a bit so the undersides aren't plain.
4. Sprinkle Emeril's Original Essence (which can be used on soo many things) on the top side of the chicken.  If you do both sides, it might be too much flavor.
5.  Add green beans.  They should be wet but not sopping.  I sprinkled some garlic infused red wine on them for a little added taste.
6.  Throw potatoes in next to all the other delicious stuff.
7.  Cook for 10 minutes at 400, then flip the chicken over, make sure to pull the moist green beans from the bottom up to the top.  Rotate your potatoes.  Cook for another 10 minutes.
8.   Sprinkle your favorite cheese over the chicken while it cools.  I love pecorino romano, so that's what I used.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","In this particular case, the Crystal Cathedral was built by a man who started a small diocese of the Reformed Church in America.  He started off with a converted drive-in movie theater, and gave his own sermons there every Sunday.  He gained popularity, and built a small chapel in the 1960's out of his own pocket.  As his congregation continued to grow, plans developed for the Crystal Cathedral.  It was built from 1977 to 1980, at a total estimated cost of $18,000,000.  Much of that was taken as a large mortgage (banks like the idea of that large of a loan, especially from an entity that doesn't have to pay taxes).  In 2010, that mortgage had accrued to over $36,000,000 of debt that the Ministry (not the whole denomination, just the local church leaders basically) owed.  They'd also racked up about 8 million dollars in other debts by that time, though by then I have no idea who was lending them money.

In 2010, they sold the whole thing to a Catholic diocese for over $55,000,000.  So somehow, despite racking up almost 44 million dollars in debt, the church leaders (about 15 people) walked away with a total profit of ten million dollars when all was said and done.

So basically yeah, an individual who wants to start a church can usually just go to the bank and apply for a building loan.  I'm sure they'd have to prove regular attendance for their church already, and stable income, and have a contracted architect for it and all, but... yeah, that's basically it.","1351728721"

"bartending","t5_2r7uj","May I ask where you took these classes? I took bartending classes at PBS in Arlington, VA this past summer and I LOVED THEM. They seem to be set up exactly how you're describing yours.  All of the teachers were really amazing bartenders with solid history. They knew the industry really well and you could tell they were passionate about it. I learned around 150 ""staple"" drinks with variations  and got my pouring down perfectly. I've had minimal experience filling in for bartenders when I was working as a server and would always practice my pouring and other technical skills. 
On the other hand I saw a lot of people in the class who didnt... excel as well as I did. I think a lot of that had to do with past experiences, personal or not. Many of them had never even been servers (which to me seems scary, serving to me seems like a logical first step towards bartending.), and didnt really seem too informed on their spirits/brands(one girl thought patron was vodka...). I think one of the reasons I did so well was because of my 4 years serving experience, my love of beer/wine/cocktails, and my personal experience bartending at home. I think if its something you're really passionate about and you don't want in for the money, then it's a great investment. Everyone seemed to get out of it what they put in. THEN AGAIN there is one other bartending class in my area that everyone says to avoid like the plague, so I suppose its also a matter of doing your research.","1351728722"

"DunderMifflin","t5_2s9h3","Dwight getting back together with Angela would be the worst thing ever. One of the weirdest things I've noticed throughout the Office is how incredibly HORRIBLE Angela is, and yet no one seems to care or do anything about it. She simultaneously cheated on two people at the same time, one she was engaged to. She's also, arguably, the meanest person in the show and basically does nothing for anyone but herself. Her sham of a marriage with the (State) Senator is nothing more than a boost to her ego for being with a public figure. She's seriously, seriously, an awful person. Dwight, while having started the show as a very strange man, turned out to have quite the soft spot, what with some of the things he's done for Pam, as well as some of the subconscious bro moments with Jim. His growth throughout the series has been really fun to watch. Unfortunately in this season, the writers seem to be trying to revert Dwight back to the quirky, socially misguided character he was at the start of the series. This really ignores a lot of the growth and changes we've seen him go through for the last 8 years, and I'm really not on board. I mean, come on, riding a bicycle on a tight rope? What the hell was that? So out of line with Dwight's character, especially since Michael isn't around anymore for him to crave attention from.

Dwight getting together with Isabel would be awesome, I always wished they'd played out that storyline a bit more.","1351728730"

So democrat and republican can be taken as concepts to understand them better. From a scale of right to left we have on the extreme left, totalitarianism. On the extreme right, Anarchy. Republic form of government, what the U.S.A has, is composed of ""two"" parties; although, there are many more, and these parties are democrat and republican. So as you move more left on the scale, the closer you get to totalitarianism. Democrats go on this idea and are ""left winged."" Some basic policies to the concept of democrats are; more government power, more taxing, and more group rights. The taxing is because they need more money to pay for government run programs that ""help"" people. As you go more towards the right of the scale you near anarchy. Republicans go on this idea and are ""Right winged."" Some basic policies to the concept of republicans are; less government control, less taxes, and more individual rights. They tax less so people have more to spend and value individuals over unions. It all depends on how you think government should be ran. If you think that people are not smart enough to handle their own business, then you are most likely a democrat. If you believe that government has to have minimal say in your life, you are most likely republican. But these are just a couple points to the concept of democrat or republican and is never as black and white as I described it. A lot of grey area in politics.","1351728733"

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's funny, Paul Krugman just wrote about [traditional political journalists' backlash](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/scoop-dupes/) (like Klein's here) against poll-parsing nerds like Nate Silver who actually put a number behind their predictions.

&gt;A lot of political journalism, and even reporting on policy issues, is dominated by the search for the “secret sauce”, as Martin puts it: the insider who knows What’s Really Going On. Background interviews with top officials are regarded as gold, and the desire to get those interviews often induces reporters to spin on demand.

&gt;But such inside scoops are rarely — I won’t say never, but rarely — worth a thing. My experience has been that careful analysis of publicly available information almost always trumps the insider approach.

Joe Klein is pissed that for all his background information and on-the-ground observation, he still can't hazard a guess at who is going to win this race. He argues that the polling numbers are all over the place,  seemingly without taking a glance at battleground state polling or the electoral college math.

But the reality is that nerds like Nate Silver are the future of accurate election coverage. The growing stream of regular state polling has allowed these nerds to easily debunk narrative-building commentary by traditional journalists. Just look at how quickly Nate Silver was able to put a stop to the idea of prolonged ""Mitt-mentum"" after the end of the debates. The polls didn't reflect the neck-and-neck horse race the embedded reporters perceived, so that entire narrative was shut down almost single-handedly by a relative newcomer to political journalism.","1351728735"

"business","t5_2qgzg","The Bank of Japan (BOJ) committed to purchasing 11 trillion yen worth of derivatives.  These include Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs), T-Bills, corporate bonds and other various financial instruments.  This would be the second time they have done so in a month.

Traditionally, this would cause the Yen to lose value. (Inflation)

Instead, what happened was the Yen gained significant value.  (Deflation)

This goes against almost every understanding of economics and currency valuation known to man =)

If you print/create more of something, it usually is worth less.  For some reason this is not the case, and pulls the rug out from under economists who promote the inflate the debt away meme. (Also makes you wonder about the deficits don't matter camp...)

Since Japan is an export nation (sort of) they benefit from having a cheap currency.  They like their currency to be cheap, because it allows   more of their exports to be bought elsewhere.  The logic is, it's better if an American can spend 1 dollar to buy 90 yen worth of dvd players, anime, hello kitty, whatever; than it is for 1 dollar to buy 80 yen worth of the above stuff.

So when a Central Bank prints, their currency should be worth less.  What happened this week was the BOJ printed a ton of money, however, instead of 1 dollar buying 80 or 81 yen worth of crap, it now buys 79.50 yen worth of crap.  This is the complete opposite of what was supposed to happen.

Because of the way GDP is calculated, this is bad.  Probably.

Edit:  This also the basis of China and America whining at each other about trading stuff.  China doesn't really follow the 'rules' for currency manipulation.

It was a discussion among Right-Wing economists who among themselves decided a particular kind of economy could not work, with little input or interest from the Left.  There is little empirical proof of what the Austrians postulated - its a thought problem that stands on its own simply because a great portion of the population is looking for some sort of explanation for Soviet economics. It is, in essence, something retroactively inserted and given significance in history much after the fact. That said, wastefulness and overproduction are endemic to Market systems as well.

I understand the need to distance this show from The Mailbox to a degree so as to show that this is a different and unique show but the current quick format before introducing the topics just kind of throws me off for some reason.

I also feel like there should be something on the screen while the topics are being introduced.  Ideally something extremely simple yet iconic...I'd suggest maybe a tophat slowly spinning around like an old school console powering up.  Gives your eyes something to focus on while the topics are read out if you don't want to be staring at the bottom of the screen.  The current format of just having it black just feels like wasted space.

The only other quirk I have is I think it'd be kind of neat for the switch to actually go from off to on to commence the show, no real reason besides I'd get a chuckle out of it.

Honestly the only reason I nitpick on these small things is because otherwise the show is brilliant.  The content is straightforward and informative, I enjoy still getting to hear TB's opinions and the sidebar looks way better then it did yesterday.  Keep up the good work TB!","1351728761"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Good question. My best guess is that the USA was founded when supreme (as opposed to advisory) parliamentary democracies were a relatively rare thing, most of the world's rulers at that time ruling by right of bloodline or conquest. 

After winning their independence the early American political philosophers developed something of a fetish for democracy which subsequently permeated the entire culture, and they decided to apply its processes to every single thing where it was remotely justifiable to do so. The original plan was that merit, ie competence to perform the duties of an office, would be a very strong factor informing electability, and that utter incompetents would not run. Sadly, special interests soon figured out that utter incompetents could easily be bribed to do their will, and the electorate can be propagandized and bribed and lied to to get them to vote the incompetents in, and then we fast forward to today's situation.","1351728764"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Diamonds are a lot harder to ""check"". Gold was valuable before it was currency, but it was valuable *as* currency because its purity (and thus value) can be checked with something as simple as [a piece of stone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchstone_%28assaying_tool%29).

Pretending for a moment that you're in an ancient society, and you're a merchant, you're far safer accepting gold as payment than diamonds. The same could be true today, presuming a return to the use of one or the other as payment between private citizens. Without access to specialized equipment (not to mention the expertise to properly use those tools, and the time required to use those tools to test the diamonds), you're stuck (as far as I know) with the old ""scratch test"", but even that is fallible unless you're using something else sufficiently ""hard"" to test it against. If your go-to ""hardness"" standard is a sheet of glass, you'll get swindled by the first schmuck who comes by with a piece of quartz or cubic zirconia.

This doesn't even take into account the many sorts of ""grades"" they give diamonds for things like colour, clarity, etc. etc. which, without a lot of specialized training and experience, nobody could reliably assess.

It's way, way easier to get a ballpark value of a bit of gold from a touchstone than to reliably assay a diamond in a shop-counter-transaction kind of environment. So diamonds might be fine for big transactions where there's time to vet the currency, but to buy your daily bread from the shopkeeper down the road, gold is the way to go.

I'm not an economist, my background is anthropology/archaeology. I just wanted to point out that there are historical and practical reasons for the use of gold as opposed to gems as a basic unit of value.","1351728766"

"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","honestly, i don't think we had too many positives this game, bar scoreline. 
1 - we looked shakey defensively, obviously. but jt, ivan out this is what it will look like. luiz wasn't nearly as bad as everyone is making out, but the one thing that i noticed was a lack of communication, through out the whole team. its as if they're not talking/don't know whos responsibility is whoms. there were multiple times (one on offense and one on defense that i can remember right off the top of my head) that had our players literally trying to take the ball off each other. 

2 - i didn't like how the game was approached, namely that we were playing our starting 11vyoungsters. i think di matteo got the subs slightly wrong. i understand we want to win as much as possible, but when we went down and put on essentially what will be out starting line up saturday. its a bit frustrating seeing fergie subbing on youngsters/fringe players and we were putting on oscar, hazard and ramires. ramires, fine, mikel had a yellow and looked primed for a second (i thought romeu reigned it in a bit after being rather reckless). i would have rather see what marin can do, and lose, than throw hazard on (although he looked really lively). thats what cup games, specifically the league cup is for.

3 - moses looked great, i'm sure not scoring was 99% down to cobwebs etc. but sturridge offered nothing that torres couldn't have and to me proved nothing to suggest he should be #1. we'll see this weekend, but his movement was clumsy at times and he is as selfish as ever. you want a bit of that in a striker but fuck me its like he gets tunnel vision. he'll give a better account of himself against swansea. he did look great on the break.

4 - piazon genuinely looks like he needs maybe 6 months - a year on loan and he'd be right up there challenging for spots with marin, who was unlucky to not have come on for lucas. ","1351728767"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;I just don't see the reasoning in attempting to dismiss/disprove the existence of God, considering we have no idea how such an entity would function, if it does.

to approach this problem it is important to define what you mean by god or we wont get anywhere, check this part of this video, it explains it pretty well

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNDZb0KtJDk&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=147s

&gt;For example: Crusades, hypocritical Christians, bigotry, Westboro Baptist church... Maybe even throw in the Salem Witch Trials."" In which I respond: These instances/people either completely missed the instructions or manipulated them for their own personal gain

how do you know? what makes your interpretation better than theirs?
why are there so many different types of christians and all of them claim certainty about what god says or demands of them?

&gt; ""Well what about the Old Testament? Whats going on there guy?"" To which, again: Yea thats pretty messed up. But its not the doctrine that (Most?) Christians follow

isnt the bible the word of god? how dare they then ignore the parts of the bible they dont like or dont agree with? i actually hear this argument a lot, i fail to see how christians rationalize ignoring the old testmant when im certain that jesus said you have to respect the ""old laws"" aka old testment. most part of that paragraph sounded a lot to me like the ""no true scotsman"" logical fallacy anyways.

&gt;Aliens. Extra terrestrials, we have no idea whether or not they exist, minus the first hand evidence that guy in a mobile home gathered, and that of Agent Mulder... We would not go about claiming: ""Aliens don't exist because you can't prove they do."" (Burden of proof, and what not.) 

you are misrepresenting the atheist view (you are refering to strong atheism which most of us agree is a intelectually dishonest position). Most atheists do not claim that they can prove god(aliens) does not exist. They make no claim about it, they simply reject an assertion which has no evidence. It is only the theist who makes a positive claim with no evidence to back it up. personally i think the existance of aliens is very plausable, the universe is just too vast and chemically rich

"sonic","t5_2sm2s","If you want to get into Sonic, you've got to know your roots.

If you have the time and inclination, start with Sonic 1 for Genesis.  If not, skip to 2 or 3 w\ Knuckles.
 
1, 2, and 3 (and sonic and knuckles) make up the core of the series and are classic masterpieces of varying degree.

For 3d, try Sonic Adventure if you've got time, skip to Sonic Adventure 2 if you don't.

Sonic Adventure introduced a lot of characters into the mainstream.

I'll say that Sonic Generations is pretty excellent.  It does a good job.  If you've played some Genesis and you've played some Adventure, you'll probably feel fine with Generations.

Most of the 'characters' and story come in on the 'off' titles.  I'll conclude that I've been playing since Sonic 1 was on the shelves.  My personal favorite 2d are Sonic 2 and Sonic CD.  My favorite 3d is Sonic Adventure and Generations.  Good luck, enjoy!","1351728775"

&gt;1993 Report of the Auditor General of Canada

&gt;Chapter 5—Information for Parliament—Understanding Deficits and Debt

&gt;The cost of borrowing

&gt;5.41 The cost of borrowing is the third area that affects the annual deficit. In 1991-92, the interest on the debt was $41 billion. This cost of borrowing and its compounding effect have a significant impact on Canada's annual deficits. From Confederation up to 1991-92, the federal government accumulated a net debt of $423 billion. Of this, $37 billion represents the accumulated shortfall in meeting the cost of government programs since Confederation. The remainder, $386 billion, represents the amount the government has borrowed to service the debt created by previous annual shortfalls.

Science can only figure out the rules of the universe and how to use them to our advantage, we can't make or break or hope to explain why they exist to begin with.

So with that said, you may as well give up asking ""why"" down the the most basic level of existence, because that is nothing but a circlejerk waste of time. Though if it makes you feel better you can go read some philosophy.","1351728781"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","It's absolutely doable, yet you keep arguing as though it's not (only occasionally throwing in a ""cost effectively"" caveat, while still making arguments that it outright *can't* be done, or makes no sense, etc.).

Once you accept it can be done, you are really only left with explaining why it hasn't been done. It wasn't done because of cost, not because of the display being non-standard, or because the resolution is unprecedented, or because it would require apps to be re-written.

These are all claims you've made, they are all wrong, and none of them have to do with simply ""it would cost too much"".

Simply put, they could have made a retina iPad mini, with an A5X CPU, and with a larger battery. The tradeoffs would have been thicker and heavier, lower yields, and a higher price (no more than $200 more *tops*, and likely more like $100).

If they wanted to, they could have made retina and add-on, like LTE. Or they could have sold it for $399-$449 for the base model. But they have certain targets they want to reach, and giving up on retina is the single-most effective way of achieving them.

But it's absolutely possible, and absolutely would have sold. Whether you want to call that ""viable"" or not is up for grabs (strictly speaking, it absolutely would have been viable, but I can accept you are using the term more loosely, even though other parts of your post imply a more strict usage of the word).","1351728783"

http://www.harborfreight.com/12-inch-x-33-3-8-eighth-inch-wood-lathe-with-reversible-head-34706.html

You'll be able to do quite a lot more than the other lathe posted, and you're not going to find a better lathe in that price range. I've owned one for a few years now and have had very minimal issues with it. It is a clone of the JET 1236. Some people are very wary about Harbor Freight machinery, but this is one of the few gems they carry. 

Aside from the rare possibility of a very generous person on Craigslist, or someone who doesn't know what they are selling...you will not find a good lathe in your price range. You will find MANY old Sears type tube lathes. Don't buy one...it's not worth what ever you will spend on it. 

Also, keep in mind that you're lathe will probably be the cheapest part of your turning experience. Prepare yourself for a very expensive and addictive hobby. Tools, chucks, finishes, wood, etc will start adding up very quickly. If you start small...you will want to go big as soon as possible. That is one reason I would suggest against a mini lathe. No sense in limited yourself from turning bowls, plates, vessels, etc if you don't have to.

So taxing cigarettes means people buy fewer cigarettes, taxing imports means people import fewer products, and taxing capital gains means people invest less money.  See the pattern?  Now the big ones: taxing wages means people work fewer hours.  Taxing payroll means businesses hire fewer people.

Taxes are pretty much an indisputably *bad* thing, except when they're applied to stuff we don't want to happen (like pollution).  So decisions about taxes come down to whether the benefits derived from the government spending that money exceed the losses from taking it in the first place, and that's a complicated question whose answers will often depend heavily on an individual's ideology.","1351728807"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","The concept of ignoring and oppressing anything you disagree with rings true with your love of the despotism spouted in r/communism.

The mistake you have made is twofold. 

Firstly, you compare men to the bourgeoisie, apparently based on your view that men have the power in terms of rights and freedoms. The knowledge of female domestic abuse, and the host of issues on which females have an advantage shows that neither gender is holding the other in a stranglehold. 

The persecution complex prevalent in feminism is the most unappealing and pathetic aspects of the philosophy. There is no conspiracy. Women hold powers over men, men hold powers over women.

Furthermore, an entity can only be understood when all aspects are studied. The genocide can only be understood once the views of the oppressed and the view of Hitler is analysed. Anything else will give a warped and incomplete view. 

The key mistake you have made is apparent. 

Both genders suffer discrimination on a level playing field of xx and xy. The mistake in comparing men to the bourgeoisie is that there is no high ground (as the bourgeoisie have) for men to stand on. Both men and women suffer the same troubles and are the same blank slate.

Your issue is that you do not acknowledge that men do not have rights which women have, but yet you acknowledge the reverse. You do this when both positions have no realistic difference.","1351728808"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I've had women who leave shelters because of this, with their children. A women with 5 kids who is mentally unstable due to their ""irrational fear"" will most likely flee from the shelter. The shelters weigh a greater significance in caring for women and all of their children rather than one man because of this. I can't speak for all shelters, but many times this is their reasoning. As well, it's been reported that an exceeding number of abusive men have claimed to be victims in order to try to get into secure shelters or otherwise find their victims to continue the abuse and control. As well, privacy in shelters is practically non-existent. Shelters aren't pretty, it's just empty rooms full of bunk beds. Huge liabilities for the shelters. Imagine teenage girls, children, and women having to undress in front of men with their ""irrational fear"" of them after finally being able to escape sexual abuse their entire lives. Funding for these shelters are from charity. Charity isn't kind to men. Statistics show it's easier for them to support themselves than women with children. There have been some shelters designed specifically for men in domestic violence; those have closed due to lack of funding. Ultimately, again. The greatest purpose of these shelters is to provide immediate shelter in an emergency crisis. A shelter will turn you down if you are not at the risk of losing your life the next day you enter your home. Since statistics show that women are at greater risk of homicide by their spouse than men, shelters will provide them a place to stay for a couple days.","1351728808"

* Make a smurf.  Use when you have to dodge.

* Basic mechanics - last-hitting, wards; make sure someone on the team has basic support/aura items (Randiuns/Frozen Heart/Aegis/Abyssal Scepter).

* Always elect one person as your 'leader' in mid-late game.  Follow that person, and they make the calls for dragon/baron, push, etc

* If someone is being a dumbass and won't follow the team, automatically make them your 'leader'.  It sucks to have to do this, but making poor choices together is better than good choices alone.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hey Blacklikesnow! 

If you can stay in school and get a degree; doesn't matter what you get it in.  That's my suggestion.

As to my story; I was never really into school.  Well really it was the tests, going to school, and homework; I didn't dislike learning or friends.  So once I was done with high-school (GPA 1.6) I went to Canada for 3 months and when I returned I entered the work force as a intern.  Did that for about a year then went to community college where I did on/off work and school for 2 years before I stopped going because it just didn't interest me.  So working full time I put extra effort into my job; got promoted a bunch and now make about average money for someone with a degree and have management work experience which is pretty invaluable.  I don't have a degree but that hasn't stopped me doing the things I want (yet).

But getting a degree is certainly a good thing to have and if you can muster it get one if only to unlock that achievement in your life and for future employers.","1351728815"

I am ok with people having a laugh at the crazy stuff their furry children do instead of getting so upset they keep the dog outside or give it up. Just like our dogs, we are not perfect and dogshaming reminds us we are not alone.  I had to learn the hard way that if I leave the bathroom door open while I take a shower the pom/sheltie I fostered would dig through my dirty clothes and steal my undies. Or that my own pit bull had severe separation anxiety that took nearly 7 months to get over with daily training and love. Unfortunately training doesn't work overnight and before he felt safe he caused 1200 USD in damage. It was either laugh or cry and sometimes both.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","That's not slimy...  Think about it. You want a credit card. You apply on line and a few days later a card comes in the mail with a welcome letter and a 1"" thick book of federally mandated disclosures, warnings and notices. 

The terms lay out the interest rates, penalties for default, etc... and say, ""By using this card you agree to these terms and conditions.""

You have a choice, return the card (or throw it away) or use it to get stuff. If you use it to get stuff, why should the agreement not be binding? Just because you didn't follow some antiquated legal formality of signing your name in ink on paper?

If nothing was binding without an ink signature, things would slow WAY down. No ""click to agree"" nothing like that. Ebay and Amazon would be out of business and you'd never get anything without waiting for a bunch of papers to be recorded and filed. 

The system is based on the idea that the mail is reliable and that people know how to read. About 99.9% of the time the system works flawlessly and there are no complaints.  And, even if you don't complain, there is a small army of federal regulators out there checking up on the banks and watching out for consumers to keep them out of trouble. 

There are problems and people do get screwed BUT they are the exception. 

In OP's case, he may not have gotten the terms, he may not have used the card, he may have been a minor at the time; there are a number of ways he can show that he didn't agree to this. If he can, then he shouldn't be responsible. However, if he got the stuff in the mail, allowed the bank to extend credit based on the idea that he AND his parents were co-signers agreeing to pay (regardless of who used the card) and now wants to cry foul...

you can roll back the Asian server and get away with it but if you roll back any server with RMAH then it gets alot harder to do and im going to say right now will never EVER happen.

for a start anyone buying gold or putting any real money into the RMAH will need to be refunded, then anyone who has taken money out the auction house will need to pay the money back.

lets say i sold a item for 2bil 2 months ago and traded that gold for $1000 cash sent to my paypal account and then spent that money. if i get lucky and blizzard roll me back to when i had that item or that gold then i can sell it all again and make another $1000.

think about the amount of withdraws and deposits and transactions in just 1 month, there is no way in hell blizzard would be able to work out what is what, it would be a shit ton of work even if you just wanted to roll it back 1 day.

in the expansion i feel that the ladder will come back as this would make them more money and would make the game last longer but also if they say from the start we will reset every x months so what you buy will be moved on this date then there can be no complaints when it happens.

I would definitely agree with bpicef and chasenoface on the ""try online (Biggercity, etc)"" advice, as you really don't have anything to lose. Biggercity lets you get a profile for free, and you don't HAVE to have a picture - though I'd put something up at least. Chat with some people
and share some more photos once you get to know them. You don't have to talk or meet anyone that your not comfortable with. Nothing can boost your confidence more than finding some people that are attracted to you, and what better place than Biggercity (or here on Reddit for that fact!). 

I think by talking to, and maybe even meeting, more people, you'll begin to feel more comfortable in your body and the confidence will come with that. Although I must say, I think guys that don't have a crapton of confidence can be quite cute in their shyness.

"learnpython","t5_2r8ot","I do that to take advantage of the fact that `print` will add a newline on the end.  Otherwise, the last line in the file would lack a newline.  Aternatives?  I don't like the idea of concatting a potentially very large string with a single char:

    outfile.write('\n'.join(integers) + '\n')
    
...or making a bunch of function calls and generating a lot of temporary strings:

    for i in integers:
        outfile.write(i + '\n')
        
Of course, it would be nice to not create the whole output at once:

    outfile.writelines(i + '\n' for i in integers)
    
But this still creates a bunch of temporary string garbage, and it's iterating python-side rather than C-side.  Another approach might be to leave the newline in each item when it's read from the file, allowing for:

    outfile.writelines(integers)
    
But I feel that complicates the reading code unnecessarily, and it makes it awkward to work with or manipulate the data if you have to remember to keep a newline at the end.  And of course there's always

    outfile.write('\n'.join(integers))
    outfile.write('\n')
    
But I don't like the duplication and the extra line.  I suppose there's also this:

    outfile.write('\n'.join(integers + ['']))
    
...but that just feels a little opaque to me.  That leads to the original solution:

    print &gt;&gt;outfile, '\n'.join(integers)
    
Or the python 3 version:

    print('\n'.join(integers), file=outfile)
    
If the feature is there, why not use it?  I haven't benchmarked it, but I'd wager it's the most efficient of all of them, without being overly complicated.  In my ideal world, `.writelines()` would take an optional parameter allowing to specify a line ending to be added to each item.

Edit: ah, I suppose there's also:

    outfile.writelines(['\n'.join(integers), '\n'])

But that's kind of hard to read in that it's torturing the intent of a method named ""write lines"", by passing all the lines as a single item and instead using it as a string-concat operator.

Put a curve modifier just above the vader layer, hold alt, and click between them where the weird icon shows up. Now adjust the lower level or the curves till darth starts to ""fit"" with the overall image.","1351728839"

Because people who believe in gods do so without evidence at all and have defined gods in such a way that no evidence can exist.

There exist a large contingent of us, some believers, some non-believers, that are not focused on this question... we're not running around opening boxes everywhere. We could honestly care very little about finding just one thing in one box and spending our entire lives trying to find that box. We acknowledge that we do not know what box it MIGHT be in.

&gt;Imagine leveraging out all you got on a very valuable race horse to breed. Then that horse dies, your asset loses all value (toxic asset) and you need money to cover your rent until....your horse comes back to life and starts breeding?

This is a rather poor example, since in the real world, banks held many many assets, not just a few. While enough of their *short-term assets* were toxic that they were insolvent, this would not be true forever.

Your example assumes that the primary asset of the banks had been rendered useless. That isn't true at all. It would be much more like if a stable owner had many horses, but was about to breed one *this month* and that horse suddenly died, or was kicked in the dick, or whatever - and because he had been counting on the income from that breeding, he is insolvent in the short term, despite his possession of many other horses which will - eventually - produce value enough to cover his expenses.","1351728850"

That's kind of hard to figure out, but I suppose the easiest way would be to imagine how you'd be feeling, right now, if you were already dating and she was all luvvy-duvvy about you.

Or, for a much more blunt (and probably not accurate) way: imagine boning her. Literally, stop and imagine it. Is it gross? That's your answer.","1351728853"

When I tell people that I play badminton, most people just think of it as a sport that you play in your backyard!

Badminton is quite an intense sport. 

For example, the fastest recorded tennis stroke is Ivo Karlovic's 156 mph (251 km/h) serve, whereas the fastest badminton stroke during gameplay was Fu Haifeng's 206 mph (332 km/h) recorded smash.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badminton#Comparisons_of_speed_and_athletic_requirements


Here are some badminton vs tennis facts:

Tennis:

The speed and the stamina required for badminton are far greater than for any other racket sport. At the 1985 All England (Tennis) Championships, Boris Becker defeated Kevin Curren 6-3, 6-7, 7-6, 6-4. At the 1985 World Badminton Championships in Calgary, Canada, Han Jian of China defeated Morten Frost of Denmark, 14-18, 15-10, 15-8. The following is a statistical comparison of those matches. 	

Tennis:

Time:  3 hrs &amp; 18 mins 

Ball/Shuttle in Play: 18 mins  

Match Intensity*: 	9 percent  

Rallies: 299  	

Shots:  1,004  	

Shots Per Rally:  3.4  	

Distance Covered:  2 miles





Badminton:

Time:  1 hr &amp; 16 mins

Ball/Shuttle in Play:  37 mins

Match Intensity*:48 percent

Rallies: 146

Shots: 1,972

Shots Per Rally: 13.5

Distance Covered: 4 miles

I'm merely trying to get at the societal benefits that government awards to those that are married and the reasons why, and if/why they should be extended to homosexual couples. If government has reasons to promote marriage, what are they? I'm not sure if you've read anything else I've said, but I'm for no involvement of the government in the institution of marriage. Since that's not on the ballot, we're having a different discussion.

That's cool, but wouldn't you two both still be practicing even if you weren't gay? I don't think having kids = unproductive at everything else. I know many productive couples and individuals with kids. 

&gt; Us gays can benefit society in other ways then popping out children.

Don't you think people in general can benefit society, gay or straight?

It tells us two things

And
 
2: Labour no longer stand for anything other than being elected. They genuinely seem to want power, and only for power's sake.

No one is spinning anything. Advice IS based on assumptions because as we ALL agree, no one is going to have the exact experience in the same situation as the next person.  It's like medicine - not everyone is going to have the same side effect or will have the same dosage as the next person. It's just based on statistics and personal experience dealing with a number of patients taking the same drug, which is what doctors do first if you don't fit an already existing medical record for those who have taken the drug.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Landlord myself, but not in IL, and I know nothing about IL law:

- Mold is serious problem that any responsible landlord should address immediately. Some mold is fairly harmless to humans, some of it has very serious health-risks, but all of it is self-perpetuating, unsightly, potentially structurally damaging, and exponentially more difficult an expensive to get rid of with time. Any responsible landlord should address mold problems immediately, and should thank you for pointing them out.

- Early-stage mold problems are usually very easy to treat. A spray-bottle filled with a bleach-water solution will usually give a permanent ""cure"" to surface mold in as long as it takes to wet down the affected area, plus maybe a re-painting the next day. Persistent or recurring mold is an indication that the drywall/plaster and insulation behind is infected, and needs to be replaced, which is not nearly as big a deal as it sounds like: you can usually cut out the drywall with a steak-knife, rip out and replace the old insulation, then tape in a new piece of drywall and re-paint, all within an hour or two. 

- The fact that your walls are soft and soggy indicates a more serious problem for the landlord: either a plumbing leak, a condensation issue due to poor building insulation, or some other permanent/recurring problem of water-damage behind the wall. In this case, the mold is a symptom, not a cause. The danger for your landlord is that this might fall outside the kind of problem that can be fixed in a few hours, and that the bathroom might be put out of commission for longer than you can live without it, raising actual habitability/safety concerns. 

Some ""slumlord"" types will basically just deliberately ignore this kind of thing, thinking/hoping that you'll give up or learn to live with it until the lease-turnover. But often, small landlords whose rent barely covers the mortgage and taxes are more distracted/lazy/overwhelmed/unprofessional, and just kind of never get around to it. It sounds like your LL might be the latter. 

In either case, my advice would be to call the landlord and say something like, ""Look, I've told you about this multiple times, and it's a serious health and safety issue for me, and it's damaging your building, which is a problem for you. If you're not here to come up with a plan to fix it by Monday morning, I'm going to call a bathroom-remodeler out of the yellow-pages and get a quote to fix it, which I will document, contract them to do, and withhold the repairs from next month's rent, or however many month's rent it takes until the repairs are paid for."" 

That action (getting the repairs done yourself, and then deducting them from rent) might or might not be entirely a legal thing to do in IL, but most states have a provision for something like it, where there is a clear problem with safety and habitability that the LL has not reasonably responded to. 

But even if you're not ""allowed"" to follow through with your threat, that should be enough to get his attention, and to get him onsite to come up with a plan. Moreover, if you document everything, keep detailed notes, phone-records, receipts, pictures, etc, it will make it very hard for him to argue his case to a judge, if it ever comes to that. 

He should have fixed this as soon as you told him about it. You were doing him a favor. It sounds like he's not a bad guy, just not a very good landlord. Show him how to be a better one by proposing a solution, and win karma IRL. That's my advice. ","1351728869"

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","Well, to be honest I would really recommend any of the towns past Barrie and Orillia. I find the best thing to do is pick a semi-major road and just drive until you see something you like. Some of the best meals Ive had are from small little restaurants that you would never expect to find otherwise. 

Most of the towns in Muskoka are full of things to do, yet still have a very nice feel. The only time I find that Muskoka gets the city feel is on long weekends during the summer. Places like Gravenhurst and Bracebridge are big enough to be considered cities I guess, though still have a townish feel. 

One of my favorite places to go is Manitoulian Island. There are two ways to get there; you can take a ferry from Tobermory, or drive all the way around. Its a beautiful Island that is still for the most part Native. I find the locals can be very very nice, just make sure your not trespassing! :P

My recommendation is to avoid taking major highways as we have some really nice back roads. I find some of my most enjoyable times on the road in Ontario have been when I'm on a back road with no one around letting the cruise control do all the work.

Legalization generally makes the thing/action in question legal under most circumstances. 


As an example being commonly discussed in the US, if marijuana is decriminalized in a state, it generally means that if you are found in possession of less than a certain amount, like a gram or ten grams, then you are doing nothing criminal. It may still be illegal to buy or sell it, grow or harvest it, etc.

Got a good education and always valued work, so that's ok, too - thanks Mom.

That was no way to live. In the end the love you take is equal to the love you make (literally and figuratively!). At coming up on 40, it is way more important to surround myself in happiness, friendship, and love. I don't yell anymore and don't fight. I will debate you, but always listen first and consider what you have to say. If, however, you spew hate of any kind for another being, you will hear my opinion :)

Nobody today totes around a rifle, nobody back in the day romped around with a halberd.

&gt;I haven't shot a gun

Right.

Without spending *a lot* of time at a shooting range you aren't going to hit a god damn thing ten yards away from you. Add in stress and a moving target, and you've got one good shot ***if*** they don't see you first. Your target isn't going to die right there unless hit in the brain or the heart, and isn't going to be slowed down unless their spine or leg bone is broken, or a tendon is severed. You aren't going to hit *anything at all* while you're moving.

If we were both about to be tossed into a pit about the size of a boxing ring and were given the choice between a sword (or even a *knife*) and a handgun, and neither of us were trained with either, you bet your ass I'm going to grab a sword.

Before there were guns, a sword could be used by the layman to cause as much destruction as a pistol provided that you were not weak. 

So, yes. The analogy holds. You think that banning swords is unnecessary (of course, a peasant in England could never afford a sword, but similar bans were used in other parts of the world).

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Something you want to be careful of, and I don't think anyone else mentioned here: There are several different kinds of UPSes by the way they operate. 

The two that are most prevalent are On-line and Off-line. Difference being that an off-line UPS maintains the battery at charge, and when the internal circuity detects a lack of A/C input power or that the input power is unclean, the inverter switches on and the relay flips so that the equipment runs off of the battery. With an On-line UPS the inverter is always on and the equipment is powered from the same circuit regardless of the source of power. Incoming A/C power goes through a rectifier (AC-&gt;DC), this in turn charges the battery and also powers the inverter (DC-&gt;AC) which powers the connected equipment. When the incoming power drops out the rectifier isn't in operation and the inverter draws it current from the battery.

On-line UPSes are more expensive, better for the equipment (there is no fail-over response time) and have a lower TCO due to the fact that batteries are used more often and therefore last longer. A battery that sits around filled to capacity will lose life faster.","1351728897"

The law doesn't require a *good* excuse, it just requires a *legal* excuse. Since during the day, traversing out of convenience would be legal (unless there were signs or fences or advisement of trespass), it is a legal excuse. The only trick is that at night, the burden is on the accused to show that they were there under the legal excuse, and if it only saved a few seconds, that seems unlikely.

"AskHistory","t5_2sa8i","He's only been on the bill since 1929, so it wasn't done by anyone who knew him personally.  But he's one of the most admired political figures of the American Revolution and the Enlightenment, and has been for over two centuries.  There's no one accomplishment that can encapsulate all of Franklin's legacy or contribution to society, but here are some things to think about (not complete lists):

Inventions:

* Bifocals
* The lightning rod
* The odometer
* The Pro-and-Con list

Science:

* Electricity: Discovered fundamental properties of electricity which contributed to the understanding of electricity, a new phenomenon at the time.
* Meteorology: Discovered that storms don't always move with the direction of the wind, which contributed to a deeper understanding of meteorology. 
* Climatology: Connected an eruption of a volcano to a harsh winter in Europe.  It seems obvious now, but connecting geology to the weather was a radical idea.

Politics:

* Signer of the Declaration of Independence
* Join or Die cartoon (rallied the colonies together for the Seven Years War)
* First Postmaster General of the United States: At this time, it was an EXTREMELY important role, and basically set the standard for how the Post Office has worked for the last 200 years or so.  
* Negotiated the Treaty of Paris, ending the American Revolution and making America an independent nation.
* Signer of the United States Constitution 
* Early proponent of freeing slaves

TL;DR: Benjamin Franklin did more on April 18, 1790 than most people do in their lifetimes.

For what it is worth, I feel that RCP was more accurate than Rasmussen in 2008. Here's where they were wrong (*based only on information from the RCP site*--I just haven't had the time to double check it, and bear in mind they sometimes list Rasmussen as ""Fox News/Rasmussen--I don't know exactly what that means):


* Rasmussen wrongly predicted McCain +1 in Florida. It went Obama +2.8.
* Both RCP and Rasmussen wrongly predicted Indiana going McCain (+1.4, +3)--it went Obama +1.1.
* Both RCP and Rasmussen got North Carolina wrong (McCain +.4 and +1) when it ended up Obama +.3.
* Rasmussen had Ohio tied when Obama ended up winning +4.6.

That's 3 Rasmussen errors adding up to 55 points wrongly predicted for McCain (leaving out the tied Ohio.) 2 RCP errors predicted 26 votes going to McCain which actually went Obama. Basically, our hope for victory lies in either 1.) them getting a state or two wrong in favor of *Romney* instead of Obama or 2.) a 1980-esque the-polls-were-significantly-off scenario.

ETA: Reasons to be hopeful their errors will end up with a ""surprise"" Romney victory-Romney's been winning in the popular vote polls, enthusiasm is up for Republicans, and he's leading with Independents.

The color blue doesn't exist outside of our brains (or the brains of any being who can perceive and process the color). The sky has no intrinsic blue-ness to it. It is blue because we see it a certain way and we call it blue. If all life in the universe were to be destroyed, then so would the color blue and the number 2. These concepts only exist in our minds.

Now, some other sentient beings may eventually evolve and perceive blue and use the number 2, but that just means that the things which caused us to have the concepts of blue and 2 still exist. The wavelength of light that corresponds to what we call blue may still exist, but that's different from the concept of blue, which exists only in our minds.

If a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? No, because sound exists only in our minds.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","All I've done for the past six months is play videogames. My life has functionally grinded to a halt since I graduated high school. Getting a job seems next to impossible. College isn't really feasible right now, so I just stay in my bedroom all day. Every action I take in my life feels like a tedious exercise. I'm so unhappy that I often forget how unhappy I am. It's like a part of who I am now.

Every day is like a small battle to not waste my time. I'm trying to develop skills to create my own indie games and maybe make money or get a job, but this negative personality that has a hold of me always leads me to do something to make myself fail. Sometimes I just give up and spend the rest of the day playing Skyrim.

All my goals seem perfectly aligned with each other. The things I want to do now will enable me to start my life and transition. I've reasoned that transitioning to female is my primary goal at this point. Having a goal isn't enough, though. I constantly find myself without the strength to pursue it. ","1351728920"

The problem these crazies have is that they're doing nothing to endear anyone to their cause.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; They didn't ban. They said ""your initial proposal sucks and is too dangerous, fix it"". I'd love to see where Obama has ""banned"" the pipeline.

He killed the proposal, said it was unsafe after sitting on it for 2 years, and then had the brass to give approval for a pipeline between Cushing and Houston as a consolation prize.

&gt; In other words, the benefit to the US wasn't proportionate to the risk. TransCanada receives almost all of the benefits.

Not true. That oil has to be sold to the pipeline operator, and then to the refinery. Both are in the US, and both transactions are subject to American taxes.

&gt; It doesn't reduce US energy dependence, it doesn't create enough US jobs, and it exposes a large portion of the US to environmental issues.

It increases the infrastructural potential to drill *more* in the northern plains and expand energy production, bringing more drilling jobs and the second-order jobs that directly and indirectly support them.

&gt; That's why the Cushing and Baker portions are receiving more support. That way we're shipping oil from our companies to our refineries, and selling our oil on the world market.

The refineries in Houston *are* our refineries. We don't need more pipeline between Cushing and the Gulf. We need pipelines that actually get to the oil that's being drilled, and the oil reserves that will be tapped in the next few years.

But let me get this straight. You don't want infrastructure spending paid for COMPLETELY by private business? I'll remember that the next time someone complains about America's crumbling infrastructure, or blames Republicans for killing the ""jobs bill"".","1351728924"

Instead, it's taking a larger power source and using a small signal to regulate and control it. Think of it as a variable power source, where the control signal is small voltage from your load cell. The amplifier senses that little signal and responds by shaping its much larger output to match it. That's what's really happening. It just so happens that if you ignore where the power comes from (as we often do in schematics), it looks like a small signal goes in and a large one goes out, and for most purposes, that's usually all that matters. But it can only put out what's available from the power supply (and usually a bit less than that, since it's difficult to control the output near the extremes of the power supply).","1351728927"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Well, it makes sense.

I've done a lot of java reflection. A LOT. The method that Java 8 lambdas are taking makes sense given the history of the language and the type structure that already exists inside java. From what I know, they're anonymous classes that are being built at compile time to conform to an interface ... fairly similar to java proxies.

It's unfortunate, because I really like, say, scala's anonymous functions. But to make things interchangable and reusable in the jvm, you need to have that shared interface. Things like scala's tuples are all precompiled classes, if I'm not mistaken, because they're basically a hack on the static compilation of the jvm. One for each type - Tuple2, Tuple3, ...

I assure you, looking at something and saying ""this is stupid because x"" is a fairly silly view. There is a reason, you may just not know it.","1351728942"

"gamingpc","t5_2sq2y","Eh... you're glossing over a ton of details. If Intel made Ivy Bridge-E it would almost assuredly be better than Sandy Bridge-E.

If we compare [the i7-3770k to the i7-3820](http://www.anandtech.com/bench/Product/551?vs=523) which have the same amount of cores and the 3820 actually has more cache and a higher frequency the 3770 is *still* faster. Ivy Bridge is a better architecture and is better fabricated, Sandy Bridge-E just has more PCIe lanes and more cores.

But the fundamental reason why it's so wrong is that it assumes, absent any actual evidence, that everything Obama wants to do is destructive to the ""American way of life,"" whatever the fuck that means.  The reality is that people like Limbaugh construct a 1950s-esque idealized (and even then, distorted) notion of what society should be.  And they suggest that Republicans will restore the values that are the foundation of such a society while Democrats/liberals will destroy it.  Once Obama wins this election and things continue to get better economically (albeit slowly) for the middle class, it will be interesting to see if we have set out a course for many years of political domination by Democrats until the old blowhards of the GOP are banished and a fresh crop of conservatives come along to (hopefully) offer a better counterweight to Democrats.","1351728965"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","First thing : as everyone else have said, this therapist shouldn't do what he does. Confidentiality is essential between patient and therapist. And like BrighTide has said, even in the ""best case scenario"", the situation doesn't look very good. 

You may not want to report him, and it's your choice. But the first thing you should do is talk to your wife. 1) she has to know what he has said and 2) You know your wife better than me, but I'm pretty sure the ""it's been 3 years, little progress, lets try someone different"" won't work. I mean, she has all the reasons to believe her therapist, he is in a dominant position (he could have suggested that she was making progress, that she was realizing that you weren't the best husband, that she needed him, etc. whatever he want). But again, I do not know him or your wife, it's all suppositions. 

The second thing is : even if she said that, and if it's true, I don't think it means what you believe. What I understand from what you write is that you think ""doesn't love you"" = ""dislike you"" (or at least ""is indifferent and just follow passively the events""). From what you are saying, I think I understand the feeling of your wife, because this is how I feel. 

&gt; is her determination to stay with me her version of love?

And if it was me, I'd said yes, it is. Because she is with you and doesn't want to go elsewhere. It's likely she is where she want to be. But you can't be certain unless you speak with her. 

It's just an hypothesis, but maybe you would be depressed too if you had the impression of being not ""wired"" for love, in a situation where you would have absolutely all things to make you happy but where you couldn't feel that seemed right. Where you can't really find where you belong. And the worst thing is you can't really tell your husband because he is quite emotional about you, and can't really understand because he seems ""normal"", like all people surrounding you. You fear that if he could misunderstood what you have to say, and want to leave you. You feel different, broken in the eyes of the media, society, movie, books, and what the others couple say. And you don't know how to fix it. So you see a therapist, but it doesn't change anything, because he has is point of view. So, nothing works, and you become more and more depressed, obsessed by the fact that you are depressed and you shouldn't be. (I'm not talking about personal feeling here, it's really a total guess)

Calmly, gently approach her, and talk to her, in a understanding and non aggressive way. Try to find all the reason of her depression (and do not forget that depression is a disease), how she feels about you, about the children, about her life, etc. It will take some time (I'm talking about year-ish time here), but I really believe the moment she will be strong enough to face the truth about her feelings, and share them with you, it will be a huge improvement in your relationship, and maybe she won't need a therapist anymore. 

Maybe a little ""advice"" here (disguised in question) : in your point of view, how do you determine what is love? Who and what can forge (and have forged) your feelings and your perception on feelings? And from what you know of her, what are her answers? 

In my humble opinion, the only solution for her is to accept herself, her limits, and become strong enough to be absolutely certain to make her own choice because she want it. The only question is : ""how do I want to live my life?"" And from my point of view, the answer include you (supposition, again). 

**TLDR : talk to her. Give her the truth, describe how you feel, and try to make her speak about how she feels.**","1351728966"

2. As far as women being sponsored due to looks, I cannot speak for this.  Women in sports generally tend to be more attractive to begin with.  Since snowboarding is a sport, the physical activity generally leads to girls being more fit, and thus better looking.

3. Professional women tend to not be as good as professional men for a multitude of reasons.  Let's face it, men and women are physiologically different.  Men tend to be stronger and faster, and this is generally seen across the board in sports.  We also see a mental difference between men and women.  Men tend to take more physical risk, and generally pursue dangerous activities more aggressively than females.  Because snowboarding, especially on the professional level involves taking risk, the environment tends to favor the men.  

4. This next factor is huge.  Snowboarding naturally tends to attract more men than women.  Because of this, the talent pool is much larger, making the sport more progressive and competitive.  On the opposite end, sports like gymnastics tend to attract girls rather than guys.  It isn't that men aren't as respected or welcomed, it's just that certain sports attract more men, and certain sports attract more girls.  Snowboarding is a sport that happens to attract more men than women.

Ultimately your argument could be made for ANY sport, basketball, running, swimming, weightlifting ect.  The differences between men's sports and women's sports come down to basic physiology and mindset.  Men tend to be about 10-15% stronger, and 10-15% faster, that's just the way it is.  Men's sports tend to get a lot more coverage than women's because the physiological advantages that men are born with make those sports more exciting to watch.  As I pointed out before, risk taking and a generally more aggressive mindset also contribute to many of the advantages that contribute to better overall performance in men's disciplines.  

Exceptions to what I have stated above do exist.  What I am explaining however, is the overall trend.  There are competitive sports where women often perform just as good as men do.  Sports like billiards, poker, music (if you count that, but there are music competitions held around the world) are activities where women perform very well in comparison to men.  Ultimately, men and women do not compete together for a reason, but those reasons have nothing to do with looks, or social structures growing up, and everything to do with physiology and a more risk-oriented mindset.       
  


I hope that this helped!

1) On the points / possession allowed I mentioned, Oregon is 11th in the country. On yards / play allowed, they're 15th (6th on allowed / pass). On passer rating D, they're 13th. Oregon's D gives up 18.1 yards per point allowed, which is better than South Carolina and LSU (who are both close to ~17). I think Oregon has a top level D, and you can clearly show they do with traditional stats. So please, quit trying to argue against something that I'm not even saying. Yards / Game isn't the only ""traditional"" statistic.

2) To try to claim your opinion is validated because someone at ESPN wrote an article that agrees with you, especially when that article is inaccesible without paying for it, is simply absurd. I could just as easily find an article by some ""expert"" that says Oregon's D isn't that good. What's hilarious to me is that you're defending Oregon's D when I haven't once said that I think they're bad. On the contrary, I think they're very good...the only thing I've said is that Oregon didn't beat Washington significantly more impressively than LSU did, which they didn't.

Watching pretty much every game, the number of baserunners that he kept off of the bases is ridiculous and he is almost without a doubt the best defensive first baseman I have seen in Atlanta in the past 10 years. But LaRoche was definitely one of those as well. There is no doubt in my mind that he deserved recognition for his defensive play, but I am by no means surprised or really even bothered by the fact that he didn't get one. Unless some ridiculous 1B phenom shows up in a few years, he will get plenty in the coming years while LaRoche is what 8 years in? That's never a good reason to give some one an award, mind you, but anybody that's a good enough 'oh well...' type thought, that Freeman is probably going to be around for another decade and a half or so.

"algorithms","t5_2qj1c","Yes, but classically this was called the traveling salesman problem. It is one of those sets of 'intractable problems' that are good ways to test a person's thought process, problem solving and knowledge.

The classic approach would be start with a weighted graph, apply constraints and optimize accordingly. Since, given enough houses the problem represents a unsolvable problem if every possible permutation had to be evaluated to prove that the optimal solution was found.

However, good enough is usually good enough so all that is necessary is a solution that is has a high probability of being good enough. The closer good enough is to optimal, the more calculating power it will take. Usual place to start is to treat approach it using weighted graphs.

Look in a good algorithm book and you should find a section, however brief, on intractable problems like this. Also kaggle.com forums might be another starting point.

The second problem is easier than the first to optimize for.

Make suggestive comments, drop an innuendo here and there—give the guy a reason to think that you're imagining what he looks like naked. *Something* that clues him in to the idea that you want a sexual interaction with him.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","On your website, the visitor is first presented with some medium-sized photos with captions, which when clicked takes the viewer to a page with a bunch of words on it and a smaller version of the photo. 

I guess what I'm saying is, the links to articles on the front page should be more obviously links to articles. And then in the articles, re-work how you're displaying that so that the photos take center-stage, and not the text. 

An additional unwarranted suggestion which you can feel free to completely ignore is to do away with that bar that says ""Blog | Landscape | Abstract | Experimental |  Nature | Night | People | Urban"". I don't think visitors care about those distinctions, in fact I think the only time I ever hear them used is on photo contests and when people ask that annoying question ""so what do you shoot?""

Obnoxious suggestion #3: on the page to view a blog post, just to the right of the article/entry/blog/submission itself is a strip of thumbnails to other articles. This is a cool visual, but in my opinion it's too easy to confuse those thumbnails as part of the article itself, and not realize that they're links to other articles. I'd say, somehow make the distinction clearer.

And lastly, is the footer not finished, or is it just not displaying correctly on my computer? There's like a left-aligned vertical list of options, and then a huge blank white space on the right. All that before the copyright notice. Maybe the style sheet's missing or something?

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Because you said you don't hate me, I'll respond.  I thought you would be too disgusted to want to deal with me any further.

Just a couple things:
I never doubted the existence of your boyfriend, his positive opinion of you, or the passion of your sexual encounters.  That line was about how one man's perspective isn't always correct or what the majority of people would think.

I chose to respond to comments in this thread in particular because it had a striking relevance to my life.  About a month and a half ago, I broke things off with a friend with benefits of mine, citing she was too fat.  Straight up told her.  I like to think I'm completely honest, even if it's blunt or brutal sometimes.  Lies, euphemisms, and cover ups are some of the most destructive things to human beings, but I digress.  How do you think she took it?  No surprise, she hated me for weeks.  She cried and yelled at me about how she's had an eating disorder her whole life. When she saw me in public she wouldn't acknowledge me and take the very first opportunity to leave my presence.  She said very hateful things to my friends about me.  Fast forward to about a week ago.  After giving her space not talking to her all this time, I texted her ""Hey"".  She immediately replied.  We proceeded to have a long conversation about how she had a boyfriend now, and that what I did and said to her opened her eyes to certain ways she was viewing herself.  It's still a bit rocky, but if my third eye shows me correctly, I'm thinking we're going to have a positive friendship in the future.

Also, I think you're misunderstanding why I think it's important not to be fat, or be the best.  It's not to please other people.  Pleasing other people is simply a result of becoming the best possible person *you* can be.  I don't doubt that you've made living with a few extra pounds work for you.  The fact is, I will never be convinced that you with these extra pounds is better than you without them.  I'm an athlete in the summer only, and when I'm in competition ready shape, *every*thing in my life is better.  I have more energy to do the other things in my day, and that makes me feel great.  The world is full of average people.  Therefore, it's not hard to exist happily as an average person in it.  But I wanna be better than that.","1351728994"

Is it possible that China's seeding could be responsible for the days and days of rain and then a dry period? My theory is they 'moved' the clouds to the other side of the globe, which would be roughly North America, by dissapating the cloud cover over them. The clouds were repelled causing the clouds to be pushed opposite of the seeding site. The clouds eventually 'bounce' back and forth from NA to China and back. It seems to be one year is dry then the next is wet, then dry. 

Sorry if it's ridiculous or if I'm not conveying the idea properly or clearly. Don't rake me over the coals, this is a serious thought ever since the record rain in (if I remember correctly?) '09. Thank you for reading and truing to comprehend my thoughts.","1351728996"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The real reason there won't be a comparable Muslim problem in the US is because the socio-demographic dynamics here are very different.

Through the 1980s-90s and even a little bit before, you saw wide-ranging immigration from some Muslim countries.  Nowadays however, it is much harder for Muslims to get visas/green cards into the US, especially after 9/11.  For the most part, Muslim immigration is now mostly limited to people with technical knowledge (we're talking about tough BA/BS degrees, masters, PhDs, MDs, etc.) or people coming for an education.  Even when immigration was more lax, a rather substantial amount of Muslims were coming in that had skills, and could SPEAK ENGLISH.  Because of this, there is a greater degree of assimilation, there is very little incentive to live a life of crime, and there is also a constant, albeit weak air of intimidation.  What do I mean?  Well since 9/11 Muslims don't feel nearly as welcome in the US, so on the whole (not saying there aren't a few nuts in the community) are not going to fuck around with authorities.

In France, I imagine the situation is different because the borders in Europe are more fluid.  I mean, if you can get into the EU, you can pretty much get into France right?  There are also actually Muslim countries physically close to France (across the Mediterranean, and the ME isn't as far) compared to US.  And I'm not sure about this part, but I get the sense that French Muslims are less often the ""cream of the crop"" from their country of origin.

EDIT: I should also mention that the general political attitude of Muslims in the US is secularism.  Some of the older generations might want to see a little more morality in public life, but people realize we are immigrants here and that this is not an Islamic country.  But among younger people (0-30s/40s), we see the Christian fundies running around, and we sure as hell don't want them running our lives.  Ergo, we respect other peoples' beliefs; though we'd like to see just a little more tolerance of ours.","1351729004"

""Reads"" is a pretty broad term, there are reads that could be considered apples and reads that could be considered oranges when you look at it from a game mechanics standpoint, it's a little more than just ""I knew you were going to do that"" as ultimately, that's what makes a good player and not a good character.

The point is when groups of people use a democracy to go against these freedoms although they use the democratic process if allowed to do so they will inevitably destroy it, and so the argument can be made in these cases that democracy is not suppose to work like that.

Allah is supposed to be a just and good god that loves humanity.

The issue is that EVIL is still around. Like God has said that Murder of the innocent and rape is evil.

So GOD sees these things as evil right?? Then why dose he allow it to happen?? IS he unwilling to stop it then he is evil.

IF i see some one getting raped and i do not do any thing to stop it then i am a bad person. God could stop it, but dose not then he is not good.

TOUT ici est fait pour garder les pauvres, pauvres et les riches, riches. Pourquoi tu pense que les médecins calissent leur camp?

&gt;Tu penses vraiment qu'avec 10% de plus d'argent pour tout le monde, ca ferait autre chose que d'augmenter les prix de 6-7% ? Tu me dis que la vie est dure pour un 3% de difference ?

Now, it goes without saying that the better quality video you upload the better quality it will come out the other end of YouTube's encoder... any encoder for that matter.

&gt;**Love China or leave, Lu Ping tells Hong Kong's would-be secessionists**

&gt;*Gary Cheung and Stuart Lau, Thursday, 01 November, 2012*

&gt;""Those who do not recognise they are Chinese should look at what is written on their passports or they should renounce their Chinese nationality.""

&gt;So says Lu Ping, former director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. ""Our country, which has a population of 1.3 billion, would not be bothered losing this handful of people,"" Lu stated in an exchange of email with the South China Morning Post.

&gt;Lu made the comments when attacking people in the city who do not want to acknowledge their nationality.

&gt;Under the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China, people can apply to renounce their nationality if they are a close relative of a foreign national, are settled abroad, or for other legitimate reasons.

&gt;Lu told the Post he noted some people had waved the British flag and held up posters calling for ""Hong Kong independence"" at a recent protest in the city. ""They claim the only way out for Hong Kong is to become an independent nation,"" he said.

&gt;It was the second time Lu has commented on calls for Hong Kong independence. In a letter to the Post on October 12 he said ""these guys who advocate for Hong Kong independence are sheer morons"". ""Deprived of support from the mainland, Hong Kong would be a dead city."" Lu said it was good his remarks had triggered controversy.

&gt;Last week, Lu's former deputy, Chen Zuoer, said ""the rise of a pro-independence force in Hong Kong is spreading like a virus"" and should be dealt with firmly.

&gt;Yesterday, an editorial in the state-run Global Times described the notion of an independent Hong Kong as a ""false proposition"". It said a minority of Hongkongers had stirred up anti-mainland sentiment because they were losing their sense of superiority over mainlanders.

&gt;Dickson Cheung - the spokesman of a group that has set up a Facebook page called ""We are Hongkongers, not Chinese"" - had this to say in response to Lu's latest attack on those who did not want to acknowledge their Chinese nationality: ""We do not even want an SAR [Special Administrative Region] passport. But what can we do?""

&gt;Executive Council convenor Lam Woon-kwong said he did not see the emergence of a movement for independence, even though some people had waved the British flag during protests.","1351729017"

Of course preference plays a role. The question is: what are your preferences based on? Putting 'not bi' on your relationship must-haves list isn't like putting 'in shape', 'career oriented', 'no kids' on it. It's more like putting 'not latino'. Bisexuality doesn't tell you *anything* at all about who a person is, beyond that they are attracted to people of both genders. The only reason to have a preference against bi people in general is because you have some kind of prejudice against the whole group; because bi people are, for some reason or another, not suitable for dating.

 *non-crazy reason, that is. I guess you could come up with some wild requirements like ""isn't attracted to anyone they went to school with"" (or something like) and limit yourself to straight men who went to all boys schools. That wouldn't be a biphobic motivation.","1351729018"

Coming from a homophobic or strict family isn't very fun. You basically can't trust your parents because they put their political rhetoric and personal life ahead of what's good for you. I don't think her mother is a horrible person and understand why she reacted the way she did, but creeping on a 16 year old's Internet history says that you don't trust your kid at all unless this situation has happened to OP's girlfriend multiple times. For example, out of my all friends in high school, my parents were the only ones who would log into my accounts and check over all my shit. It was embarrassing, not necessary, and made me feel like shit but there wasn't a ton I could do about it.

&gt; To me, there's no reason why someone should be in a long-distance relationship three years that person's senior. 

I don't think we should immediately write OP off due to the age difference. I've dated people five plus years older than me without much difficulty (i.e. when I was 19 I was dating a 28 year old). Most state's have 16 or 17 set as the age of consent. Since we don't know where OP is, it's pretty far-fetched to call her a sexual predator. I'm thinking co-dependent would be a more accurate term. Although I don't view 19 year olds as adults, so I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree. ","1351729019"

Don't get my wrong, I definitely agree with the French decision to do this. This violence has no place in France. However:

Have you all forgotten the colonialism of Morocco and Algeria? Have you forgotten the fathers that you ripped from families and forced them to fight under the french flag (such as my Uncle)? How about when you worked these people like slaves in manufacturing during the war?

The french were busy taking their ""place in the sun"" and bringing home cheap/free labour, but never seemed to complain about these Muslims then. After the Germans took Paris in a time most people could only shower in (30 mins), who was part of the force that helped you recover your touted ""liberté""?

France is busy crying about ""losing their culture"" but it is all their fault. Anyways, if it wasn't for the rest of the world fighting for them, they'd be speaking German. You brought them there, directly and indirectly. Look at the French soccer (football) team. Their hero Zidane himself is of Algerian descent.

TLDR: France greedily came into Africa and stole their people during world war 2. Complains that Africans have taken over their ""culture"".

"DebateAtheismPlus","t5_2v2mp","First, I don't know how you would measure the amount the ""average person"" who votes GOP ""supports"" social causes (or where you assumed that fact from) but I'm going to assume (A) you're talking about financially, and (B) that you're correct.  Even without asking for a reference.

&gt;The average person who votes Republican and support many social justice issues that atheism+ does, just in a different way.  I would bet that when it comes to supporting people with disabilities, law-and-order (read: getting rapists), and feeding the poor, religiously oriented republicans surpass the non-religious in both numbers and as a percentage, the same can be said for religiously oriented democrats.

That's a bet I'd take.  And win...unless by ""supporting social justice in a different way"" you mean ""by supporting social justice only to the extent that it suits the possibility of being re-elected and funding their campaigns in the eyes of the ignorant and the deluded.""  

There are reasons that the religious outweigh the non-religious in terms of financially supporting social causes, which have been explored in a variety of venues and which I shouldn't need to re-hash here: indoctrination from early youth, guilt, threat of damnation,  fear of community excommunication and ostracization...but to imply that this support somehow nullifies the damage done by the religious in these same venues in any way?  No.   Religion: fixing the problems compounded by religion.

&gt; For instance, you will find lots of religious blacks who don't support LGBT rights.

If you can show me where I can find ""lots of religious blacks who don't support LGBT rights"" but are still voting Dems, I'll give you a blowjob in a Harlem church.  ""Lots""?  No.  That's a piece of info I need to see a study on.

&gt;I suspect that if you actually polled atheists, you would find a good percentage of ""fiscally conservative, socially liberal"" out there. Many of these would vote Republican if ""Republican"" didn't equal religious nuts and sociopaths. 

Why would you assume that?  If Republican didn't equal religinuts (i.e. Dave Silverman in 2009), why would you assume ""a good percentage"" would automatically vote GOP?   Because you're prioritizing the fiscal plans of the GOP over the social policies of the Dems?  Yeah, that's worked so well for the US to date.  If anything, on a level playing field of Atheists looking at politics devoid of religion, one should assume...nothing.  In fact...look at [this](http://www.atheistrev.com/2008/06/mccain-or-obama.html) from 2008.  (And what does ""a good percentage/many"" even mean?)  I find that speculative and doubtful.","1351729027"

They want to retain strict control over the tempo of new content drops and the overall lifetime of the game.

Bucs fan here, and we most certainly don't expect an easy win. Not any more at least.

I'm not an appeaser. I'll admit that under normal circumstances( with our #1 corner not suspended and an O-line that's actually healthy enough to play) I would bet on the Bucs to win this game, but that's not the case anymore. 

The Bucs are severely depleted and the Raiders have looked like a completely different team since the bye week. It will be crucial that our O-line( currently made up of 3 backups) give Freeman some time and Martin some running room. Our offense needs to score just about every time we have the ball. If we can't do that, then I see us falling behind early and not being able to catch back up.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","As albh mentioned the price-rent is very high. At these levels, vis a vis other investments offered to North Americans, there are better places to place one's money right now, in my view.

Doing affordability calculations on housing is not how I would judge the soundness of an investment. This is a capital investment whose useful life extends for many decades, the land portion hundreds of years further. This necessitates a long term view when doing investing and, comparing real estate to other utilities of similar risk profile, the return should be much higher than the current level.

The best measure of an investment's quality is its earnings potential, risk adjusted. From what I see marginal investors now are, whether they realise it or not, relying upon above-inflation capital appreciation to produce a fair risk-adjusted return. If that does not occur investors will be loath to plug money into an asset that is likely to be worth less in five years. At that point the only support level for prices (using the US as a gauge) is cash-only investors looking for a 7%+ cap rate for high quality properties. What is often forgotten with capital purchases is the heavy sensitivity to equity ratios in determining behaviour of those reliant upon improving ratios to keep cash flows positive. Without that support demand dries up and prices fall.

I'd suggest taking a step back and looking at what, ultimately, sets prices in the long run. It is not financing, it is earnings potential. There's an SF Fed paper on this line of thinking, using so-called price-rent ratios to estimate the bottom of the market. It proved chillingly accurate in the United States and unless you think Canada is immune from basic earnings analysis we should expect a similar retrenchment. Based on my measures Vancouver condo prices are currently 70% above levels supported by its long-run price-rent ratio. That portends a 40% drop in prices in real terms.","1351729045"

Ne looks at the big picture. It provides spontaneous creativity and links different ideas together. 

Your father's Si is their dominant function, which is what conflicts with your Ne as they are opposite ways of Perceiving.

Any medical device must receive market authorization. This is the most important part. The manufacturer of the device must show that it exactly as it claims to do, in this case, deliver a specific dose of nicotine, and that it is similar enough to existing approved devices that it doesn't need to go through clinical trials. Until a manufacturer goes through this process, e-cigs will never be legal in Canada.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","This has got me thinking of what a star rugby team would look like using NFL players...

Front Row: I'd want guards or centers because while they need the size and strength to boss a scrum they also need to be agile enough to get to the rucks and tackles.  People like Josh Sitton, the Pounceys, Alex Mack, Nick Mangold I think would be perfect.

Second Row: Let's get some size, strength, jumping ability, and tackling ability up in this bitch.  That means DEs and LBs.  J.J Watt, would be the first name on the list without a doubt, and I think second on that list would be Jared Allen.  Aldon Smith could also be considered, as well as Mario Williams.

Back Row:  This is the fun part, because I want size, speed, ball carrying ability, vision, a good rugby brain and above all else the best tacklers in the team.  Patrick Willis, Ray Lewis, Clay Matthews, etc would all be names I'd consider from the defensive side but people like the Gronk, Tony Gonzalez, Jason Witten, could also be very handy.  Toughest positions to decide by far.

Scrum Half: Quick thinking, quick on his feet, good passing, doesn't need to be overly sized but needs to know how to exert total control of the vastly bigger team around him.  And he needs to have no fear as he'll be tackling people much bigger than him... Man if only Doug Flutie was still playing I think he'd be perfect.  Instead I'd consider Brees, RG3, or Michael Vick if he could cure his fumbilitis.

Fly Half: Easy, Chad Johnson (AKA Ochocinco). He can run, tackle, has good hands, we could teach him how to pass and most importantly... [he can kick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AldNVxN67Y)

Centre Partnership: Woof... another tough one.  I want big, strong, good tacklers, but with good speed, hands and passing ability and definitely someone who could break a tackle or two.  Arian Foster, Adrian Peterson, Aaron Hernandez, and Frank Gore are the names that immediately come to mind. 

Wings:  Give me SPEED and I don't care how big they are as long as they can outrun everyone else on the speed and make cuts when they have to.  CJ2K, Hester, Desean Jackson, Percy Harvin, etc etc etc... Literally a wealth of possibilities. 

Fullback: Size, catching ability, tackling, vision, basically the perfect meld of back row and back.  Megatron, Julio Jones, VJax, Larry Fitzgerald, are top of my list.  And if I could have Randy Moss in his prime he beats all of them out for top spot.

So, lineup:

1. Maurkice Pouncey

2. Nick Mangold

3. Josh Sitton

4. J.J. Watt

5. Aldon Smith 

6. Patrick Willis

7. Clay Matthews

8. Gronk (Can't not have his running ability)

9. Drew Brees

10. Chad Ochocinco, obviously

11. CJ2K because even in his rut he can still outrun people

12. Arian Foster

13. Adrian Peterson

14. Percy Harvin

15. I'm stickin with Julio Jones

I'd like to think that although the US war machine is an evil construct, we've not seen anything even close to that kind of massacre in this war. The worst moment of the war for me was that one with the soldier in afghanistan going to those houses and killing all those women and children.

But I think this is human nature for the people on the top, to become desensitized to civilian deaths. They become impartial and when they have massive firepower like the US it's very dangerous.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I am going answer your question as a Christian, so you may not agree with everything I say, but I am going to answer honestly. Apologies for the long response.

To properly address this question, we should probably ask “what makes *any* sin, sinful?

Sin is sinful, because it is an offense to God, put most simply. God created everything for a rightful purpose and to glorify Him, but sin normally turns something created for a good reason, into something other than which it was intended, twisting it into something else. 

We are advised that certain things are sinful for this reason, but also because there is a good reason why we shouldn’t sin for *our* good. Think about it “why shouldn’t I steal?” “Why shouldn’t I desire my neighbour’s things?” “Why shouldn’t I get drunk?”. Follow each sin through to the common consequences and you can get a good idea as to why it is a bad thing.

Something else to consider is that all sins are equally sinful – no one sin is outlined as any better or worse as any other. Since all people are sinful, then no one should be treated any different due to their particular point of weakness. I say this, because some people try to make some kind of distinction that isn’t there about same sex activity.

Next, we need to consider that it isn’t just homosexual sex that is sinful; it is every kind of sexual activity outside of the created purpose. That includes sex outside of marriage between two heterosexual people, sex between more than two people, pornography, masturbation, adultery, sex with a near relative and any other kind of sexual activity outside of one man and one woman that are married to each other.

These behaviours are not what sex was created for. Most of these activities are aimed at satisfying yourself. Most of them negatively affect others in some way. Satisfying yourself sexually has the aim of satisfying yourself. This leads to selfishness and negativity towards others. If I consider just *what I want* then my actions are aimed with this focus. If I consider what is good for others, then my actions are aimed with that focus.

God created people for community, not to be selfish.

Homosexual sex is sinful, along with these other things, primarily because it is offensive to God. But there are other, practical reasons why it is also a bad idea. The anus was not created as a place for sex to be had. It is the place we humans get rid of our waste. God has decreed this as a taboo not only for His glory, but also for our good. Anal sex has many, well documented [health risks]( http://www.mckinley.illinois.edu/handouts/anal_sex.html) too, which also suggests that it is a bad idea.

By having homosexual sex, you are turning something Holy into something perverse. But this model is the same for all sin – turning something Holy and good into something bad and perverse. Think about it – Money is good, greed is bad. Food is good, gluttony is bad. Protecting yourself and your family is good, violence is bad.

By having homosexual sex, you are opening yourself, and someone else to serious health conditions. This is a selfish act, for your own gratification.

Think about this on a wider scale: Who benefits from negative health consequences? Nobody. Who suffers from them? The whole of society.  

How about the psychological impacts? If this is supported as a good and right thing, then we are saying that something that dishonours God, that is bad for us, that produces negative health consequences, that promotes self-satisfaction, is a *good thing* for society and people. We are affirming to others that something bad is good, so we are not supporting what is for the best for them, in fact, we are supporting them doing something that is bad for them.

Lastly, as a Christian, I am not prepared to support something that will keep people from God. The Bible says that sin separates us from Him. Sure, you can go ahead and say “I don’t believe it is sin”, but it doesn’t change how He sees it.

Should I support something that may well be the thing that keeps them from God? On judgement day, am I going to be held accountable for their soul because I supported them in their sin? The last thing that I want to consciously be doing is putting road blocks in the way and preventing them from coming to know God, who loves them so much that He gave up His son for them.

If I support this thing, then I am not being true to God, to myself, or others. Should I deliberately lead others astray? You may think it is unloving to not support it, but actually the opposite is true. If I support it, understanding it in this way, it would be **very** unloving for me to overlook that.

"TheSimpsons","t5_2rhs5","I'm in my late 20s and started watching The Simpsons when I was seven or eight when it was still two or three seasons old, and stopped around the time I went to university-- at first for lack of TV, but really because the writing got really tired, the plots predictable, a weird shift to topical humour, guest stars appearing as themselves on the show the same way they appear on late night talk shows (a way to plug something), self-referential humour, etc. The animation got better, but that's not necessarily a good thing if it doesn't feel fresh, and really just the voice acting that's still as good as it ever was, but that's not reason enough for me to keep watching.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I haven't said the previous ones were accurate, so I'm not sure why you're attributing that to me.  I also haven't said these aren't accurate, only that they are weak evidence due to a low N.

For purposes of comparing preferences of early voters, the relevant N is the number of people surveyed multiplied by the percentage who have already voted.  So you get an N in the vicinity of 60 for each poll.  That's pretty low for predicting a national result, especially given the low response rates we've seen.  Still, it's better than nothing.  If this were all the evidence we had, I'd tentatively go with it.  But there's a lot of other evidence available that contradicts it.  If you're going to combine evidence, you have to combine all of it, you're not allowed to just cherry pick the two polls that agree.  When you do that, the picture is quite different.

This is similar to the issue with interpreting Gallup's broader results.  They've been outliers for some time now.  Of course it's possible that Gallup is right and everyone else is wrong, but the safer bet is that Gallup is having some difficulties with their demographics and are overestimating on the Republican side.  If that's true in the national polls, and the early vote results are a subset of the national results, we should expect a similar lean.

So while these polls should not be dismissed out of hand by any means, in the context of the broader evidence available to us, they should be taken with a large dose of salt.","1351729075"

Most, if not all schools offer free classes where you can see how they do things. Take advantage of that and check it out, ask other students about the pros/cons, and take note of the class atmosphere and how the teacher behaves and acts around the students.

And don't feel like you have to make a decision right away, and don't let anyone pressure you either. Take your time and evaluate all the options.

Are there other schools in your area that you might consider?

Why Muay Thai?

And as for your questions about ""Dojo life"", you could call it group lessons cause you learn and train as a goup. Freedom to train would be different from school to school depending on the Art, but mine has some flexibility in that area. And competitions would mainly depend on if you are actually interested and want to compete.","1351729082"

I believe that figure relates to beef.   Meat chickens are much more efficient and gain 1lb for every 2lbs of feed.  If they're free range and have access to good pasture they will eat lots of things like bugs, grass, herbs etc as well, lowering the amount of grains they need to be fed.  

You can also use them to fertilize yards/pastures by putting them in bottomless cages and moving the cages once a day or by building raised beds and placing temporary cages over top of the beds and adding in a layer of straw every so often.    You can still feed them forage, grass clippings, weeds, etc and once they're ready to harvest, you've got a ready to go raised bed to grow food in AND chicken meat :-)

"NASCAR","t5_2qs08","Let's take a look at every other sport's playoff system. We have a regular season where a select number of teams make it to the playoffs. From this point forward, it doesn't matter whatsoever how well you did in the regular season. If you perform well in the postseason, better than anyone else over those games, you move on, and eventually win the championship. It doesn't matter if you are the wild card team that barely finished over .500, all that matters is you made the playoffs and got hot when it counted. Obviously teams that did well in the regular season should get SOME sort of advantage over those who did not, which is where the bonus points come into play. Personally, I think that the bonus points are just slightly not enough of a reward. Three points per win doesn't seem like a lot to me, because like you said, look how easily Biffle's advantage went away this year. Compare this to a team having the best record all season and gaining home field/court advantage, but losing to a low seed in the first round. Again, you just have to perform well enough to make the playoffs, and then perform the best in the playoffs to win a title.

While I think that the Chase has flaws, most of them have to do with the racetracks, rather than the qualifying and scoring process. There never will be a perfect system, just like there is not a perfect system in any sport.","1351729094"

As a simplified example:

(10,000 * 0.10 * 0.80) + (100,000 * 0.35 * 0.80)

 =

((10,000 * 0.10) + (100,000 * 0.35)) * 0.80

 = 
 28,800

Thus the rate would be 28,800 / 110,000 = 26.2% instead of 36,000 / 110,000 = 32.7%, i.e. a 20% lower rate.","1351729098"

Coincidentally these are talked about the least amongst SRS types even though this is the strongest intersection. Additionally, when SRS tries to express this idea, it is implied that race and sex are the strongest intersections. It also almost always used as a weapon of a attack upon one's own intersection instead being presented as a tool with which to view society and yourself. Not make people feel like they are actively doing something wrong.

I agree with current versions of intersectionality, but I think it's the wrong idea to force it so adamantly everywhere you go, especially online. It's like forcing a traditional Christian to constantly think in terms of quantum mechanics. Some people just won't see the same world you do.","1351729105"

His self esteem also shouldn't be eroding. Sometimes libido has nothing to do with the partner! I've always had a low libido, and it honestly sucks sometimes. Terribly. I love my SO (of 3+ years) and find him very sexy, but my body doesn't cooperate. Often times even my brain wants it, but my body just won't. It doesn't mean it's his fault and he should feel lesser!

I understand the hurt of her feeling like you're a chore, but please OP, realize it is not always because of you. Some women are not wired to be sexual deviants. By all means you need to talk to her and discuss things, but you absolutely cannot be hurtful. This is a very soft subject, you must tiptoe and think and be deliberate but gentle. You both have to figure out what you need and what compromises can be made to get you both happy again. Maybe a handjob instead of sex one night? Maybe have one night a week of a candlelit bubble bath to relax, and maybe some sexy time after if she feels up to it!

Back in Super Bowl XLII, one of the last hail marries that Brady threw, he was inches close to completing it to Moss. He was covered by one back. If Brady threw it a little more accurate, Moss could've caught it I bet and there'd be at least OT in that Super Bowl and Brady would be known as the best clutch player of all time.

Five years later without Moss, we haven't gotten close to that moment and Brady is no longer known as the golden clutch boy. At least I don't hear it anymore.","1351729109"

You misunderstand. **There's no such thing as what you describe**. Congress by law outlines where funds must go in the DoD, and that - the National Defense Authorization, is that outlining document. The President can give any lawful order as Commander in Chief, but the sole constitutional method to pay for them is through Congress. *The President has no lawful authority to move money to back his orders but can only act unilaterally where Congress has already allocated funds* - and, you know, not specifically forbidden him from using any money on doing that specific thing.

Ironically, had Obama not used Gitmo politically, he would have been much more likely to get away with using already allocated funds because Congress clearly put that provision in solely as a ""Fuck you"" to him.","1351729116"

"movies","t5_2qh3s","That's because horror film has fallen into the genre trap. That being that it is more profitable and easier to cater to niche audience that will always pay up. This is equivalent to the straight to paperback genre novel franchise, which turns a huge profit by relying wholly on the type of compulsive person that will read it regardless (romance, western, horror, etc). Add to this the very profitable budget video sales and VOD, and they literally only have to concern themselves with a built-in audience. I'm sure we all know the kind of cat who will watch, rent, or buy any shitty horror movie no matter what (or any shitty action or sci-fi movie).

Risk makes little fiscal sense for a film exec., and so it is therefore left up to the push of existing artistic talent to bring notice to actual worthwhile horror films (del Toro). Alien and Jaws had mega budgets and were made by filmmakers that already had a bit of a name. The genre has so been soured that now it is rare for an established filmmaker to venture into those waters. On top of that, those two were large budget films, thereby of a higher risk, and we've already established that that rarely happens now. They were also cross-genres (sci-fi and action, respectively).

I hope we get there again, though. There are still great horror films out there, they are just not easy to hear of or find because they are at a disadvantage to dreck. Formulaic, repetitive vomit is attractive to folks who don't wanna think during their entertainment.","1351729118"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","After topping the list without loosing a single game, ESL decided to ban us from the ESL Pro Series. The reason why they removed us was because of the fact that we had too many penalty points. On a sidenote, 12pp's were already given before the tournament even started.

When the tournament started we had to use our wildcards because premium &amp; trusted statusses weren't in order yet. It took ESL 5 days to send out the trusted cards, after that we had to send them back by post which takes some time as well. As some of you might know we aren't playing that long together yet so we weren't able to get the trusted / premium in order earlier so there was no way for us to finish the things earlier. ESL was aware of what was going on in our team but clearly didn't care about the circumstances.

The last penalty points we got in last monday's match was because of the fact that we didn't have 5 players ready for the match against dotpixels. Since we used all of our wildcards already we weren't able to wildcard again and this caused the kick from the EPS.

I'd like to thank everyone who supported us during this EPS season and ESL TV for casting our games. We aren't allowed to play in the upcoming season of the EPS as well so you will not see us play any EPS games for the upcoming months. We'll still be competing in the ESL Major Series where we just won our 1st group stage match.","1351729124"

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","That's true that it's uncommon, but it was kind of a necessary thing in Chrono to do that, to give the game at least some challenge.  Even though, the game has almost none.  Perhaps that's part of what allows it to have such universal appeal (like what Nintendo's been trying to do with all of its latest games) but for me that game's just too simple.  Having played through the DS one recently, and for the first time that I've played the game in a long time, I was disappointed to finish it without rushing, doing all the (original) side stuff, in just over 11 hours.  Yes it has New Game+, and yes it has 13+endings, but several of those endings have zero value other than completionism, and there is of course even less challenge on subsequent playthroughs, and you can burn through the game beginning to end in like 5 hours.

For what it's worth, I'm kinda playing devil's advocate here, as I do love the game and with the nostalgia bug it's among the games I've flat-out enjoyed the most in my whole life.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; How is it inhibited? If they can predict disasters, then firms still make profit if they can or cannot gouge. If they can predict demand, then they won't buy less supply than is needed just because they can't gouge. They will buy in either case the supply they can sell. And they certainly aren't selling more supply by gouging. 

Did you read my response at all?

&gt; Disasters mean shortages. Gouging laws have nothing to do with shortages, only fair distributions. Show me sufficient evidence to support your claim that disaster areas where gouging is allowed do not undergo shortages.

You want evidence? Read a Micro 101 textbook, indexed under ""price ceilings"", which is exactly what anti-price-gouging laws are. You arguing this particular point really hurts your own credibility. This is *very basic* economics. If the market equilibrium price is above an imposed price ceiling, it leads to shortages. If the market price is below an imposed price floor, there will be surpluses.

Maybe this will clear it up (Wikipedia - Price ceiling):

&gt; *A price ceiling set below the free-market price has several effects. Suppliers find they can't charge what they had been. As a result, some suppliers drop out of the market. This reduces supply. Meanwhile, consumers find they can now buy the product for less, so quantity demanded increases. These two actions cause quantity demanded to exceed quantity supplied, which causes a shortage—unless rationing or other consumption controls are enforced. It can also lead to various forms of non-price competition so supply can meet demand.*

Also,

&gt; *In terms of fairness, anti-price gouging laws require producers to sell goods below their market-clearing price: the market clearing price is the amount at which quantity supplied is equal to quantity demanded. If goods are priced above their market-clearing price then there will be a surplus of goods and the converse leads to a shortage of goods. Under anti-price gouging laws, consumers are unable to buy the necessary goods which they desire in a time of need.*

And of course,

&gt; ***Many economists argue that laws against price increases serve only to restrict supplies of a good or service by reducing the incentive suppliers have to undertake any additional costs, hazards or inconvenience that may be required. They argue further saying that these price increases force consumers to ration goods thus increasing the longevity of certain resources in an emergency.***","1351729129"

"composer","t5_2sjib","Have you spoken to the marimba player and showed him the score? I'm not a percussionist but I took a class in undergrad and a class in graduate school on percussion writing as well as had two percussion pieces commissioned and in all of those experiences I was explicitly told not to write for marimba like it's a piano. And more specifically, alberti bass lines and melodies on top are extremely not idiomatic for keyboard percussion.

Looking at the score it's really clear that many figures, like the one that starts on measure 105, are clearly intended for piano and not marimba. I was taught to practice playing the part on the piano with only your thumb and your pinky to get a very approximate sense of what a playing with two mallets in each hand is like. And if you try to play those figures on the piano with those fingers you can see how hard it is to do these lines simultaneously.

Also some of the notation is odd. Marimba doesn't sustain like a piano nor vibraphone, and there is no pedal. Each attack only sustains so long and even less if you want muting. So tying some attacks over multiple beats doesn't really make sense in the marimba context. this becomes especially clear at measure 82 where you've asked for a dotted half and a quarter note in the same attack. While this may be meaningful for piano, (though very difficult as you need big hands to reach that tenth) on the marimba there is no way to accomplish this and would  just be distracting to the performer.

While i look at 82 I can't help but notice that you have a tenth in the right hand. I don't think that that is reachable with a single hand on the marimba, even at that range with longer mallets. It'd be possible then to put the upper Db in the left hand so that the left hand plays the octave and the right hand only plays that high F, but then the left hand has to swing down to hit the low F. Which is possible, probably, but hard.

Which is where the other major difference between piano and keyboard percussion comes in. Since the percussionist is playing with mallets they are not actually feeling the instrument which means that they need to at all times see where they are going. The figure at 82 stresses this until 86 where the percussionist needs to place the mallets over all five octaves of the marimba. Most of these melody and accompaniment ideas are difficult because you are asking the percussionist to constantly find and place two separate ideas at once and thus dividing their attention. Not that it can't be done, but that it's difficult and not idiomatic for the marimba. I'd direct you to ""How to Write for Percussion"" by Samuel Z Solomon page 79, which I'm consulting now while I write this to make sure that I'm not leading you astray. 

Once again I'm not a percussionist, but I'm really concerned that your piece isn't playable and I'm fairly certain it's not idiomatic for the marimba. Of course I would be happy to be wrong and please let me know if your percussionist disagrees with my comments.","1351729133"

China can drive you crazy, but I would definitely go for at least a few months; preferably longer so that you can really improve your Chinese language skills. It will really open your eyes up too. If you do go, I would avoid shanghai and Beijing, as I personally don't think they are the real China in some ways. They're also bloody expensive places to live! I would recommend Kunming if you end up going - the air is cleaner than most cities, pretty laid-back, some great Chinese language schools, and in a beautiful part of the country, Yunnan province. Whatever you do though, don't give up on the language learning, it'll be so useful to you in the future.","1351729137"

Most likely it was passed down from the mother to the child during childbirth or breastfeeding. HIV transmission through the placenta is extremely rare, but during childbirth there is a lot of mom's blood all over the baby, and it could easily get into an orifice that would lead to infection. HIV is also transmitted through breast milk, and through blood while the baby is nursing (if there is a skin break). HIV women who have children should not breast feed, but if the mother could not afford formula or did not know she was HIV positive, or that the disease could be passed that way, can easily spread it to her child.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt;The reason your getting downvoted is because you are using the wrong language for the situation.

The language is completely acceptable. None of what I've used is exclusive to some field of law or debate. All the words I have used have conveyed the exact meaning that some other word would have conveyed. I cannot tell you why I chose these words apart from the fact that these are the words that came to mind. I felt I should express myself in that particular way and I did.

&gt;In this context they make you sound like you are trying to be superior to the rest of us.

This is not the obvious and blatant conclusion you are trying to make it out to be. This is what you yourself are interpreting from my word usage and my word usage alone. If I had come in here on some grand high horse of self importance and condescension, you would have a point. If I had insulted others for having a problem with the words I used or to ""get on my level"" -something I never once did- you would have a point. I simply posted a comment with perfectly acceptable grammar and vocabulary. The meaning has not been obscured. The words have not been used incorrectly. 

&gt;Which is why people are not liking you.

The problem is not in my word usage, it is in what you sensitive people decide to preemptively and unfairly assume about me *based* on my word usage. Let me state here and now that I do not believe the words I have used are big, important, or necessary. They are simply the words I wanted to use. Leave it to reddit to form a gripe on something so completely idiotic.

It's a waste of finite resources, as far as I'm concerned. There's only so many vintage bikes left that are in good shape. I don't care if you scored an old Panasonic for thirty bucks at a yard sale or if your dad gave you his old Bridgestone: If its still in good shape, it's a shame to fuck with it. 

Especially since what's most likely going to happen is you'll strip it down and shave all the bosses and guides off, ride it around for six months, and then get rid of it for a fraction of its original worth once you decide you want a proper track frame. 

It's different if the kid just takes the derailleurs off and swaps the wheelset out. Then when they wanna upgrade they can sell the bike complete and original to someone who'll appreciate the fuck out of it(3).

1. Except I -do- ride an expensive-ass track frame on the street. Whatever. 

2. I'm not against multicolored gaudy set ups. My bike is fairly low-key aesthetically, but you can do whatever you want; if its got two wheels its okay in my book. 

3. I've done this with a few different bikes. I always save the stock components when doing a conversion. 

tl;dr: Don't shave your shit, asshats. ","1351729149"

"MECoOp","t5_2tkk1","&gt;Typhoon 1 (I just unlocked this last night, used it on silver, and it feels like my Revenant is better, for now)

It's Halloween so I have so time to crunch some numbers while handing out candies.

It depends what kind of protection you are up against.

Some facts on the Typhoon:

* The N7 Typhoon does not ignore armor DR at all.
* 1.5x damage multiplier does work against all protections, and stacks with 1.5x ramp up properly.
* Ramp up 1.5x damage multiplier affects ammo powers. i.e. it increases base weapon damage.
* At 0% ROF bonus, the first 4 shots are ""cool"" and consume 1 ammo each. After these 4 shots, the remaining uninterrupted shots are ""hot"" and consume 2 ammo each, with a 50% base damage increase

Since you are low on AP Ammo here's the comparison with Extended Barrel and Piercing V mods.  Although I would run AP Ammo and use the Extended Barrel and Magazine Mods.

Your Spec gives us 27.5% ED from the class passive and 15% ED from Devastator Mode.  Extended Barrel V gives us 25% ED, Assault Rifle Amp III 30% ED and your Assault Rifle Gear I 5 % ED.

Revenant - 650 rpm * 1.1 from Devastator Mode

Typhoon - 600 rpm * 1.1 from Devastator Mode

**Revenant X against Barriers Shields and Health**

    79.5 * (1 + 0.275 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.05)
    161.0 damage = 1918.6 burst dps

**Revenant X against Armour**
    
    79.5 * (1 + 0.275 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.05) - 50 * (1-.65)
    143.5 damage = 1710.0 burst dps

**Hot Typhoon I against Health**

    (44.4 * 1.5) * (1 + 0.275 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.05)
    134.9 damage = 1483.9 burst dps

**Hot Typhoon I against Armour**

    ((44.4 * 1.5) * (1 + 0.275 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.05)- 50 * (1-0.65)) * 1.5
    176 damage = 1936 burst dps

**Hot Typhoon I against Barriers Shields**

    (44.4 * 1.5) * (1 + 0.275 + 0.15 + 0.25 + 0.3 + 0.05) * 1.5
    202.3 damage = 2225.3 burst dps
  

So, with piercing the Typhoon is better against protection once ramped up to full RoF.  The Typhoon takes about 2 seconds to ramp up.  And, you'll only get 989 dps average against Health, 1201 dps against Armour and 1358 dps against Shields and Barriers during the ramp up phase.

The Revenant looks good on paper but the poor accuracy only gets you these numbers against big boss targets.  I find the Typhoon very accurate now that they patched the recoil issue.  I want to love the Revenant and the accuracy from Devastator helps but I need Marksman to put a reliable amount of bullets on target.

Why would Sam not look for Dean? This is the least dead Dean has ever been and Sam walks away? But in his form of purgatory Dean has vanished with (you are like a brother to me) Cas and Sam is alone. Then Sam gets two things he has always wanted, true love and more importantly a dog. So Dean is back and angry that Sam gave up on him and Kevin and here is Sam being a big disappointment again to his big brother. So Sam's purgatory is filled with loss of family, disappointment and the life he can never have. Now on to Dean. What are the things that would be in Dean's purgatory? Biggest thing is he is alone (again) in a hell like environment and looking for Cas who has given up so many things for Dean and who is now hiding. Dean has to throw in with a monster to find a way out. He has brought a monster who can kill and worse make more monsters back with him. And what was the deal with Kevins note? Everyone around Dean dies, but why so much anger towards Dean? Sam is the one who abandon him, it made no sense to me. Anyways I could go on and on let me know what you guys think.","1351729161"

Another thing you can try is adding starch as you would to thicken a soup or sauce: whisk in a roux or a slurry of cornstarch, tapioca, arrowroot, etc. These definitely blunt certain flavors, though I've never tasted it against salty (salt comes last). It will thicken the chili, but you can loosen it again with water, broth, beer, whatever you're using.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I've been noticing some questions that seem very social science-y in nature. Perhaps linking to /r/AskSocialScience might be appropriate from time to time? I'm thinking of, for instance, [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12a3ke/xkcd_ran_an_interesting_infograph_today_on/) [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/12au3b/south_korea_is_known_to_be_the_best_example_of_a/) recent posts that I saw.

Not to say that these are bad questions or that they aren't appropriate here! There's certainly a lot of interesting history to discuss in these contexts. But there's also a lot of PoliSci/Econ/etc that could be discussed. Maybe at the very least a mention on the sidebar? For instance, the post about xkcd didn't really dig into DW-NOMINATE very much (which was the entire basis of the chart, and it was developed by political scientists).

I'm not sure people even *know* to ask social scientists these things, so they might not be searching for an exclusively historical perspective on purpose. So it might be valuable to provide some small amount of direction so that people can get a fully diverse, satisfying answer to their questions.

I would also say that there are some posts in /r/AskSocialScience that probably belong here (there is even a ""history"" panelist flair, which seems unnecessary considering the existence of this excellent sub).

During the interview, aside from some comments about how he'd applied for dozens of internal jobs and not gotten interviews, things were going OK.  The guy was a little on the wacky side, but that's not a problem for our teams.


He'd interviewed well, and we were just finishing up some cursory ""soft"" questions (""Tell me about a time when...) when he told us that he is an Associate Pastor at his church.  No big deal.  Then, he proceeded to tell us about the *three* times that he and his wife had packed up and moved cross country.  The first time, it was because his wife had a disagreement with the pastor of their church.  The second time, they moved to follow a different pastor, who was promptly arrested for embezzlement.

First off, Attorney General Holder says that due process does not apply on the battlefield.  This is certainly true.  It is not possible to give a fair trial to someone who is shooting at you; you simply shoot back and try to kill them first.  But, this does not apply to al-Awlaki's situation.  Yemen is not a declared battlefield, and the decision to kill al-Awlaki was made months in advance.  He was specifically targeted.  This was an assassination, not a chance battlefield casualty.  If the president can decide on his own that anywhere in the world is a battlefield, where martial law reigns, what's the point of having civil rights?  It simply gives the president an unaccountable authority to kill anyone, anywhere, for nebulously-defined reasons of ""national security.""  It is an authority that would be prone to error and excess.

Second, the idea that secret executive deliberations can be regarded as a substitute for ""due process"" is laughably yet disturbingly perverse.  Would any person prefer, upon being accused of a crime, that their fate be decided by a secret panel, with no oversight or transparency?  Due process means that innocent people are weeded out of the judicial system, so that they aren't wrongly punished.  A critical element of due process, then, is accountability.  If no one can observe the proceedings to ensure that they are fair, then there's no one who can catch, report and rectify purposeful or accidental mistakes.

Third, the Constitution actually lays out a few specific rules for due process.  Article III stipulates that trials for all crimes shall be by jury, while the Sixth Amendment states that the accused shall be tried by an impartial jury.  The fact that the President in this case acted as accuser, jury and judge is a far cry from impartiality.  Again, the point of these civil protections is to ensure that the wrongly accused are released.

*I do not doubt that al-Awlaki was aiding the enemies of America and participated in plots to kill Americans.  Additionally, the CIA's tracking of al-Awlaki no doubt included sources and methods that should not be made public, lest they fall into enemy hands.  Therefore, the process of indicting, convicting and sentencing al-Awlaki might be different than how the justice system usually treats accused criminals.  I agree with this part of Holder's assessment.*

However, if al-Awlaki was truly as dangerous as the administration claims (as I am inclined to believe), then there must be ample evidence suggesting this, and so it ought to be easy to charge al-Awlaki with treason and attempted murder and sentence him to death, in absentia.  For the sake of protecting sensitive US intelligence, this process could conceivably be carried out by a closed but independent tribunal, with the explicit understanding that the proceeds would be declassified at a predetermined date in the not-too-distant future.  This provides an incentive to executive and military officials to make sure their claims are accurate by ensuring retroactive accountability.  In this way, administration officials who act illegally or wrongly levy accusations against American citizens can be brought to account later on.

*Al-Awlaki was probably not innocent.*  **But is it absolutely impossible that no innocent person would ever be accused of similarly heinous crimes?  No.  Is it absolutely impossible that, in the future, the administration could target other undesirables, like protestors or dissidents, with a similar legal justification?  No.  That's why we need due process, even for people like Charles Manson, ex-Nazis, and Anwar al-Awlaki.**","1351729186"

I'm sorry if I mislead you to believe the Supreme Court actually re-wrote the law. They didn't have to, they just decided to change the meaning of words (you know, like Orwell) here's an article on Obamacare, you'll read in the 12th  paragraph how Roberts just decided to call a penalty, a tax, expanding Congress' authority immensely:

http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Health-care-law-survives-with-Roberts-help-3669996.php

Can you please explain to me how our gun laws in AZ put thousands of weapons into the hands of Mexican drug cartels?

Then why does Obama have all these Czars, that aren't authorized by the Constitution? Why has Obama passed over 900 executive orders, in just 3.5 years? Why is the EPA now enforcing the Cap and Trade provisions that weren't passed into law? Resulting in numerous coal burning power plants being shut down? Why is emminent domain now being used to ""increase the tax base"" while enriching political cronies, instead of commonly used infrastructure devices like highways and bridges? Why is asset forfiture becoming the normal way for police forces to increase their budgets, preying on the people? People's assets are being seized even without any charges being filed for any crime, and then they are told to spend $thousands to get it back. 

The size of the federal budget is increading astronomically, much of it going to political cronies, with no end in site. Entitlements are unsustainable and will disappear altogether in the next few decades because nobody has the political will to fix them. Obamacare does nothing to control costs because it ignores the 3 main reasons prices increase: lack of tort reform (capping doctor's liability), lack of competition amongst insurance companies (across state lines), and too many policy mandates (politicians telling people the minimum health coverage they must purchase, by law). 

It would appear that the USA is going to learn the lessons of collectivism itself, rather than learn from the mistakes of Europe, Cuba, China, the Soviet Union, etc.. ","1351729187"

It's also juiced to all hell :p Sounds of war, limbs coming off, and most importantly pressing ""X"" gives a war cry, and pressing ""C"" gives a warcry/taunt and a good animation (banging shields etc.).

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Thanks for sharing! I found this subreddit just recently too and after 6 weeks of buying and returning, I found 3 different bras that actually fit (well, there are a couple of small issues I'm still working out). 
I just got an Elomi Hermione in 34H that fits wonderfully, smooth cup, looks great under t-shirts, (no visible seams, yay!), but it kind of makes the boobs a little ""east-west"".

I recently got a Fantasie balconette from brastop, but the lace on one boob wrinkles a bit, maybe should have sized down to the 34GG, but I can sew so I just took a little dart in the center near the gore. And in today's mail I got a Panache Emily Balconette in a 34GG and it fits nicely. 

I have been reading June's blog and I really want to order the Ewa M. Onyx, the Curvy Kates are cute but their sizing seems difficult to pin down, plus I think I'm a bit too old for all those ruffles and bows! :)

That being said, it is a huge stretch to try to twist Romney cancelling appearances in areas no one was going to show up to (because there was a hurricane) and then trying to pass every thing off as a humanitarian effort. It's just unfair, that's all. Most people can see that, any attention to this issue beyond that discussion of ""should disaster management be handled at the federal or state level"" is pointless.

I don't understand why so many conservatives think that to be conservative you must view every situation as ""Romney is perfect and Obama fails at everything"".

Also.. lots of people give a flying fuck about a candidate's religion. They use it as a proxy to judge core values. And candidates also offer it as proof of their values.","1351729197"

Going from past experience this is how I'd approach it. First, I would try opening the file with MPEG Streamclip(it's free). If the file opens you will likely be able to export it to your desired format. If it doesn't open then it is likely corrupted. With corrupted video files, there's never a guarantee that you'll get all or even a section of your data back, but it is certainly worth a shot. I'm not positive of the specifics on AVI files exclusively, but most Quicktime codecs are supported by Media Salvage through Digital Rebellion.

I always see these posts that read ""Check out this awesome thing!  Can you believe our friends didn't know what it was?""

Actually, no.  I can't believe it.  Who are these 'friends' of yours if they can't recognize things you're into?  I don't expect your cursory acquaintances to be able to read out your entire music library or something, but they should be at least in the same ballpark.  

Doubly so for this particular post, the only people I know who wouldn't get this Spongebob reference are republicans over the age of 75.

I guess if you think meditation is something you do for its own sake, then that doesn't matter. OTOH, the TM definition of enlightenment concerns stabilization of the ""pure consciousness"" state outside of meditation, and tradition (and research) says that attempting to hold on to that state is counterproductive.

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","On the subject of Modern Military Shooters...

I've always liked them. MOHAA was the first online game I played.. I actually started with LAN parties before I had decent internet.. then I went to college in 2003 where I could play online... I fell into a clan and have been playing with them ever since. (Always playing no-respawn modes like S&amp;D... pretty much exclusively)

We don't just play shooters anymore but mostly shooters. We kind of grew out of COD after COD4... COD:WaW and Black Ops kept us mostly entertained with zombies, so they don't even really count. But helped us transition into playing a lot of Killing Floor and L4D2.

After COD4, I would only play COD with friends.. preferably pubbing around until we could find a scrimmage. ""Pubbing"" I found to be irritating to play and really just wanted to get into a scrimmage.

As of now I play a lot of BF3. We only pub around because of the scale and we only have a COD size number of people... 4-6 people. But even in BF3, I hate playing by myself, but LOVE playing with 3-4 people in a squad working together.

Right now, I'm having a lot of fun with MOHW multiplayer and disappointed with the reception its received from critics. I've listed out reasons why I prefer it to recent Call of Dutys:

&gt; * Recoil. You need to burst fire, and aim well in MOHW. Thats not appealing to the masses of people who just want to spray bullets around.
* Map Design. Criticized as being ""generic maps"" these maps take a much needed step back from recent Call of Dutys.. MOHW maps are small, but have a lot of elevation/open space mixed with Close Quarters. Balancing them for all classes and tactics. While recent COD is now just a circular, labyrinth of close range run-n-gunning. MOHW is more reminiscent of older, better, Classic COD style maps.
* Fireteam - Promotes teamwork, while COD's labyrinth maps promote individual Rambo style play. Fireteam also helped slow the pacing down. Working together with somebody keeps the movement slower, more tactical...
* Hardcore Mode - COD has no recoil, and close range maps.. so hardcore COD feels more like ""easy mode"". 1 shot 1 kill at close range, makes it a game of chance in who saw who first because you don't even need to aim, or think because the whole match is a mindless scramble for kills. MOHW on the other hand, took away the HUD and helpful UI elements as needed but didn't do much for bullets.. meaning you still need to aim to Kill. I prefer this hardcore mode because its actually harder... and not just who shot first.
* Melee - Its back to COD1 and COD2 melee where you actually needed to sneak up on somebody... and in MOHW GUN BEATS KNIFE in a fight. Recent Call of Duties are a joke with melee.. Ninja-sprinting-knifers running around knifing you from 10 feet away as you shoot bullets into their chest. No thank you.

In MOHW, its also not so much the COD experience where I feel I need to be in a scrimmage... but more like BF3 where I *need* a full squad to enjoy it... but in MOHW.. I only need 1 friend for my fireteam, or 1 team-friendly, cooperative ""random.""

I don't enjoy MMS as much as I did during MOHAA and COD2... but I've also gotten a lot older, and have a lot less time.. with a job, I also play a lot bigger variety of games, but shooters are always my fallback, go-to games to play. I think I keep buying, because I think back to the MOHAA and COD2 days where I put a lot of time into practicing... to the point every inch, step, and grenade throw was memorized... every spot people could be hiding... I didn't really want that anymore. I wanted to play more and more maps. New ones we didn't memorize like that.

Singple player MMS, may be at this point repetitive been-there done that, or done that better elsewhere... but I don't care. I haven't played one since COD4. Even then I was spending 95%+ time in multiplayer. Its where I had the most fun, made the most memories... and in clutch situations got my heart rate going. I will probably keep going back to MMS's until they no longer do those things to me... (In normal ""pub"" situations, they do not. I do not find them as intense as being the last man alive on a team in a no-respawn mode scrim/match... and when I can kill the last few people by myself.. it just makes the games' moments worth playing)","1351729206"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Aha! I admit it! It's evolution. Much like potential energy and kinetic energy are both energy! They're just energy so lets shut up and not look at the details, right? It hardly matters that they are essentially opposites, we should not argue the semantics and just look at them as one thing, because that's what intelligent people do right? Blindly accept things and not look any deeper than the thinnest portion of the surface.


They are opposite situations, there is value in looking at both separately. I can tell you, artificial selection almost never happens in nature. Humans actively do it, to look at it as a ""component of evolution"" is really not something you should do. It's more of an exception, a very special situation.


 The components of evolution in the wild are basically: natural selection, sexual selection, and genetic drift, and all the sub-components that fall into those categories. There is not ""artificial selection"" on there, it is not a ""component"" of evolution as has been said a few times before, more like a special situation where there is extreme manipulation of the three categories I mentioned. 


Look, maybe you view this as semantics, but it's really not. It's an important distinction to make since the implications of natural selection and artificial selection could not be more different from one another.","1351729207"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","A proton has zero electronic energy, of course. (And electrons are being removed from the water to produce O2). If you look at the total reaction of PSII is: 2PQ + 2H2O --&gt; O2 +2PQH2

The right side of that balance has a greater electronic energy, which is why it requires the addition of energy from photons. 

But if you want to look at it in more detail, each time a photon hits the thing, an electron gains energy, and then loses a bit of it as its transferred to PQ, which picks up a proton to balance the charge. The active site then grabs another electron from a cluster of manganese atoms, which are binding water. This repeats itself 3 more times until the manganese cluster is so oxidized that it has enough redox potential to take four electrons from water, forming O2 and four protons. (although the jury's still out a bit on the exact sequence of events here) The electrons actually lose some energy here too. They lose energy in every step except for the photon absorption. But the total result is an increase in electronic energy.

You seem to be thinking in terms of 2H2O --&gt; O2 + 4H^+ ; which is obviously an unbalanced equation. You have to include where the electrons are going.

As for the second one, it depends on the context. Anything can be unhealthy when eaten in excess. But it's totally wrong to blame a single food such as sugar for all kinds of ills.

In general, it's best to just ignore all kinds of extreme statements such as ""sugar is poison"" and ""saturated fat will give you a heart attack"" because the extreme views are rarely right.

Say a private liberal arts college has a $40K price tag...unless it's an elite school it's discount rate is probably in the 40% range or even higher. If it's 40% that means the *average* student pays only $24K for tuition. But of course there's not really an average student-- if they enroll 2,500 students there are probably 2,400 different prices being paid. Those at the top end of the range (and especially those paying full price) are subsidizing the other students. Those who are receiving large amounts of institutional aid (grants and internal scholarships) are paying less than the cost of delivering their education.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I've heard many christians claim that there's a distinction between ""moral, civil, and ceremonial laws"", but not one has ever been able to give me a straight answer about how they tell the difference between the three. It's clearly about what they find personally distasteful or silly, but admitting that that was the case would rather undermine their positions, so don't expect them to admit it.
Apart from a few commands which were explicitly intended for a specific people at a specific time, there is absolutely nothing to indicate that most of these laws weren't supposed to be binding for everyone for all time. Indeed, in many places (See Leviticus 23:21, for example), it's explicitly stated that they *are*.

Remember, many Christians find it more comfortable to believe in a god who doesn't condone, command or commit murder, slavery, rape, child abuse, animal abuse, arson, torture, ritual mutilation, fratricide, patricide, matricide, infanticide, genocide, and so on than to believe in one who does.
Unfortunately, since the Bible (Old Testamant and New) is pretty clear about Yahweh's position on these things, holding a belief in Loving Hippie Jesus™ requires ignoring huge portions of it. Or just never reading it in the first place, which seems to be the most popular option.

Well, let's see what Jesus has to say about that:

&gt;“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.

(Matthew 5:17-18, NIV)

Some Christians claim that his death and resurrection ""fulfill"" this. That is bullshit for one simple reason: last time I checked, Heaven and Earth haven't passed away.

Jesus also made his views on people ""picking and choosing"" quite clear:

&gt;[Jesus] answered them, “And why do you break God’s commandment because of your tradition? For God said:
   *Honor your father and your mother;* and, *The one who speaks evil of father or mother must be put to death.*

&gt; But you say, ‘Whoever tells his father or mother, “Whatever benefit you might have received from me is a gift committed to the temple”—  he does not have to honor his father.’ In this way, you have revoked God’s word because of your tradition. Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said:

  &gt;These people honor Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.
 They worship Me in vain, teaching as doctrines the commands of men.”

(Matthew 15:3-9, NIV)

 Looks like Jesus has quite a bit to say about people who ignore commandments, in fact. But maybe it's just Matthew?

&gt;It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.

(Luke 16:17, NIV)

Okay, so Jesus is a bust. Let's see what the Epistles have to say about the Mosaic Code:

&gt; If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, “Love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing right.  But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 

(James 2:8-10, NIV)

&gt;All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

(2 Timothy 3:16)

&gt;Do we, then, nullify the law by this faith? Not at all! Rather, we uphold the law.

(Romans 3:31)

&gt;Know this first of all, that *there is no prophecy of scripture that is a matter of personal interpretation*, for no prophecy ever came through human will; but rather human beings moved by the holy Spirit spoke under the influence of God.""

(2 Peter 1:20-21 NAB)

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Even if it detrimentally affects fitness, it can still be selected for insofar as it can (and plausibly does) further the propagation of your genes.  For example, your siblings statistically share 50% of their genes with you; from the genetic perspective, all other things being equal, dying in order to save 3 of your siblings is a desirable outcome.  A gene that encodes for this behaviour will thus tend to further its own propagation (to put this another way: will have an evolutionary advantage).  A gene that makes you more likely to sacrifice your life for several of your siblings might plausibly be non-specific enough as to result in other altruistic behaviour.

What you suggest is that it's ok to put up with other people's bull shit and they should just be allowed to continue to do what they do so then next guy who she kills or injures deals with it. You're also implying that its ok to not speak up when you see something wrong. Fuck that. Too many riders have been killed because of this exact situation, I'm saying something.

Second, I didn't confront her, she confronted me after we went our separate ways on the road. She wants to talk about how angry she is that I flicked her off? Good, I wanna talk about how angry I am for almost getting killed.

Part of a relationship is compromising for your partner, so even if I personally preferred my armpit hair for instance, so long as it wasn't an absolutely massive deal, I would compromise with her wishes.

So some people go with their religion, others go with love, reason, the universal human bond, or just the power of the group helping each other stay sober. So it doesn't matter much to me what others use, because I use what I use. It works for them, it works for me. But that's part of the process of getting sober, I think - recognizing that the super-religious guy, though he may not be a close friend, could say just the thing to keep you sober that day. And vice versa. The more you're around it, the easier it gets. Also, not sure if you've read it but Augusten Burroughs' ""Dry"" is a great memoir on getting sober in meetings, written from a gay male perspective. I thought it was a great read, and I'd definitely recommend it!","1351729249"

It's a lot more hectic than punt/kick returns, and all it takes is a nearby offense player to make the tackle before the defender can get open space to the endzone. Sometimes there's no one nearby, sometimes everyone is nearby.

Take for example JPP's interception return this sunday. It was a screen play by the Cowboys, and JPP read it well. When he intercepted it, the Cowboys linemen were getting ready to advance to the 2nd level to block, so when JPP snatched the ball out of the air and began to run, no one was near to make the tackle.","1351729257"

The theory was that if you could seed intense thunderstorms in the area around the eyewall of a hurricane, you could cause a new, wider eyewall to form, which due to conservation of angular momentum would result in a wider storm with weaker winds. However, even though they were successful in achieving this (though controversially so), scientists soon discovered that this was actually a natural process that hurricanes undergo anyway, known as an [eyewall replacement cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewall_replacement_cycle). This finding, coupled with the realization that with the predictive abilities of the time (and even with today's, or the *forseeable future's* predictive capabilites) they could not know if their change to the structure of the storm could cause the storm to shift course, hitting an area that wouldn't have otherwise been hit, which would have **drastic** implications, especially if it hit another country, led to the discontinuation of the program.","1351729258"

"science","t5_mouw","1) Roman concrete was not stronger than modern concrete.  Nor is strength the only criteria for choosing a concrete mix.

2) Roman's didn't reinforce their structures, so they never put the concrete in situations we put it in.  At the same time if we didn't reinforce structures we wouldn't be able to build concrete structures of the size we do.

3) The great majority of the stuff made from roman concrete doesn't exist anymore.  the few buildings/bridges remaining are usually heavily checked and maintained if needed.

4) we could absolutely build the pantheon today, easily, without reinforcing.  It's just stupid to design that way.  Why would I use concrete in tension when its at its weakest that way?  If it failed it would fail without warning, unlike steel reinforced concrete.  I'd rather reinforce it.

I imagine a child, kidnapped at birth, locked to a table and kept alive by machines against their will. This seems really shitty and coerced, but not unfair. If our society allows for the assailant to exist we are accepting that one will eventually exist and thus a child will fall victim.

Additionally, germinating barley gives off A TON of heat and ruined my fridge (it was 140F in my fridge before I abandoned it). Anyway, here's the [book](https://rapidshare.com/files/1094896735/Barley%20and%20Malt.pdf).

I just got power 4 hours ago, got home about an hour ago. I've been going to my grandmas for water/civilization everyday for a couple hours, she lives a 30 min walk from me.

During the storm, we smelled fire, so I checked out and some people in the building and I went floor by floor checking for fires, all 26 floors. Nothing was found, so it was coming from the outside. The next day, my block had no damage but the blocks around me were under water. There were Mercades, Maseratis etc on the street covered in water. At the canal 2 small sail boats broke through an wooden bridge and were leaking diesel. It was intense, now theres looting going on at coney island, and the area seagate is basically underwater. We lost water and power for 3 days, but had natty gas though so we were able to cook. Theres no order in Brigheton beach, only the liquor stores are open now.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","See, this is where Morello's nerf-biased strategy is actually paying off. Compare LoL's design to DOTA2: modular versus integrated. 

DOTA2's balance is dependent upon full availability. Their individual heroes would be incredibly OP if transcribed into LoL mechanics and stats, but are balanced against each other - they're in an integrated deadlock that still allows for competitive play and counterpicks *so long as the full roster is available*. 

LoL champions are underpowered in comparison, but are more modular in design. While you still want a large roster, it mostly doesn't matter what specific champions are in your stable. While it's true that Ahri counters Karthus, for example, you don't *need* to own her (or Karthus) to be able to play midlane. At least in solo queue, you can get by with Annie alone, or anybody else - it's more a matter of understanding lane dynamics and gameplay mechanics than *individual champion* mechanics. 

So, let's project that ten years on. Let's even assume that the roster is now deep to the point of absurdity (which doesn't seem likely - there's going to be a cutoff point, if only due to their design team's wariness of excess burden of knowledge, and it's just a matter of how it's implemented). Bans might be increased, but will play be any different?

No, not really. A modular approach to design makes for less depth, but allows for more constant iteration. /u/Silfurstar's [post on champions by IP and release year](http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/124min/is_new_always_better_champions_popularity_and/) indicates no strong correlation between increased champion population and popularity - while that is far from the only factor to consider when forecasting LoL's future, it does at least mean that Riot isn't necessarily pressured to constantly churn out champions - and if they do, even ten years from now, their design approach mitigates balance issues.","1351729278"

* [Roy Montgomery - Scenes from South Island](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWZujXuKm5w) Great solo acoustic psychedelia. Other albums may have better tracks, but this one is quite relaxing.

* [Flying Saucer Attack - Chorus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcAhNt5pm6Y) a hodge-podge collection, but one that works rather well. Otherworldy lo-fi.

* [Black Angels - passover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZYkI__-szU) easily one of the better new psychedelic bands.

* [Mazzy Star - So Tonight I Might See](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlqgTDXEcmE) Wrongly lumped in with Shoegaze. A fuzzy version of Twin Peaks' blues noir.

* [Comets on Fire - Avatar](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mS6qdUfFCV8) I like it better than their noisier material.

* [Wolf People - Steeple](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyY3WasbTFE) Closer to Cream-like Psych-rock. Instead of fawning over Tame Impala's over-rated Innerspeaker, people should've been listening to this instead.

Get Ultimate.

You could jump up to a 7970.  You could get a better SSD, such as the Samsung 840 Pro.  You could get a bigger SSD.  You could get a better case.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","The issue is it takes time for teams to create a good foothold, anywhere between 5-10 years. The Panthers have been crappy, so attendance was down for the longest time, as they aren't the Leafs or Habs. But their attendance was up this year due to playing better, and new ownership. 

It costs a lot to move a team, and it's a large hassle, as seen with the loose ends that Winnipeg is still dealing with (most notably travel, since they are still in the Southeast division). 

Generally speaking, all leagues don't like moving teams because of the greater influence it'll have on the local community. Many people lose their jobs, and the local community loses a marquee sports team (regardless of how the team plays, it's still the highest level of hockey). Moving a team is generally the last option, barring crooked ownership, which was [why Jim Basillie wasn't granted ownership a while back, despite having the money](http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/06/15/sp-coyotes-balsillie.html) 

Key Arena is looking more at the Sonics, not a hockey franchise at the moment. 

You do have to realize that Canada isn't a safe haven either, while the economy is better now in Canada in relation to the US, a down economy can crush teams too, which was why Winnipeg and Quebec City lost teams in the 90s. ","1351729300"

"conspiratard","t5_2r2dd","That's far from true. The major resistance reports came from one man, Wiltold Pilecki, who reported mass killings and atrocities throughout 1940-43 and whose reports were initially laughed at by the allied powers. The rest came from information smuggled to the Poles in Krakow, whom also seemed to think the reports were mind-boggling and unreal until they had gotten the chance to see the camps in reality at the end of the war. Additionally, to say that the camp was ""infiltrated at all levels"" is highly disingenuous. There were resistance operations at the location, but those operations were confined to Birkenau for the most part, and in particular the prisoners in the camp. The resistance fell apart when the SS began actively finding and killing Poles who were part of the resistance in early 1943. Wiltold Pilecki, the guy I mentioned earlier, was forced to break out of the camp and flee for his life. He told the allies again what was happening and they thought he was bullshitting them.

All told, most historians agree that somewhere between 1 million and 2 million people total died at Auschwitz. According to Rudolf Hoess' post-trial writings, he believed that something like a fourth of the people who were reported to his officers dead at Auschwitz died of ""natural causes"" (like starvation, overwork, disease etc.) and the rest were killed. There is a huge amount of testimony from the prisoners forced to clean the corpses from the gas chambers and those who participated in cremations and other hard labour at the camps that the gassings happened.

If anything, the only questionable part about Auschwitz was the report by the Soviets that 4 million people died there, but literally no credible western historian has believed that since 1950. The post-Soviet plaques at the camp have been revised to say 1.1 million total killed, a very conservative estimate.","1351729302"

Death Wind resolves, turning your Mogg Flunkies into a 0/0. Before Elemental Mastery can resolve, state-based actions are checked - Mogg Flunkies is sent to the graveyard for having 0 toughness.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I discuss this a bit in a previous question, this was essentially the process: traditionally nonwhite groups, Southern Europeans, Slavic peoples, Irish American and even Jewish Americans, which movements such as the Know-Nothing movement fought agains, claimed their ""whiteness"" through the opposition of and identification from other ethnic groups such as African Americans in the mid to late 19th century. They did this through the political process, through upholding WASP racial relationship norms and through actively espousing racist rhetoric. By the end of the 19th century and and the start of the 20th century white America perceived, but more importantly these Southern European, Slavic and Irish groups saw themselves as white. In essence, they ""claimed their whiteness"", to steal a phrase from [Roediger](http://www.amazon.com/How-Race-Survived-History-Settlement/dp/1844672751).

In regards to Jewish Americans, the effects of WWII, the conception of Americans as Jewish liberators, and the Yum Kippur War had large effects on the shifting perceptions of Semitism as group rather than a race, as you say. The creation of the liberator image in military culture in the postwar years creates a more paternal relationship when it comes to the mentality of Americans towards members of the Jewish community. Furthermore, the creation of a Jewish state, and the close diplomatic relations between the United States and Israel forces Americans to perceive Jewish Americans as not simply a race, but rather as actors, in some way or another, of a state apparatus. 

Edit: in regards to your last sentence, if you specify more, I would be happy to discuss the changing notion of race. It is dependant on a lot of factors, culture, politics, international diplomacy etc.

* How do you know your heart stopped? Did the docs tell you that? 
* Seizures have *nothing* to do with your heart. They have to do with the brain.
* Most common thing for getting too high too fast is loss of consciousness. That often has to do with blood pressure when cannabis is involved.

As gameryamen said, it might have been some serious impurity in the oil. But you're saying ""rather large hash bomb"", and for someone who smokes an ounce a week to say ""rather large""...sounds like the bomb all right.

If you're purely a recreational smoker, I seriously advise you to think about what this amount of weed might be doing to you.

I've never smoked an ounce a week, nor could I imagine doing it (I use weed constantly for medical purposes, but somewhat less...maybe 1/2 gram a week), but I *have* passed out from being too high and I *have* had my heart actually stop (not related to weed though).","1351729316"

So I make sure to keep a safe distance whenever possible, and be alert.  

Just as I take for granted people *not* being afraid of me, as a female - you take for granted *not* being afraid of so many others, as a male.  To generalize.

What I am saying is that I play hardcore. There aren't too many hardcore servers and people know which servers to play on. I continually see the same names of people that I have never communicated with in the same games. The issue seems to be admins on normal servers. I won't deny that there are likely butt-hurt admins, but as long as you play within the rules the server states and as long as you aren't violating EA/DICE TOS (base rape, spawn camping, intentional teamkilling), I have found that you generally don't get kicked.

Now, if you are talking shit to a guy who is an admin or sending them messages gloating, you get what is coming to you. There's no reason to do it. I can say that I have only been abuse kicked a few times, but that hasn't really happened on the hardcore servers.","1351729326"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Both the Democrats and the Republicans partake of far right ideology; averaging them just gives a nominally different, still far right, I don't even know what you'd call it, style? There is so little ideological difference between the Dems and Reps, I don't have any idea how people think a ""center"" between them would differ.

A centrist would inevitably fail because a centrist in this context is effectively just a far right winger, and far right policies don't work. They would also face the opposition of our very prominent overt American right, who would refuse to compromise, hastening failure, and then blame that failure on the country not being overtly right-wing enough. Sound familiar?

Some have argued, Paul Krugman for example, that Obama is indeed the centrist president so-called moderates have been wanting. How does he differ ideologically from the GOP line? Foreign policies are genuinely identical, ideologically; no one would dare suggest that any aspect of America's chosen course in the world is immoral (only honest errors of execution attributed to incompetence are fair game). Domestic policy, Democrats are in favor of the government existing to do something other than defense and justice; there is a difference there, but no one besides the craziest fringes of the superlative right wing, the American Libertarians, have ever taken the GOP's current stance a la Grover Norquist. But there is little ideological difference there, only a tactical one. Obama says government should offer social programs because the American Way is that we stick together. Romney invokes racial hatred of other nations (""Obama sold GM to Italians to make Jeeps in China""). Their conclusions aren't the same, but neither's ideological rationale contradicts Fascism.","1351729328"

A general rule for cheating: it is cheating [emotional, physical, or otherwise] if it is something you wouldnt want your partner to witness you doing. So in her case, she is doing something, texting a guy, and she doesn't want you to know about it.


This general rule only works when the supposed cheater actually has empathy towards his/her partner or actually cares about the relationship or upsetting his/her partner. Some people dont give a shit about hurting their partner, think they are never wrong, do whatever they want regardless of anyone else's concerns, and this would not apply in that case as they may not care whether their partner witnesses their ""cheating"".","1351729330"

And if you see the huszar on the picture, it is very likely that the sword should be in his right hand. Where it is. Were it flipped, the sword would be in the left hand.

The ""huszár"" (hussar in English) is a cavalryman (light cavalry). Etimology: it seems to be likely that the ""húsz"" (twenty) hides in the word, because King Matthias ordered that one hussar must be mounted per 20 sites. He was the king inventing this military unit.

If you want a famous Hungarian hussar, the founder of the US Cavalry might do: Michael Kovats (de Fabriczy).

You have been my greatest inspiration and example for becoming a musician and a producer. Your music has been a balm to me in times of sadness, and a stimulant for when I needed to focus on my study.

I have probably a thousand questions i'd love to ask you, but Im going to stick to just one:

Will you ever be coming to the Netherlands to perform here, or is such a tour abroad not something you are planning on?


As a closing note, i'd like to say:

Thank you, and I hope that you will never stop making your beautifull music.

I would also suggest doing something that takes more time and more mobility and no constraints such as blankets. By this I mean things like whip cream or chocolate syrup, put a little on her breasts and lick it off. 

You could also have her lick it off of your dick just make sure that if you are going to have PIV you wash it off so she doesn't get an infection.

My Final suggestion would be to use a blindfold with the syrup/whip cream, or just normal foreplay because it forces the other person to focus on the feeling instead of being distracted by your surroundings. ","1351729332"

"LibertarianDebates","t5_2tvku","Ah! This is actually a common argument from those who don't have a better understanding of the free market. It is impossible to ""force"" the free market on someone.

The free market is just a term for the lack of involuntary force on individuals. If I shoot you, I'm FORCING harm or death on you. But if I DON'T shoot you, you could hardly say I'm ""forcing"" life on you! The free market is the default. It's not a system; it's what's there if we remove all systems.

Consider two countries. One is a complete socialist state, the other is a supremely minarchist state with zero government interaction with the economy. A group of people in the socialist state decide they want to keep what they earn, not have it controlled by the state. A group of people in the minarchist state decide they want to pool what they produce and distribute it according to their philosophy. Which group will be allowed to do so? The socialist state will, MUST stop their dissenting group - they must FORCE socialism on those people. The minarchist state couldn't care less - it's your money, you can voluntarily organize yourself to spend it how you like. The only thing you can't do is force that on non-volunteers. See, the free market isn't ""forced"" on anyone. ","1351729333"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","For a moment, let us define speech. ""The expression of or the ability to express thoughts and feelings by articulate sounds."" - does that definition work for you? 

Accepting that definition, speech, in fact, stops being speech when you fail to express your thoughts and feelings - such as when you are drowned out by a mob. 

Regardless, you really aren't understanding the point of the word ""freedom"" it doesn't mean an absolute capability to do anything - there is no context where you can use the word freedom and that freedom would be absolute. Go ahead and try if you want. Just like your freedom of religion doesn't include the freedom to sacrifice children in the name of the FSM. 

And it is ridiculous to assume that the labeling of speech as such is Orwellian - the founding fathers were not trying to deceive people into thinking they had freedom of speech when they did not - they simply didn't mean the thing you want it to mean. 

No freedom is absolute. None. It isn't black and white. There is a difference between your movement being restricted a little and a lot, for example. This is what is meant with the establishment of freedoms - that they do not override the other freedoms they are given, because no freedom is absolute.

I will break up with her soon. I love her very much but, I know deep within she doesn't feel the same...at some point she also said ""i don't know"". She has helped me as well...by making me see I had problems I had left unattended (something I did too with her), and she convinced me to seek help, but in the process, in the fights she stopped loving me.

Maybe it's hard what I will tell you but here it is: you have to move on with no expectations. right now My mind, too, is trying to convince myself ""maybe on the long run she'll change, she'll love me one day"" truth is that that doesn't depend on you or the circumstances (i.e. stress) it depends on their own personal growth and maturity and these things often take a lot of time. If you keep dreaming he will comeback to you with renewed lasting love you will only risk yourself at some serious and probable disappointment. You have to let go, convince yourself...and I know it hurts (that's why I haven't been able to break up with her) but it's better for you. ","1351729340"

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","The USDA zones aren't really a scientific definition, they're just a seat-of-the-pants, best-guess estimate, and as such don't really belong in an entry striving for technical and scientific accuracy. And they're exclusively a U.S. thing, and so aren't applicable to the other 90% of the world that uses Wiki.

Also, USDA zones when applied to plants aren't carved in stone--a plant that is considered by one authority to be hardy to zone 4 can turn out to not be hardy for you in zone 5.  There are a lot more variables that determine whether a plant is hardy to a certain low temperature than merely the temperature itself--there's the plant's maturity, and whether it's mulched, and whether it's sheltered by a large building (which retains heat), and whether it had a stressful growing season, and whether it's newly planted or has been there a while.

So, all in all, the USDA zones just aren't scientific enough for Wiki.

"estimation","t5_2uh0h","From [this website:](http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa101697.htm)
&gt;Parker black ballpoint pens will produce more than 28,000 linear feet [8534.4 m] of writing -- more than five miles, before running out of ink.

And [this website:](http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/IgorFridman.shtml) claims the total surface area to be about 1.8 m^(2).

If we assume the diameter of a ballpoint pen dot is 1 mm, and the packing efficiency is at a maximum [\(0.907\)](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CirclePacking.html), then:

          Area of one dot = pi*r*r
                          = pi/4 mm^2
                          = 0.785... mm^2
                          = 7.85 * 10-7 m^2

              Dots needed = 1.8 m^2 / 7.85 * 10-7 m^2
                          = 2.29 * 10^6 dots/person (without packing efficiency)
                          = 2.53 * 10^6 dots/person (including packing efficiency)

    Maximum dots of 1 pen = 8534.4 m * 0.001 m
                          = 8.534 m^2
                          = 1.08 * 10^7 dots/pen

           Number of pens = 2.53 * 10^6 (dots/person) / 1.08 * 10^7 (dots/pen) 
                          = 0.234 pens/person
                          = 4.26 people/pen

So there you go. About 2.5 million dots. That means a quarter of a pen will be (roughly) able to cover a person. That means you'd be able to do about 4 people per pen.","1351729348"

(A) the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, and is the paramount and most fundamental right of a person; and

(B) the life of each human being begins with fertilization, cloning, or its functional equivalent, irrespective of sex, health, function or disability, defect, stage of biological development, or condition of dependency, at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood; and

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","So a victim of rape *must* have some sort of evidence that they were raped?  You do understand that rape is about power, not sex.  A gun to the head or a threat that the victim will be killed if he/she doesn't obey is often enough to perpetrate a successful rape.  No bruises.  So then the rape shouldn't be prosecuted?

And what stupid rapist is going to text apologizing afterwards?  Very rare.

And how many times have you gone to a bar and noticed, with 100% certainty that someone is drunk?  You don't need *extreme* intoxication for rape to occur, either.  And that might not be noticeable.  So the rape then shouldn't be prosecuted?

Punishing the innocent is definitely worse than letting the guilty go free.  However, have you looked at the stats?  False rape allegations are extremely rare.  They occur and those who make false allegations should absolutely be punished extensively.  But do you have any idea how many rapes *aren't* reported because the victims are afraid no one will believe them?  Because of people like you?  

It does take more than ""Yep, he raped me.""  Jury.  You have to convince a jury.  The jury, I assure you, is MUCH more concerned with making sure not to punish an innocent someone for the rest of their life than they are with making sure a proper conviction is made (I'm in law school, I've read the reports).

You are wrong.  And I sincerely hope you are never raped and forced to listen to someone say, ""Oh, no bruises?  No proof that you were drunk?  No text message?  We're not going to prosecute him then.  Hopefully he's not someone you know and see often.  Good luck with everything.""","1351729351"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","What do you do in zazen apart from just sitting? (serious question, I'm curious)

In Tibetan Buddhism there is the concepts of various yanas that you use according to your disposition and current possibilities. For example if someone wants to do dzogchen (quite similar to zen practice in many aspects), but wants to get ""something"" out of it, he will probably be told to downgrade to a gradual practice with a goal, such as attention to breathing (where the goal is generally to settle the mind in concentration). So you might get inspired by this and altern between goal oriented practice, and complete surrender.

Generally when I have the same issue as you do (quite often recently), I first take the mindset that I am trying to lose something, rather than gain something, then I try one of the following:

- Pushing through and sitting for longer than usual, like one hour in plain normal state of consciousness, doing nothing. Once I have sat on the boredom and frustration the mind gives up, and I can be fully present. Should be the only technique really, but sometime I can't for lack of time or will soooo...

- Breath counting. Old recipes work wonders, it is very rewarding and I can get quickly results in terms in calm and presence, that helps to relieve the frustration


- Discursive thinking ""what am I expecting exactly?"", a bit like in your edit but with complete discursive power, that's a real question after all. Not meditation but best done on a cushion for clarity.

- Invoke Amida or other supernatural being to the rescue with a mantra. Does not matter if you believe in whatever you think you should believe for this, just invoke away, people do this for a reason

- Theravada-like balancing of the ""negative emotion"" with a positive one

- Focusing on the energies in the body, accepting everything unconditionnally, including the energy of frustration. I know this sounds like hippie nonsense and has little to do with the various canons, but damn it works

- Watching the play of mind with the frustration, the conflict between ""I want to get rid of it"" and ""I am accepting it"", also ""there is nobody there"" yet ""there seems to be doing"", interspersed with ""who is doing the watching?""

- Being the watcher, like in the second gear of kenneth folk's 3 gears model

- Going back to watching the watcher over and over again. Requires a lot of mindfulness and energy but at some point the watching goes away

All of this to just sit in the end, most liberating thing. I wonder if someone else here uses such a confused and contradictory array of techniques? Anyway if you like the dharma consistent and straightforward, forget all of this, I do this precisely to derail the whole train of conceptuality. Hope that helps and good luck.

That is the decade in life where you have the smarts and wisdom gained from life thus far BUT you still have bags of energy, drive, and life to push and get things done.

The inadequacy of the public defender system is the reason why the Prison system is so taxing on our society.

*Edit: as an example, even middle class citizens would quickly be financially ruined if they had to fight a criminal legal battle. For your average felony, lawyers cost hundreds and sometimes even thousands of dollars AN HOUR. and what person wouldn't want to appeal a decision, especially if they're found guilty? That type of litigation will ruin almost anyone financially.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","Way too much to go into a whole lot of detail here.  Perhaps easiest to explain that my friend had a unique insight for a prospective recruit.  

Virtually his whole family was/is either in the military or on a police force.  For example, his father was a high ranking police officer who co-ordinated investigations (drug, homicide, etc.) between several different law enforcement agencies; and my friend actually had military experience (I believe he reached the rank of Lieutenant).

My friend, ever the skeptic, also did his own investigations into the culture of the various organizations.  He also managed quite a few ""ride alongs"", etc.

In the end, he decided against the RCMP.  As he described it, the culture there has degraded severely in the last while and he decided it would be in his best interest to serve elsewhere.

Note that this was _not_ a case of his not having the required skills.  He's fit, trained in various combat techniques, cool under pressure, a remarkably good shot (don't tell him I said that), has corporate management experience, is quite young, and quite skilled with various types of computer systems and networks (including security analysis and intrusion detection and mitigation).*

Honestly, I thought he'd be a better fit for CSIS than the RCMP, but he seems to have found a good home elsewhere.

The capital gain generated by an investor is made on the backs of other investors. The money changes hands between investors. The idea that investors are needed for business is outdated.  After the initial offerings the corporation has received all the investment funding it will.  The rest of the trading is merely passing money amongst the ""gamblers"" in the market.  Why do they deserve to pay less for ""gambling income""/capital gains than for the income that we all go to our daily jobs and earn?

*sigh* i just explained why the ideal doesn't validate the individual's actions and why the individual's actual goals have little to do with their behavior in this regard.
&gt;the only way to placate an activist is to be one, it seems.

i really don't understand where this is coming from.
&gt;It seems to just blame this nebulous concept of ""colourblindness"" as a whole for incidents of racism

let me point out the relevant section for you:
&gt;In other words, without a detailed and specific understanding of racial discrimination, children then just assume that it’s because individual Blacks and persons of color are entirely responsible for their subordinate status and have “earned” the scorn, prejudice, and hostility directed at them, not to mention being blind to the subtle privileges they enjoy as being part of the White majority. Ultimately, the assumption becomes, “Since American society is supposed to be equal, why aren’t you successful? What are you doing wrong?”

""Johnny hesitated. I could turn around now, he thought, and go home.  
And if I turn around, I'll never find out what happens next. I'll go away and I'll never know why it happened now and what would have happened next. I'll go away and grow up and get a job and get married and have children and become a grandad and retire and take up bowls and go into Sunshine Acres and watch daytime television until I die, and I'll never know.  
And he thought: perhaps I did. Perhaps that all happened and then, just when I was dying, some kind of angel turned up and said would you like a wish? And I said, yes, I'd like to know what would have happened if I hadn't run away, and the angel said, OK, you can go back. And here I am, back again. I can't let myself down.  
The world waited.  
Johnny took a step forward.""

These guys talk about ""normal"" shutter speeds, so for a 35mm film with 180° that's apparently 1/48s, which is the maximum that 48 fps can provide (Probably not a coincidence).

What I had been talking about is the largest time frame you could capture at any given fps. At 48 fps, it's 1/48; but like FodT said, there is some downtime in the CCD. That means that even though you're shooting at 48 fps, you're going to have to shoot at a less than 1/48 s shutter, so the motion blur will be less. I don't know how much less, it depends on how much downtime there is in the sensor.

To give you an example: I've been soloing C'thun every week since I reached lvl 90 with my Monk, for unaware people, the only way to solo him is by pulling in Ouro to his room in order for him to teleport you out of C'thun's stomach. However, if the tentacles in the stomach are not killed, C'thun has a 99% damage reduction shield. This leads to a very long fight, however, once C'thun reaches ~400k HP and I use Touch of Death on him, it still deals full damage equal to my maximum HP, instantly killing him through his 99% damage reduction shield.","1351729387"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Perhaps some of that is a bit out of context because before I was addressing a person who *both* had a reductionist view of Marxism *and* was actively anti-feminist. It seems that you just have the reductionist view. 

Listen, I understand the key importance of class struggle. However, I think it is clear that Marx, Engels and Lenin understood that the struggle for women's liberation must be advanced before, during, and after the revolution. In *addition* to, not instead of, class struggle.. 

Oppression of women predates capitalism -- it serves capitalism and has somewhat changed under it for sure, but it is not simply a product of it. We cannot expect to ignore the matter and have it go away when the revolution comes. 

&gt;do you think Marx would say that social progress could be measured in a bourgeois society that treats women well?

I would say that Marx would view this as progress. Anything that can remove one thing that pits the proletariat against itself is a good thing. This is also why Marx so much supported the end of slavery and a fight against racism under bourgeois rule during the US Civil War. He understood these things to be progress.


&gt;It's nice you took a seminar on Marx and feminism

This kind of childish condescension does not serve to create a productive discussion. Perhaps I have paid you back with my tone here, I'm not sure, but let's both make the effort to respect one another and not assume we have nothing to learn from each other. By the way, unfortunately, I have never taken a seminar on Marxist anything.


&gt; But where in Marx's writings does he endorse the progress of women's for women's sake?  Where does Engels say that gender equality is an end in itself? Where does Lenin say that we should set aside the struggle of the working classes in order to promote women's standing in society, for the sake of women qua women, and not as productive beings?

You act like it has to be either one or the other. Why can't there be a proletarian feminism, that recognizes the struggle for women's equality as *part* of revolutionary struggle? I of course don't advocate simply forgetting the class struggle -- you should do it informed by this. Lenin supported feminist movements and worked with communist feminists, like Inessa Armand. For specific citations beyond what I have given for Marx and Engels (which I still think serves to demonstrate they would agree) I would have to do some more reading. 

&gt;As I said elsewhere, you can prescribe a painkiller, but you have you to address the cause. 

And as I said earlier here women's oppression is not solely a product of capitalism, but women's liberation is something that would greatly aid in the overthrow of capitalism. 

&gt;Workers of the world unite

Indeed! Let's not belittle the struggle of feminists, *especially* Marxist feminists and the like, but instead realize their struggle is an important part of ours.

I ran a t-test comparing for the question of whether or not this year has significantly more punts blocked and got a t-statistics of 2.36 which equates to a p-level of .99, which would be interpreted by a layman as being 99% certain this year has statistically more punts (my words suck right now so people who've studied stats can definitely find problems).

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","There is no orb walking in League of Legends because we do not use the orb system.

Orb walking is abusing the engines limitations (you could only have one on-hit effect at a time, including lifesteal for range) because an affected projectile was labeled as a unique orb in WC3. By manually activating the orb you could nullify tower and minion aggro because they didn't expect them to have such a strong presence in custom games such as DotA (you wouldn't care about neutrals aggroing you in an actual WC3 game because all important units are controlled by players anyways.)

Jayce was animation cancelling / stutter stepping. The video you provided in a later comment is half wrong. Method 1 of his ""orb walking"" is obviously not that because you can see that the tower had set aggro to him through it. Method 2 was orb walking as none of the creeps dropped their preexisting threat table.","1351729403"

For instance, if you were to be awoken from deep sleep, and asked if you were dreaming, you would know, so there has to be some extent of awareness. 

To answer your question, I've heard numerous people say that they notice this after awakening, but I don't know how common it is. I don't think it's so much that they've developed an awareness that continues through sleep, but that they've become sensitized to the awareness that was there all along.","1351729404"

To quote Bloomberg: ""Icahn, 76, has a long history of building up large stakes in troubled companies and then pressing them to consider selling themselves, cutting costs or replacing top executives and board members. In many cases, Icahn has muscled his way on to the boards so he can be in a better position to promote his agenda.""

"CNC","t5_2ralu","nearly 10 yr vet CNC guy here. Here is a quick run down on how this industry is setup:

With a 2 year degree (as you are trying to go into) you should be able to hit the 10-12hr mark if you are really good and can impress during the resume. You can be on machines as soon as you start. Most shops hire people off the street to be the monkey who loads and unloads the CNC, and that will be you. Its a somewhat easy job depending apon the place. Other places it will be complete shit production runs in a shitty mom and pop shop and you will be stuck at $10 an hour for the rest of your career. You have to continually want to advance and continually want to learn to get anywhere. You will also have to leave shops every 2 years or so in order to do this and to get more money. You want to get into the big leagues, like Boeing, Toyota, Lockhead, etc. That is the only time you will make real money. In other shops, you may max out around the 18 mark in 5 years, then you will have to get into programming and that will max you out to around 25 (if you are lucky enough to get into it, its very difficult) But if you get into a larger corporation, you are looking at 50G-100G a year before overtime, and trust me, you will be working plenty of it.

As far as schooling, books pretty much suck. Its all hands on, and you need to befriend older machininsts and listen and watch how they do things. NEVER think you know how to do anything, even after 10 years, I still feel like a kid because of the amount of stuff there is to learn. I still dont know crap lol. PM me if you need more info, There is a lot I could say but dont really have time to write it all here.

 Easier said than done, but accepting both languages would create a lot more peace while keeping Montreal unique. Both sides need to stop pulling pussy fits.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","I'm naturally wide set. I'm also a 28F. So there's a decent amount of boob there. I can't cleave myself up unless I'm in the wrong size bra. The best ones I've found so far are ALL 32 band bras from H&amp;M. Their 32s all seem to run stupid small in the band. 30 band ladies, check them out. Seriously. They are cheap, and they run small. I have a couple in 32C that give me epic cleavage. Because they are what, like 3 sizes too small? but yeah, they work for that. Might work for you, too. 

As for scooping, YES! do it. Over time, I'm getting BIGGER. and more front and center. But still separate. And unequal. But that's me. I will say that I wore my 28G CK bra today and I just caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror. It's life altering-I can't believe how much better I look. HUGE difference. 

I'm thinking of trying Ewa in a closer size, but am so worried about ordering the wrong size. Ladies who swear by them, can you assist me in ordering? I want to make sure I don't make a mistake since the way they say to measure seems a bit off to me. I really want to support Ewa-I'm of Polish descent on my mom's side, and all I can say is that I look JUST LIKE THE MODELS. OMG. It's like a montage of my body at a variety of weight points. Strangest experience of my recent life, hahaha. Which makes me think the bras will LOVE ME FOR ALL MY LIFE.","1351729415"

Even though the humidity isn't as high as in other places, the fact that the temperature is so much higher makes the humidity more of a factor.

In other words, mere 30% humidity at 110 degrees feels like 122 degrees.  Meanwhile, 70% humidity at 90 degrees only feels like 105.

Even in early summer, when it's not so humid, heat exhaustion is a grave danger...you don't think you're perspiring, because the sweat evaporates quickly.  That's why emergency rooms in the desert are filled with newbies who don't realize they're sweating buckets and getting dangerously dehydrated.

Sadly, the game is very short storyline wise, but you can easily get lost mission by mission and spend hours doing one minor thing. The length of the game never really bothered me because the game was meant to be replayed many times, using different tactics each time.

"keto","t5_2rske","I've been here for about a year, and I've succeeded and failed at Keto twice. You are very correct in your assessment of the lifespan of this diet. How remarkable that you were able to vocalize it in such a coherent manner.

However, I would also like to stress that the reason why many people in the first few months suddenly become Professors of Keto is because there is this instance that occurs when everything suddenly makes sense, and you want to stand on top of the tallest building telling everyone that you've found the cure. I mean... I tried I can't recall how many diets, always failing, but when I found out about Keto it just all made sense. So, yes, I did want to go out and tell people, which was probably very zealot'ish of me. And yeah, I lasted 7 months this last time I went through keto, tried CKD and fell off the wagon. Carbs man... they are fucking addicting. I mean I was one of the hardcore guys who never had one cheat day, who felt that my resolve was completely absolute. However, those cheat days can really screw with your body and your mind. I really would not suggest them to anyone, but if you DO have a cheat day, make it a planned one. And don't go crazy. 

Yet, there aren't very many people who understand how the Ketogenic diet works, and are skeptical out of fear of the unknown. When you tell someone that you eat a high fat diet, you just know that their eyes begin to roll. It's so out of the ordinary that when you begin even describing the diet in the simplest, non-fear instigating manner, you can tell that you just lose people's interest. This is my 3rd attempt at Keto, and I have it down to an ALMOST science (I'm still trying to see if artificial sweeteners are impacting my weight-loss). I know what I can and cannot eat, and I'm pretty much finished with tinkering with the diet (CKD, cheat days, etc - the last two times through). And, hey, maybe it takes people a few times to fall off the wagon and get back on it to become strong. I know that my resolve is much stronger the 3rd time through than before. I no longer fear fat as I did the first time through Keto. I no longer crave or want cheat days like I used to (1st and 2nd attempt). Maybe three is my magic number, however - I no longer go around proclaiming keto. It takes too much energy to explain the diet to someone in a manner which doesn't scare them and makes them understand at the same time. I just point them to the proper resources (/r/keto and the sidebar resources) and I let them study it for themselves.

I think there are many people new to Keto who would LOVE for their overweight friends to adopt this diet, however it's not for everyone. My new girlfriend tried to start keto again this third time with me last week, but it affected her body differently than it did for me. She was eating keto properly and drinking enough water, however she was very moody and weak, and we decided that keto was not working for her. Keto is NOT the only diet that works, and it's far from a lifestyle itself. It can be used as a lifestyle, but most overweight people use it to lose a massive amount of wight, and then switch to paleo to maintain their weight, or try a new diet. I love the Keto community because all of you guys are some of the most creative, open minded and supportive people that I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. It's just that Keto is not an easy diet for everyone. For me, it was very easy for many, many months. Yet, I caved to the temptation of carbs. I am only human. So I will not knock or mock anyone who falls prey to the allure of sugar. It's a powerful substance, and that's why we are all here. To try and break the cycle of addiction to a substance that is so prevalent in almost every food in our culture.","1351729426"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;  My understanding right now is that this is not the case with OS X, so when you use the highest native resolution, everything will be very small

Since Lion, OS X has been (sort of) resolution independent, meaning all the UI elements can be scaled to different sizes so as to accommodate the display's resolution. In fact, if you buy a Retina MBP, you actually can't set the scaling factor to 1x in System Preferences (though you can in Terminal) for this exact reason.

Apple presents changing the scaling factor as making your screen ""like"" one of a series of pre-Retina resolutions so as to not confuse anyone, which has confused everyone.

&gt; As for clarity, it does make a difference, but is it worth the huge extra cost?

As someone who's a bit of a type nerd, I think it is. We currently have ""screen fonts"" that are designed to be displayed at 20px high, and ""print fonts"" that look good on paper. Now we're looking at screens with nearly 300dpi displays (the Nexus 10 is actually a little over IIRC), which is print resolution territory.

Maybe for others it isn't worth it, but I agree with Linus, and look forward to the day that there won't *be* an extra cost because every display on the market is like this.

As a side note, on that day, every website and program that isn't designed for resolution independence will look like crap to everyone, so many of the people buying the rMBP are the people responsible for those websites and apps.","1351729427"

Gaming is art, let's start here.

Playing games is another way of experiencing culture.

As for professional gamers, I again need to disagree. As mentioned, chess players, or professional poker players escape that stigma, even though poker boils down 'just' to knowing your statistics. You need a lot of skill and knowledge and multitasking to be any good at Starcraft. You need to train your peripheral vision, reflexes and movement patterns to be any good at Counter-Strike. There is a lot of problem solving going on in high pressure situations.

"baldursgate","t5_2t07j","""You make less per sale but more sales overall""

This is true, but think about all the companies that get a piece of this pie before BeamDog: Wizards of the Coast, Bioware/EA, Atari... all of these guys take a cut before BeamDog gets anything. These companies all want to make as much as possible from the hugely successful BG franchise.

While I can't tell you how much of a cut these companies will take, I can tell you apple will take a 30% cut from sales on the ipad. I would assume that's about the same cut Steam takes. Assuming those above 3 companies only take 10% each, that leaves only 40% gross profit for BeamDog, before any of their costs. That means going through steam means a 43% reduction in gross profit/unit assuming it's sold for the same price, and we know that most of the sales would be at a significantly lower price. 

They already have to make this concession on the ipad/mac/android, and while you could argue that means they could do it on PC as well, I think it's more likely that they're banking on making their real money in the PC market. The ipad and android are mostly ways to get multiple sales/person along with a possible word of mouth campaign, and mac aiming for an audience that can't use a PC.

Also yes, I am aware that there are order of magnitude increases in sales numbers for a price drop of about 75%, but that might not be enough to make it work. Assuming people purchase it at a price cut of 75%, then BeamDog is only making about 10% *gross* on what they would be selling through their own store. Would they be able to overcome that selling through Steam? I would guess yes, but I don't think it would be the slam dunk that many think it would be. In the end, if they get an extra order of magnitude they'd end up breaking even selling on steam, which doesn't make much sense for them when they can just wait and put it on there later.

As for pushing their client, yes, that was probably the main goal in the beginning, but now there's no need for any client. That means essentially no DRM... I don't quite get why people love steam to the point where they will choose it over a significantly lesser form (or even no) DRM... but such is the case of fanboys, I suppose.","1351729435"

I recently hit a personal distance record--I'll wait until the Sunday thread to brag about specifics, as proper runniquette dictates--and found that for the last three or four miles, I felt like absolute crap.  I had very little energy, and when I finally completed the run and started my cooldown, I could barely walk in a straight direction.  I suddenly felt famished, all at once.  As I will be participating in a road race at this distance soon, I was going to inquire as to how people carry quick shots of energy with them.  It was obvious going this distance without food would not be a good strategy in the future.

At any rate, thanks for inadvertently answering my question.  I'll have to pick some of these up to carry with me on my long runs.","1351729443"

I don't think it's a strawman at all. Scientists like Richard Dawkins draw metaphysical conclusions from their study of purely physical phenomena.

&gt;No, there are many pathways to truth.

Like?

&gt;If other worlds/realities/dimensions exist, we simply haven't found any evidence of them, yet.

I'd say Jesus walking the earth, claiming to be God and then rising from the dead is evidence of the divine.

&gt;That material world is* all that's important to scientific inquiry.

That's not what I said, however. It's the difference between saying, ""Nails are all that are important"" and ""nails are all that are important to hammers."" Of course the material world is all that is important to scientific inquiry. Scientism claims that the material world is that is important, period.

&gt;Actually, there is no evidence for the existence of anything supernatural, at least from a scientific standpoint. 

How would you go about conducting such a scientific study?

"DistroHopping","t5_2v71x","I'm an ardent KDE user (not to say I haven't lived elsewhere... I've also been known to spend time in Openbox, ratpoison, e17, and even Unity &amp; Gnome Shell, since I was originally an Ubuntu user), and I really must say, coming from Unity, there will be a lot of little things that trip you up that you don't even think about. In order to ease the transition, I would highly recommend going the route flipcoder suggests, and starting with Kubuntu, so that at least you'll feel familiar with the underpinnings of your OS.

To jump into your specific questions...
&gt; A) Does KDE seem to be a good cross-platform DE for visual appearance and functionality?

The answer is a simple yes. KDE is as cross platform as it gets; it will function without problems on every distro on the planet, and reaches into the BSD world as well. There's even an experimental KDE for Windows project. To the second part of that question, there may be many reasons to not use KDE, but visual appearance and functionality are not any of those reasons. KDE is arguably one of the most beautiful desktops, with a unified, consistent theme and smooth compositing. From a functionality standpoint, KDE is not disputably in an elite class. It's customizability is far above and beyond that of any other desktop right now, and it has countless numbers of widgets, ability to enable and disable individual desktop effects, transitioning between tiling or floating window management, a full application suite which integrates with the KDE environment and includes email, RSS reader, internet browsers, advanced text editing, calendars, email client, IM client, and just way, way too many applications to name. On top of what you install by default with the desktop, there are tons of other applications which are more or less blessed as KDE desktop apps which you can optionally install, such as Amarok (one of the most fully featured music players anywhere), KDevelop (One of the most lightweight IDEs available when used with the KDE desktop), K3b (A cd burning utility that blows anything Gnome has to offer out of the water, feature wise), and again, countless other applications I can't even name.

The point is [in case I didn't drill it in already :p] KDE is NOT just a DE; it's truly an entire desktop application suite that creates a fully featured desktop PC experience. Of course the beauty of it is, you can take as much of the application suite as you like and fill in the rest with other apps you love (For example, I'm not so big on the Calligra office tools. I prefer OpenOffice). But if you find yourself not liking very many of the KDE applications, you'll feel like the KDE Desktop is a burden on your machine that you'd rather shed in the interest of something lighter weight, written in GTK (i.e., XFCE).

Which brings me to my final point on this question-- KDE's reputation for being a resource hog did not evolve from mythology; KDE very much has the potential to be a very memory hungry desktop. However, my experience has been that this is entirely dependent on *how you use it*. To go more in depth:

After a few months of living in KDE, I noticed that my base desktop memory usage had slowly started to creep up, to the point where I was using 1.2 GB of RAM simply idling on the desktop. This was a major concern, because my idling memory used to hang between 0.9 GB and 1 GB. After checking out some memory usage info, I discovered the problem was mostly self inflicted. I always had kmail running in the background, monitoring 4 mail acconts, always had akregator (RSS) running in the background, parsing easily 50-60 feeds every 30 minutes (or less in some cases), akonadi had a whole host of resources I had created that I never set up or had set up but never used and had no use for, I was running two different activities (which is basically having two different desktops run at the same time which are configured for different workflows) which both had lots of widgets running, I had Kopete constantly running in the background with 2 or 3 IM accounts, and I had a fancier kickoff menu (the lancelot launcher) running, which consequently used more memory. My most surprising memory hog however was krunner (a pop-down bar which serves a similar purpose to the search bar in the Unity dash), which I found was taking almost as much RAM as the entire plasma desktop. Since I never used krunner to do anything more than launch applications, and I could do this just as easily from the regular kickoff menu (KDE's ""start menu"", if you will), I immediately disabled krunner.

After I fixed up a lot of those problems, and consolidated my email &amp; RSS notifications under one lightweight python applet, I was able to get my idling memory down to about 0.7 GB (sometimes fluctuating down to 0.6, sometimes as high as 0.8). This is right in the range of RAM usage users of the Unity desktop experience.

The very long winded message? KDE is as memory hungry as you let it be. Don't use apps or services you don't need to, and consolidate services under a single app when possible (this is good advice for any DE, but is particularly easy to get carried away with in KDE).

Oh yeah... you had a second question... lol.
&gt;B) What distros offer the best KDE integration?

Like myself and flipcoder were saying, if you're familiar with Ubuntu already, Kubuntu will be a comfortable transition. However, he's correct in that OpenSUSE would be the go-to distro for a top notch KDE experience (this is coming from a former OpenSUSE user). The packagin system is different from that of Ubuntu, and there are a couple other oddities which might throw you off (for example, /sbin and /usr/sbin are not in the sudoers PATH, so in order to execute commands like ""reboot"" or ""halt"", you need to use su -c ""halt"" instead), but all in all, if you're looking for an easy to use, top of the line KDE experience, SUSE is a goood selection. And ultimately, if you're looking to build skills that free you from Ubuntu dependence, its a good next stop, because they do have GUI tools for package management, but they make you take the step away from the Software Center (which is so beautiful and easy to use, that nothing resembling it can be found anywhere else in the Linux ecosystem :P).

You could also try a Shure SM58, which has slight tuning for vocals, but it comes with a molded grill that will more than likely get smashed as people knock it over in a classroom.

I was going to actually suggest you look into some piezo boundary mics. I don't know if you're only recording vocal overdubs with the mic (from your post?), or if you want it to capture the whole classroom.......And I also don't know if the preamp you are plugging the mic into supplies phantom power. I know the boundary mics are usually not dynamic, but they allow you to install them in a location where they wouldn't get stolen or perturbed much.

Also, realize that the ""noise"" you are picking up might not be related to dynamic/condensers. You might have the preamp set far too high and sensitive, and are getting spill. Also, hypercardioid mics will be more directional and have less spill......the noise in the classroom does not necessitate a dynamic mic.","1351729458"

Ratings show how many people in the important (read: product-buying, and willing to switch products) demographics are watching a show live.  This means they are likely to be watching the commercials that air during the show.  Networks sell commercial time during their shows to make money.  The more people that the advertisers are trying to reach watch a show, the more money they will pay to get their ads shown during that show.  

It's a fairly shitty aspect of the business of TV because it means that a bunch of great shows (like Community) aren't given a fair shot since they don't play down to the general audience and thus are seen as inaccessible, but that's how the business works.","1351729466"

The relevant statistic is the murder rate of trans\* people *above* the background rate, which then needs to be disentangled from correlating factors (for instance if trans\* people are more likely to be poor, then a portion of the increased rate is likely due to that). 

Essentially what I've done is shown that the values being chucked around are likely too low (since we expect an increased rate above background). And they should probably be cited.","1351729474"

Unless you really know your bikes and what suits you individually I would recommend going to your local bike shop. Ask them for a little advice on what would fit you and look at their prices. Explain to them your pricing predicament and they might be able to help you, I got my Caad8 £100 off because of a tiny chip in the paint, they just had it in the back waiting for someone like me to come along. 

If they have nothing for you I would then look into getting a used, but reputably branded bicycle. Have you checked if there is a bicycle recycling project in your area? You may be able to get a nice aluminium framed bike from there. Only after trying all of that would I consider looking online, it's very difficult to evaluate a bike if you haven't actually ridden it. Still look for used bikes though on ebay/craigslist etc as cheap new bikes really aren't worth it (in my opinion) and will leave you wishing you had saved up just that little bit more to get the next model up.

I'm only happy buying components and accessories online. That's what I think anyway haha!","1351729475"

It would be treated as a shrink-wrap contract (much as in the *Gateway* cases), which *can* be enforceable, but you should go read the actual cases.  There must be a period of time during which the recipient of the product may refuse and return the good.  A shrink-wrap contract cannot become enforceable at the moment of receipt of the good.

And the implied acceptance of a shrink-wrap contract comes from the retention of the good after being warned that keeping it for more than X period of time would result in acceptance of the terms.

**And** not many circuits have accepted that idea of a shrink-wrap contract being valid.  The Second Circuit (IIRC) rejected a two-week return period as being not a valid contract.

Furthermore, you have not established notice of anything.  In shrinkwrap cases, it is *impossible* to access the good without noticing the terms (which is why click-through agreements on software are more enforceable than ""the terms are in the box"" agreements).  Here there is no way to prove he actually saw the terms before taking the items.

There is no reason to get into unconscionability, it's not a contract.","1351729476"

Regarding the CPUs:

They both have approximately the same computation power per core in benchmarks. Only for highly threaded applications (video encoding, compression, etc.) does the 5800k really outpace the G530. For games (such as D3), surfing the web, office applications, etc., which aren't highly threaded (using at most 2 cores, and almost always just 1), they end up being pretty much equals because they have nearly equivalent computation power per core.

Regarding the GPUs:

The A10-5800k graphics is equivalent to a Radeon HD 7660D, and it requires some fairly fast memory as well. Memory and motherboards are just more expensive for the A10, and that's a problem for budget building. For ~$20 less than the cost of the A10, you can have a discreet Radeon 7770, which has about 3x the graphics power of the A10's 7660D. 

So, for $20 less, you drop some multi-threaded applications (which may just end up being able to use your graphics card anyways!), but keep the same computation power for the vast majority of applications, including Diablo 3, and then you also pickup 3x the graphics power. Noteworthy, the Intel + discreet GPU package also has huge upgrading options available while the A10 has very few.

Lastly, my suggestion is to build your own desktop PC which has the horsepower, and for mobility, pickup a netbook and run an n-lite stripped copy of XP or Lubuntu. That will cost you less than a single laptop which does what you want, and you'll get far more for your money.","1351729480"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","While that is true there are many religions that have no central god(s). Buddhism (the original Theravada Buddhism anyway) had no central gods, and was based around values and teachings found by the Buddha through meditation and introspection. He had stressed that he should not be worshiped as a god, where his title holds the meaning of ""The Enlightened One."" There are other religions that exist as religions without any types of gods, but the abrahamic religions all have one at their core so people will argue that to be a religion it must have one.

I may be paraphrasing a bit, but there was one historian who studied religions and tried to find what they all had in common. He found two thing:

""Belief in God if there be a God."" 
""Life is worth living - sometimes.""

This look like stamp collecting?

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2846656/

Part of the issue differentiating math and physics from biology is that math isn't even a science, first of all - it is highly RELEVANT to the sciences and an important basis of the sciences to a certain degree, but it is not a science.  Physics has a limited amount of crap to work with, and it focuses on very different things.  It focuses on forces, and it focuses on tiny elementary particles, and it focuses on the fundamental stuff of the universe.  I will not hesitate to say that biology and chemistry are in one sense derived physics, but that's not really a completely accurate description of biology and chemistry.

Chemistry, for example, is described well as a highly-derived physics.  Each of those atoms is a combination of particles and energy, and both of those fall under the realm of physics.  Except chemistry goes up to a greater scale and deals with the emergent phenomena that happen when there are interactions between conglomerations of these atoms.

Biology gets wackier yet when you have conglomerations of these atoms that order themselves into cells and self-replicating molecules and life.  There are biomolecules we don't know about and there are systems we don't even know that much about.  It's all a problem of scale.

Biology and chemistry use plenty of math in different subfields.  The problem with applying math to biology is that you have to know all the components of the system, and there are plenty of systems which we haven't accurately characterized yet.

Just because it's less ""pretty"" doesn't make biology any less scientific.  There's just a lot more work to do and a lot more complexity to sift through, and biology requires a slightly different context from chemistry, which requires a different context from physics.","1351729500"

If you're an agency working with larger clients, you'll have big 'website redevelopment' projects, absolutely.

For what it's worth, this is the type of work clients pay more for.

And, of course, the webapp side of things also covers working for companies that are building their own products.

There is already sectarian violence in Bahrain. The government's military and police are in large part Sunni immigrants from South Asia, and so immigrant workers have been targeted as loyalists. It seems significant to me to point out that this only started after the government seriously cracked down on protests, destroying Pearl Roundabout, outrightly killing protesters, and sending plainclothes thugs to attack them.

As for getting an abortion, good luck, I think that would be best. A pregnancy at 13 is dangerous, and as you said she isn't ready to be a mother.

If you can't get the abortion legally, then your best option is to carry it to term and then either have someone in the family adopt the child, or put the child up for adoption. It could be a weird situation with one mom young enough to be a sister (who is more focused on education, but is ideally still around), and two parents who are of a more normal age, but it can work.

As for her, make sure she gets to a good therapist. And be there for her without trying to push your ""comfort"" on her. She may want space, she may want a shoulder to cry on, she may want someone to talk to. Regardless, you should let her find how she wants to handle it (with professional help, and all the resources you can provide).","1351729507"

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","Friends and I had had some drinks in the city, and it was time to call it a night. We find a maxi to share with some other people heading in the same direction. They get off first, and give us the full fare to that point, sweet! 

We get to our destination, and the driver decides that it's the law that we must pay 2.5 times the full fare, being that we split. After a heated argument, we simply refuse and go to hand him the cash for what we thought the far should have been, and what was on the meter. 

This wasn't the end of it though. Before we could get out of the cab, he floors it! One of the girls in the back is flung around (she had stood up to get out) and hurts her hand quite badly. He was easily doing 80 in a 50km/h zone, and one of the guys in the back is on the phone to the police. He refuses to stop until he has to because of traffic. I yank the handbrake on and throw it in park to give us all a chance to bail!

We get back to our house and who's waiting there - the cab driver. Starts cursing us for not paying etc - at this point I hadn't given him any money (he took off when we tried to give him the original fare) and just wanted him to fuck off. He continually shouted that we were breaking the law, and I started to review the 'roadworthiness' of his vehicle. He was under the impression that it was OUR responsibility to ensure the cab was roadworthy, not his. We bailed inside the house.

About half an hour later I hear a knock on the door. It's about 4AM by this point and figure it must be the police. Nope, same driver. He decides to try and push his way through me and into the house. I'd had enough. I pushed him hard enough that he went down. I dared him, almost wishing that he'd try it again. He didn't, and finally took off.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","It's not foolproof because they can use God's omnipotence to subvert anything that you come up with. Most of them will probably concede that logic is a useful tool though. Even if they belief lots of crazy things about God they could probably be convinced that God wants people to use their brains to achieve his will, or something.

One argument that I like which turns Christian values on their head is to argue that true faith pursues skepticism. If you really believe in something then you won't hesitate to subject that belief to tests (especially if doing so would convert unbelievers or would give you rewards - make a bet with them or something, with the stakes being money or church attendance or whatever). If you don't test your beliefs, you can't be sure whether or not you really believe them or if you're rationalizing reasons that you shouldn't take tests and that you should continue to believe. Faith is strengthened by testing it in the forge of skepticism.

"botany","t5_2qrcz","And this is how a proper GMO discussion should go.   Facts and historical references that are realistic concerns the industry faces.

Entrenching ourselves in the current system of agriculture will occur no matter what, as family farms have long lost the skills, equipment, and fences to live 'off the land'

With the ease of 'Wal Mart' or raising chickens, most choose to keep their hands clean.   Additional food crops for large scale industrial farming would be great, but sadly so few work in a way that can be harvested and processed before the crop spoils.   It takes months of planning to keep a pea or sweet corn canning plant running at full capacity.

With streamlined production methods and distribution, those factories are too far and too few to give all farmers a third or fourth crop in the rotation.

With the price of canned goods already very reasonable, there is little motivation to grow that market more.  That is the downfall of any 'massive overhaul' of ag as we know it.  Subsidies are being cut year after year, and right or wrong switching to a crop that pays less per acre will kill off the last of the family farms.

No system is perfect, but corn, wheat, and soybeans can be harvested and stored easily and processed when needed, not when the crop demands it.  Until another crop can do those same things, that will be what is grown.

Weed pressure and resistance will always exist, but the one method it hasn't been able to overcome is steel.

But then we end up with erosion and top soil loss, so you end up back at square one.  Well, there is always regrowing the prairie and setting fire to it, but that would probably be brutal on our lungs.

This would seem to be impossible as I believe Winterfell was constructed long before the dragons were brought to Westeros by the Targaryens.  

If I'm correct, the only dragons presumed to have survived the Doom in Valyria were the Targaryen dragons, so the only way for dragons to emerge in Westeros is if the Targaryens brought them.

'unhealthy' food is generally high in calories with little to no fibre (pizza, ice cream), and a lot of sugar/salt, which hits pleasure centres in preference to actually supplying the body with nutrients it needs.

Accountability Partner Résumé

to mgende sent 55 minutes ago

Age: 21

Sex: Male, I know you were looking for a girl but I think I'll be alright, I've watched and enjoyed the Notebook.

Background: I currently weight 214 with 21% body fat at about 6'0 feet flat. I started my journey at somewhere around 265 had a really inaccurate scale at the time, I started on August 1st of this year so I've lost about 50 pounds in three months through willpower and about 1300-1500 calories a day, although it has been going a bit slower as of recent as I've been eating to my caloric max daily lately because I've been so busy and needing the energy. Before August 1st I lived extremely sedentary for three years and I've been overweight/obese since I was about 9 or 10 so I understand the wide range of insecurities and issues that many go through.
I'd like to have a partner to keep me going as well as I continue my training in not only becoming skinnier but healthy and fit. I have a few fitness goals I'd like to share with you as they leave me feeling focused and dedicated and maybe you could use goals of your own to do so.

1) Get down to 170 pounds with 10-12% body fat.

2) Be able to complete 25 pull ups, 200 sit ups, and 100 push ups in one sitting. I'm at about half of that right now, except the pull ups I'm only capable of three right now.

3) Complete the following adventure race: Run for your life 5K, Spartan Dash, Muddy Rudder, Color Run, and Tough Mudder

4) Run a half marathon, followed by a marathon and triathlon.

5) Be able to do a back flip, front flip, hand stand and cart wheel.

6) Climb a tree. (One I've wanted to do since I was a kid)

Those are a few of my main goals on my list. So as you can see I'm in for the long run and I know I'd benefit from having a partner to discuss these goals and my progression towards them with in the long term.

Do I say, ""Well, yes, my ancestors did own slaves, and they did start a terrible war so that they could continue to do so, and this was their flag.  But when I fly it, I mean the opposite of all that?""  

But beyond all of that, this got started because somebody said they had seen Confederate flags on the South Island.  None of that ""Southern"" heritage stuff like that applies, so it's more likely that it is being displayed as more of a racist/skinhead kind of thing.

You said it. *THIS* is the part that needs explaining. What a ""20% reduction in taxes"" means really doesn't need clarification, although you did explain it very succinctly, and thank you for that. 

&gt;Now the real question here, and the effects are truly unknown at this point, is how much of this money the average taxpayer will spend. If we assume they spend 100% of it, then the gov't will recover around 2% of the money in sales taxes.

Going down the rabbit hole are we? Making tax policy based off of speculation on citizen spending? Not a good idea. Maybe a businessman with the genius and experience of Mitt Romney knows how to treat this problem...but I've heard no convincing arguments -- no arguments at all really. I'm more interested in whether (deduction contraints)&gt;=(20% across the board tax cuts). Perhaps this calculation is more difficult for genius businessmen to make?

Also: you seem interested in fiscal multipliers as far as the money *saved* by low-income families via a 20% tax cut is concerned (i.e. how much will the government get it back via other taxes, for example) but you conveniently do not consider fiscal multipliers involved with ""broadening the tax base"". i.e. how much more revenue are you REALLY getting from that part-time McDonalds employee starts paying taxes instead of buying merchandise. If our tax policy reaches this level of nit-picking I move that it is not a sound policy. 

&gt;The rest of the tax plan is concerned with reducing the corporate tax rate

Everyone agrees this makes sense. But the reason we have high corporate tax in this country is that individuals do not want to pay taxes. This is a problem. A simple problem that is solvable using arithmetic. ...I was really trying hard to avoid the word ""arithmetic"" in this post, but I couldn't avoid it. My apologies.

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","Here is a well put together, succinct article on the subject of conscious, unconscious and subconscious:
outtake:
""Some people use the terms the unconscious and the subconscious interchangeably, but this is not accurate from Freud’s definition. Unconscious, first and foremost, does not mean, as it is used in medical terminology “knocked out,” and it doesn’t mean anesthetized either. Yet these ideas have a relationship to Freud’s conception of the unconscious.

In simple terms, the unconscious is the store of collected information that has been repressed and is not easily brought to the conscious mind. These memories not recognized by the conscious mind can be memories of trauma, or even simply memories, thought patterns, desires, and sense impressions that remain far below the accessible surface. Because they are in essence, inaccessible without psychoanalysis, they may drive and control the conscious mind on unseen levels. Much of Freud’s id and superego work in the background of the unconscious, creating illness, mental problems, neuroses, and a host of other issues.

The unconscious and the subconscious are vastly different, though non-psychiatric professionals often incorrectly use subconscious. In contrast to the unconscious, the subconscious mind lies just below consciousness, and it is easily accessible if attention is paid to it. For instance, you might know someone’s phone number. This information is not stored in your conscious mind, but in your subconscious. If you think about it, you can produce the phone number, but it isn’t simply floating around in your conscious mind. You need to direct your attention to memory in order to dredge up the phone number. Those memories you can recall easily are not conscious unless you pay attention and focus. When someone asks you to describe your perfect day, you reach into your subconscious mind for these memories.

However, if someone asked you to describe the worst day you ever had, especially if it was particularly traumatic, you might not really be able to describe the worst. You’d be able to discuss memories in your subconscious that were memorably bad, but a truly traumatic day could be in part, or completely repressed. In this way, one of the differences between the unconscious and the subconscious is that, at least in Freud’s estimation, the unconscious worked as a protecting force on the mind, even if this protection was wrongly guided. Really finding the most traumatic day of your life might mean significant therapy to access layers of memory buried away from both from conscious and subconscious, deeply hidden in the mind.""

He then proceeds to make these sort of comments for the rest of the 18 holes. ""That was a par 4 daddy. What did you get?"" ""8"". ""Wow, that's way too many daddy"".

"science","t5_mouw","Absolutely. Most people don't realize that there are three stages to stress in concrete design (which I'm totally about to unload on Reddit because I'm slightly drunk and happen to have my old concrete design notes handy):

Stage I: concrete/steel system is still ""elastic"" (aka, no cracks have formed, system is controlled by compression strength of concrete). Here, the forces on the system are so low that the compressive strength of the concrete is still strong enough that steel rebar is, theoretically, not needed.

Stage II: micro-cracks have formed, but system is in equilibrium, with compression equal to tension (the majority of systems). The forces on the system are enough that the rebar's tensile strength come into play, but the system has not yet yielded. At any point, the compressive strength is equal to the tensile strength, and the system is secure (albeit with micro-cracks).

Stage III: ""strength design,"" aka the point where failure is inevitable. This is sort of the ""breaking point,"" and this point is calculated so that the ultimate compressive strength of concrete will be equal to the ultimate tensile strength of the rebar. Past this point, the system will fail.

In other words, micro-cracks are not only inevitable, they are actually included in the design process. The bio-concrete just helps to fill the cracks, and prevent the quick corrosion of the rebar once it's exposed to the elements.","1351729538"

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","They didn't need the nerf, even at 30dex/str a decent scaling weapon would out damage them. Sure the elemental weapons would have a higher AR, but AR doens't mean that's the damage it will deal.  
  
Elemental weapons seem to have this stigma that they're the super OP or something, even at SL120 PvP level, which just isn't true.  
  
Their only advantage is at low level PvP in which case, yes, they're OP as shit. They really should have some form of scaling, not with an attribute, but with overall level maybe. So they still keep the benefit of only needing base level stats, but don't deal massively OP damage at low levels.  
  
&gt; I'm glad elementals got nerfed hard and people are finally offered a noticable incentive for upgrading specific stats to 40+   
  
There's no need to go past 40 in a weapon scaling stat. Only in Vit, End, Fai and Int (and then only if you need to to use spells/miracles).","1351729538"

When a call goes out and we need to get there fast I look at the location of the call, where I am in relation to that and what the safest most direct route to that location is. Yes; time of day, construction, traffic patterns, and urgency all are taken into account when choosing a route to the scene. But when it comes to freeway or surface roads safety is also a factor. My safety and my partners safety come first; no matter what...even at risk to the patients life/health.  If something happens to us on the way to the call then we become patients ourselves and cannot help anyone else and now another ambulance needs to come to us and yet another to the original patient, now extending the response time of to the patient.  By taking a crowded highway it is much safer than taking many surface streets with more vehicles moving faster, not paying attention and therefore more risk of greater injury ...not just to myself, but to the drivers on the streets, the pedestrians and even to the kids playing in their front yards in neighborhoods (running red lights, pushing cars onto sidewalks, driving against the flow of traffic, and driving faster in slower speed zones is all much more dangerous to myself and to the citizens than moving people stuck in traffic a few feet out of the way).


So basically it comes down to the debate of ""Do I need to get there possibly 2 or 3 minutes faster? Or do I want to take the safest path of travel for everyone on the road?""


And to the question of how pissed off do I get with road rage? The answer to that is VERY FUCKING PISSED! Just get out of my way! Turn your fucking music down, get off your damned cell phone, and look in your fucking rear view mirror more than once every few minutes!


If you see me coming up behind you and you can move to the right lane, then fucking do it! Don't stop in the middle of the road, don't jump onto the median to the left when there is a perfectly good right lane to get into, and don't you ever speed up to try and ""beat me"" because you will lose...every time you will lose. Be it at a red light, other cars, or god willing (and I've seen it before and its awesome) a cop notices what you are doing and pulls your bitch ass over. 


If you don't see me then you need to go back to Jr. High and take a basic drivers Ed course and learn what to do while you drive; check your mirrors every few seconds, keep the music at a reasonable level, not drive distracted by cell phones or food or make up. Just look at where you're going and pay attention to what's around you. Seems like a pretty easy thing to do...seems.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Thanks for this, and I completely understand what you're saying. I understand that the importance of marriage to women. I'm also not saying that I am never getting married. I'm pretty sure I'll meet a woman that I want to spend the rest of my life with, and I will want to marry her because that's what makes her happy.

But it's still a one-sided act that is (mostly) viewed as a requirement. Society once conditioned men to expected women to cook and clean for them, but that has changed. We're now conditioned to expect that women should choose whatever career path they want. I agree with that notion, but I also agree in gender equality, and marriage is anything but equal. In order to be with the woman you love, you have to sacrifice freedom, sexual access to other women, and all the things you spoke of. I've been in love, and I know that those things don't matter when you're in love with someone, but there's also no recognition of the sacrifice. It's seen as something that you have to do anyway, not something that you did for your woman.

All in all, I know that this is what it is right now, and I'm not going to be the Gloria Steinem for men and fight gender inequality. If my fate is resigned to giving up my freedom, spending thousands of dollars on a ceremony and honeymoon, enter into a contract with a woman that allows her to have half of everything I make, and get taxed more, I would like to know if there's ANY benefit to this besides making my woman happy and not dying alone.","1351729551"

That's not even remotely related to any of the points you'e made last night and you should go reread your posts if you don't believe me. If you think feminists should address misandry issues, then you should join the conversation and express it (rather than crying about how you don't understand them like you did last night). 

Furthermore, what misandry issues do you think need to be addressed? The only one I can think of is divorce law in some states. With regards to paternity payments and divorce proceedings. Some states have laws where any reports of spousal abuse have to prosecuted, but that knife cuts both ways, so it's not really a gender issue in that sense. They are for gender equality, it's just that, you are clearly only thinking about *your* gender because I don't think the above compares to the battle women are fighting to remain in control **of their own genitals**.

I think that if people like you and the MRA guys didn't constantly bemoan mischaracterize and insult feminists then they would probably take up the misandry issues I've mentioned with full strength. But seeing as how you are likely going to vote for a president that has no regards for the issues they are facing, why should they listen to you? Why should they care? They are busy fighting a battle to overturn an entire history of being ignored and you want to nitpick them because sometimes in some places divorce isn't exactly fair and it's not on their list of priorities. 

Why don't you try and have a reasonable discussion with a feminist and convince them that not only are *their* concerns worth fighting for, but *yours* as well? I've never seen someone do that on /r/conspiracy or /r/mensrights. You guys are dead set on telling women how it is - big surprise - they don't appreciate that!","1351729557"

3) This would depend on the Lodge.  The average age of the members of my lodge is probably in the 60's.  That being said, the average age of the active members of my Lodge is probably in the late 30's-early 40's.  Look at all the Lodges within a reasonable driving distance from your home. Ask them what their make-up is, what activities do they do, try to find the Lodge that best fits your personality.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No. It is only biased if the information is incomplete, misrepresented, distorted, or consistently selective.  

This refers to the subject under discussion, not the candidate as a whole, or a duration of time.  

For example, if I were to say ""Candidate X ran a successful business, showing his leadership qualities."" But in truth the business was only successful because he used secret slave labor mines in Antarctica, that would be biased. I have selected a particular aspect of a given fact and presented it a way which misrepresents reality. 

But if there were no sordid secrets and if the statement that he ran a successful business could be taken at face value, this would not be biased. 

Because even though the information was specifically and openly selected in favor of one candidate, the information itself presented a reasonably complete and accurate representation of (that relevant segment of) reality. 

Now, if I were to consistently say only the good things, while avoiding the bad things, we have added an element of duration to our presentation and within this expanded scope, I would be biased. 

Its a meta-level above the facts themselves. Wherein information is filtered in a selective manner over a period of time. Now even though individual facts are unbiased and accurate, their selection is

But this cannot be established with one instance, especially when it has been openly requested that the fact be ""something good."" 

If someone says, tell me something good about Romney. And you tell him one good thing about Romney, there is no bias (assuming that the information is accurate/fair/complete). 

If someone published a blog wherein they posted only good (yet still accurate/fair/complete) facts about Romney, while ignoring the bad ones, they would be biased as there is a level of selection occurring across an extended duration. 

The ""fact"" only good facts are ever displayed becomes a kind of ""meta-fact."" Not only is each individual fact good, but because* all* presented facts are good, an implication is created. 

Yet here, there is no misrepresentation, no unfair selection. The posts do not deny the existence of ""bad things"" (explicitly or implicitly through duration) nor do they attempt to misrepresent something and as good. 

**Bias is something which prevents an unprejudiced representation of reality. It is not prejudiced when someone says ""tell me something good,"" and you tell them something good. Bias only enters the picture if this something is a distortion, or somehow seeks to deny or distract from the existence of the opposing side of the argument, such as occurs with a duration of only the ""good facts.""**

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","&gt; I'm not sure this explanation was warranted, as he was just saying he generally solos using the pentatonic scale. For instance, in D minor, he's using D F G A C. This is the basis for his solos, but he also finds that if he does add anything to this set, the added notes tend to be E and B, thus giving you D E F G A B C, or D dorian. If he were adding Bb instead of B natural, then he would be using a D minor scale. See how that works?
 
Of course I understand how that works, no need to be condescending (although I've been called condescending in this thread, so perhaps I shouldn't be allowed to make that judgement). Clearly you can be in the minor pentatonic then add the two pitches 2 and 9 semitones, i.e. a major 2nd and 6th, above the tonic, and, without switching tonics, you'd be in the Dorian mode, but it's highly unlikely that's what the OP's doing. Almost all pop music that uses the pentatonic scale is minor pentatonic over minor diatonic framework. I'd bet that he's not going modal (in his solos, while the backing track is almost certainly minor), and that he's actually just going to the corresponding minor scale or something close to it. (Edit: Even if he was by some strange chance playing only the Dorian mode, that in itself is a huge red flag that he doesn't understand modes.) 

&gt; -adding notes to the pentatonic scale absolutely gives you other scales, one of which is the dorian mode (add major 2nd and major 6th). To accentuate that, you'd want to make sure the harmony that you're playing over uses the same scale, thus giving you an available chord base of i-ii-III-IV-v-vi°-VII, though v is rarely used and would most likely be changed to V.
 
In the Dorian mode, obviously the triads available are i- ii - III - IV - v - vi(dim) - VII. This is trivial. It's the same triads that are available in all modes, just with the numbers rotated so that the Dorian tonic triad is the first degree.  

Then you say the v is rarely used, and it's best to substitute a major chord there. This is just terrible advice. It shows very little actual reflection into when and why musical rules were developed, if those rules are still worthwhile, and what the Dorian mode is. 

Think about why you believe a major chord should be substituted on the fifth scale degree. By doing that you've essentially just changed the Dorian structure to that of the melodic minor, so a better, more-general question to ask yourself would be, why did western composers of the not so distant past almost always alter the minor scale to the harmonic and melodic minor, and how much does this ""why"", even if foolish, still affect our current understanding of music theory? 

In my opinion, your insistence on a major chord rooted on the pitch a perfect fourth down from the tonic, the altered minor scales, and unfortunately many commonly held harmonic and melodic beliefs still held in the music world today are all relics of painfully simplistic, obsolete music theory from the 17th century. 

Once the modern western musical system had been fully adopted, and diatonicism, the most stable 7 note spread, came to dominate all music, the major and minor modes stuck out as the most exploitable (and I mean that in a good way). They both are centred around the identically stable and most stable triads, i.e, the major and minor chords, and have at the most consonant interval from the tonic triads, both ascending and descending, the same triads, i.e. major chords for the major mode and minor chords for the minor mode. This creates a very simple way to define tonality in these two modes: begin and end on the tonic triad (simple repetition of the tonic is maybe the easiest way to imply tonality, one that works equally for all scales and modes, and is used constantly), after playing the initial tonic triad move in some fashion (initially the requirement would have been:move immediately) to one of the other two triads of the same type, then resolve back to the tonic.  

Further, it seems that early ears insisted on the most obvious melodic resolution, which was, once you leave the tonic, the only way to build momentum back towards it was with a leading tone, preferably preceded by a run up of tones (as in 2 semitones) from either the fourth or fifth scale degree (our triads that pivot to the resolution after all) to create a sort of tone-gallup up to the leading tone, which only then do we arrive at the small interval of the semitone. Run as fast as you can to the tonic, slowing down only at the last second! 

Since compositions seemed to require this leading tone melodic resolution, and the harmonic resolution of a like triad either 5 semitones up or down from the tonic, followed by the tonic triad itself, the minor mode can no longer fulfill all the resolution requirements. The major mode still does, but only one of the two resolutions includes a leading tone, the V-I resolution.  IV-I no longer is viable. 

But composers also saw that the minor mode had exploitability similar to the major mode (but different). The solution, instead of learning new ways to imply tonality for this distinct mode, was to instead alter the minor mode to be closer to the familiar, safe major mode, so they could more or less operate in the minor mode just as they did with the major. Hence the melodic and harmonic minor scale. 

(Now I'm not saying the melodic and harmonic minor scales are bad, although they do create imbalances in the scale that have to be acknowledged and addressed when composing in them, but they are hugely overstressed even today. We still haven't thrown off those initial tonality defining requirements.)

How long was music almost exclusively composed in the major and altered minor modes? A comically long time. 

Of course, these rules have been softened or totally abandoned over time. We no longer insist on a leading tone for resolution, allowing for the natural minor mode, and four - one cadences. We no longer insist that resolution must come from a like chord, so leading tone resolutions can come from VII(dim)-I, iii-I, etc (though these all have strengths and weaknesses of their own, e.g., in the iii-I resolution only one note moves, the other 2 remain the same, making it feel very still, and not very pronounced). We don't have to start and end on the tonic. etc, etc.  Pop music doesn't really care about cadences at all most the time, choosing instead to create tonality through repetition. There have been some attempts to exploit the other modes, particularly in jazz and exotic (Non German!) music. Atonality took hold for a while, most popularly with Schoenberg's 12 tone system, but the parameters there, while they produced some novel, interesting music, were comically restrictive. 

But even as we abandon our initial restraints and open up to more musical possibilities, we are still affected by these early rules, be it consciously or subconsciously.  Sometimes when we're not careful we show a heavy unjustified bias in favour of them. 

When you told the OP to use the Dorian mode with a major chord on the fifth scale degree, you were essentially telling the OP, ""here's the Dorian mode, and how you use it is you alter it to be a mode you already know how to use, namely the raised 7th degree makes Dorian the melodic minor, which really, if we're going to be honest, is a scale that was created early in western music's history, in an attempt to make the minor scale work more like the very safe, familiar major scale. So just play Dorian like the major scale. Play safe, don't get hurt."" 

Let's actually play in Dorian. No cheating. Let's find new strengths in the mode that are unique to it, and exploit that. This is actually something that nobody does. Even many of the so called great composers weren't willing to really dig into and analyze the unknown. So what are some unique features of the Dorian mode? One that jumps out to me, is that it is the only perfectly symmetric mode in diatonicism (a feature you're destroying with the V chord), i.e., ascending from the tonic is intervalically identical to descending from the tonic. This symmetry can be exploited easily. In Dorian any set of notes played melodically or harmonically, has an analogous set of notes that are intervalically identical and directionally opposite, which you find by reflecting the notes through the tonic. This could create a strong sense of Dorian. Combine that with the tried, tested, and true tonality creating technique that works for any scale or mode of just playing the tonic a lot, preferably also starting and ending on it, and boom, you're playing in Dorian for real.

That's my point. That's *Romney*. Or Gary Johnson/Ron Paul I suppose, coming in second place.

&gt; the anti-war left(who get ignored the day after the election)

If only. Rather, they were appeased - but very apathetically. It took years to resolve Iraq and Afghanistan will end during Obama's second term.

But in any case, I'm digressing. The low-government, low-tax, 'pro-freedom, anti-nannyist' ideology is just as run by special interests, and blatantly more economically powerful ones, than their opposites.

Note, for instance, that NAFTA was signed during Clinton's presidency - when you acknowledge that Clinton's ideology isn't supposed to be the pro-business, it's supposed to be pro-union. Those pro-business interests get what they want sometimes even when the other guys are in charge, such is their very much unrepresentative influence.

&gt; There is no one interest of most Americans.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Paris is more expensive than New York because rubber tires need more maintenance and have a shorter life expectancy. Even within the Paris system the rubber tire lines are more expensive than the conventional ones. 

Look, if you want to make an argument for cost efficiency that's fine. But BRT takes up more land and isn't something you can just retrofit the subway into. If New York or any other place were to build a new line somewhere where no line exists, I would be with you (most likely). You need to factor in land value when making an economic argument, and in dense areas that makes the aggregate cost (ie more than just the cost of construction) higher than rail.

I used to live in Washington DC. Just recently DC metro celebrated its 35th anniversary and a group of college students decided to study what DC would look like if the metro were never built. Even if everything was moved to buses, DC as it currenly exists could not function without it. The downtown core has over 200,000 people commute in by Metro, there are not enough roads in downtown DC for an increase of 200,000 bus riders. And since you can't exactly knock down historic buildings just to widen roads, the result would simply be a more spread out city.

DC Metro has its problems, as does any subway system, but the benefits go far beyond just providing a ride. Rail may require a larger up front cost, but they cost less to run than buses and they can get more people to any one station than buses could. That clears roads, it allows for longer distance travel, it brings life to cities. I would love it if there *were* a better option, but no such option exists that can handle the ridership that rail can. There is more to transit policy than just cost per mile, BRT can not deliver as many people so for high demand areas it is a bad idea even if it is cheaper. ","1351729565"

Nope, Abominati0n is right.  I like rotary engines, but they simply do not compare to piston engines.  There is a reason why piston engines dominate the market - because they are better in just about every category.

Hopefully Mazda makes massive improvements on the rotary's fuel efficiency, torque, and reliability, because I really want the next RX-7 to have an awesome engine. (not just in terms of power, either)

The one thing the RX-7 will likely have going for it is being light.  Most cars these days, even sports cars, are overweight.","1351729569"

The world needs cooks and trash collectors (who make a bunch of money, BTW), auto mechanics,  and masons and plumbers and none of these require anything more than basic reading and math, and specialized training in the specific trade. Trade schools would be a huge improvement over 12 years of general education for the multitudes of children that just put in the time and get ""promoted"" while actually learning little.

Life would be better for both the students and the teachers if education was tailored to the student's capabilities and needs and not to some standardized test that assumes that everyone has the same capacity for learning or the same long-term needs.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","I have an argument against it: **It does not address the main issue of accidents.**

A big chunk of our accidents can be laid to a handful of reasons, IMHO:

* Poor driving standards.
* Lack of testing.

**Poor Driving Standards:**

If you have sub-standard drivers on the road, then that is the fault of the regulatory body who is supposed to ensure that all drivers are fit to be in control of their several ton death machines.

A good example of this is that in Australia, you can take the drivers exam without knowing a lick of english. However, all [emergency signage](http://www.cvsignsandsafety.com.au/images/detailed/1/35023.jpg) lacks symbols. I've been driving with my partners mother, who can't read english, and nearly had her run up the ass end of someone around the corner, because she was unable to read a sign very similar to the one above.

**Lack of Testing:**

You renew your license every *n* years. Why are you not retested to ensure that you're still safe to be in control of a few tons of metal that moves at insane speeds?

**In Conclusion:**

This is not an argument that high vis clothing for motorcycle riders serves no purpose. This is an argument that there are other factors to take into consideration, and that saying ""Higher Vis = Safer"" is not the end of the debate.

An interesting thing to note is that if everyone wore bright, vivid colours then they too would be easier to see. Easier to see, means safer, right? So why is this not implemented with pedestrians? If you get hit by a car and you're not wearing your 5 pieces of safety gear, it's your fault! Because that's ridiculous, that's why.","1351729589"

Taken together this kind of suggests that I am more correct. Can you offer another explanation? Do I have a magical computer that eliminates bugginess? If so I'd like to sell it to NASA or something, so please let me know.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Bad moms is very much a men's rights issue. If your mom spent 140 on from child support on a meal rather than buying you basic clothing we men are concerned about child abuse and you freezing to death. I don't know exactly what happened, but when that sort of thing happens it is very much a MRA issue. We want accountability to child support payments to ensure the children get good stuff.

Indeed men do have the advantage that we are less likely to be catcalled and honked at by strangers. But, men who go through rather seedy areas where a lot of that happens do have to fear for their bodily integrity because are much more likely to face stranger violence. Most murders and robberies are of men.

We also face very aggressive sexual harassment from more familiar women because the whole ""No means no"" thing doesn't apply to men culturally as we are supposed to always want sex. We may well have crappy experiences with sexual harassment (from friends, not strangers) and be able to understand you. You're more likely to be able to make people care about women by understanding what guys experience.

So I am saying, A. It's good to ask us more about what our views are before judging and B. You have to be quite open to new information to not be put off from our sub.","1351729596"

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","are you referring to the metabolic rate claims? Yes, that was found to be questionable, but not based on ludicrously bad surveys done by outsiders, but, as is typically the case, proponents of the theory found that there were better theories to fit the observed research than the original theory.

The original research published by R. K Wallace, and later corraborated by Herbert Benson, found a drop in metabolic rate that was lower, on its face, than found in sleep. Newer studies, found differently. That, on its face, isn't sufficient to cause researchers to revise their theory, but when the basis of the theory, that metabolic rate was tied to pure consciousness -the closer one was to PC, the lower the metabolic rate was going to be- was discredited by TM researchers themselves, they revised their theories.

PC doesn't affect metabolic rate much, if any. The breath suspension state is simply based on a slight change in sensitivity to CO2 levels that occurs as a side-effect of PC. In some people, this manifests as apparent breath suspension. In others, it manifests as simply a notably reduced normal breath rate.

.

Some people STILL insist on using those original publicity charts that were discredited years ago. Bad communication within the TM organization, I am guessing.","1351729603"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So a few weeks ago me and my fiance, who were having some troubles, kind of reconciled and started making plans for how to go forward.  Things seemed healthier than they had in a long time, and it seemed like we had a good plan.

A few days later we were at a party.  She got blackout drunk, and was all over a mutual friend of ours.  Sitting on his lap, playing with his hair, looking back at me and grinning.

I got up and left the party.  About ten minutes later I got a call from the host of the party (the guy she'd been hitting on) saying that he had kicked her out, sent his guard to walk her home, and asking me to come back.  It was my last weekend in town, so despite being furious and heartbroken, I decided to go back.

On my way out of my house, she was just getting there.  She asked me where I was going.  I said ""Out.""  She punched me as hard as she could in the nose.  Luckily it wasn't very hard, so I rode off and went back to the party.

When I got back the next morning, my guitar was smashed.

Then, later that day she left.  She was gone almost 24 hours.  This was in Ghana, so I was pretty worried.  I called almost everyone I knew.  I thought about calling the cops.  Finally found her and she was completely unapologetic.  Now she has some excuse about how I was emotionally neglectful so she acted out.

I don't know.  It may be true.  I never meant to be.  But it fucking hurts.

So this isn't really on topic at all, but I needed to vent and I just moved to a new town and don't know anyone so I guess this is as good a place as any.","1351729609"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","The only relevant distinction here is between who can use the ring, and who is used *by* the ring.  

Sauron is the only Lord of the Ring. 
Frodo, Bilbo, Isildur, Smeagol etc are all used *by* the ring.  

They become invisible because the ring is trying to get back to Sauron and in the wraith world they are corrupted by its power and drawn to Sauron thus they are invisible to those who are not in the wraith world.  Smeagol was too simple to be corrupted; Frodo was too strong of will to be completely corrupted until he was standing inside Mt. Doom.  

The ring betrayed Smeagol because it knew that others were nearby and thus fell off of his finger for Bilbo to find [same with Isildur when the Orcs were nearby].  

Thus, Frodo becomes invisible because the Ring is in control; Sauron's power is at its max when he has the ring on his finger because he wields it.

Keep in mind that I'm talking about the Vanilla days--things have come a long way since then.  The way I recall it was that tanks had the most responsibility of knowing strategies, because they had to know what to pull, when to pull it, and how to pull it (based on the mob locations), where to position the boss, when to gain gain/drop/switch aggro, as well as any other miscellaneous stuff.  Healers needed to know where to stand, who to heal, when to heal them, what level to keep the tanks topped off at.  DPS only needed to know when to stop or start damage, based on fight mechanics.

That's how I generally remember the complexity order of the vanilla raids.  Others may have different opinions.  Everyone *should* know exactly what they're doing, but it's easier to fake it as a DPS (without wiping the raid).","1351729626"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","This is only partially correct. 

The right to petition and the right to petition the government are two separate things. The first amendment to the constitution protects the second not the first.  Without going into a whole lot of case law and legal mumbo-jumbo, this means that national and local governments are required by the constitution the provide some way for people and groups to have access to the government in order to complain about things that the government has done to them. Funnily enough, although they are required to have some way for you to complain, the supreme court ruled that although you have the right to complain, the government doesn't have to listen to you or respond to you.

None of this, in any way, gives you the right to walk around with a piece of paper and ask people to sign it to support a cause (a petition). This historically tends to fall under the free speech provision of the first amendment. This provision is the one that allows you to speak freely in public places. However, there are limitations on these rights. The supreme court has ruled that governments can not restrict what you say, but can put restricts on when, where, and how you say it. These are called time, place, and manner restrictions and are allowed under the Cox v. New Hampshire supreme court case and other cases that followed.

The government may legally limit when, how, and where you speak assuming that they do three three things:
* They don't show preference for specific content. For example, they can't say that it's OK for people supporting a pro-war message to speak in public, but not OK for people who support an anti-war message to speak in public.
* limitations must be specific as to how, when, or what you're not allowed to do. For example, they can prevent you from shouting anti-war slogans inside the capital building while congress is in session, but they can't ban you from shouting slogans everywhere.
* they must allow you to alternative ways of speaking out. 

The supreme court has consistently allowed local governments to place restrictions on soliciting and canvassing (which includes walking around with a piece of paper asking people to sign it) in order to ""protect citizens from crime or undue annoyance"" as long as the legislation meets the previously listed criteria.

**tl;dr:** The first amendment protects your right to petition the government. This is not the same as walking around with a petition. The government does allow, given that certain provisions are met, limitations on your ability to walk around asking people to sign your piece of paper.

If you don't think the international division of labour favours men,
If you don't think that within the household, traditional gender roles that are still widespread today dont serve to extract labour from women,

This might be wrong in that you *don't* live in a binary world but you sure as fuck haven't given me any evidence contrary to that yet.

ad hominem, yeah I guess technically I'm talking about you in that you're letting your view of the world fuck with what you believe to be free speech and what isn't.

When you type in ""facebook.com,"" your browser sends a request to the server (computer) that is storing the info for facebook. If you've logged into facebook before, your browser probably also is storing your login information in a file cake a 'cookie.' So that information gets sent to the facebook server along with the request for the 'facebook.com' page. That's one of the keys here. Most often when you (your browser, really) request a page, you are also giving some information to the remote server. So the server sees the info you sent and creates a unique page based on it. This happens every time you refresh the page or go to a new facebook page. Content is being pulled from many different places, and the server puts them all together in one html file, and sends you that files so that it SEEMS like you are looking at a simple page.

That was the end of the argument, not the whole basis of it. Therefore everything you said based off your asinine thinking that this was the whole argument is completely wrong.

Poor in your eyes because you don't want to believe it is anything but poor. It does not take a genius to understand a pro-Romney article will not get upvoted in /r/politics. Only idiots and deniers would dare say otherwise.

Not a deflection. It was part of my argument, but you were too daft to figure that out. So it is neither an ad hominem or a strawman argument.

* MH is a cash cow for systems(in Japan), so why is there no new 3DS design with a second analog stick yet?  

* I don't feel like I should buy an accessory just for another analog stick, especially if it isn't going to match my 3DS' color scheme(idk if they come in colors other than black, but I still don't feel like buying one).

* The MH that they are bringing out to NA is just MH3 rehash(with improvements, I know).  Why no MH4?  

* Capcom hates Westerners.  This isn't the 3DS' fault, but I felt like adding it.

Despite all that, I am still considering buying a 3DS just for MH, but don't be so quick to write off RO.

The OP of the original post could have reposted pictures of cats anywhere on reddit and picked up the same karma without the long setup and the cash layout. He doesn't really use his account much and has no visible history of trolling or unreasonable animosity toward /r/atheism or Christians. Also, he had no guarantee that he would see the front page after paying out, so the effort involved would be absolutely pointless. 

&gt;If you look at the image, you can see that the owner of the sticker likely attached the FSM logo for a brief period (maybe a second or so) and that it wasn't attached for an extended period of time.

2. Create the unit test with an large number of items and create a loop that will run the sort function a large number of times.

3. Exclude this test from the normal test run.

4. Run the test with the profiler, make optimization as necessary and verify that they helped with the profiler.

5. Run the rest of the test suite to ensure it still works.

In general, I believe that proper following should revolve around being your best, considerate, and inclusive of others, and greatly appreciate that. That's my line though. I don't believe that religion should be used to fuel hatred, hate speech, or discriminate against others. I also believe that the separation of church and state is a must, and that there is no room for religious reasoning in politics (it weird me out whenever i see american election campaign clips online of candidates talking religiously). 

I have a couple friends who are quite religious. Some of them are more conservative views than others (like getting married before moving in with each other). However, they are all very respectful and open minded. Their use of religion is really to be better people. There's no hate, no political motivations, no exclusion. And there is no way I cannot respect them and their faith for that.

I'm a little dumb founded by some of the religious groups that get into the media and the hatred they spew. It makes me glad that Canada does not include hate speech in our freedom of speech.","1351729661"

But supposing you say ""I would never date a mormon."" What you have just said, in no uncertain terms, is ""I, for some reason or another, think *all mormons* are unsuitable for dating."" You can't then turn around and say ""I've got absolutely no problem with mormons."" That would be bullshit.

Aero is very rigorous and competitive. I've heard from a lot of students that went elsewhere for undergrad and then came here for grad say that they wish they had gone here for undergrad because of how much more prepared we were. I think it says a lot when I've heard that from many grad students from various graduation years and undergrad disciplines that came here for Aero grad school.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","There's lots of other great advice in this thread, so maybe I'll just throw in a suggestion.

Something I've found works is put to players into a role right off the bat. Bounty hunters, mercenaries, pirates, soldiers, gladiators, slaves. Take the initiative to define the purpose of the party before the players go and do it themselves, and sets the tone of the campaign. I'll usually even do this even prior to character creation, having my players define themselves *in relation to* the role assigned.

Another problem you had was group cohesion. In a first session you basically have two kinds of groups: the ones who will work together ""because that's what you do in D&amp;D,"" and the ones who are looking for a reason to work with the group. You had the latter, and without a reason they just kind of ran amok and did whatever.

Which again, is totally cool. It's just hard to plan for. How do you run a session when everybody is off doing something different?

One way to combat that is to bring in the characters one at a time. Start the session off centred around one character, whom is the designated party leader (likely a player who volunteered or was volunteered for the role). Then introduce the other characters one by one, or as is appropriate.

To give you an example, here's how I started my campaign.

First I picked the player who was most invested in his character already, a human sorcerer. He was a loose cannon and a drunk, on the run from a family that he had dishonoured and a vengeful father. So the natural place for him was at a bar, wasted off his ass. I ran a little narrative, telling him to roll some checks here and there (roll perception. You get a 1. You look around the room and see...blurry figures. Lots of them. You'd guess at least two or three times more then there actually are. Someone is playing music. You feel like retching). A few minutes later he found himself following a pretty girl who had inexplicably taken an interest in him out to the alley and WHUMP. He's lumped out.

He wakes up with a splitting headache, his entire body aching and sore. Roll perception again. You're chained to a post in a large room, guards patrolling the perimeter. There seem to be several other prisoners chained to you, though you can't see them all. The one on your right is (player 2 description), and to your left is (npc description). What do you do?

He introduces himself to one, and then the others, and they all get to talking. Turns out they've been taken as slaves, and are to be thrown into the arena. What to do? They attempt to escape but just end up getting the NPC killed. Before they know it they're bundled out and chained to a post in front of a screaming crowd. The doors open and a pack of wild dogs are upon them. Roll initiative!

The PCs somehow manage to survive, and their valour attracted the attention of a wealthy slaveowner. Turns out he's an owner and trainer of gladiators. He offers to set them free if they will fight for him for a year and a day. Do they trust him? Or do they plan for an escape?","1351729675"
"skyrim","t5_2s837","In case these might answer some of your questions, here you go:

**Suggestion for a First Character:** This will be rather in-depth, so skip it if you want to discover things for yourself.  

* Be a Breton (you automatically get 25% magic resistance)
* Every time you level up, choose ""health""
* Finish the Book of Love quest for 15% more resistance to magic.  You get it from the Dunmer priestess at the Temple of Mara in Riften.  While you're in Riften, get Marcurio the mage.  He costs 500 Septim.
* Get the Lord Stone (25% resistance to magic and 50 points of armor all the time).  Head south on the road from Dawnstar, past Red Road Pass (giant camp) to the Hall of the Vigilant.  There's a path to the right of the Hall over the rocky hill that leads to the Shrine of Mehrune's Dagon.  Head towards the shrine and you'll see the marker for the Lord Stone.  
* Join the College of Winterhold and follow those quests until you finish Saarthal.  In the very beginning of Saarthal, you'll be prompted to pick up some artifacts.  Three of them are rings and one is an amulet.  Make sure you get at least two of the rings and wear one.  Disenchant one of the other ones and use it to put on other rings, robes and necklaces when your enchanting gets high enough.
* At the end of Saarthal, there's a note on the boss.  Read it and it will begin a quest for the Gauldur Amulet.  Finish that quest next.  You'll get an amulet that gives you 30 points of health, magic and stamina.
* You'll also get a sword, The Gauldur Blackblade, that absorbs health.  Disenchant it and enchant at least one weapon with that. 

From here (and it will take a while to get here), you can choose what you want to be.  So think about the skills you want and level up in them.  Sneak archer.  Heavy armor tank.  Whatever.  The following is just one suggestion.  It's meant to give you really good defense and not use magic that much (mage builds are hard to do at first):

* Enchant your boots with ""fortify stamina,"" your gauntlets with ""fortify one-handed,"" a hood/circlet/helmet with ""fortify archery,"" robes/armor with ""fortify health,"" a ring with ""fortify health"" and the Gauldur Amulet.  
* Get the spells ""Oakflesh"" and ""Bound Sword.""  Carry one in each hand and cast them whenever enemies appear.  ""Bound Sword"" is actually a really good weapon at first, especially with the ""Mystic Binding"" perk.  Oakflesh will raise your armor rating.
* Use any bow you like.  If you can get your hands on a Forsworn bow, they're particularly good and benefit from the Steel Smithing perk.  Imperial bows do not.  But Ancient Nord bows do.  
* Wear whatever armor you like, although I suggest light armor so you can move around more quickly.  Using Oakflesh will offset not having the same stats as heavy armor. 
* Smith whenever you can.  The best thing you can do for money is iron daggers with the ""banish"" enchantment, which will also level your enchanting. Also, jewelry with gems levels your smithing quickly and the ""sneak"" and ""carry"" enchantments will make them worth the most.  
* Don't use any smithing perks except ""Steel smithing"" and ""arcane smithing.""  You can make a steel weapon very powerful by enchanting gloves, ring, necklace and robes with ""fortify smithing"" and drinking a ""fortify smithing"" potion.  
* Whenever you can, put perks into the middle tree of Enchanting.  
* Really, the only One-handed perks you want are the five Armsman perks.  
* For Archery, you definitely want Eagle Eye and Power Shot.  Eagle Eye helps you aim and Power Shot staggers even powerful enemies, giving you time to reload.  The Ranger and Quick Shot perks are great as well.  Faendal, in Riverwood, will train you to level 50 for free (if you help him instead of Sven). ","1351729675"

since it's abs^2 you just get a^2 + b^2

a^2 = 6 + 4sqrt(2) / 40

b^2 = 6/40

In all fairness, I really don't play the game all GTA-style (okay, there were some civilian casualties while I was trying to level my werewolf tree in Dawnguard).

Her dad was my first human casualty, shortly after starting the game. When I arrived at Riverwood, the first thing I did was punch a chicken, and learned that the people of Skyrim do not fuck around when it comes to animal cruelty. In the ensuing melee (truly, I was trying to run), I happened to kill Dorthe's dad.

After finding his corpse some days later (it never disappeared), and becoming more acclimated to my role as the grand troll of Skyrim, I dragged it back to his family's doorstep.

(The glee that I got watching the family start each day by walking outside, and immediately freaking out when they realize they stepped over their dad's corpse - again and again and again - well, I should be ashamed.)

Unfortunately that all to an end when a stupid follower of mine reanimated him during a dragon fight.

As for the mom, yes, this happened recently, about 300 hours in. A dragonborn can only hear ""I hope the wilds claim you one of these days"" so many times. So I popped into sneak mode, and Fury'd her, in hopes she's sucker-punch a guard.

I'm in school for GIS but I heavily cross train into different fields including Hydrography, Watershed Management, and even do a lot of Comp Sci courses (some software dev, mainly general Databases with options in geospatial Databases (R-Trees and such), and computer architecture/design (low level logic at the chip level)). If my school offered forestry I'd be all over that too.

One thing I disagree on though is how the author kind of implies that ""an untrained monkey"" could use some of the more advanced GIS things (Google Earth, Streetmaps, and MapPoint are one thing but some of the advanced Arc functions, GRASS, and Map3D are a whole different ballpark IMO).

Final thought; I think that GIS professionals are kind of going the way of CAD guys. Basically it'll still be a separate department but they're more or less attached to some specific group, (eg.engineers; sure engineers could do CAD drawings but their time is probably too expensive to be doing details on a CAD drawing instead they have drafters to do it all for them). My dad is an engineer and that's exactly what he says; sure he could do CAD work but he's busy with the actual design part of the job and juggling other projects, and his time is too valuable to be doing drawings so they have CAD guys to draw up his designs for him.","1351729699"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The laws of thermodynamics argument is often used for pro-reduced-calories diets. But its not as simple as you say it is.

You're oversimplifying the laws of thermodynamics. You need to take into account that the variables ""energy taken in"" and ""energy used"" are not independent of each other in a human being. The body regulates how much energy it uses based on how much energy it has available. Eat less and your body will use less (and as a result you'll have a harder time maintaining your body temperature, not be as alert, etc.). You should also factor in that you're affected by the lower energy levels and won't be as active when going about your daily life as you would normally have been.

If you're gonna use the laws of thermodynamics argument you need an equation that takes that this into account. Just assuming that energy used is a constant and that if you reduce your energy intake by a certain amount it will use the same amount from your stored body fat instead doesn't work. The working hypothesis for the people who are against the calories in - calories used hypothesis is that this doesn't amount to nearly as much as it would have done if you don't account for this.

Now what OP is arguing for in his books is looking at what mechanics the body use to regulate its energy usage and storage, and how to affect them (trought your diet for example), which is worth considering given the above.","1351729701"

Also, with a player like Kobe, there is no reason to run a half-court offense like that when he has certain sweet spots he can iso at and be way more efficent (i mean damn it's Kobe). Basically, the Lakers should play faster for the sake of a mor fluid offense, Nash's ability on the break, and Dwight can outrun most bigs so if he gets to his spot in the paint first it's an easy bucket.

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","It can mean a huge number of things. Since you seem to be asking about it in relation to women, well, if a woman has it on her profile that she is bisexual, but states she only wants to meet men, it could be a disclosure of past sexual endeavours (whether she hooked up in a club and enjoyed it, or has had sustained sexual relationships with other women in the past) and, although she doesn't want to seek it again, feels that she should let other know. Alternatively, she could be bisexual but heteroromantic, or she could be bisexual and biromantic but only interested in dating men for the time being. 

It can also be that the person identifies outside then hetero/bi/homo ""spectrum,"" but feels it would be more misleading to use something more exclusive. These are less likely, but she could be, say, only into people who are male gendered, regardless of physical sex, or only into people who are male sexed but is fine with all gender identifications.

There are other, shallower reasons, of course (fetishisation of lesbianism, and the perception that they will be more attractive to men for being bi), but really, sexuality is a personal thing, and it's not something that you can just generalise about - at least not accurately, and not on a site that only gives you three options for sexuality.

Personally, I'm mostly into people who are either sexed or gendered women, but I enjoy cismen too, and am open to dating them (mainly due to lack of women I am attracted to in my area).

TL;DR Sexuality is fluid and can have different meanings to different people. Best to ask each individual what their sexuality means to them.

I see too many of my friends decide that they can't find the right girl so they give up, and then convince themselves that they're unattractive. That's a bunch of fucking bullshit excuses to cover up the fact that they're being pussies and hate rejection. 

You have to learn to love rejection. It gets fun after the 20th time or so.

So sometime soon after that we go shopping, and I distinctly remember pointing at some black people in the aisle ahead of us and saying ""Gramma, nigger, nigger, nigger!"" Holy shit the look they gave me. At the time I knew that the expression that they showed on their faces was the same one that my parents gave me when I did something bad. I just didn't understand why they were giving me THAT look. My grandmother didn't even try to shut me up, she just laughed. Yep, prejudice is learned. Fuck.

I know, some people are bullies, it's why it's good have an adult to to keep bullies from bossing us around or taking our toys. Adults are boring though, we don't need them hanging around all the time because we can have fun in our own games when everyone is playing fair!

No, you're not seeking outside approval, you're sharing a pretty picture with your friends.

Why is outside approval a bad thing? Doesn't everyone like compliments and the more the better?

For that matter, what the hell does ""outside approval"" even mean? Making a connection with someone other than your boyfriend?

Shouldn't your boyfriend like the fact that other people think his girlfriend is attractive?

Even if his compliments mean more to you than other people's, you would still like other compliments. 

Your boyfriend shouldn't be ""everything"" for you. It's okay to also have friends who meet some of your other needs.

It's not *only* in the context of competitive athletes, it's not only athletes that use type II muscle. Read Lyle's comment from page 215 again. And read what Phinney says just before the athlete part, ""performance is limited by the low muscle glycogen levels"". That he mentions athletes does not mean that it doesn't apply to normal people doing high intensity work. Normal people still use type II fibers when lifting, and not having adequate glycogen will impair their performance.

&gt; Also, Phinney himself on that exact paper: ""That paper was written 8 years ago, and much has happened since."" You keep citing old shit

That is in the context of endurance and beginners, look at the article. 

Even Peter Attia (co-founder of NuSI with Gary Taubes) uses carbs to get peak performance (and he's focused on endurance, cycling, swimming, with some lifting), see [""Introduction to Superstarch – Part I""](http://eatingacademy.com/sports-and-nutrition/introduction-to-superstarch-part-i).

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","&gt;Would having used AC instead of DC made a difference?

This question makes little sense. AC or DC would only be for the power supply of the machines on both ends. A DC signal contains no information at all, because it only has one state. An AC signal contains little information because it is just a sine wave.

The signal that was transmitted was most assuredly not a DC signal (i.e. constant), you must have misinterpreted some of the info there.

&gt;What about harnessing resonance?

You would have to work with the resonant properties, maybe use frequency modulation to alter the frequency spectrum of the signal to be more easily transmitted through the cable. The cable has a frequency specific behavior, the same goes for the noise. By using certain techniques at both ends you could get much better SNR.

I feel like I never really had a personality. Nothing about me felt like me, I felt like a cutout from a magazine or something.

To answer your question, I think that resistance does nothing to benefit me, which is why I persist with it. Part of me wants to see myself fail. I've developed a self-defeating nature over the years which I sometimes mistake for perpetual bad luck.","1351729735"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","There was a bug with the first run of unusuals... Well, not a bug, personally I enjoy pink in a totally heterosexual way, and think having a pink-glowing courier would be da shit since no one else has one. Basically, the initial run of unusuals had some strange colors like brown, black, pink, etc. Valve gave single-use paint to everyone who had an unusual courier, which allowed them to change the unusual effect color to any RGB value [EDIT: apparently not, only specific colors]. There were only about 4000 paints ever given out, and a lot of them were used right away, so the few left in circulation are incredibly valuable.

Put effort into post and actually answer the question = get downvoted. As I said, I never actually had one since there are only a few out there, so I guess I was wrong about the any RGB value part.","1351729735"

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","This problem is called class imbalance, and occurs in a number of different machine learning domains. As [jhinka states](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12evgi/classification_when_80_of_my_training_set_is_of/c6ujdwv), bagging and boosting can be used to improve classification accuracy, although they are not specifically designed to deal with imbalanced data (they're for hard-to-classify data in general). The same applies to Random Forest, which was [JeradDS's suggestion](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12evgi/classification_when_80_of_my_training_set_is_of/c6uk77n).

[ashwhat](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12evgi/classification_when_80_of_my_training_set_is_of/c6ulu7z) and (to some extent) [ieeaaauuuuooooo](http://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/12evgi/classification_when_80_of_my_training_set_is_of/c6uifxu) get at the real solution, though: sampling. Both oversampling (adding instances to the minority class) and undersampling (removing instances from the majority class) can be employed, and these can be done randomly or in a directed fashion (e.g., the SMOTE algorithm, which oversamples by generating new minority-class instances rather than simply duplicating existing ones, or the Wilson's Editing approach, which removes majority-class instances which are too close to the majority-minority class boundary). In addition, these can be applied in conjunction with one another, or with the aforementioned approaches for improving weak classifiers.

ashwhat also mentioned cost-based learning, which is when the costs of false negatives and false positives are different. By training the learner to minimize overall cost rather than misclassification, you can give it more incentive to give you more true positives. (I'm assuming here that the minority class is the positive class.) In addition, you can just manually change the decision threshold to weight your algorithm more in favor of the minority class. Both of these must be manually specified, however, and the proper costs and/or threshold values are not always immediately obvious.

One final note about AUC, the Area Under the ROC Curve. While many performance metrics assume the default decision threshold, this is inappropriate for imbalanced data. Often, the default threshold will simply classify everything as majority-class, since that gives the highest overall accuracy. If you want to see the performance of a learner on imbalanced data, you need to use the AUC, which gives performance across the whole range of decision thresholds. To be honest, when you say you've got a 79% success rate on your learner, I'd bet your learner is just saying ""label everything as the majority class."" If you used AUC, you wouldn't get misleading results like this.

EDIT: Adding a TL;DR

**TL;DR:** If 79% of your instances are in the majority class, and your model is giving you 79% accuracy, there's a very good chance your model is just labeling everything as ""majority-class."" Consider the AUC of your model to see its real performance. And use Weka's CostSensitiveClassifier learner, under the ""meta"" classifiers tree, to build your model with different error weights. Note that the ""Cost-Sensitive Evaluation"" checkbox under the ""More Options..."" button from the ""Test Options"" area is a trap; don't use that. Only use the actual CostSensitiveClassifier, and then set the classifier you really want under the settings for that.","1351729737"

1) hold run the whole time
2) run on the inside path

So many people are much, much slower than me for those two reasons alone. 

3) stay on ledge as long as possible and jump at last possible moment

You can practice (3) by running up the right edge of the stairs in the beginning run, before the rest spot. Most people loop these stairs on the left. What you want to do is practice running up the right (there's a few jumps). Try to run that part faster than everyone else.

A rollback will restore your character to a previous state, a state from before your items were removed.  So a rollback duplicate would be performed by getting an awesome item, giving your entire inventory to another account (basically faking getting hacked) and having your account rolled back.  Now both the other account and your account have a copy of the awesome item and whatever else was in your inventory.  I would think that this would be a tough method to duplicate on anything other than the small scale because if the same godlike item is seen on a few accounts by the same customer service rep who's doing the rollback you would probably end up raising suspicion but if you can do these rollback duplications with different representatives you are more likely to avoid detection.  It would also only be worth it with a certain grade of item as each individual account is limited to being rolled back once so the dupers in this case would need to buy a new account for every set of duplicates they want made.","1351729751"

It implies a rule of authority and so what in Rawls' theory legitimizes authority to impose this justice?  I do not believe that people in the original position with a veil of ignorance would even accept authority or go along with the belief that society should center itself around a conception.  Either way you are stuck with the authority of those in power who impose Rawlsian justice or you are under the authority of the conception itself.  I don't think Rawls finds a way to legitimize this despite creating a really good theory of justice.

In terms of what you can and cannot do, you might want to do some online research call planned parenthood. Depending on what state she lives in, you might be able to take her to the clinic, she might be able to go by herself, she might need her legal guardian(s) to go, and go 3-4 times because your fucked up fundy legislators don't think women should have reproductive rights.

In my case, there was a couple of times I lied because my gf would have gone mental over something I knew she shouldn't go mental on. 

It's a catch 22. 

Ex girlfriend texts, just catching up. You either tell your gf and create massive drama, or lie and continue to be true to your gf. 

You text your ex 'yeah all is cool, currently seeing my gf, all loved up, would be nice to do lunch at some point in the future' 

So you lie having done the right thing. Your gf breaks your trust by reading your messages then freaks out about her trust issues and how she can't let it go. 

So then you're the liar. 

Your then has the option, either deal with it like an adult or start acting neurotic about it allowing the incident to eat away at her and inform every decision she makes in future. 

OP is at a crossroads and I truly hope she learns to judge each item on it's own merit rather than relive past hurts. 

It's classic karma in action. Either let things go move on and be happy, or cling to and recycle past hurts eventually transmitting them into your new relationship, driving him away and further entrench the victim complex. ","1351729755"

IMO, Introversion is a good example of that.  First, Uplink.  Next, Dar/multiWinia and DEFCON.  They sold, but didn't make tremendous money... so that plus poor management, and now they're doing a pretty standard ""Tycoon style"" game and using the minecraft model to release it.  ","1351729759"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Some key tips from the few games I played last night.

Three Phases for the event.

**Step 1: Upgraded Courier + 1 set of Wards.**

**Phase 1: Radiant vs Dire.**

I personally try and get 2 blinkers on my team and 1-2 disablers + carries.

Blinkers go purely offensive and steal shit from their candy basket. Have had great success with QoP and a Force Staff Riki.

Remaining three rotate between the closest lane and the basket with 2 defending the basket at all times. Have had easy games with Void, SFiend, Drow and Windrunner.

**Phase 2: Roshan chases a random hero alternating between Dire and Radiant.**

Keep doing what you did prior during the Roshan Chase sequence. Best thing to do is kite Roshan for as long as possible as each Candy gives him +1 Armor during Phase 3.

Once you have a distinct advantage, either turtle up at your basket or keep doing what you're doing but at 2mins remaining, go into deep turtle mode and make sure you spend whatever gold you have remaining and drop all candies at 10 seconds remaining for the XP.

**Phase 3: Roshan Boss**

Two main smash your face abilities cast by Roshan at this stage.

1. He will do a Charge Up animation and slam his fists into the ground and cause a shockwave which kinda resembles Shiva's. Closer you are to him, the more damage it does. I had 4k health with Ursa and got instagibbed.

2. Pretty much after the Slam, he will do a Sunstrike on each Hero's position which does 3k damage. Death to most non-Str heroes. Move the fuck away.

Other than that, you can burn his mana, sheep him etc etc.

**Phase 4: COLLECT YOUR ITEM LULZ!**","1351729762"

Have a great selection of snacks, most people I've seen on the field don't tend to have a meal. Also a good selection of sport drinks and juices, Ibwould stay away from sugary and Redbull type drinks, but that's my own preference. Good coffee, both for players and for parents or watchers. Have a good seating area, covered if possible, lots of space to move around. Lots of recycling and garbage, getting bottles for deposit could also throw some more cash in your wallet. ","1351729762"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I don't really consider it overcoming personally. Or at least not any more ""overcoming"" than a spellcaster having to balance out the use of their daily spells. There are pros and cons to any class. But arrows are cheap and commonly available. Unless your group is running through a number of dungeons/encounters without any chance to go back to town to resupply (which should really only happen rarely if at all IMO), it's not much of an issue.

As for making the projectile an integral part of the class itself, I feel that's what prestige classes (or magical items) are for. There are a lot of prestige classes that alter the projectiles being fired. Although I can't think of any classes that give you an unlimited supply of arrows, I imagine they exist. Plus, I know I've seen classes that give you the ability to treat any arrow you fire as having magical attributes, whether it's +1 or keen or what have you. I'm pretty sure Order of the Bow Initiate is one of them. Plus, arcane archer lets you attach spells to your arrows which has some really neat implications/uses.

As for the archer in my group, I'm pretty sure he had scout levels and I know he had OotBI. As for anything else, I'd have to search for his character sheet.","1351729763"

""Possession"" and obsession are highly charged terms, but entirely appropriate ones for bad habits and addictions.

I believe you are on your way toward moving beyond the need to enact this ritual which had ceased to be useful to you, and has, in fact, become more of a hindrance to you.

You've admitted you have a problem, which actually puts you way ahead of the game, as far as I can tell.

Now it's all a matter of finding the activities/processes that will help you to overcome this obsession.

Please look into CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) which is excellent at helping people to overcome specific negative behaviors.

States like Colorado and Washington are the bellwethers for the end of the drug war, and I think the general country could eventually feel more comfortable following in their footsteps, if Amendment 64 works in the first place. I am not blind of reality; I do not expect Gary Johnson to become president. But, I think my vote is more useful to him, and I prefer abstaining for voting for the ""lesser of two evils"" as people commonly say. I think it's a shame no president will do that soon, too, but Obama surely has fallen short on his drug policy promises. Just think, if New York wouldn't have stood up to the feds back in the Prohibition days, we might still not be allowed to drink alcohol. 

Sorry, but I don't consider being selfish, in this regard, to be a bad thing -- Colorado is doing something to benefit itself, and will it really affect the rest of the country in any way at all? I think it is has the potential to be a great step forward in our country's policies.","1351729766"

Not just money, but time with your children and your ability to be a large part of their lives. Spreading yourself too thin can mean that your children will ultimately suffer for it. Four children already equates to a large family, and perhaps your wife is feeling that strain. I would also add that you write that your relationship is strong enough to handle another child, but if this is enough to destroy your marriage, then I would have to disagree. 
Ultimately, however, it is not up to reddit, or your faith leader to decide this. If you want another child but your wife doesn't, that is it. You can't force her into it, and even if you did, she would resent you for the rest of your lives and possibly the child too. It seems to me that you are acting as if she is being unreasonable, but maybe she has other reasons to not want more children. Maybe she has kept her strain hidden from you, maybe she fears pregnancy again, as the more children you have and the older you get the more risks that are associated with pregnancy and childbirth, maybe she does not want your existing children to suffer for what is essentially greed. If she thinks you can't handle the stress, maybe you should try to find out why she feels that way instead of trying to convince her of something else.","1351729771"

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","If you go south of Hamilton (which is way beyond the GTA) things are very different.  You can also go west towards K-W where there's still cities and towns, but they're not at all part of the city.  The actual boundary is pretty difficult.  If you don't get at least a few minutes of farmland/forest between you and the city, you're in a community that basically feels and behaves as a suburb of Toronto.  The areas I mentioned are different in that most people don't commute to the GTA for work, they have their own industries and employment, and often differ demographically and politically from the city itself.  
I live in Niagara, and while it's about 1 to 1.5 hours to get anywhere but Scarborough, it's not at all like TO.  The niagara region basically starts just as you leave hamilton, and the whole area is not at all Toronto-centric, nor does it feel like a suburb.  There's forests, farmland, and proximity to the US border among other things that differentiates our region's economy and landscapes.  Homes are also cheap here, and big, with big yards (compared to anywhere within the GTA and surrounding area).","1351729773"

"crossfit","t5_2qqfd","Alright. I don't know the exact science of what is happening internally but here is what I think. You are disrupting your sleep at the most important or DEEP phase. Over time this will lead to adrenal fatigue and or a hormone imbalance. Your cortisol level are probably getting jacked up as well. The level should look like a down hill slope on a graph. Highest in the morning and lowest at night. With elevated cortisol levels at the time you are attempting to make up lost sleep. You will lack the proper chemical balance to achieve a deep state of rest. In your case you need to exercise less and rest more. I know it's hard because you love it but over exercising is a common issue for many people. Might I suggest a book on my to read list. It's called [lights out](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0671038680/ref=redir_mdp_mobile/176-8755425-5336642) and supposed to be an excellent book on health and sleep.

The first 2 or 3 weeks of getting them to go with you is hard because they lack motivation, aren't use to the routine and have yet to figure out the benefits of exercise. I find that after this 2 to 3 week period the person is motivated, generally feels better about themselves and ends up being the person to push me out the door when I want to skip exercsie. Just bet him that if he doesn't feel better about himself and just life in general after 3 weeks, you'll buy him a 6 pack of his choice. ","1351729783"

Science-fiction changes because culture and technology changes. It's a product of the time it's in and of the expected future of that time so invariably the themes will change to reflect that. All the basic tropes are there, they're just being explored from new angles asking different questions. There's plenty of big stories out there now, it's just different big.

Sometimes the track will flip you to your front/ back bumper faster than you can correct it.

As someone in exactly OP's shoes, I find this to be almost just as terrible. I think sex is an extremely important aspect in a couple's relationship.

Isn't one of the problems of Americans that they don't save enough and spend too much? Even during the recession, our retail sector has [boomed](https://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=NYSEARCA:XRT).

&gt; And I've still not heard specifics on what loopholes would be closed on corporations, to offset the 10% cut he proposes for them.

Hopefully none. Our corporate tax rates are ridiculous. We don't incentivize business to move overseas through our tax code. They outsource because labor is cheaper and no tax will fix that. What our tax code *does* promote through high rates are for companies to relocate their headquarters overseas in low tax zones or host intellectual property in places like Ireland. Google keeps its algos in Eire to reap the 12% tax rate on the profits derived from them worldwide as an export from Eire. This is bullshit. If we could get 11.5% effective tax rate for all of their assets to be in the United States, we would make a killing.

I we stopped attempting to tax overseas profits, and allowed companies to repatriate money tax-free, we could have a [$1.3 trillion](http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2012/07/16/idle-corporate-cash-piles-up/) stimulus without spending a penny of federal money.

&gt; Even though corporations are people, it wouldn't be practical to allow them a standard deduction...

They don't get one, they're only taxed on profits which means we subtract all legitimate business expenses from their revenue, and tax the remainder. The huge disparity we see between 35% marginal rates and effective rates are due to profits earned overseas that are deferred indefinitely. These companies will never bring this money back so long as we try to take 35% of it.","1351729795"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","A lot of people repeat this about e-ink displays but I'm not convinced.  And before you ask, YES I have seen and done reading on such devices.

Almost all e-ink readers (including Kindles) have a 600x800 resolution (the DX kindles are 824×1200, not much more).  There has been no drive in e-ink readers to increase resolution, because ""you can't see the pixels"" - and also because manufacturers of those devices don't tend to boast about resolution so there isn't much public awareness that the resolutions are so low.  The good quality anti-aliasing (lots of levels of grayscale) combined with the fact that the e-ink screen is made of many small grains as opposed to straight, precise, squared-off edges means that people don't notice the pixel boundaries, they just see ""soft text"" like on an old, coarse printed page and it looks natural and readable, having a ""softness"" to it that is characteristic of such screens.

You could get a similar effect resolution-wise (not brightness-wise) on a 1024x768 iPad if you gave a slight extra blurring to the edges of text.

As for eye strain from the backlighting - in 99.9% of cases I believe that people simply have the backlight brightness set too high.  The glare is from the screen being significantly brighter than a non-backlit object would be in the same light.  It doesn't help that most LCD screens have glossy surfaces which reflect background lights, which kind of necessitates having the brightness quite high in order to overcome the reflections.  If you can find an angle where there are no reflections, turn the brightness as far down as you can stand until your LCD is as dim as a (non-backlit) e-ink display (or if you don't have one of those, a normal newspaper) in the same light.  You'll find that you have to turn the backlight brightness way down further than you expect.  And it'll be dim enough that reflections on a glossy screen become a real problem.  But you will get rid of the ""eye glare"".

If they brought out LCD based tablets with non-reflective screens that would be awesome.

And as far as Mac Pros go, they are complete rip offs... *right now*, but they aren't always. In order to understand why this is, you have to understand how Apple prices things (retardedly). When a Mac gets an update, they're competitive on price, but the price never goes down as time goes on. The competitors do lower their prices as time goes on, and their stuff goes on sale. Macs never go on sale. So the current Mac Pros? They were last updated in 2010. So you're looking at 2010 hardware at a 2010 price. Silly I know, but that's the Apple way.","1351729798"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I would like to first off state that I certainly don't know everything when it comes to politics and invite you to please correct me if I present false facts and such.

As stated (and not argued against but please do so if I'm wrong here) the electoral college has the say in it all. Bush/gore debacle would be a nice reference to this. Your vote will not be a factor at all. If 10 million more went in to vote for Gore, Bush would still be elected to office. This is my reasoning until now for not voting.

It's unfortunate that the third party absorbs much of the democratic vote and agree with you here. I forgot the voting system (do you know?) that helps solve this problem but I am amazed that our system has not been changed because of this.

I was born, raised, and wouldn't imagine moving from California. So basically: Romney is the devil where I'm from haha. 

I would argue that I make plenty of a difference by merely stating my opinions without voting. Although this is rather new to me, Reddit is my playground where I get to use my megaphone (exaggeration :]  ). My one vote comparatively to the Internet community hearing my voice. All of my friends, family, and peers I get to bounce opinions and ideas off of. To call me a hypocrite for not voting seems a bit farfetched. The proliferation of ideas is much more effective than you give credit to. 

I do send letters to congress about important issues on occasion, though they are those Internet template ones that make it extremely convenient. On a tangent: are those letters even effective at all?

Couldn't agree with you more about system reform but that is a whole other topic I would love to dig into another time :)

Definitely voting this time (I have a $100 bet on the matter so that is in fact quite the incentive as well).

Geordilaforge, I would just like to say that I love your thoughts on the matter. I have never been much of a commenter on Reddit but I just broke the barrier today thanks to you.

I mean, wow, he might be on to something there! Maybe a food environment with a constant abundance of energy in easily-consumable forms could explain this whole obesity thing without having to do a bunch of handwaving about carbs and hormones!","1351729805"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I won't walk you through the entire meta game as it went, but here's my brief thoughts on how it is now, as a Platinum Protoss:

Zerg is dominant. WCS has [4 Terrans out of 32 players](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2012_Battle.net_World_Championship), Dreamhack had [two Terrans in the Ro16, both of who lost immediately.](http://wiki.teamliquid.net/starcraft2/2012_DreamHack_Open/Bucharest)

Tournament results don't say everything, but its the general opinion. They are able to play extremely economical and still get away with it, and they have the most powerful lategame composition.

The Zerg late-game composition is Infester Broodlord. Terrans have been using Thor\Viking\Siege Tank\Raven to beat this. Protoss rely on the Mothership (Vortex, and if you're lucky an Archon toilet) 

The games are generally more macro orientated then they were two years ago. Its incredibly rare for any player to not fast expand; and they try to get to a third base reasonably quickly. 

In PvZ, FFE is still the way to go. Zergs will typically go for quick 3base and mass Roaches, making it difficult to take a third -- Protoss players often just fall back to 2-base or 3-base timings vs Zerg.

PvT, 1 gate 30 food expand into 3gate robo is most common. Terrans do gasless expands. Heavy drop play at the midgame is their best chance to win, as lategame Protoss are at an advantage. (Ghosts have been nerfed quite a bit)

HR is testing your social competence as well as personality combatability and communication skills.  

An exec is looking for applicable quantifiable skills which he might make use of.  As the scope of HR is generally fairly large and concentrated on the humanities aspects of an organization, a high degree of specialized or technical knowledge is not necessary to do that job.  Given that many HR departments oversee so many different branches of companies, it isn't possible for them to be able to ask pointed questions regarding materials engineering, python coding, legal case studies, industrial design, biochemical engineering, or questions about the socioeconomic conditions of Western Russia.  If they had a knowledge base that wide and varied, they would not be limited to a job in HR.  This is why you generally do multiple interviews at larger companies for a specific position therein.

Actually I wasn't aware of how bad tesla's profitability was. In which case, yes tesla has a bad business model.

What I was actually getting at was:

&gt;is being sued by numerous car dealers because they don't sell their cars through dealerships, which is required by law in those states.

And the fact that these companies or entities are suing Tesla because they are using a different business model then they are - in effect profitability through litigation instead of profitability through innovation.

But you assumed that I think That capitalism is all bad? No no - what is bad is when there are laws that protect out dated business models, and lack of checks and balances that protect the individuals and employees from abuse. But the idea of capitalism? Is not evil. Ideas lack the ability to be inherently evil. And promoting capitalism is not bad either - it is simply one way of doing things.

TL;DR - I was talking about Profitability through litigation by certain companies, and laws that are outdated and inhibit innovation.","1351729816"

I find that carbs put me to sleep, so I try to eat eggs for breakfast (instead of cereal or toast) for those days when I know I need to be awake in class.  Depending on how big the class is, I sometimes eat in class.  Obviously this is obnoxious in a small class, but it's not noticeable in a big lecture and I can't fall asleep if I'm eating...

There's also the obvious solution of making sure you're getting enough sleep at night and try taking a quick nap during the day.  My lunch usually consists of meal + nap and it's a great mid-day energy booster.

Other than that, if it's a class I need to pay attention to, I try to be really, really good about note taking.  I'll OCDly color code my notes or something that makes them more interesting.  If you just need to stay awake (i.e. quality of notes doesn't matter), try doodling or taking notes with your non-dominant hand.  Or doodle with your non-dominant hand.

A couple years ago...

I was at a friend's bd party at a karaoke, and one of the persons she invites is a mates ex-gf HB8 (and to this day i get the feeling that he still loves her).

She came with a male friend of her work, and since i was the only person that she knew besides him and the bd girl, she saw me and sit next to me. And here is when it got crazy i was just chatting with her regular stuff work and stuffs. She is ignoring this guy that came with her so the guy goes try to hook up. After she had 3 beers she starts getting really ""gigy with it"" and gives me a lap dance and then puts her ass on my face and shakes it. I stood there astonished, i literally did not how to react just froze there.

Then she goes to the whole place mic in hand singing and been silly.
And i took it as ""meh she is like that outgoing"" ""she is not flirting with me"", So after this little display she finished her beer, and said bye, and i could tell she was kind of annoyed. Now that i think back i could have F-closed, but then again i want no problems with me mates.

The communication drop is hard, but I find it to be easier to keep busy while he's busy.  Another thing is you could have a specific time every day that is talk time, that way you can work your schedules around to accommodate.  Also, it's good to communicate your feelings right off the bat.  It saves a lot of time prying at each other to get to the truth when you could be talking about other things.

Oo!  Just thought of something else!  Whenever my SO is in bed and I can't talk to him due to work or something, I will write him a ""swapnote"" on my 3DS.  It's a little letter you can draw on that gets sent to another 3DS via wifi.  That way, when he gets up in the morning, he has a little letter from me and what I was thinking about while he was dreaming away.  It's a good way to vent out your feelings and feel like you're still communicating when you can't.  If you don't have a 3DS, emails work just as well!

"beards","t5_2qn08","If someone has uneven growth then you need to get a trimmer to keep it looking good, you dont need to bring this decision to committee, you have a mirror and can figure this out yourself.  A beard, like all questions on appearance, is subjective and no one will be a greater critic than yourself.  There are people out there who are just not predisposed to being bearded, it's a sad fact of life, but if your only at 2 weeks, we cant really help you, there isnt enough to go on unless it's the start of an epic beard and can look good in that time frame, which make the question irrelevant.

Having a beard is less of an absolute objective thing as it is a subjective social issue.  Many employers have issues with beards, those working with machinery, food or the armed services come immediately to mind, so obviously you cant be bearded while working in those conditions.  But secondary, if you have a close lady friend who will be upset about beard rash near her lady parts, then you have to chose between the beard or her, this is a simple choice(beard).

A single man with hair on the vast majority of his face(a man) has no reason to shave unless he wants to, and if he wants to, what is he doing on /r/beards ?

Proper care and maintenance of a beard? This is your place. Whether you can pull of a beard? Ask around at work or school or a bar or any other place where people can really experience the beard, a single bad phone pic cant do a bead justice, these are 3d living things, they must be experienced to be judged.

Now, if you're looking to do a steroid cycle, people say wait till you're around 22-25, since that typically when males are finished growing and have gone through puberty, but people have done cycles younger than this and still been ok (at least atm). 

Given how relatively new steroids are in relation to the lasting effects until old age, its unsure if this will have much of an impact, chances are probably not, so its your body, its part of the risks, up to you.","1351729841"

* $21,800

You can see each person is clearly considerably better off then the person below them. You can do a great deal more with 870k than you can with even 43k.

Let's turn this into a progressive system shall we. 

* 40% of a $1 Mil = $400,000
* 13% of $50k = $6,500
* 5% of $25k =  $1,250

In Halo CE that was the first known encounter with the Flood. They did live on other Halos locked away as part of the Forerunner studies on the Flood, and on other worlds out of the reach of Covies and the UNSC. Meaning the Flood on those worlds never knew about us there fore never had a reason to leave those worlds.

I dont think the SoF will return in Halo 4 or they would have teased it in one of the trailers, but I do hope on day they ""make it back to Earth"" aka make it into a new game, and I hope that game is one of the new Halos (5 or 6).","1351729851"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Okay ""custom"" is a retarded term to begin with, because what is a Templar action if not mildly tweaked Remington 700 long action? 

Remington does not just sloppily make a tub full of 700 actions and use them across their product range. The custom shop as far as what you can get out of Remington they also have a small division for Military and law enforcement actions. These are the base of their top quality rifles and are crafted the same way those shiny custom actions are. They leave the shop trued. Aside from the fact that you can look at say a standard BDL action and look at either the Police, M24, or Varmint, or custom shop action you will see how much of a difference there is. 

What pitfalls does the base Remington 700 have exactly? The article itself did not recognize the source of said 700 action and if it were the loose sold ones from a couple of years ago they were pretty crappy. 

The article lists a scope base as an option the Remington doesn't have. NO SHIT. As well as a Fluted Bolt. which has its uses in extreme cold, but not much else. And the M16 extractor, which seems like a waste of money since the standard extractor does a damn fine job as it is. The tactical bolt knob is not going to make you shoot any better. 

So I think you are mistaking me saying a specific run of Remington 700 actions will compete with Custom actions for ""all 700 actions will be awesome and buying a custom action is silly.""(paraphrasing).

and ""Better"" is subjective in its self. I'm cheap, and can get one of the listed Remington actions for 300 dollars, not $1000 plus just for an action. 

and In regards to the ""rumor"" that the Police and Varmint barreled actions are the same, call or email Remington and they will tell you they are of the same manufacture. Only differences are that Varmints have a different coating and are not shot before shipping. ","1351729856"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Two people are put up before you and if the last few debates are anything to go by they are almost promising the same things. Just changing the amount you pay to your healthcare for example does not makes them worlds apart different than each other, it as illusion, nothing will improve they have not promised to change anything apart from a few numbers here and there. You are no longer voting for the best leader but whoever sounds the best on TV or if you are really a super idiot you can maybe vote for the next Bush in 40 years.

The US was so far ahead in science and growth over the last century, now every new person that comes to office seems content in the fact that they will inevitably fall behind the likes of China and India just because they have larger populations (ie they can buy more big mac burgers). All they want to do is to improve on the Big mac index. Change things for fuck sakes and challenge those countries to do the same. So sick and tired of the race for the best TV series or the largest skyscraper, they are not important for the future of mankind. Where is the colonisation of Mars, where is the mining of asteroids or the moon. Companies are making excessive profits and are not being forced to put most of it back into creating more jobs. Excessively wealthy is a problem and they are wasting their money on broken promises like this election so they can make more money to waste.

The leaders of this world just seem content for us to ruin this planet and die out eventually or let the people that have disaster on their hands deal with it then but it is OK at least we can watch the next episode of the Vampire diaries on our leather lazy boy with a big mac. Or if you are really lucky your Dad had invented the super square touch screen that was 7.2 inches and someone tried to copy it, then you get two big macs and a foot stool.

History books will remember us as the 100 years of the fat lazy idiots that idolised skinny girls with big boobs and almost destroyed the planet. That is if there are people after our era to write these stories.

Now the elections have turned into the most expensive reality TV show ever, what benefit has this given the US and world when this reality show has only shown how much money we have wasted so we can elect someone else to waste more money.

As someone that is not from the US, this election for the worlds most powerful man does not instil confidence for a positive future of humankind as neither of your candidates care about anything other than money and they are not even good at acquiring it. ","1351729857"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","You sound a little defensive, as if you're trying to say you like ponies, but you're rationalizing it and saying it would be weird.

Like three months ago I would have said yes but now, I would still say yes but in a different way. I still would wan't to have sex with a pony, but not really a character, maybe Fluttershy, Octavia, Luna, Lyra, you know? But I really don't like mlp anymore so this answer is based on purely a sexual standpoint.

Ponies are probably the sexiest things I've ever seen in my life, not exactly the characters, just what they are, their legs, their eyes, their manes, their mouths, everything is perfect. I would totally have sex with them but I wouldn't want to live in Equestria or any of that bullshit. I would like to keep one but she probably wouldn't like it because she would have to hide and just hang out in my house.

A one night thing? Totally, anyone really. I don't like all of them but even if Rainbow Dash was my only option I would say yes. I don't know how they would translate in real life but there are plenty fan art pictures that show a good example.

I don't think I would be to comfortable with one around me because, I wouldn't know what to do? Do I feed it? Do I pay attention to it? I don't care what I do around my dog because he's a fucking dog, do I treat her like a human and talk to her? Back to my dog, what if he flips shit because there is a god damn flying pony in my house. I couldn't leave her alone because thats not fair at all, and she might fuck something up or answer the door and screw our deal up. I can't take her in public.

I would totally keep her forever but I don't think it would be a paradise, for her especially. Regardless of how I treat her she is basically a sex slave and that all well and good for a roleplay situation but it would be her life and she can't get away from it. At least I would have some information on her and know what to do a little bit. If she got into the hands of some hick across the street she is fucked.

Bottom line, I think I would be too selfish to pass it up but my life would be stressful as hell trying to figure out what to do with her afterwards. So many things would have to be accounted for and in the end, she wouldn't like it, and neither would you after awhile. I don't know if you would be taking her from ""Equestria"" of whatever or if she is just appearing and doesn't know how to talk or eat or fly or whatever, in that case, no I wouldn't do it, I'm not raising a god damn pony just so I can fuck it. Otherwise, yes, like I said I would be too selfish and I couldn't pass it up.

Now to how it would work, I don't know. I guess the act of sex would be pretty normal, shes basically a horse, just a lot cuter. If she spoke english and had a basic understanding of the situation and was reasonable to let me talk to her and explain how this is going to work, then it would be pretty fine. Although, other things like going outside, telling people, etc. would be hard to work out.

I would need a Celesta to check up on her and tell me what she eats and if she is sick she is pretty shit out of luck unless I can buy some OTC medication for her. I wouldn't have to worry about her being pregnant, right? I don't think she can get pregnant by a human.

Anyway, sure. But she would have to live up to the exceptions of a canon pony, like knowing basics like English, eating, walking, etc. ","1351729859"

The Romney campaign went out with five thousand dollars and spent it on stuff to ""donate"". If they had just sent that money to the red cross, it would have done a lot lot more good than what they did.

The Red Cross is just not a ""charity"". It's not the SVP or Habitat for Humanity. They're a disaster relief agency. When an earthquake, hurricane, tsumani or whatever happens they're fast-responders. They're priority is getting what's needed where it's needed *as fast as possible*. The logistics of collecting blankets from donors, making sure the blankets are cleaned and packaged and then moving them from the donation location, to a distribution center and then out to where they're needed is a lot of work.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got this idea from some website and decided to try it out 2 years ago:

I dressed up wearing a jacket that was way too big, huge jeans, and worn out shoes. I put little bits of straw sticking out of the shoes, pants, jacket, ect. On my face I wore a straw hat and a cheap scarecrow mask. I took one of those foldable chairs and put it on my porch, sitting completely still with a basket of candy on my lap and a sign saying ""Take One Only Please!"" My hands lay inert near the basket. I didn't have to wait long until the little children started trickling in. At first they were nice, taking only one piece and mistaking me for a shabby scarecrow decoration. Then a little girl came with her uncle. The uncle waited on the driveway while she walked forward to get her goodies. First she grabbed one, then she looked around furtively and grabbed a whole handful. Now I sprung into action: Suddenly I came alive, first with my head snapping up to look at her, my arm grabbing her candy-ridden hand, and my best raspy voice saying ""ONLY ONE!"" I have never seen so much terror on a person's face. Her uncle grasped the situation pretty quickly and was laughing for a good 3 minutes before moving on.","1351729863"

How will she react when the problem is actually a big deal? Composure under pressure is a legitimate factor that employers evaluate. Some don't care about your attitude, but some do, and I appreciate the ones who do. I don't want to work with or for someone who starts screaming every time there's a problem.

No one here (to my knowledge) has ever disputed the idea that confidence matters, or lifestyle improvement is more rewarding than pure seduction techniques, or how fashion changes your game, etc. 

We know it, we do it. But this sub is about **seduction**, we want to know how to **seduce women** and that comes down to knowing the techniques. Self-development is incredibly important and that should be your goal with or without success with women, but when it comes down to it sometimes you just need to know how to pass a shit-test, kino, and all the rest. 

Confidence and inner balance *is* everything. But you can't go from zero to superstar in a day. Remember kaizen. Constant, steady improvement over a long period of time is the name of the game and that's what all these techniques are for. ","1351729868"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","My dad wasn't there for me in the strictest sense.  He handed me books on physics and biology.  He worked every day of his life to provide me with better opportunities.  He told me to find my own way, to learn from my mistakes, and that I should take no one at their word...trust but verify (a Reagan quote despite his liberal leanings) and take all things in moderation.  He taught me honesty, virtue, and the willingness to look before I leap...yet to land where logic takes me (as opposed to where the social world says I should be).  He taught me that you fight for what's right and real, not imagined and beyond your ken.

My dad's an asshole and fucked my social sensibilities over for the rest of my life (comes with that whole honesty bit)...but I love him because at least I know I'm not going to Disney guys throwing lemmings over a cliff.  My mom on the other hand grounded me in the other reality (15 years too late and too little...but c'est la vie), the reality that the social world is not ready for the real world.  Each generation should prepare the next until eventually we are living in the here and now with eyes towards the future.  

Both however taught me to never stop learning, because despite reading Plato, Nietzche, Asimoff and beyond, there is always another man with another little reflection of logic you never thought to look at.  The world is not the past, the present or the future, it is all three and to look only one-dimensionally is to lose a whole facet of the universe.  

Kudos to your dad for giving you grounding in one world, but don't forget the other.  If you cannot translate others' fantasies into the real world, you'll never be able to help the rest of the world catch up.  ","1351729871"

"bootroom","t5_2s927","Here's something that landed me on varsity as a freshman, much to the dismay of the older players who got bumped to JV:

Go 150% for absolutely everything. Show up for each training session like it's the last chance you'll ever get, and treat every single play in every single game the same way. Show up for training and tryouts early, be ready to go, and work as hard as you can. Of course, don't do reckless things that will get you or your (future) teammates injured, but never, EVER give less than everything you have at any point.

Chances are, you're better than at least half of the players on the team - at the very least, better than they were when they were your age. This is natural, due to the fact that youth football has been improving drastically in quality and organization over the past couple of decades. Kids are doing things now at young ages that I wasn't taught until I was a teenager. Be confident in your ability, but ready to take direction and willing to do whatever is asked of you by the coaches.

Work on skills you feel are lacking now and keep developing those attributes which you feel are your strengths. You think you're fast now? Put in work to try to be faster. That's all simple, though. You know what you need to improve on and it's likely fairly simple to make improvements. Watch as many high-level matches as possible, and focus on your ability to read the game, especially if you feel you may end up as a defender. Do interval sprints and hard physical work to get yourself ready for the conditioning phase of training and tryouts - it's the first thing nearly every high school program does.

The biggest boost you can give yourself is to be mentally prepared and focused. Never give less than 150% effort for any activity. This will stand out massively, especially in a young player. You will make many of the older kids, who probably feel confident that they'll keep their place on the team, nervous. It's a good thing.","1351729872"

And now that I was satisfied with its performance within its budget, I've decided to pump a little money into it. Hellkites and Zealots were on the list! So thanks for the confirmation!

"circlejerk","t5_2qpol","Rare candy level ups are always the same as regular ones.
The rumor that a pokemon leveled up to 100 via rare candies is not as strong as one that got there through battling is only partially true.

In pokemon, there are a few things that will influence your stats (besides what pokemon you are). There are individual values (IVs), effort values (EVs), levels, and in later games nature.

IVs are basically genetics. One IV point in a particular stat correlates to an additional stat point at level 100. Therefore, a pokemon with higher IVs will have a slightly higher stat potential than a pokemon with lower IVs. IVs are set as soon as you encounter the pokemon and can't be changed.

EVs are basically experience. You gain EVs through battling (also through vitamins, but only to a certain extent), up to a max of 255 EVs per stat and 510 EVs total (Gen 1 did not have the 510 total EV cap, so you could get the maximum number of EVs in every stat). Every four EV points correlates to 1 stat point at level 100.

Levels are obvious. Every time you level, you get stats, so a higher leveled pokemon will generally have higher stats.
Natures are like personalities. They essentially boost one stat by about 10% and decrease another by 10%. For example, the Modest nature boosts Special Attack by 10% and decreases Attack by 10%.

Basically, leveling up a fresh pokemon to 100 via only rare candies will result in an overall weaker pokemon, as that pokemon has to effort values. However, if a pokemon already is maxed out on effort values and you level it the rest of the way to 100 via rare candies, then it will be exactly the same as if you had battled it all the way to 100.

TL;DR: Leveling up to 100 with rare candies in any game will result in a slightly weaker pokemon because it does not have any ""battle experience"". However if your pokemon is already maxed on ""battle experience"", then feel free to stuff it with as many rare candies as you want to.","1351729881"

That's his right, for sure. More power to him and all that... but that's not really a ""good"" or ""bad"" thing about Romney.

Part of it is also your phrasing. You could also have posted the same basic story, only as ""Romney charitable donations were to LDS, which he used as a tax write-off"" and it'd be a far more accurate description, though still not pro-Romney.

The biggest problem with pro-Romney, is there aren't really any honest ones. I didn't support Bush when he ran, but the man did have some good things about him, some pro's. Romney, he's pretty much bad across the board, and everything I've seen that would present him favorably have been ridiculous spin, or outright false. 

If donating to his church as a tax write-off is the best there is, he's gonna have a bad time; that's like a +0 in my book.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","""Good"" and ""evil"" somehow match exactly what our biological imperatives dictate.

We are social animals and therefore society is important. However, we still have the survival instinct. In this, we require resources to live.

Many social animals have the same actions we have. Given our larger and more complex brain, our social norms are likewise more complex. But at the base, they are no different than dogs or apes.

It is not good to kill someone in your own in-community. That is ""evil,"" whatever ""evil"" is supposed to mean.

As far as ""all is permitted,"" that really is a perfect description for religion. Why, you ask? Because all is forgiven by the christian mythological deity, as long as the proper ablutions and mea culpas are performed. As a christian, one *truly* can do *anything* and get into heaven. Atheists, on the other hand, think this life is all there is. If they get thrown into jail for 30 years, that is 30 years off their one and only life, and therefore, atheists have a much greater reason to be ""good."" 

&gt;creating your own meaning is still meaningless, reality cares not for your artificial creations.

This is just some random meaningless phraseology that you created. Meaning comes from the brain. The brain is a physical object. It *is* reality, and the thoughts it creates are electronic impulses, which are real. A person takes information from the environment (reality) by their 5 senses and integrates this information together inside their brains. This is all the definition of reality (as long as we're not talking solipsism).

You are trying to take reality, other than your own, and trying to make it meaningless by putting artificial constructs upon reality that does not fit your own definitions. YOU are the one that is denying reality.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Uncooked wheat flour is really harsh in your innards.  The problems it causes tend to be rather subtle as it is not easy to see irritation of the intestines and bowel.  Even properly cooked wheat can cause gut leakage, inflammation, and a range of other problems.  There are various sources for this information, but one of the more accessible is the recent book Wheat Belly.  Eating wheat is not necessarily a good idea even if you are going to cook it, and eating it raw could contribute to serious problems like Cron's Disease or other digestive complications.  Being healthy and treating food like medicine is a much safer way to go, and there are lots of other ways to enjoy life with less risk.","1351729898"

"politics","t5_2cneq","And that is exactly what I said, is it not?  They took the goods because, shit, Romney's campaign already drove (was driving?) them out there.

That is not the same things as providing hot meals and dry clothing to thousands, medical care to those in need, or starting the repair process.  All of which, 5K in a monetary donation would have been able to contribute to.  Romney severely limited the impact of his aid donated so that he could get a photo op.


EDIT: I didn't address Obama.


1) First, I am sure both candidates have given to Red Cross, or another charity, privately.  I am glad neither of them are trumpeting that they did, or how much, as that would be disgusting.


2)Along the same lines, if Obama's campaign did donate, along the same lines as 1), I am glad they are not trumpeting it.  If you want to help, HELP.  Don't help so that you can get publicity.  But if that's the only way you will help... well then its better than nothing.

No, people die because kidneys are a commodity. Demand exceeds supply and therefore people die for want of a vital resource.

&gt;You just repetitively say the child has a right to life at the expense of the body of the mother, while contradictorily claiming the person in need of a kidney does not have a right to life at the expense of your body.

You're ignoring the parental responsibility to care for their children.

&gt;The mother's body does not belong to the child, your body does not belong to the kidney patient.

You're right. But the fetus's body does not belong to the mother either.

&gt;In that situation there is no denying that the life you are sacrificing for the convenience* of your body is an intelligent human.

Someone in kidney failure dies for want of a rare resource, not because I willingly sacrifice them. If you want to extend such culpability in that direction, then we're all directly responsible for not carrying jugs of water to Africa and providing drinks to those dying of thirst.","1351729910"

Arrays in C start at 0, not 1. You write entries into the array starting at index 1, but then pull out highest (and lowest) from index 0. What's up with that

This code:

    int n,i,j; // n demotes the number of studentsint 
    float scores[n]; // an array of type float with size n

doesn't work. You can't allocate arrays that way in C. If you don't know about dynamic allocation (does ""malloc"" ring any bells?) then set some sort of ""big enough"" array and complain if the user tries to enter more students.

    #define MAX_STUDENTS 256
    float scores[MAX_STUDENTS];

Final tidbit - you don't actually need to allocate an array in the first place. You can compute the average score, highest score, and lowest score perfectly easily without storing all the scores in an array.","1351729913"

Just so you know, I've played through all the Quest for Glory games  multiple times. My favorites are 1 and 4 because I like the European-like settings and the monsters and scenarios in both of those. QFG2 would have to be favorite after that, but they are all wonderful games. Some of my favorite aspects of the games are finding things that I think are supposed to be secret. Like the thieves guilds for example - you could play through the whole game without noticing they exist, so uncovering these ""hidden"" aspects in each game was truly a delight. I have bought all the Quest for Glory games multiple times (even though I still have functioning copies) because if I see it on sale new somewhere, I just have to buy it as a show of my support (I hope you guys see some of that money :D). 

I hope that if you continue to make games, you will implement some of these hidden little adventures and areas - it is such a thrill to think I'm sneaking around in someone's house (the sheriff even!) when I'm not supposed to, and I'm afraid I might get caught.","1351729913"
"webdev","t5_2qs0q","Though the lines between positions blur quite a bit when work needs to get done, typically a studio will have a designer create a mockup.

That can be in photoshop, a wireframing kit, or (most preferably) a working rough HTML of the page. Then, the front and back end developers work together to realize the designer's vision with web technologies. Front end creates the client-facing code, making the HTML page, styling in CSS: colors, typography, layout, etc. Animations are done in CSS and JS, as well as other interactive elements. Remember, depending on the skills required for a job, WordPress theming, vs a shop making Ruby on Rails apps, there will be different requirements of a front end developer.

Then, probably while the designers and front-end are doing their thing, the back end folk will be creating the services that give the page its data. So that's making sure the time prints out correctly, that someone's tweet gets saved, making sure that calendar is correct. You get the idea.

Depending on the scope of your projects, you'll have to all of these positions yourself unless you work with someone. It's going to take a lot of effort, time, and energy to get comfortable banging out web apps, and design and development are two fundamentally different skills that must work hand in hand to create the user experiences you get now.

The DOM (Document Object Model, a.k.a. how CSS and JS interact with HTML) and styling/interaction coding in JS is most important to a front end dev, while web programming skills in javascript, ruby, java, scala, or python are needed to develop the back end services.

As you learn more about how web applications work, you'll intuitively understand the different between front end and back end work. If it happens in their browser, it's probably frontend's domain, if it happens on your server, it's probably backend's domain.

To answer your question about time: becoming skilled in web development takes many weeks and months, mastering it takes years. You'll find that the knowledge barrier to entering web development is typically much higher than web design, as web design (frontend is like, half designer, half developer) employs the core DOM tech (HTML, CSS, some JS). On the other hand, web development is easiest to learn to someone with a lot of programming experience already.

However, if you find the web as cool as I do, you'll be able to look back in six months and gasp at how far you've come, and how there's infinitely more to still learn. Work hard, always be making something, even (especially?) if it's bad, and apply your good taste. You can't help but learn and get better.","1351729914"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;If we believe the word of the bible then it is an unavoidable conclusion that we have both free will and determinism. 

No it's not. There is nowhere in the Bible where it says we have freewill. It says we may make ""freewill offerings"" which are free of social and religious obligation and that are made on the basis of our inner constitution. It does not say that these offerings are made as the consequence of some metaphysically free-will.

Indeed the Bible says that God forms us unto honor or destruction and it is not of our wills (e.g. Romans 9:16,21)

In Exodus when Aaron and Moses are going to Pharaoh to have the Israelites released God says ""I will hardened Pharaoh's heart"" and Pharaoh's heart becomes hardened. This is stated repeatedly throughout the old testament but primarily in Exodus where it is stated more than a dozen times. Once it says that Pharaoh hardened his own heart. How could Pharaoh harden his own heart if God hardened Pharaoh's heart? The answer is simple; God *is* Pharaoh. Pharaoh does not make any decisions independent of God's omnipotence, all of Pharaoh's choices are by divine providence including his choice to harden his own heart. When Jesus said ""I and the Father are One"" this is what he meant, not that he specifically was God, but that God is so close to us, and so fundamental to our being, that we do nothing without God. We do not have power independent of God, not even will-power, as this would certainly cut into God's omnipotence.

It is identical in a way to say that as human beings we do not make free choices but are determined this way or that because of the organization of our brains, genetics and the laws of physics. In this secular view we are not separate from Nature. It is Nature who acts through us, not we who act within Nature. All is Nature and no one acts outside of Nature's law but is fully determined by it.

This is what it says in the sacred Hindu text The Baghavad Gita: *God is with you at all times; through the activities of mind, senses, breathing, and emotions; and is constantly doing all the work using you as a mere instrument.*

In that perspective, Pharaoh and God are One, Jesus and the Father are One. And free-will is a load of crap believed by people who are all puffed up on themselves and desire to weild power they do not actually have. Think about the account of Lucifer having done all of his work in his own name, having taken glory for himself for that which he could only do with the power of God. The story signifies that Lucifer was not his own but was a property of God and though Lucifer was a property of God and could not act independently of God he desired to be like God and have free-will and to earn praise on that basis. Thus Lucifer was cast down to hell because through his **pride** he denied God.","1351729916"

You don't at all see a problem with the claim that the country  is on the verge of some sort of popular revolt against the oligarchy   &gt; when they are dangerously close to electing a prototypical oligarch president? I'm not even talking about partisanship here. The fact the Romney is a Republican is not the point.

The phrase I used is a ""fraying of the edges.""  I'm not sure what mindset reads that and concludes with a claim of impending popular uprising, and I fear it would be rude to speculate.

&gt; Speechless. I have no idea how to respond to that except to say that self-marginalization such as this is exactly what gets you ignored. Apathy doesn't get you noticed or listened to. What you're saying here is ""No matter who wins, they won't have us to thank!"" and considering it some kind of a principled success story when it's really just total failure to grasp the meaning of political power and how one obtains it.

Yeah, it's self-marginalization that gets people ignored.  Not continuing to vote for the party that continues to race to the right because it knows it can always scare you into obedience.  Definitely not that.  And you deny the two major parties are both subservient to corporate power?  Instead of your condescending dismissal, how about you tell me how many Wall Street fat cats responsible for the state of the global economy have seen the inside of a court room?  What is the effective difference between Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner/Larry Summers?  What benefit do we gain when Obama supports NAFTA and CAFTA instead of Romney?  

Political power is in the vote.  People who vote for a candidate who actually represents their views, consistently and as a priority, can move the political culture in ways far, far beyond anyone who votes Obama because they're afraid of what Romney might do.  Your statement implies any movement not explicitly for either the Democrats or the Republicans is worthless to the political process.  This is by far the most poisonous attitude and is to blame for the fact that self-identified liberals convince themselves to live with ""not-as-bad"" because it could be marginally worse. 

&gt; What evidence do you have for what feels to me like a blind hope?    Maybe Occupy prompted some people to get really politically engaged and stay that way, but how many others were simply disillusioned by  the mess it became? And how are even those remaining political actors going to accomplish anything if they're happy to do little more than the political equivalent of sitting outside the partisan circle of power and shout insults and criticism?

I'm still not the person claiming OWS espoused any of these goals as a movement.  As I spelled out before, it's an organic result of existing attitudes and frustrations.  They are a small part of a much wider swathe of disaffected people.

&gt;I don't want to be rude,

But you're going to be rude.  Go on.


&gt;but when you suggest that things like an anti-drone bloc are at ""peak influence"" it appears to me as a borderline deluded sentiment. To attribute America's marginal aversion to war following more than a decade of middle east quagmire to some mostly invisible resurgent left is just... not credible. The drug war is losing popularity, sure, but how do you figure that it's the lefts doing? I think you'd be just as justified to credit the libertarians, and, personally, I feel it's just a relic of bygone a era of social unrest. It's not that the left is winning that fight so much as younger generations don't relate to the culture clashes that formed the unspoken foundation and justification for the policy in the first place.

I didn't say the dissent against the drug war comes solely from the left.  Nor did I say the movement against the endless war machine is strictly of the left.  The left is a big part of it, but it absolutely is also a resurgent libertarian, traditional conservative movement.  The reason Ron Paul's ( and no, I don't support him, so don't bother) candidacy was valuable is that he was the only candidate to stand on that stage, from either party, and say we should not be involving ourselves in foreign military operations as a way of life.  No Democrat said that.  No Democrat will.  In case you haven't noticed, Carl Levin just sent out a *reassuring* message to Jewish voters to assuage them of any fears that Obama would not absolutely attack Iran if Israeli felt it necessary.  

&gt;Just look at this political campaign season. We couldn't even get one of the candidates to mention climate change. Practically no one criticizes the drone war except a handful of left-wing bloggers, and certainly no one with any real political clout.

Exactly.  Who's pressuring the Democrats--the so-called environmentalist party--to talk about climate change?  The people who care about the environment but will vote for them anyway?  Sounds viable.  I'm sure if we vote them all in *just one more time* they'll all suddenly be liberal again.

&gt;The fact that people are willing to answer in the negative when a survey asks them if they condone what amounts to open political corruption and do little else hardly speaks of a mass movement waiting in the wings. Especially considering your open indifference to whether or not the presidency is held by a person who has spoken out against the problem (Obama) as apposed to a man who has literally publicly stated that ""corporations are people.""

I have no stated indifference.  My earlier point was regarding subservience to Wall Street.  Is there truly an effective difference between the two candidates when it comes to ensuring what happened in 2008 will not happen again?

I prefer Obama to Romney.  But I don't think it's acceptable to continue to accrue losses on so many fronts because the Democrats are better on a few issues.  By that logic, we'll all be held hostage so long as they can claim one single issue in which they're preferable.  I want people to realize they have as many candidates as they can force into the picture.  It won't be instant and it won't be easy, but it can be done.  Democratic apologists like yourself make it substantially more difficult.","1351729918"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I adore them if they give me an extra objective in a game. I never care about them if they're earned for just playing the game. If they're rewarded for strange behaviour or going out of your way to do something they can change the way the game is played. If I enjoyed the game and want to keep playing it, it's nice that I'm given extra little things to do and strive for. I'm buying a lot of games on Steam at the moment because they have some interesting achievements I can strive for.

There's little I love more than seeing achievements for such things as never killing anyone or using only one weapon during the entire game. I've played Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Dishonored and Mirror's Edge in entirely different ways since I began caring about certain achievements, it's an awesome feeling to go through an entire game not knowing whether or not you were successful until the achievement message pops up at the last moment.

I'm really surprised to hear the hate for achievements. People say they're a 'cancer' of modern gaming and only stupid kids care about them. I have no idea why so many people think that's the case. They don't seem that different to high scores in Sonic the Hedgehog to me, they just something extra to strive for if you really want to, they're not intrusive and won't affect gameplay.

With collectable I rarely find myself caring about them. I cared when playing Canis Canem Edit, because I knew there'd be a bouncy reward it the end of it, the gameplay was good enough for me to not get bored while doing it, I wanted the game to last as long as possible so I was happy to do these extra things.

I recently completed Saint Row The Third a few hours ago, I planned on making it the first game I completed 100%, I finished at 98%, turn out I have to play it again to go through the alternate choice paths. I really enjoyed finding all 80 collectibles in the game, just because I enjoyed playing the game and didn't want it to end. I'd get 3 mascot homies and we'd drive around in my Knoxville golf cart. A lot of the fun comes from doing things yourself and finding collectibles gives me a chance to not follow objectives and just move around the game world in fun ways.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Unfortunately your honeymoon period is over and you'll just have to space your rolls apart. Everyone experiences this eventually and this is why most people only roll a few times a year. 5-HTP is more of a placebo so I wouldn't invest in it. Antidepressants, specifically the classes SSRI and SNRI, can actually make suicidal thoughts worse. In fact, when my friend tried to come off of paxil years ago she had to go on suicide watch and just recently a friend committed suicide while using a popular SSRI. I was on paxil too when I was younger and the complaints my friend made before she left us were eerily similar to my qualms with the drug. Would you rather be a robot or experience the rolling valleys of human emotion? However suicide is serious and although I wouldn't recommend an SSRI or SNRI there are other options and perhaps it's best if you took a break from ""illegal"" drugs. However, any thing that modulates the serotonin system will strongly affect how your body reacts to psychedelics and MDMA. I found a strong mushroom trip every few months to work best for me. The whole point of seeing a therapist is to talk and get feedback psychedelics at least for me let me have an honest conversation with myself. ","1351729927"

It can be hard to see projectiles and where they come from, tooltips are sometimes incorrect, cast times for a lot of spells are really long, etc.

Not if the abortion were needed to save her life. Never. Because life is sacred."" 

Below is the text. Where does it say what the headlines imply? It doesn't of course. Leonard Pitts Jr. of the miamiherald.com is full of bullshit. Of course. What else is new? Just some more fear-mongering by the left.


""We oppose using public revenues to promote or perform abortion or fund organizations which perform or advocate it and will not fund or subsidize health care which includes abortion coverage.

Republican leadership has led the effort to prohibit the barbaric practice of partial-birth abortion and permitted States to extend health care coverage to children before birth. We urge Congress to strengthen the Born Alive Infant Protection Act by enacting appropriate civil and criminal penalties on healthcare providers who fail to provide treatment and care to an infant who survives an abortion, including early induction delivery where the death of the infant is intended. We call for legislation to ban sex-selective abortions – gender discrimination in its most lethal form – and to protect from abortion unborn children who are capable of feeling pain; and we applaud U.S. House Republicans for leading the effort to protect the lives of pain-capable unborn children in the District of Columbia. We call for a ban on the use of body parts from aborted fetuses for research. We support and applaud adult stem cell research to develop lifesaving therapies, and we oppose the killing of embryos for their stem cells. We oppose federal funding of embryonic stem cell research.

We also salute the many States that have passed laws for informed consent, mandatory waiting periods prior to an abortion, and health-protective clinic regulation. We seek to protect young girls from exploitation through a parental consent requirement; and we affirm our moral obligation to assist, rather than penalize, women challenged by an unplanned pregnancy. We salute those who provide them with counseling and adoption alternatives and empower them to choose life, and we take comfort in the tremendous increase in adoptions that has followed Republican legislative initiatives.

**We likewise support the right of parents to consent to medical treatment for their children, including mental health treatment, drug treatment, and treatment involving pregnancy, contraceptives and abortion. We urge enactment of pending legislation that would require parental consent to transport girls across state lines for abortions.**""

EDIT: Fuck it I changed my mind. But after this, I swear, I am closing the Reddit tab.

Here's a classic example of privilege, under the modern definition. A white guy says ""I don't get my feelings hurt when a black guy calls me cracker, so why should he get his feelings hurt when a white guy calls him nigger?""

The above comment is *almost exactly the same thing*. I don't get my feelings hurt when someone parodies my people, so why should you? Because the situations are **fucking different**. America is rich, powerful, and hasn't had significant internal conflict for centuries. The guy dressed in thawb and turban with dynamite around his waist? That guy is sending up a people who are poor, oppressed and are currently getting the shit bombed out of them by sky robots. Asking him to go ""ha, yeah, I guess we are all terrorists"" - *even as a joke* - is like asking the black guy to go ""ha, yeah, I guess we are all stupid, violent street thugs"".

In other words, since the compressive strength is stronger than the tension provided by the steel, the tensile strength of the rebar will have failed long before the compressive strength. This basically means that, if the system ever gets to the point where the concrete crushes itself under its own weight, adding steel will have been completely useless, and rebar is kind of pointless.~~

The alternative is not faking it, any of it, ever. No one needs to ever know how much money you have on hand, making a show of it is tacky. 

In the long run would you want to stay with a person just because they thought you had cash? Either 1) you don't actually have cash, and they will find out eventually 2) you do have cash, but you then can't trust if they like you or your money, 3) they don't care if you have money or not but they then feel like it's something you went out of your way to show off, and what does that really say about yourself?

The only reason I could possibly think of to keep an ""extra"" hundred in your wallet is for the personal psychological aspect of knowing you can bail yourself out of most situations. Even then, no one knows it's there. ","1351729945"

Well, if you want to be *really* specific about it, there was a civil war, and there was no way to tell if the communists would have created a successful communist state from the collectivism which they forced by gun-point, or would have collapsed into a dictatorship. 

The end result, was in fact dictatorship by the nationalist movement winning out against the Anarcho-syndicalists

You can't really use Spain as this glorious collectivist example, when they basically were put down before they ever had a chance to really experiment with the long term effects of this collectivization, it was a span of three years and merely was upheld by coercion by most historical accounts. Hardly you can call this an exception, when it clearly wasn't allowed to 'act out' it's means.
