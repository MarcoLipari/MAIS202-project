Maybe I'm just not typical, that wouldn't surprise me.

I am not macho, but I am also not a ""sissy"", I'm secure enough in myself that watching or reading something not featuring or targeting my gender does not degrade me, and I think that's a concept that some in society just can't get around.

"McJuggerNuggets","t5_37r2z","*Well, there's finally something for me to review.*

**TL;DR: This video is a bore-fest. It's honestly more boring than his past yearly reviews. I could barely watch it. For forty-eight minutes, you could chop this down to five minutes and you wouldn't miss a thing. Jesse says the same thing he's been saying with these types of videos for years. No return to actual content.**

Even though I normally don't grade these things, due to the indefinite content drought, I'll give this year-in-review a solid 4/10.

You've got a bland montage in the beginning that only reminds you of what could've been more than what we got. You've got Jesse downplaying his failures and lack of actual decent uploads. You've got him using the same excuses that he's been using for years about lack of content. You've got him fumbling through his ""this year I'll be better!"" script. You've also got a clickbait title to wrap it up as well! (Which he even admits to). I'm sorry, Jesse, but all of those lines are old; they've been old for the past four years. This feels copy-and-pasted as always.

You have him pretending to be Nostradamus with his predictions per tradition; let's be honest, they are all educated guesses at best. Some are worded in a way that could make any event seem like it was correct. It's just vague wording that the mind fills in. As an example, I can make the prediction right now that ""COVID will still be a thing at the end of 2023!"" Even if somehow the case numbers dropped substantially, I could always say that it is ""still here in some form or another!""

The excuses he uses for the lack of content get old as well. How many times have we heard it? Most of what he said you could condense into two minutes, but instead you get long rambles about his issues. The whining is getting very petty at this point. Every single yearly review has consisted of this formula: ""Whine about the current state. Promise that things will be better going forward. Wait until the end of the year. Repeat.""

Also, it's **NOT** going to be better. He's pretty much confirmed that he's not going to be doing much with the McJuggerNuggets content front this year. A potential MVE has been scrapped. No ideas of any other projects. Nothing more than vague promises of ""cinematic content and reAl lIFe VlOGS."" He's not even committing to an upload number, which give him the excuse to post one or two videos this year. Don't worry, though, he said **he'll still be pumping that finance content for his FIVE fans over there! YEET!**

You also have a pasted cheesy motivational speech at the end that really puts icing on the garbage-cake. **What a great year-in-review! /s**",1672531202

Why I stopped being vegan,
It's a long and complicated scene,
I started out with good intentions,
But my journey took a turn.

I thought I was doing right,
Eating all my soy and tofu,
But before I knew it,
I was turned into a woman too.

The Book of Vegan played a part,
In this strange and bizarre plot,
But in the end, I learned my lesson,
Veganism just wasn't for me.

So I said goodbye to soy and tofu,
And returned to my old carnivorous ways,
No more strange dreams or cravings for pink,
I'm back to being a man again, hooray!",1672531202

Looking back, I didn't actually set any distinct goals for 2022. However, I guess I did have some loose goals, rather unstated, and I did meet them.  

I wanted to try out some different programing methods. I probably didn't get to as many new options as I might have liked, but I did do that.

  

I also meant, for a long time, to try to add more variety in movement to my training, and I finally did that.

  

I also set out, as I have every year, to just keep getting stronger, and chipping away in all areas, and I  have done that.

  

[This was my lifting highlight of the year](https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc38HDVqwUp/).

  

High Handle Trap Bar Deadlift, 470lb for 7 reps, with an estimated 1-2 reps in the tank. This one is my favorite because of how easy it felt and how easy it looks! I set out to beat a PR, and had a rep goal in mind, which I passed easily. When I first watched the video I did kick myself _a bit_ for not going for extras. Also, my arm looks kind of big. ü§£ 

  

[My 2nd place highlight was this cheaty overhead lift](https://www.instagram.com/p/CasozzHKP_O/).

  

Overhead Press w/ Leg Drive, 215lb for 1 rep. This one was satisfying because [I failed it two weeks before](https://www.instagram.com/p/CaL65Tuq2Qj/), but I knew the strength was there. I could have had it with better technique/a cleaner attempt. I was right! Previous to this I had only lifted &gt;200lb overhead a small handful of times (in the weeks leading up to it). It was also a &gt;BW overhead milestone ‚Äì my bodyweight was ~210lb, so this was +5. It was not a strict lift, but I don't care about that.

  

**2023 Goals**

  

I have purposely stayed away from 1RM goals, many milestone goals, and actually most numbers-oriented goals as a whole for the past few years. I think this has served me well, as that kind of goal-setting doesn't seem to work very well _for me._

  

With that said, these are my basic training goals for 2023:

  

1.  Continue getting stronger across the board. Keep chipping away at becoming just stronger and more muscular overall.    
2.  My main physique goal for 2023 will actually be a successful cut after this winter bulking phase is over. I would like to get leaner than I've been since late 2019/early 2020.    
3.  Squat a weight I am not embarrassed of. Front Squat or Back Squat.    
4.  A 600lb High Handle Trap Bar Deadlift would be amazing. I don't care that it is a cheater ego lift ‚Äì I like it and it's fun. I would settle for a good rep PR well into the 500s.    
5.  Can this finally be the year I bench &gt;300lb? Three plates? We'll see. I would also be happy with a good rep PR at 275lb.
    

  

Everything else is basically neither here nor there ‚Äì and hey, my goals might even morph throughout the year, and that's OK.

  

_**Pontificating...**_

  

This year has not been the greatest for me. Many areas of my life have suffered, and I enter the new year in a deep depression. There are a lot of things that need attention and work.

  

But things are not all bad. I also did many fun things and went to cool places. I got my motorcycle endorsement and put almost 3,000 miles on the bike I bought last fall. Explored new areas and spent a lot of time learning a new skill.

  

And my physical health, as far as I can tell, is good!

  

While I sit here and reflect, I can truthfully say how grateful I am that I've let training become such a consistent piece of my life, and how proud of myself I am for having stuck with it. I am not the most gifted lifter, not the biggest, not the strongest ‚Äì not the most creative or entertaining.

  

Training has come to have a centering effect on my life, though. It has a way of helping me re-establish a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù when I drift off-course, or when things seem chaotic. If I can get back into a groove of doing this one thing I've come to appreciate, it at least _helps_ draw some other things in.

  

And that's pretty cool. So even if I don't set monster PRs or put up amazing numbers, I think as long as I keep doing it, that will be just fine.",1672531204

Ever since your parents divorced, your mom has become the town slut. 

It started with her diving into the dating world, but as time went on, the guys got younger and her moans every night got louder. She began to get a reputation around town, especially among college guys/Futas/Women your age and just a bit older. 

Every night she seems to bring a guy/futa/woman home, her moans carrying through the thin wall that separates your bedroom and hers. The rhythmic slapping of him or her fucking her, her passioned moans, his or her groans as he finishes inside of you.

At first it horrified you, your hands pulling the pillow down over your head in a vain attempt at muffling the sounds. Lately though, as terrible as it sounds, it‚Äôs begun to turn you on‚Ä¶

~

Hello there! I hope you enjoyed my little intro there. 

The RP I‚Äôm looking to do today revolves around a slutty mom and her son. She begins to fuck all kinds of young men/futa/women around his age at their house, and he becomes increasingly turned on at hearing this. I want to pick up just as he‚Äôs getting more brave about trying to spy on her. 

 I want this to focus on the voyeurism, and potentially even some cuckold themes. Perhaps she even catches you and comes up with a way for you to watch without letting the guys know?...and maybe you could join in the end...

These are all things we can discuss in PMs! I definitely want to hear your ideas!


I hope to hear from you!

Kinks: rough sex, hair pulling, light biting, light choking, sweat, moaning, musk, spit, cum, cumplay, creampies, talking during sex, exhibitionism, outdoor sex, age gaps, light cuckold, voyeurism.

Never knew this was a thing. I don‚Äôt know any of those women and my access is broad. I‚Äôve sometimes wondered about internet manipulation of our relations with each other. 

&gt; These are women who want to have sex, conversation, and dinner, on a repeat basis, but won‚Äôt hold hands or otherwise be affectionate outside of sex.

Never wanted to believe this could possibly be a thing but I had a husband who proved me wrong, so there‚Äôs that. 

I think you have to go on dates to weed them out. Doesn‚Äôt have to be dinner. A museum, a walk or a bar meet can help to establish and reveal intimacy. Knee touch and reciprocal touching, hand on lower back type thing and genuineness. I think a woman who touches you, reciprocating your touch is telling you who she is, how she‚Äôs feeling. How you tell her who you are determines the rest. Take time to develop and see the signs of intimacy. As you‚Äôve already seen that can be as early as the first date

"anime","t5_2qh22","**I Didn‚Äôt Want to be Unprepared for Season 2, So I Hosted My First Rewatch**

Rather than talk about the series as a whole, for our final discussion I‚Äôd like to talk about what Bofuri and this rewatch in particular have meant to me.

Bofuri is one of my favorite shows. It‚Äôs not one of those things where I can pin down a solid rank like #1 or #5 or so on, and it hasn‚Äôt changed my life in any dramatic or meaningful way as other shows have. However, it‚Äôs one of the handful I keep coming back to the most and never tire of. If I‚Äôm ever having a rough time, it‚Äôs one of the few things I know I can turn at any to that will pick me up a bit. Or I can go to it when I‚Äôm feeling great and will be assured I‚Äôll leave feeling even better. Bofuri is the first seasonal show I truly connected with once I began watching seasonally at the end of 2019. And now, having had the chance to share that feeling with many people has made it all the more meaningful to me.

Now, I have to thank the many people who have made this such a worthwhile experience for me. Since joining r/anime in 2020, I had never felt the desire to host a rewatch until Season 2‚Äôs airdate was officially announced, partially because I was unsure I‚Äôd be able to be a sufficiently engaging host and partially because I had no idea whether anyone would be interested. So first of all, thank you to all the CDFers who contributed ideas for this rewatch and to u/Nebresto and u/mysterybiscuitsoyeah specifically for encouraging me to take this on. Thank you as well to everyone who regularly participated in the daily discussion threads, especially first-timers. Your reactions were a daily delight. I couldn‚Äôt have imagined I would get such a large initial response, much less so many people contributing every day. Thank you everyone who stopped by to participate once or twice and also everyone who stopped by just to see what everyone in the thread was saying. I hope we‚Äôve made these threads engaging and fun for all of you. Lastly, thank you to source readers for expanding my knowledge beyond what the anime shows. It‚Äôs been a fun ride learning about how intricate a lot of the game is that the anime doesn‚Äôt have time to show.

Thank you all for making time in your days the last 2 weeks to watch and discuss one of my favorite shows with me. You‚Äôve helped make my first rewatch such a big success and so so much fun. I appreciate each and every one of you and hope you‚Äôve enjoyed this experience as much as I have. And I hope you‚Äôll consider joining me again when I eventually host another one of these. One day. Once I‚Äôm done rewatching Bofuri for like the 12th time.

QotD:

1. Maple &gt; Sally &gt; Mii &gt; Bonk Twins &gt; Kasumi = Iz = Chrome = Kanade &gt; most of the members of the other guilds &gt; Dread

2. As a whole fight, Maple vs. the Flame Emperors takes the cake. However, my favorite action is the part of Frederica‚Äôs ambush where Maple rescues Sally.

3. I would welcome a proper Sally vs. Kasumi fight with open arms. I‚Äôd also like to see Sally and Frederica match wits one more time. It would also be nice to have Shin become more of a character so Kasumi can have a decent rival outside Maple Tree.

4. A multi-guild raid boss. I want to know what it‚Äôs like when the devs aren‚Äôt just trolling but set up an all-out raid- tier enemy instead of floor bosses that can be solo‚Äôd.

5. NWO reminds me a lot of the fictional MMO ‚ÄúThe World‚Äù from the .hack//G.U. series, particularly in the way that main characters are able to freely break the game, albeit in much more outwardly horrifying ways.

6. No, though I don‚Äôt have any rational reason for saying so. On an emotional and functional level everything in the show seems way too ‚Äúreal life‚Äù for me to call Bofuri an isekai, even though it probably technically fits any isekai definition or genre description.

7. Yes! Though I sadly won‚Äôt be able to make it to the threads as they drop because Season 2 will be airing during the middle of my class day every week. Woof.",1672531209

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","To be fair, there‚Äôs an amount of any substance that, if consumed can kill you. There‚Äôs even a list of the different substances and quantities for humans. It‚Äôs called LD50 or ‚Äúmedian lethal dose‚Äù. The interesting thing is that it‚Äôs not even that much! It‚Äôs 6 liters for water and 13 shots of hard alcohol (40%, 45ml). [(source)](https://www.compoundchem.com/2014/07/27/lethaldoses/amp/)

My point is: overconsumption is bad regardless of what you‚Äôre consuming. Alcohol has an acquired taste but there‚Äôs certain types of alcohol that have a very delicate and well balanced flavor profile. Not everyone appreciates it similarly to how not everyone appreciates coffee of cheese. 

Similarly to how you can have squirt-out-of-a-tube cheese vs aged Parmesan or freshly made burrata, canned tuna salad or sushi-grade ahi tuna, condensed milk with whipped cream latte or a properly brewed espresso shot, you can have good quality alcohol (eg: a properly aged whiskey or wine) vs college-grade beer or vodka. 

In the end of the day, overconsumption and addiction to anything is bad. You can appreciate things in moderation though.",1672531210

"AgentAcademy","t5_fiwg9","Aim trainers are usually multitudes more strenuous. I never have wrist issues/pain when playing valo (maybe like 1-2 times ever after like a 13-14 hour session with a lot of DMs). 

If you think about it, for example - I‚Äôm going to use 1 wall 6 targets (or sixshot on aimlabs) I can hit up to 120 targets per 1 minute. That‚Äôs 120 flicks per minute. You don‚Äôt get that in-game. 

I‚Äôd recommend stretching your wrists before doing aim training, and then taking a break every 10 min at the MINIMUM to relax your hands/reset. But take as many breaks as you need so you don‚Äôt get wrist pain. 

You should also aim train at a separate time from when you play a match as playing a match after aim training is also stress on your wrists/your hands will already be tired.",1672531210

"singularity","t5_2qh8m","I think it's AI top to bottom next year.

1. Pixel focused models make a bigger splash, as they become a viable ""multimodal"" approach, being able to generalize across text, pictures, computer screens and maybe video

2. Inference for all models gets lots of breakthroughs. I imagine much faster and cheaper inference will be a huge focus, and we'll see everything from tweaks to architecture to fundamental changes to how we create models, tackling this. 

3. I think we'll see sparse models that are large - I suspect some work from Jeff Dean and some of the awesome people on his team pays out: https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/uyfmlj/r_an_evolutionary_approach_to_dynamic/

4. Image generation has a qualitative improvement, where lots of the critiques it currently gets (weird hands, specificity, in image text) starts to make it out of papers and into stable diffusion models and other open source or at least publicly accessible models. Additionally, generation of images hits millisecond speeds, creating new unique opportunities (real time art?). 

5. Video generation has its ""Dalle2"" moment, or close to, by the end of the year. I'm thinking coherent 1 minute+ video, with its own unique artifacts, but still incredibly impressive.

6. Lots of work done to apply audio to video as well, but I don't know if we'll get anything really useful until we get a multimodal model trained on video/text/audio. 

7. I think we see papers with models that are able to do coherent video and audio based on a text prompt, of at least 15 seconds. 

8. We see AdeptAI come fully out of stealth, only for it to have a bunch of competition, early in the year. We'll have access to Chrome extensions that allow us to control the browser in a very general way.

9. LLMs get bigger. 1 trillion-ish param models that are not MoE. They have learned from FLAN, Chinchilla, RHLF, and a whole host of big hitting papers that end up giving it a significant double digit jump in the most challenging tests. We have to make harder tests.

10. Google still holds on to the mantle of ""best research facility"" for both the most influential papers and the best models. Additionally, pressure from investors, internal pressure, and competition will push Google to provide more access to their work, and be **slightly** less cautious.

11. Robotics research hits new levels of competency, off the backs of Transformers - we see humanoid robots as well as non humanoids robots doing mundane tasks around the home in real time, building off the work we see in SayCan. 

12. A new model replaces PaLM for Google internally, and we start to see it's name in research papers

13. Billions upon billions more dollars get poured into AI compared to 2022. 

14. Context windows for language models that we have access to hit 20,000+ words - more with sparsely activated new models.

The keys to that are communication and forgiveness. We had that conversation within a week of dating, and I told her then I was going to marry her. 

The guy can take from this experience that he at least had it right, that they were in 2 different places in this relationship. If he had actually had this conversation, this might have ended ‚Äúhappily ever after‚Äù or just ended. 

But people are always being punished for being the first to show commitment. The first ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù is always awkward. Same with the pronouncement of exclusivity. But if you are not ready for some kind of awkward, you aren‚Äôt ready for a relationship with anyone.",1672531210

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","A few years ago I was fortunate to sign up to a BC Hydro beta program - and can see in real time what is going on with electricity consumption using the HydroHome app.  It's been amazing and noticed my energy usage was soaring some days - and it led me to discover my heatpump wasn't working as expected.   I tried for 5 years to get the installer to troubleshoot after converting the house from electric baseboard to forced air with heatpump.  I wasn't saving money in the winter.  Long story short - after paying around $1000 in numerous visits, I just discovered on my own a few days back after reading the technical install manuals  - the lockout was set too high on the zone controller (I have 3 zones....)  and was only using auxhillary heat and instantly was saving $35 plus a day when we had the recent coldsnap in Victoria after I made the change. In addition, i now discovered, after 5 years there was numerous settings on the 3 smart thermostats that were being overrode ie: Lockouts, Ramp ups, and Weighting of zones - and made additional changes on the controller that now reflect what I was expecting.. both from a comfort perspective but also energy usage... can't wait to see the improvements also in the summer!

Also, on the big push for heatpumps in BC - when shopping pay close attention to how often they do the defrost - some do it automatically on a timer vs when needed... if you're on a timer - you can modify the setting for additional savings...  Mine was defrosting by default every 30 minutes in winter when being used and would consume 18kw more power calling for max aux heat to compensate during that time \~10min duration - not only would cool down the house in the process creating a vicious cycle of temperature imbalance and using a ton of energy.  I now have the setting to every 2 hours - and it's another huge $$ saver :)",1672531211

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

Direct search is the easiest to get started with. ""How to . . ."" then let the auto complete suggest something. 

the goal is always high conversion rates. You want people to click if it's facebook. You want people to stay on your video if it's youtube. The two ways to get feedback are A. split tests (run 2 similar ads to the same demographic and see which does better) B. Ask people directly

Anyone would be pissed off. And I don‚Äôt say that to invalidate you. I say it because it normalizes your reaction as opposed to pathologizing it as some terrible NPD thing.

Like you, I excel at the caring, nurturing part of motherhood and less at the play (I have ME/CFS and fibromyalgia so I physically can‚Äôt do it heaps!). But my husband excels at play and less at the gentle nurturing (still very caring, but just not the same gentle energy as me). So my daughter often goes to him for fun and energetic play and to me when she feels sooky, tired or sick. Sometimes I wish I could engage more in the fun stuff and sometimes my husband wishes she‚Äôd go to him for the cuddles, but we are both just happy to know that her needs are being met. 

Different people have different energies and your child responds to that, so when you are feeling bad about this, remind yourself that while your son loves to play with your sister, he loves your nurturing when he needs nurturing - and that‚Äôs such an important role! You don‚Äôt need to be EVERYTHING to him, we can‚Äôt play all the roles they need. You‚Äôre an amazing mum, even if you‚Äôre not good at play!",1672531214

This is really insightful and helpful.

One thing is, I don‚Äôt think this person who hurt me is a ‚Äúbad person‚Äù. I think just immature, unempathetic and not very in touch with their (and others‚Äô) emotions.

I don‚Äôt necessarily have anything against them, I was just very hurt by their actions and for some reason stuck around against my better judgement (out of loneliness I guess)

So I wouldn‚Äôt wish for their life to turn out badly (I have no way of checking how they are doing and we‚Äôre not communicating). I just feel hurt over their lack of empathy and concern for how I feel and the fact that I have invested time and effort into achieving a resolution of our conflicts. I would wish for them to do some healing (I don‚Äôt think they are even aware that they need it) in order to be a more loving person towards themselves and others. 

Well.. I think the advice that you‚Äôre giving me stays the same nonetheless, about resilience, self love and listening to my gut. I will actually start therapy in mid-January so I am quite excited for that.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","Sorry you were tricked and lied to. You deserve better. Wish there was a way to tell if they‚Äôre just saying anything to get married or if they really mean it. It sucks.

My husband and I had that talk after just one day of dating, because I wanted him to know how staunchly CF I was. He said he was too. Awesome! He even walked away from some of his family once the breeding pressure became harassment. And then seven years into the marriage he admitted that he‚Äôd never even considered being CF before meeting me and totally lied about it and had doubts on and off for years. Thankfully he had seen how having kids had ruined so many of his friend‚Äôs lives and he was glad to be CF and was more than happy to stay that way. But just knowing he lied for all those years became a huge trust issue and took a lot of therapy for us to make things alright. I kept overthinking if there was a better way to tell at the beginning of the relationship.

Out of curiosity, do you have any childfree discussions with him in writing anywhere? A text message or email? I‚Äôd love to know how that would go down in divorce court.",1672531216

Just because a machine does it systematically, to many people, and faster, does not change the ethical implications.

Furthermore, while not stalking, effectively blacklisting the 2nd individual who was just listed on the booking is a very shitty, unethical move, as there is basically no reason to do this other than ""the person is linked to this other person whom we stalked"".",1672531216

Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; # Background
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum is a **multi-layer smart contract ecosystem** that is currently migrating from Proof of Work to Proof of Stake:
&gt; 
&gt; * Layer 1 - Consensus/Settlement layer
&gt; * Layer 2 - Execution/Rollup layer
&gt; 
&gt; ## PROs
&gt; 
&gt; **First-mover advantage** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Like Bitcoin, Ethereum enjoys a first-mover advantage. Being around longer than all other smart contract networks gives Ethereum a massive advantage in adoption, which leads to greater decentralization, security, liquidity pools, and app development. Because of the first-mover advantage, Ethereum easily trounces its competitors in security and popularity, and those competitors have little chance of catching up even though their virtual machines are more efficient than EVM.
&gt; 
&gt; **Resilient to spam and Denial-of-Service attacks** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; Due to high gas fees on the Ethereum network, it is extremely resistant to DDoS attacks and spam attacks. Ethereum is battle-tested and hasn't sufferred a major DDoS attack since 2016.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of its competitors are still dealing with DDoS attacks. Every time the Solana network goes down from DDoS attacks, which have happened at least 6 times in the past year, there are huge complaints from the crypto community. You need a large amount of memory and bandwidth to keep up with fast networks like Solana. Similarly, Polygon suffered an unintentional DDoS attack from [Sunflower Farmers game](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/06/polygon-under-accidental-attack-from-swarm-of-sunflower-farmers/) in Jan 6. For several days, bots ground the network to a halt.
&gt; 
&gt; **Proof of Stake resistant to 51% attacks** (minor):
&gt; 
&gt; * 51% attack (for PoS and PoW) can only revert or censor transactions. [It cannot be used to steal accounts.](https://thedefiant.io/vitalik-eth-cross-chain-bridges-security/). Every transaction has to result in a consistent state.
&gt; * With the exception of client bugs that can have unexpected and widespread effects, deterministic PoS networks are very resistant to reorg attacks since they can be immediately detected when a double-spend happens. Bad nodes will be immediately slashed and that double-spend will never go through.
&gt; 
&gt; **Long-term scalability as a settlement layer** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum has long-term scalability through Layer 2 rollups. It can offload all its data bloat and computations off-chain.
&gt; 
&gt; Many monolithic blockchains are fine for now, but they eventually all suffer from massive data bloat on their blockchains unless they also offload to Layer 2 solutions. When this happens, they will be playing catch-up with Ethereum.
&gt; 
&gt; **Economic sustainability** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; * Ethereum PoS is one of the ONLY networks that's expected to be deflationary due to its extremely-high fees. Ethereum PoW's amount of inflation is [now offset 35%](https://watchtheburn.com/) in Jun 2022 by the amount burned per transaction from EIP-1559. After the merge, the issuance is expected to drop 80%, making Ethereum PoS the first popular blockchain that will have **supply deflation** and become a positive-sum investment.
&gt; * In contrast, many other blockchains have enjoyed lower transaction fees by subsidizing network costs through charging investors with inflation.
&gt;   * **Polygon PoS** distributes $400M in inflationary rewards annually but only collects $18M in fees.
&gt;   * **Solana** collects only $40M in fees but gives away 100x that much ($4B) in rewards [[Source](https://polynya.medium.com/why-rollups-data-shards-are-the-only-sustainable-solution-for-high-scalability-c9aabd6fbb48)].
&gt;   * **Cardano** rewards stakers from a diminishing rewards pool that is on schedule to drop 90% in 5 years.
&gt;   * **Bitcoin** pays miners with block subsidies (set to diminish by 99% in 30 years) that are 50-100x bigger than its transaction fees. When their subsidies disappear, unless they have major governance changes, these networks are either going to see much higher fees, or their security is going to decrease drastically.
&gt;   * **Avalanche** has 10% inflation, and the [burn rate](https://burnedavax.com/) is 100x smaller than the issuance rate.
&gt;   * **Algorand** pays from a staking reward pool [that disappears in 2030](https://algorand.foundation/governance/algo-dynamics). Its low transaction fees don't cover the cost of paying for validators and relay nodes.

Additionally I suggest to join some extracurricular activity club. Robotics club, programming club or something like that. For more connections, for some interesting projects, for hackathons and sometimes also for internship offers. As I mentioned hackathons then yeah, participate in them. It is a good way to work on some interesting projects and sometimes also win stuff when you or your team does very good in said hackathon. Sometimes you'll be offered even internships there.

Your main goal is studying, building your portfolio and also getting an internship. Getting a job, directly while doing your studies, is difficult.",1672531217

The idea is to draw as much of the test solution/sample over the capture area as possible.

I've not seen this exact type of test before but some other rapid tests have vents at the end.

**Rule 7. Off-Topic** - Posts must be strongly relevant to D&amp;D (or other TTRPGs) and must include an attempt at humor or entertainment. Posts with a very loose connection to D&amp;D/TTRPGs (such as generic fantasy memes) will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. While screencaps of social media posts (e.g. Twitter, Tumblr, Discord) are an acceptable medium, the original source must be reasonably related to D&amp;D.

What should you do? First, read the rules thoroughly. Secondly, if you are able to amend your post to fit the rules, you're welcome to resubmit your meme. Lastly, if you believe your post was removed by mistake, please [message the moderators through modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/dndmemes&amp;subject=&amp;message=).

"ATT","t5_2rqvm","Yes, as I'm not going to affect my numbers for ANYBODY. Now, what I will do is suggest another means of obtaining your device AND saving money AND still leaving the store that day with your new phone. I'm not going to put something on your account but I damned sure will not waste my time with a worthless transaction. Sales reps make squat from a phone sale. Accessories and add-ons are where it's at. And considering people already don't want to spend money in the stores, whine and cry over EVERYTHING (sometimes the complaints were legit), then EXPECT transfers and set ups? Nah, girl. It does not work like that. Sales are nothing but communication, and if you as a customer are not providing worthwhile discourse then I'm afraid our talk will be very short.

Now you can puff up and suggest some sort of half-assed complaint or slight against my person but end of the day...I rarely had a complaint in the almost decade I did wireless. AND if there was a complaint it was because, like you, the customer left out vital information when responding to yours truly.",1672531218

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I can appreciate where you're coming from and may even agree with you. But I do apologize because I know I reject this consideration. Many people have said we aren't compatible and I am trying hard for my family to prove them wrong. 

This is what I would call the easy answer because yes. I know families exist that are separated. But I would desperately like to avoid that. Considering the history and the other situational issues. I think I would end up with the short end of the straw. Which would cause not only my two children and her two children to be raised without me. Which may be my hubris. But I think I can give them a lot that the rest of their family can't. Tools to live by. 

So I want my family whole. No. I don't feel as though my opinions are considered and oftentimes I see her issues that she complains and blames others for, and recognize that it would be a better situation if my advice had been taken. 

But I can understand that everyone learns differently. She has a lot of background that created lot of baggage. I've chosen to fight beyond that baggage and I will currently stand by that decision.

1.	My dad actively took me to see his mistress (my now stepmom) while he was still with my mom. I was really young, but I remember being around her while my parents were still married. It didn‚Äôt click for me until I got older, and the rest of the family was really mad to find out when I told them.
2.	The thing I know that my dad and the rest of my family doesn‚Äôt know themselves is that my paternal grandpa continued to give my mom $1000/month on top of what my dad paid in child support, because he was pissed at my dad for cheating. My mom actually told me a story about my dad trying to bail on a dinner where the divorce was going to be discussed, and my grandpa straight up said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre taking your fucking bitch ass to that dinner.‚Äù My dad started favoring the kids he had with my stepmom, and my grandpa wasn‚Äôt having it. Until the day he died, he would secretly give my brother and I ‚Äúextra‚Äù for Christmas, birthdays, etc., because he knew the other two kids were getting treated better. My mom told me many times that my grandpa was the only member of my dad‚Äôs side she truly still loved after the divorce because of everything he did.
3.	My grandparents paid for the house my dad and mom lived in, but my dad wanted to leave it when he got remarried. He didn‚Äôt want the memories from it. Note that this house was three years old and really expensive. My dad threw a fit, because he wanted to build a new one family farm land. This pissed the rest of my family off, because it was active farmland. This fit split the family in half, and it‚Äôs still not fixed. My aunts and uncles still don‚Äôt like my stepmom because of her role.",1672531219

At the end of the day the problem is financial because our players aren't cheap and that's not their fault. It's not that they lack ambition it just makes no sense, when your career is short, to accept those terms. Only the delusional people on this sub think THEY would be different and accept a 6 month loan w/ no obligation to buy on a shit team and only if our players weren't so lazy we would have won a World Cup by now.

I'm not sure what you're trying to prove with Reyes and Govea. They both had to come back with their tails between their legs because they had bad experiences in Europe.

I had an unwanted 3 day water fast due to medication cessation, and the rest of the days became 24 hour fast cycles with me choking down some saltines once a night. It was all I could stand in terms of food, and even though I‚Äôm familiar with the process, I was still surprised by the decent weight loss.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Lol- there are two parts to this. 

I unfollow my exes. I‚Äôm a lesbian and we often have interconnected dating / social pools from hell. And I find unfollowing and snoozing takes them out of my field of view and I don‚Äôt have to deal with any social fall out because I KNOW I‚Äôm going to have to run into them or their bff at the next potluck/pride parade/hummus fest whatever. 

Since you are straight and have a much wider dating pool: if you are ready to let go and don‚Äôt want to be friends with her- unfriend her. 

Either way- it would be good to get her out of your line of sight for about three to six months. 

As for her love languages- I fucking hate those. Just- take the whole branding of ‚Äúlove language‚Äù off of it and look at what she is saying. She is saying she feels loved when her partner does things for her that they see need to be done without talking about it first. Well- yeah- most humans do because for most people- this is our first experience of love- our parents taking care of us and giving us what we need without having to ask. 

So- assuming she is not talking about the classic m/f division of household labor and wanting someone who does their fair share without being told- because that is sometimes wrapped In this conversation- what she is actually saying is she wants a mind-reader who will take care of her. And, that‚Äôs just not realistic or healthy. The only way this happens organically is when a couple knows each other‚Äôs patterns so well and have the time, money and bandwidth to anticipate each others needs. 

Otherwise it is when one person doesn‚Äôt want to talk in their outside voice and the other is a caretaker. And having been the caretaker- fuck that. No thank you, ma‚Äôam. The caretaker usually gets the short end of that stick.

Look- your ex is going to post a lot of stuff on social media and you are going to want to interpret it as ‚Äúyou did it wrong‚Äù. Especially right now. And the truth is- some of it, maybe. Nobody gives anyone everything they want and need. That‚Äôs not how humans work. But you also likely had some stand up qualities too. So- if you want to work on yourself- do it for YOU to be a better human and find confidence and happiness in yourself. 

And when you miss her and the kid- I find it helpful to just imagine you are putting those feelings into a cloud in the universe for them to tap into if they want to. It takes a while for it to become habit- and you can find a similar metaphor. But the idea is that you are putting it in a neutral space and they can pick it up if/when they want it- so your brain starts to both recognize the separation and gives you a way to deal with the feelings. As for the negative feelings- I take those to the gym. I scream in my car. I give myself safe spaces to let them out where I will not hurt anyone, including myself.",1672531220

"CommunalShowers","t5_2858fg","Yes, it is possible. What I am asking is.... given the recent poll results, if you had to guess, would you still describe it only as a mere ""possibility"", or would you go so far as to say it is likely (aka more than just ""possible"") that sexual gratification occurring during CS usage is a direct motivator for a ***significant*** portion of this sub's membership? I have doubts that you are genuinely confused by the ""principal that /u/alansmithee2016 was talking about"" so maybe this comment will help to elucidate that discussion a bit more. Perhaps I'm misreading something.

&amp;#x200B;

Or, if you would rather not answer that question directly, do you have any thoughts on the poll results? Again, to summarize, in a sufficiently large sample:

* the vast majority of poll respondents were okay with non-zero sexual attention in the CS
* roughly half of respondents are okay with moderate-to-extreme sexual attention
* Nearly a quarter of respondents were okay with ""overt persistent and direct explicit sexual interests to aggressively sexual. Jerking off, erecting, pushy,""

Do you think this kind of response characterizes a population that merely has incidental sexual pleasure in the CS, akin to your ""taking a walk"" comment?",1672531220

Since they never addressed it, I'm assuming that Maple got to Sally so quickly in episode 10 by having the Twins throw her. Or maybe batting her with their hammers. Yes, it makes more sense for her to have just flown with Machine God, but that's less silly.

"AzureLane","t5_3p20d","So, spoilers for the current event, and I don't know how to hide spoilers on tablet:




The Commander uses the Reaity Lens to examine Anchorage's hull data. In doing so, The Reality Lens overclocks, threatening to cook the Commander's mind at best or destroy the facility at worst. Helena, Memphis, and Vestal stay behind in the facility after it's evacuated to watch over the Commander while his mind is stuck in the Reality Lens. Desperate to save him, Helena contacts Helena META and Memphis META. Working together, they're able to stabalize the rampant data leak caused by analyzing Anchoage's unusual hull data. Part of why the Reality Lens went heywire is a Siren, The Devil, connected to the system as the analysis began, prompting Memphis META to connect to the Reality Lens as well. The confluene of the Commander's, Memphis META, and The Devil's memories combined with the data Dr. Anzeel archieved in Anchorage's hull and created a facsimile of the Original Timeline. Memphis META supplanted herself into the scenario the Commander was experiencing, allowing her to be close and protect him.

From the Commander's perspective, he realized he was in some kind of echo of the Original Timeline, but played along. This lead him to meeting a gestalt persona of Dr. Anzeel, as well as Yorktown, Northhampton, Hamman, Langley, and Hornet, using Type II rigging. He spends the 'day' with all the girls until Dr. Anzeel is called away, and takes the type II girls on a group date. After, Dr. Anzeel tells the commander they need to go to Samos Island and meet with Dr. Aoste, where the Commander and Anzeel have a philosophical discussion. While being guided through Aoste's lab, the group is introduced to The Devil and will be conducting an exercise with her, with Memphis leading Devil's forces. During the exercise, the Commander leads the type II's well against Memphis and The Devil's forces and is able to trap Memphis in a checkmate. At this point is when The Devil reveals her true self, using her control over the simulation and the power of The Tower to delete items from the simulation, including the type II girls and much of the surrounding enviroment.

Memphis META manages to get the Commander to an exit point she and the real girls constructed, intnet to hold back The Devil and assuring him she has her own way out. Taking the exit, the Commander ends up in ne final simmulation, encountering Aoste and a Laffey II, managing to have a quick discussion with them. He then wakes back up in the real world, surrounded by Vestal, Memphis, and Helena. Reviewing what happened, the Commander gets an idea to have TB analyze the data of the type II rigging from the simulation. TB computes a framework of type II rigging for all the sim girls except Laffey. Using type II rigging, the Commander is able to save Yorktown and Lexington.

During what I am assuming is her upgrade, Yorktown has dreams about her time in the Pacific and Enterpise's experiences. (Forgot to mention, after Yorktown II is hit with a delete beam, she encounters her META self, her data saved thanks to Helena META, about the Commander and him being able to use the experience from the Reality Lens to save the original Yorktown, but sim Yorktown needs to fight to buy more time to escape.) The Commander then meets with Enterprise and takes her to the facility to reunite with her healed sister.",1672531221

Even without nukes, Israel managed to defeat them at a time when the balance of power was even so makes you think it will be any different now when Israel is way ahead of them in literally every field?

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","&gt;They weren‚Äôt meant to compare the characters against another and when you try to do it you notice inconsistencies within them

Of course they are... They're stats. You don't seem to understand what stats are. It's a direct way of judging an individuals strengths and weaknesses which can very much be used to compare them to another character. That's literally what stats are.

&gt;For example when we compare Yama and Toshiro, Yama had a 60 in physical strength and Toshiro a 80.

Incorrect. It wasn't strength. It was stamina. Which actually makes complete sense because Yamamoto is incredibly old and Toshiro isn't. Tbh they make perfect sense if you fully understand what they are. 

&gt;Yama and Unohana are equal in term of offense (even though it‚Äôs blatantly false)

Again this actually makes complete sense because it isn't taking their zanpakutos abilities into account but the individuals actual offensive power. It makes sense that the second greatest Swordsmen would have equal strength to a super old Yamamoto.

&gt;Aizen only used KS with the Momo stunt

He was using it the whole time. That was the point. That's why he gets up and attacks the lieutenants while the captains are messing up Momo, because the lieutenants were actually watching over Aizen pretending to be Momo and the captains were fighting Momo who looked like Aizen.

&gt;They don‚Äôt have equal Reiatsu

The literal canon databooks completely disagree with you and the ""point"" you made doesn't actually prove otherwise.

&gt;Will going back to sertraline help to revert this shit ?

Have you seen the videos?

These drugs do damage, reinstating is going to do more damage.

While taking the drug erection is impossible for many. Wasn't this your experience?

&amp;#x200B;

Many don't get PSSD or notorious persistent effects after the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. time they take one of these drugs, but some time they do get it.

This is very tricky, as it gives a false impression that these drugs are safe.

If you reinstate you risk this to happen or the condition to worsen.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; im currently not taking any medication. doctor last gave me wellbutrin. ive been on it also for 2 months in the past. Would you recommend taking it or also avoid ?

If it was not clear, the recommendation is: avoid all drugs.

Always research for the bad effects of drugs, all psychiatric drugs are very dangerous. Many times the medical documentation lie or omits important things, like side effects / damage being persistent.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion

It amazes how they prescribe a sex destroying drug to improve sex. They are crazy.

"BuffyTheVampireSlayer","t5_2v4dd","He was originally slated to appear in five episodes.  He was built up as this dangerous, cool villain just for it to be all the more shocking when Angelus killed him and assumed the mantle (with Dru) as the Big Bad.  The character was a big hit with fans though, so instead of being offed, he was injured and confined to a wheelchair for the last half of season 2.  IIRC, he and Dru were supposed to come back for a one-shot deal for s3 but Juliet Landau was unavailable.  So Spike came back solo for Lover's Walk and then that was supposed to be the end---he'd drive off into the sunset to get Dru back.

For s4, the Scooby gang was missing its 'truth-teller' as Cordelia had joined the cast of Angel.  So SMG actually made the suggestion of using Spike in that role, the character that basically tells everyone they're stupid and about to die.  Which he pretty much started to do in Pangs.    As far as his arc with Buffy, I believe that was decided on in s4, because despite being a crack ship, a Buffy/Spike pairing was still massively popular in the fandom.  Per an amusing interview w/ JM, he went to JW sometime in s4 and told him to give him notice if he needed to be shirtless so he could hit the gym more, ""don't Marc Blucus me.""   And Joss was like, ""Funny you bring that up.  You're going to fall in love with Buffy.""  JM thought this was awesome and asked if it would be comedic or really horrible and Joss said something along the lines of ""neither.  She's going to reciprocate, you two are going to have sex.  Get ready.""    (JM's response to this was ""WHAT?!"")

So basically Spike was brought onto the main cast to fulfill Cordelia's role. Reportedly JW bowed to fan (and probably network) pressure to turn Spike into a love interest for Buffy, the seeds of which were sown in s4 (Something Blue foreshadowed both Spuffy and Dark Willow).",1672531224

first up, thoughts on the new episode! oh, defo [watch the PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgHnA7ZV8tM) feat. the new ED/OP if you havent yet! 

- [S2 Ep 1]&gt;!Between seasons, Kaede has gotten some [new merch](https://imgur.com/VtBcQ9W)! USAGI SANNNNNNNNNN I REMEMBER YOUUUUUU. So has [Risa](https://imgur.com/frqcnYA)!  We pick up shortly after S1 both in terms of overall timeline, and the ridiculousness and war crimes with the [phantom-world Maples](https://imgur.com/1vTaGqF) lol. Return of the battle theme too, which is nice.!&lt;

- [S2 Ep 1 cont'd]&gt;![QUEUEEEE THE NEW INSERT SONGGGGGG](https://imgur.com/Z0hd6nx). I believe actually in Engrish too. Sally has gotten a nice handy skill in her duel w/ Frederica, the fact that when she says that if she's defeated Maple will be all alone, a [maple leaf floats by](https://imgur.com/lLMLuUd) is not lost on me [](#yuristare). Nice that Mii's finally friends with Maple too, and it's nice that at least Misery does know what's going on, gonna be hard if RP-ers really can't let loose once in a while. I wasn't a fan of [Kasumi's new form's](https://imgur.com/9HLkEek) drawback in the novel, and neither am i here, but the [new attack and skill](https://imgur.com/iBu6y6Q) is nice, as is her fight to get it.!&lt;

- [S2 Ep 1 cont'd]&gt;!MECHAAAA [TRANSFORM UPGRADED VERSIONNNNNN](https://imgur.com/dTEG7oT). S2 looks good and a slight step up from S1 so far, which is great. Yup, [looks about right](https://imgur.com/s8lqwPM) for when Maple is in action. Payne's [defo reaffirming](https://imgur.com/0073yMN) that he can stand alongside Maple as a top player in NWO tho. And finally, I like the maple leaf too [on Maple's present here](https://imgur.com/2hIhRIe)!&lt;

- [S2 Ep 1 and future LN]&gt;!I CAN'T WAIT FOR [SALLY TO USE THISSSS SPIDEY SALLY IS THE BESTTT](https://imgur.com/gqEzH9b).!&lt;

- [Mild S2 Ep 1]&gt;!And as the board says, [a happy new year everyone](https://imgur.com/fOh9dRv)! I hope you'll enjoy S2, and can't wait to see you guys in the threads, even though i might be late since it airs during busy-hours for me.!&lt;

Thanks to /u/hereticalaegis for hosting the rewatch! It's been great reading everyone else's reactions to this fluffy show. It's nothing too groundbreaking and ambitious, but it knows what it's aiming for, and sticks to its guns well, promising great entertainment for all. Defo an anime that i recommend for newcomers, particularly if theyve also played multiplayer games!

QOTDs: 

[1.]Rank your favorite characters!

Sally, Maple, Kanade, everyone else is kinda the same. 

[2.]What was your favorite fight of the first season?

Maple vs Mii [](#justright)

(3-4: LN reader)

[5.]What real MMO/game do you think NWO most resembles?

idk..... are any games as broken to a single player only, and allow for unique gear without paying money? 

[6.]Is Bofuri an isekai?

I dont count it as one. there are frequent references to a world that all characters can safely return to, and have separate lives at, after all. I classify it as an SOL sci-fi/fantasy anime. 

[7.]Will you be watching Season 2?

I already am! see you guys in the S2 threads!",1672531225

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","What we're worried about is chlorine harming our fishes; chlorine is a very good oxidizer, so we add a reducing agent (usually sodium thiosulfate) to convert to the chloride form. It goes from ""bleach"" to ""table salt"" by virtue of adding a reducing agent. (The other way about it involves adding ascorbic acid- vitamin C- converting ascorbic acid to dehydroascorbic acid, with the chlorine being converted to hydrochloric acid- which quickly becomes a proton, and chloride. The proton very very slightly shifts the pH down, small enough that the 1 ppm chlorine in your tap water makes a negligible amount of hydrochloric acid.)

In your tank, you're probably familiar with ORP (oxidation reduction potential); ORP is a measurement of oxidizing potential within your tank. ""Healthy"" levels are generally in the 300-400 millivolt range for your saltwater aquarium, while ""healthy"" for drinking water is typically 800 millivolts, and ~700 millivolts for swimming pools.

If you were somehow able to raise the ORP of your tank to ~800 millivolts, then you'd have such a strongly oxidizing environment that your fish would perish: it would be the same as dropping your fish into unbuffered tap water. But note [figure 5](https://iccontrols.com/wp-content/uploads/art-8-2_chlorine_theory_and_measurement.pdf): free chlorine becomes negligible around an ORP of 500 or less.

So provided your tank has a sufficiently low ORP that it can ""absorb"" the oxidizing power of your chlorine, it will be rendered into chloride almost immediately as it is added to the tank. Your co-worker is correct *in that context.* It is very difficult to get an aquarium to an ORP of, oh, over 500 because there's SO MUCH STUFF in there that will reduce the chlorine to chloride- algae, detritus, organic matter in the water- long before there's enough chlorine in the water to start acting on the gills of your fish.

With that said, I wouldn't add it in a large bolus, dumping in 20 gallons of saltwater prepared with tap water into a 55 gallon saltwater tank. And if the water supply just *happened* to be superchlorinating the tap water that week, all bets are off.

But even if you were to do a 25% water change with 1 ppm chlorine in the water, even if ORP etc. weren't factored in, then you'd still only have 0.25 ppm chlorine, [and many fish tolerate this in the short run.](https://webwiser.nlm.nih.gov/substance?substanceId=338&amp;identifier=Chlorine&amp;identifierType=name&amp;menuItemId=79&amp;catId=93)

LC50 = lethal concentration for 50% of the animals under test, and most fish are 0.5 ppm chlorine and above... for an hour, anyway. Plenty of time for that chlorine to get reduced to chloride in the tank.

Too much info? I apologize. But it's not a black-and-white statement to say, ""yeah, it's fine and stuff.""",1672531225

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Maleficent_Plankton which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Ethereum has drastically changed in the past year now that it has rebranded itself as **Consensus/Settlement layer** for other Layer 2 Execution/Rollup networks. It is no longer trying to be a monolithic blockchain by itself. Because of this shift in design, many of its former CONs are no longer major issues. And many of the CONs that still exist often have a beneficial sides.
&gt; 
&gt; I discuss the CONs of Ethereum and their impact on its users here:
&gt; 
&gt; ## CONs
&gt; 
&gt; **Gas Fees** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; The biggest complaint for Ethereum is its network gas fees. Every transaction needs gas to pay for storage and processing power, and gas prices vary based on demand. Gas price is very volatile and often changes 2-5x in magnitude within the same day. ERC20 transfers are used for a large percentage of cryptocurrencies, and it's the reason much of DeFi is extremely expensive. If I wanted to send ERC20 tokens between exchanges, it's often cheaper to trade for XRP, ALGO, or some other microtransaction coin, transfer it using their other coin's native network, and then trade back into the original token. Basically: use a coin on a different network to avoid fees.
&gt; 
&gt; Typical transaction fees for Ethereum were [between $2-10 over the past year](https://etherscan.io/chart/avg-txfee-usd), but they have shot up to $50+ several times in 2021.
&gt; 
&gt; And that's just for basic transactions. Anyone who has tried to use more complex smart contracts like moving MATIC from Polygon mainnet back to ETH L1 mainnet during a time of high gas fees mid-year in 2021 saw $100-$200 gas fees. Transferring ERC-20 tokens (often $20-50) is also more gas expensive because it can't be done through native transfers like on the Cardano network. It's impractical to use swaps like Uniswap for small transactions due to these fees.
&gt; 
&gt; In particular, One/Many-to-many batch transactions are extremely gas-expensive using Ethereum's account-based model compared to Bitcoin's and Cardano's UXTO-based model. [This batch transaction on Ethereum](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x0fe2542079644e107cbf13690eb9c2c65963ccb79089ff96bfaf8dced2331c92) cost over $5000 while [a similar eUXTO transaction on Cardano](https://adapools.org/transactions/e586c6340ee9e60a6c64f447feffe5f89bdabc7741666ecaa681081957938f56) only cost $0.50 in fees.
&gt; 
&gt; On the other hand, these fees provide Ethereum long-term economic sustainability and resilience against DDoS and spam attacks.
&gt; 
&gt; **Competition from other Smart Contract networks** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum has enjoyed its lead as the smart contract blockchain due to first-mover advantage. But there are now many efficient smart contract competitors like Algorand, Solana, and Cardano. Ethereum is now facing much competition. Who wants to pay $20 gas fees on Ethereum when you can get similar transactions for under $0.01 with Algo and Solana or $0.30 transactions with Cardano?
&gt; 
&gt; Fortunately, the amount of competition is limited because Ethereum is positioning itself as a Settlement layer whereas these other networks are monolithic networks. All monolithic networks will eventually run into scaling issues due to long-term storage and bandwidth limits. It will really depend on how successful Ethereum's Layer 2 rollup solutions will be.
&gt; 
&gt; **Future uncertainty about Layer 2 solutions** (major):
&gt; 
&gt; Ethereum's long-term success is dependent on the success of its Layer 2 solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; These Layer 2 solutions are still extremely early. Even after a year, L2 has a very fragmented adoption. The majority of centralized exchanges currently do not support Layer 2 rollup networks. A few have started to support Polygon, which is more of a Layer 2 side-chain that saves state every 256 blocks than a Layer 2 rollup. Very few CEXs allow for direct fiat on/off-ramping on L2 networks, which puts those networks out of reach of most users.
&gt; 
&gt; Many of these Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Loopring, ZKSync, etc), are not interoperable with each other. You can store your tokens on any specific L2 network, but they're stuck there. If you want to move your tokens back to Layer 1 or to another L2 network, you have to pay very expensive smart contract gas fees ($50-300). Eventually, there will be bridges between these networks, but we could be years away from widespread adoption.
&gt; 
&gt; Fragmented liquidity is another huge issue. Each of these L2 networks has its own liquidity pool for each token it supports. You can store your token on the the L2 network, but you won't be able to trade or swap much if there are no liquidity pools for that token. Eventually, there will be Dynamic Automated Market Makers (dAMMs) that can share liquidity between networks, but they are complex and introduce their own weaknesses.
&gt; 
&gt; Both Optimistic and ZK Rollups are handled off-chain and require a separate network nodes or smart contracts as infrastructure to validate transactions or generate ZK Proofs. They are very centralized in how they operate, so there's always the risk that their network operators could cheat their customers. By now, the community seems to agree that ZK rollups are the future rollup solution to decentralized L2 networks. There is only 1 notable instance of Plasma (Ethereum to Polygon network conversion), and no one uses it anymore since the Ethereum-Polygon bridge is easier to use. The biggest competitor to ZK rollups are Optimistic rollups, and those take too long to settle back to Layer 1 (1 week) and are still too expensive to use (20-50% of the cost of L1 Ethereum gas fees for transfers).
&gt; 
&gt; **ZK Rollups** require special infrastructure to generate ZK Proofs. These are very computationally-expensive, potentially [thousands of times](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html) more expensive that just doing the computation directly. To reduce the cost, they are done completely-centralized by specialized servers. Thus the cost of a ZK Rollup is cheap at about [$0.10 to $.30](https://l2fees.info/). But even at $0.10 per transfer and $0.50 per swap, these are still at least 10x more expensive than costs on Algorand and Solana. Users will have to decide whether the extra cost and hassle of using an L2 platform is worth the extra security of settling on the more-decentralized and secure Ethereum L1 network.
&gt; 
&gt; **Ethereum Proof-of-Stake merge is arriving later than competitors** (moderate):
&gt; 
&gt; The ETH PoS Beacon chain has been released, it's a completely separate blockchain from ETH and won't merge with the main blockchain [until later this year](https://decrypt.co/78690/ethereum-2-staking-tops-21-billion-merge-horizon), giving its competitors plenty of time to provide FUD. We still don't know how successful the merge will be. Currently, stakes are locked, preventing investors from selling. We don't know what will happen to the price once staking unlocks.
&gt; 
&gt; **MEV and Dark Forest attacks** (minor):
&gt; 
&gt; [MEV](https://np.reddit.com/r/MPlankton/comments/rs4wp2/the_dark_forest_of_cryptocurrency/) is actually a pretty big issue for networks with high gas arbitrage and mempools like Ethereum, but most casual users will never notice hostile arbitrage. When you broadcast your transaction to the network, there are armies of bots and automated miners that analyze your transaction to see if they can perform arbitrage strategies on your transaction such as front-running, sandwiching, excluding transactions, stealing/replaying transactions, and other pure-profit plays. ""Dark Forest"" attacks have reveled that bots are constantly monitoring the network, and they can front-run you unless you have your own private army of miners.
&gt; 
&gt; **Final Word**
&gt; 
&gt; Overall, I still think the PROs outweigh the CONs for Ethereum in the long-run due to its first-mover advantage and the long-term sustainability of the Ethereum network.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Trump began promulgating election-related conspiracy theories at least as early as Aug 1, 2016.  
  
If Trump lost the Electoral College, Republicans planned to promote spurious claims of election fraud and support challenges to the electors in Republican-controlled statehouses.   
  
Before and after the election, Trump‚Äôs campaign coordinated with the Nevada GOP in an attempt to claim decisive electoral votes.  
  
No Republican leaders claiming voter fraud, question any Republican wins, on the same day, on the same ballots, using the same systems.  
	  
If somehow Biden‚Äôs victory was fraudulent, so was every Republican elected in the election. If Biden shouldn‚Äôt be in the White House, Republicans who won shouldn‚Äôt be in office either.   
  
Nov 4th, 2020 ‚Äì Rick Perry (R-TX) texted Mark Meadows ‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt the states of GA, NC, Penn and other R controlled state houses declare this is BS . . . and just send their own electors to vote and have it go to the SCOTUS?‚Äù   Because a state legislature‚Äôs post-Election Day substitution of its own preferences for those of voters would violate federal law.  
  
On Nov. 4, the day after Election Day and days before victory had been called for Biden in Nevada and nationally, Nevada GOP Chair said via text that he had spoken to the president himself, Eric Trump, Mark Meadows, and Mayor \[Rudy\] Giuliani. ..‚ÄùThere is a major plan.‚Äù   
Dec. 10 - In emails including Chesebro, they nakedly laid out the Trump campaign‚Äôs commitment to fake elector schemes in Nevada and 5 other states, including a press release with draft language for Republican fake electors to use in WI, providing a template.  
  
2 days after the election, before it was called, Trump, Jr. texted Meadows - ""We have multiple paths We control them all."" with Republican majorities in the US Senate and battleground state legislatures, with ideas for overturning the 2020 election to ensure Trump would get a second term.   
  
At least 357 sitting Republican legislators in closely contested battleground states used the power of their office to discredit or try to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.  
Trump and many of his allies after the 2020 election, wanted state legislatures to simply substitute their preferences for the voters in their states.   
  
By Nov 6, John Eastman had been in touch with an attorney working with Trump, about his illegal scheme was to have state legislatures toss certified election results in battleground states Trump lost.    
On November 6, U.S. Rep Biggs (R) texted Meadows to encourage the state legislatures in battleground states Trump lost, to appoint electors.  Meadows replied ‚ÄúI love it.‚Äù Meadows texted on Dec. 8th ‚ÄúI am working on that as of yesterday. Briggs later asked AZ House Speaker to sign letter to decertify state‚Äôs 2020 electors.   
A state legislature‚Äôs post-Election Day substitution of its own preferences for those of voters would violate federal law.  Eastman knew it was illegal, and sought a presidential pardon.  
Eastman and Trump‚Äôs plan to disrupt the Joint Session of Congress on Jan 6th was fully formed and actionable as early as Dec. 7th, 2020  
  
Trump went to court to throw out millions of votes in the swing states. Presented no evidence of widespread voter fraud in the election in any state. Lost every lawsuit.  
  
On Nov 18th, there was a written plan by Chesboro to have electors pledged to Trump in battleground states he lost, to fraudulently meet and cast their votes on Dec. 14th.  A substitution of electors from those chosen by voters on Election Day violates federal law.  
  
The RNC, at Trump‚Äôs direct request, helped to gather fake electors.  
Trump put the RNC Chair on the phone with John Eastman to discuss obtaining assistance from the RNC, on a call made from the White House switchboard.""That phone call was determined by the January 6th committee to provide proof of ‚Äúan overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy‚Äù with Trump‚Äôs role in organizing people nationwide to submit false Electoral College slates to Congress declaring Trump the winner in their states.  
  
Trump phoned officials in PA and MI -- and they told him they would move to keep him in power, despite the results showing Biden had won their states.  
Trump and his allies badgered, intimidated, and endangered battleground state legislators and election officials to commit election fraud  
  
Trump directly asked the DOJ 9 times to undermine the election result, threatened to replace DOJ's uncooperative leadership, and his chief of staff Mark Meadows broke administration policy by pressuring a DOJ lawyer to investigate claims of election fraud.  
Trump tried to use the DOJ to announce election fraud investigations, ask state leaders in Georgia to appoint electors, disregarding the certified popular vote, and tell states to stop sending in their certified and required Electoral College vote totals, and then ""leave the rest to me and the \[Republican\] Congressmen,""   
The Trump campaign gave the order for the Georgia Republican Party to create a fake elector slate.  
  
Trump also tried to get voting machines in battleground states seized by DHS, the Defense Department, and local law enforcement.  
Individual Republicans, without any authority, took it upon themselves to seize voting machines, ballots, and hard drives.  
Republicans made 8 attempts to breach voting systems in 5 states in search of evidence of a debunked conspiracy theory.  
Trump allies planned to have 3 companies send armed workers to seize machines and election data.  
Sensitive election system files obtained by attorneys working to overturn Trump‚Äôs 2020 defeat were shared with election deniers, conspiracy theorists and right-wing commentators  
  
There was also a plan to seize data from the NSA and utilize the Defense Dept. in an effort to ‚Äúprove‚Äù the election was stolen with the help of foreign powers.",1672531227

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Also a French main here, also playing top tier, but I never have a problem with CAS.

To be honest, people complain about revenge CAS are often straight minded people who don't think and don't plan. Because if you planned for incoming CAS, you can greatly reduce the chance of getting bombed. In other words I always prepared for an incoming plane after every single kill and take cover under trees or buildings. I leave my position until it is clear and safe. I stop any advance, take my time to hide, watch the sky, and keep an eye on the kill feed to ensure no one is going to revenge bomb me. The result? I rarely get revenge killed. In fact so rare that I can't remember any specific incidence. Most ground players are racist against anything with wings. They just amplify every memories they got kill by planes, and said CAS is horrible and is ruining ground battle. CAS is, in fact, avoidable and can be counter even in your tank if you are willing to think more.

Just play SPAA is a joke, but hey, Just take cover. bro. Planes are top predators on modern battlefield, tanks are lower in the food chain, so just keep this in mind and plan your every move. It is not that difficult.

Let's be honest, Have you fly in top tier Ground RB? Have you use laser guided bombs or laser guided missiles? They are not as easy as you think. You can watch youtuber pulling out beautiful kills, but try it yourself. They doesn't show how many times they got shot down before they can drop their payloads. I guaranty you will get bankrupt if you play CAS at top tier. The current environment is so unfavorable that usually one to two kills are already the best one can get. Yes, sometimes you are lucky, but most of the time a SAM will knock you out of the sky.

Heli is another problem. They are greater threats to the team than a plane when unchecked.",1672531228

"space","t5_2qh87","From the 90s, and into the 2010s, NASA knew the shuttle was toast. Most of what was going up, was going up on Delta boosters or from the ESA facility in French Guyana.  The tech was progressing in terms of getting things into space, but it was not really spectacular. 

The International Space Station, was keeping human spaceflight alive, barely. 

In the rest of the aerospace field, composites were finally taking off for use in more than just corporate jets, and weird experimental Burt Rutan creations. Efficiency and reliability were being pushed, and even in that there were growing pains with the 787. 

Drone wars, DARPA challenges, the RC community going batty over the Quadcopter innovations, various autonomous robots were becoming practical on the small as well as large scales. This was not just for engineering students, but any bored hobbyist looking over what was in the STM32 pile of system boards, add on boards, you name it. 

3D printing moved out of just laser curing tanks full of gel, and 5 axis mills with crazy learning curves. And with that, rapid prototyping and small scale engineering went insane. 

Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, STM32 Blue Pills and Black pills. Hell, I talked to kids in Nigeria, barely into their teens at a residential tech school who were playing with those.  They were goofing around on r/PAN sure, so fairly tech savvy, but even still. 

Accessibility to tech you didn't even get to play with until you went off to university, or if you had a really well funded electronics/computer/tech program in your school in the 80s, kids are playing with that stuff now like we were with Radio Shack 200 in 1 electronics kits back in the day for around $39.99   These are now ridiculously expensive in modern times.

You can get an Arduino Mega with a few shields and a bunch of sensors for that.  Even get a pretty good meter for another $30.

And all the youtube shit, what was a MAJOR library research project. Clickety, clickety, its done, in under 5 minutes. 

I'm not sure going to the Moon or Mars is that big of a deal anymore, even for manned flight. It's just kind of an engineering and infrastructure grind. Rather than a megalomaniacal suicide plunge like it was in the 1960s and 1970s where there was BARELY the tech to get people out there and back in one piece. 

In terms of biology.. The rapid covid response was certainly a moonshot. A very messy one however. The tech was there when it was needed, but 95% or more just have no understanding of the biology, or how bad it could have gone down.  Peru gave us some ideas, but it went bad so fast the journalists just bolted.  And even with an outstanding result, North America ended up with 2.5 million excess deaths, a snarled economy, social chaos.. 

It'll be a good 20 years before people have an understand of how badly it could have gone. 

And by that time, who knows, manned exploration of the outer Jovian moons, where the radiation won't instantly cook you?  Or probably Ceres.  Jupiter has the advantage that you could use the planet itself as a fuel depot. Not just of hydrogen for reaction mass, but anti-protons from one of the flux tubes.",1672531228

Not too deep or bright, not powdery. Clean but not a sharp clean, like the ones that hurt your nose. Very balanced fragrance. I don't know what orange blossom smells like so I can't compare. The only problem I have with it is I can't smell it unless I put my nose right next to my wrist. Someone would have to be very close to smell. And it doesn't last long, maybe 2 hours tops. I don't mind reapplying since it smells so nice. I wish I could find their lychee scent in stock somewhere!

I also use the Elemis Skin Buff face wash, the Wishful by Huda Beauty face wash (you put it on dry skin and  massage it in circles and it breaks up and flakes off and then you just rinse). I also use ANYTHING by Tula. Love LOVE their Sugar Scrub and they also have these little exfoliating finger face washes (I can't remember the name just now and I ran out so I need to figure it out lol) 

This is also on top of my skin care routine, where I use exfoliators in my skin care as well, like lactic acid, glycolic acid, etc and I also use retinol. The key is to NOT use them all at the same time and just keep it simple and use a great moisturizer! 

For my body, I use a dry brush VERY gently all over before I get in the shower and that's been amazing! Started doing that about 2 years ago and it works in our sub zero freezing winters with my thyroid messed up super dry skin feel like butter! I follow up with... Don't judge me lol...

3. Sally and Dread. They had little conflicts, but they never got a full on death match.

4. Anything for solo players. I can accept something that players in guilds can join if they have to do it solo, but for Pete's sake! Let solo players participate in events as something other than second class citizens! Even if not events, create a game mode or system that limits to only one person! Special dungeons that can only be challenged solo, competitive game modes that allow for just one person at a time! Players in guilds, especially the big guilds, participate and dominate in these events that give significant benefits to the guilds as a whole. 

Are you a solo player who likes challenging the game alone? Well, sucks to be you because random scrubs numbered 1-48 from the Holy Sword guild get a permanent 5% bonus to all their stats that you'll never have. Even if another battle royale event comes up, you'll be at a massive disadvantage to the other skilled players who are part of guilds who spent the last 6 events accumulating buffs and bonuses that add to their base abilities, regardless of their level or time playing. And that's before all the other advantages that being in a guild brings (such as more efficient farming, access to better crafters, gear made of the best materials, etc.) that are inherent to any game with a guild system.

5. I don't play enough MMO's to really know. And, frankly, I hope none are too close. As fun as Bofuri is, NWO would only work as a VR experience. Taking the game design and applying it to a standard MMO would make it a nightmare I wouldn't want to touch with a ten foot pole.

"AshenTheGame","t5_3ltxb","You entirely missed the point, and by the looks of it didn't read what I wrote.

1. You said ""Regarding this shortcut, in particular, you should be kicking yourself for not having seen it already"". The thing you need to realize is that a massive chunk of the playerbase is not actively looking for shortcuts, just like I didn't until I was too frustrated. At minimum, a majority of the players of this game are not going to see the shortcut, get frustrated to hell on this dungeon, and decide to just call it a day and play something else. They'll never come back because what's waiting for them is this awful dungeon...and then eventually they'll uninstall it after not playing it for a year. I'm NOT an average player of games like this, and I found it too much of a pain to keep dealing with or even bother skipping.
2. I said ""The number of cheap shots in this dungeon with a normal route is inexcusable. I looked up what to do, hey there's a skip to just gloss over the entire dungeon."" In response you said ""Shortcuts are not an admittance that a dungeon is too difficult or long...Regarding this shortcut, in particular, you should be kicking yourself for not having seen it already"". It was already clear before your comment that I already knew about the shortcut from the very first refill station, but the point that you seemed to have entirely missed is that it becomes necessary because the normal path is irrefutably bad.
   1. The Dark Souls 1 example is Blighttown. Blighttown was not this bad on the normal route, and is full of shortcuts. But cheapshots like this were not there. Maybe you were thinking of Sen's Fortress. Sen's did not have cheapshots either, and doesn't have any shortcuts on the way up.
3. You said ""If you're having difficulties, maybe you should finish the rest of the side quests for health boosts and upgrade your weapon again."" You missed the part where I specifically said ""Combat to this point was not difficult."" And its because the combat is not difficult. Again, the cheap shots are the problem. On the entire way down from the top to that point with 4 platforms at a refill station, combat was not difficult. This includes tight hallways and places where you can't maneuver. The cheap shots are the problem.
   1. The Dark souls 1 example that's closest is Tomb of the Giants. But that area does not have cheapshots. It is PITCH BLACK requiring a lantern if you don't know the route by heart. You could also effectively outrun a horde of enemies chasing you if you know the route by heart, something you CANNOT do in the normal route for Seat of the Matriarch.
   2. It was not in fact my first chance to get sapient moss, I'd already found some before I got to this dungeon. Enough to upgrade 2 weapons to Ashen before entering the dungeon.
   3. I had no metric for how much health is necessary for this dungeon.
   4. I had exhausted my side quests prior to and within the area.
   5. Meaning that whatever health I had SHOULD have naturally been sufficient.
   6. Healing was not a concern. I had 6 gourd charges at +3 effectiveness.
   7. Damage was not an issue, with the Uttoko emblem, the lantern talisman buff, ashen +1 1 handed axe with 30% crit. Maybe I could have dealt more damage via more upgrades, but the only way you get that is by dying repeatedly in the dungeon, or homeward boning out. Either way it means running the dungeon at least 3 times before going past the 4 platforms, because the trip down from start to finish is roughly 10k scoria.
   8. If you have to run a dungeon 3 times to get the necessary upgrades to have enough damage to beat it, then it means either the game was paced poorly, or the dungeon is out of step with the games pace. I rather think the game was paced well, but the dungeon was mismatched to that pace by a rather large amount.
4. ""On the contrary, rather than blacklisting it I feel that this is a true successor to the spirit of early souls games, especially Demon's souls"". That's fine, I've never played Demon Souls. I've played all the Dark Souls and Elden Ring.
   1. We're talking 2000 hours in Dark Souls 1, because I was big into the PvP at levels 20, 45, and 110. I played just about every kind of build there was except for FlippyKat because I didn't find it interesting. Knives, armor, faith, magic, quality, strength, etc. I did not twink at low levels, I used level appropriate weapons, armor, and magic.
   2. Dark Souls 2 was not an issue, although the netcode for PvP is an absolute dumpster fire. 400 hours of playtime
   3. Dark Souls 3 was not an issue, I did not do much PvP there. 200 hours of playtime.
   4. Elden Ring's only bad boss for me was Radagon, because the boss's animations are meant to screw with people who have good reactions, but reward people who don't have any. PvP was not an issue, I used a dual knife build that wasn't straight bleed (mixed with other status effects). I couldn't one shot anyone, but if I wasn't up against a gank or a one shot build I was doing well. Playtime is roughly 300 hours.
   5. Nioh. I hated fighting the bosses. Fighting anything else was great. The bosses are extra cheap in that game. Uninstalled it, tried it again, got farther, but still uninstalled it.
5. You said ""There are no more run-ups to bosses. Stamina now regenerates far too quickly, and barely punishes you for running out"" with respect to Souls games becoming too easy.
   1. I'm guessing you specifically mean gauntlet prior to the boss that cannot be avoided. You may be right, I don't remember unavoidable fights in a souls game aside from some bosses. If you don't mean unavoidable, then I'd argue that there are several bosses in DKS1-3 and ER that had gauntlets, but not every boss had them.
   2. That is probably true for a light weight hit and run style build, or a one shot build. Things are very different with medium weight, and excruciatingly different with a heavy weight build. If you think you can do those and NOT get punished for not upgrading your stamina, you are sorely mistaken. Depending how heavy your heavy build is, you may not even be able to move without upgrading your stamina.
6. ""This game is refreshing...The only issue I have with it is that the bosses are far too easy and janky so far"" I agree. It was refreshing up to a point, and bosses were relatively easy.
7. ""This fourth map area, The Whispers, I think it's called, may be one of the coolest environments I've ever had the pleasure of meticulously exploring for hidden enemies and items."" I also agree, but it's unfortunately the last major area a lot of people will explore because they'll get cheapshotted enough in the dungeon to stop playing.

In summary, the problem is the cheapshots on the normal route. I agree with some of the things you said, disagree with most, but ultimately you did not address the problem of the cheapshots. The cheapshots are the MAJOR problem with this dungeon, because at this point is where the players massively drop off out of frustration.",1672531230

"samsunggalaxy","t5_2y8rx","I hate Samsung. I do.

Back when model numbers were in single digits they had rather good phones for first year after buying, then shitload of issues would arise. I moved to Sony Xperia Z3 and it was glorious. Stellar battery, snappy like a pistol shrimp, beautiful UI, messages and mail synced perfectly every time. Z5 was the pinnacle of awesomeness. Everything about that phone was perfect. Samsung was utter garbage at the time. Then Sony started taking away the cool features everyone loved, brainlessly copied features nobody wanted from other makers. Probably the last semi-decent phone from Sony was XZ3. The gaming phone concept was just taking traction and they got impatient and killed it. Then everything went to shit and moreover, they raised the prices exponentially. Hell, they are a major camera maker and their phone cameras went from awesome in Z5 to the worse with every new model. What the actual fuck?! 

So I made my research and found that Samsung put all the cool features Sony to away into their phones and their cameras got on par with those of an iphone. Finally I found a huge amount of customisation options which I was always a sucker for. Android is modular, so all phones should have plenty of customisation! Nah, Sony gives zero fucks, LG dropped the ball, RAZR is RAZR, I hate Apple as a company and their walled garden shit and their obnoxiously shitty design decisions both hardware and software.

So a Galaxy phone was a natural choice for me.",1672531230

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The Burj Khalifa hailed over me. The towers peak was so high that my head had to be peeled back like an orange. With my neck aching and my toes retracted from my too tight socks I still stood with excitement. The long awaited fireworks show was about to start. It was New Years Eve at one of the busiest tourist attractions in the world and me along with my parents had a clear view of the true to scale embarkment. It was magnified 100 times from the pictures I‚Äôd already seen. You truly believed that it was the tallest building in the world standing under and looking right up at it. My mom tugged on my shoulder. Standing beside me at the top of a step to get an even better view. She had her phone camera ready and her internet friends viewing live with her.
‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to turn on your camera?‚Äù She asked me.
I glanced down at my bag hanging over my shoulder. My phone peeked out waiting for me just to grab it. It was always waiting for me to capture a moment. But there were a hundred other people here already capturing the moment for me. I wanted to see this through my own eyes. 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok mom. I‚Äôll watch.‚Äù I said. 
She nodded contently. Her cheeks and cheery red lipstick smile Illuminated by the spectacle of lights shining down from the tower. My dad was behind me too. A tall man with a big phone he pointed towards the top of the tower. The tower went blue, then green and then orange. A kaleidoscope reflected across the stair stacked tower. Images of the universe, nature and the animals reflected on the screen. The people all around felt closer to me. There were a hundreds of us staring in hope and anticipation for the show to start. The UAE flag popped up and we all screamed. Then the count down started. 10,9,8 my mom makes a hearty laugh. 7,6,5, my dad offers her a hand that she squeezes back. 4,3, every person is shouting in perfect unison and crouches to jump. 2, 1. HAPPY NEW YEAR. 
We take flight. 
The lights go off. 
And we scream. 
Golden fireworks fly off the tower and come down like the branches of a Christmas tree. The building is decked in ornaments of fiery lights. Fireworks fly and twirl in all sorts of directions. Looking up, the fireworks hurtle towards us like comets and then vanish and leave a flurry of smoke. Small breaks happen in between. Where the fireworks stop. But each time they start back up again they strike with an even bigger bang that‚Äôs more racuos and explosive. It‚Äôs a spectacle. The surrounding buildings are loud and animated because of the chanting of inside guests. From behind us, fountain water spurts up and claps with the crowd as it hits the ground. ‚ÄúBravo, bravo‚Äù I‚Äôm sure it would say if it were alive. Towards the end I thought it was over. Then a bang went off. Accompanied with golden fireworks spanning out the sides like wings. Then an even louder bang and with even bigger wings. The crowd cheered. And then the last and loudest bang with the biggest and widest fireworks all around. The crowd cheered and roared as flames popped off into the air and soon dissipated. At the end of it all people joined and said happy new year to one another. Pulling non-friends and friends alike into tight hugs. The shimmer of lights glowed down. The particles of smoke hung around the longest. It was very sudden when the lights of all the buildings turned off too. Skyscrapers dimming down like someone had pulled the powerchord to the city. Thinking it was apart of the show, we waited. It was a few moments of deep darkness, only thousands of phone lights shining. People moved to get out of the small closed off section. Security guards, at the barricades, tried to usher people in small batches while everybody else was tried to leave together in one go like fish trying to escape from a net. Everybody on their phones tried to get a taxi and probably tried to ask what was going on. My dad typed frantically on his own. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no Wi-Fi,‚Äù he said to my mother. My mother frowned and then looked down at me. She threw her phone in her bag and pulled me closely into her. I looked at her and when she looked back at me she tried smoothing the features of her face to reassure me. But I was not reassured. People were pushing and shoving all around. Paying little attention to where there elbows hit and where there toes stood on. I was short and felt like a flower whose roots were no longer in the ground. The only thing stabilising me was my mom. I pulled my phone out. The glow illuminated my face and my parents too. I tried to go into a messaging app and message all of my friends. While, all of my contacts showed up it said offline for each one with a red dot next to them. I was going to ask my dad how long until a taxi could come but then a women‚Äôs scream went off. Quick and like a movie jump scare scream. Morbid curiosity got me looking for a source. The darkness seemed to be enveloping me even more as I looked around. Then I soon realised peoples phones were turning off. Lights were leaving all around me. I held tighter onto my mother. My dad still in front of me. His phone turned off. Mine was still on. I captured their worried faces for the last time until the glow of my own phone left. Soon enough all phone lights were gone and everyone was gone. I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between this and when I‚Äôd closed my eyes but right now my eyes were blinking. I felt my mother still holding me and my father asking if we we‚Äôre still there. But the one thing that cemented that my reality had turned to true darkness were the haunting screams that echoed all around me.",1672531230

At the time he didn't care whether or not she knew it or returned it.  He teamed up with the careers to secretly try to protect her.  It couldn't have really been ""true love"" since they didn't really know each other.  I don't think they could really have been said to love each other until much later in the series.

Some of these are always in the same place at the start of the game, whereas others are distributed randomly.¬†Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere¬†red herrings.Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight.""

I had a talk with my brother about Hungarian paganism, and according to research, most Hungarian myths/paganism got lost since they converted to Christianity so quickly. But if you ask the right people or look stuff up, you'll find something, im sure. Look into the roots of where Hungarians came from and what their spiritual practices were. According to my brother (which I haven't vetted, so do take this with a handful of salt),, they were related to the worship of the skies and shamanism. There is evidence they had water spirits. I remember they had their own version of the devil too. An origin myth i know of is the life stag that brought two brothers to Hungary.  I have a bag and earrings of that stag to represent my heritage.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","  &gt;Characters land on earth randomly, and they just HAPPEN to be a short distance from the last human bunker that still has running water, food, and a civilization. Naturally they end up killing everyone there.

Thats because they were supposed to land there genius.... The  trajectory was set to land on mount weather but they went off course after having covered a couple of miles within the atmosphere ....so them being a couple of miles away from the mount  weather doesn't seem like a coincidence. Looks like you had your brain turned off while watching the show or have the attention span of a goldfish.

&gt;Then the president who is still on the space station, uses a rocket (not a ship) to get to earth, has no navigation, and crashes a short distance walk from everyone else.

Wow because new York (which was close to where he landed ) is a  short walking distance to Washington and virginia where they were located huh. LmfaoOoo sure it is if you have hyperflexible legs adapted for superspeed. Are you actually this dense or were you extra preoccupied while watching this show? Also he was aiming for Eastern United States as stated in the show 

&gt; Also the AI's main lab, or base, etc. is also not far from where everyone is.

The AI's lab was thousands of miles from where they were, towards  the extreme end   of the northeast coast of the United States.  Also the person who created the AI was an American so why would it seem like coincidence that her lab would be located in the United States ü§®? I don't see what you're even arguing about here or how this has anything to do with convenience .

&gt;Plus forced love triangles, because the CW excels at that shit.

Wow....tell me you haven't watched this show without telling me you haven't  watched this show. If you think there were any forced love triangles in the show  past the first season then you clearly have a lot going on in your head. Do people  often tell u that u appear to  be in your own world? If they do ,you seriously have  to go and get  that checked . The show basically  dropped some of this teen drama elements like love triangles past the first season for more mature story elements . If you think otherwise , then you're probably &amp; definitely not watching this show. No sir, you're watching something else. Probably something  that  is encrypted  in the world u zone out to lololol rofl.

&gt;On all of earth, everything is all in this one central area.

That's  because the plot was solely focused on  the locations they were. Just because all events in the plot happened there doesn't mean everything on earth happened there. This argument is weak and superficial. If u paid attention which I doubt you did based on your arguments you'd see that we get a glimpse of  other humans in a different place in the world. Just because we don't get enough coverage of what happened in the rest of the world doesn't mean there was none. This logic is like saying that everything that happened on earth in the walking dead happened in southern United Statesü•¥.",1672531233

This may look familiar as I've made similar composites for the [last](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/51791827587_3802ec468e_o.png)  [few](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/50783714443_69df7df281_o.png)  [years](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49293932818_29bbee0357_o.png). The title of this post is a *little* dishonest as a some of the images were partially shot in 2021, but I wasn't able to process them until this year.

This summer I moved to an apartment with bortle 8 light pollution and only a limited view of the northwest sky. Despite this I've had a very productive year for astrophotography, and gotten [over 500 hours of long exposure time](https://i.imgur.com/PuWz1IZ.png) with my single astrophotography rig this year. I have links below for those who want to check out the uncropped original photos, as well as their specific acquisition and processing details.

Commonly asked questions about my photos:

**How do you take long exposures if the sky moves?**

* I use an equatorial mount to [track the movement of the sky](https://gfycat.com/fancytimelyjavalina) and take long exposures without the stars trailing. I also take several hundred shorter exposures (several minutes each) and stack them together to create one single image that then goes onto post processing.

**Are the Colors Real?**

* Most of these images are in false color, however images 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 10 are considered to be true color (our eyeballs alone will never be able to see color in these objects, even through a telescope). I use a black and white camera, and have to take images through filters which are then mapped to RGB channels in order to produce a color image. Using narrowband filters you can isolate specific wavelengths of light emitted by certain gases in space, and map them to make a false color image. [This post does a good job further explaining true vs false color imaging](https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/8cjcv1/the_differences_between_false_color_and_true/dxfdpbf/).

**What is your light pollution/How do you deal with it?**

* These were photographed from a few different locations ranging from bortle 4 to 8. Prior to movinf this summer most of my images were taken from my bortle 6 driveway, but now I'm gonna be living in the city for the next couple years with heavy light pollution. Images 6, 8, and 10 were the only ones taken from dark skies (Bortle 4).  

In order to deal with the light pollution I use narrowband filters which only let through specific wavelengths of light (the specific wavelength that these nebulae emit) and block out almost all other light. It is possible to get good photos without using any kind of light pollution filters, and adding total exposure time is one way to get around LP.

**Is it photoshopped?**

* Not in the way you think. Nothing is being added in to the photos off of the camera. The goal of post processing is to bring out the data that is already there. The raw images are pretty much black, but brightening, sharpening, and running noise reduction helps turn them into nice looking photos.

**How much does your equipment cost?**

* What are you, my wife?

**Where can I learn more about taking pictures of space?**

* Check out /r/astrophotography and /r/AskAstrophotography. They have tons of resources on their wiki pages/ask anything thread, and it's where I learned a lot when I first started in this hobby. If you want to buy a telescope for visual use check out the sticky on /r/telescopes.

"politics","t5_2cneq","There are many individuals and groups within the GOP who actively oppose white nationalism and support diversity and inclusion. These individuals and groups work to promote policies and initiatives that reflect these values, and they often speak out against white nationalist ideas and rhetoric.  
  
Republican National Committee: The Republican National Committee (RNC) has also spoken out against white supremacy. In a statement condemning the violence that occurred at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, the RNC stated that ""white nationalists, white supremacists, the KKK, and neo-Nazis are repulsive, evil, and have no fruitful place in civil society.""  
  
Republican Party of Virginia: The Republican Party of Virginia has also condemned white supremacy and has taken action to distance itself from white supremacist groups. In 2020, the party adopted a resolution condemning white supremacy and stating that ""the Republican Party of Virginia denounces in the strongest terms any and all forms of white nationalism, white supremacy, and racism.""

Former President Donald Trump: During his presidency, Donald Trump, who was a member of the GOP, condemned white supremacist groups and individuals on multiple occasions. For example, after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in 2017, Trump stated that ""racism is evil"" and that ""those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.""  
  
Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy: In 2020, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, who is a member of the GOP, tweeted that ""white supremacy has no place in our society"" and that ""there is no room for hate in America.""

Some of the largest names in the GOP have spoken out against white supremacy, so I don't think they have been silent, nor complicit.",1672531234

I feel like a brand new, hot shot, much smaller display would chooch along better than my big ass TV, but it seems like EVERYONE who has one complains about frame rate...

Should be noted, however, that the human cells used for the prototypes pictured above were actually just purchased from an American tissue laboratory.

It should also be noted they used bovine stem cells (a byproduct of the meat industry) for it, so it's not vegan or harm-free regardless. I guess what they can really say is ""No humans were specifically harmed for this purpose,"" but that's hard for marketing to sell.",1672531236

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I don't disagree with military waste, but there's some aspects of it that can be explained. I share this as an interesting fact because I thought it was interesting.

One part is quality standards. The US military demands that every single part produced meet extremely rigid quality control standards above and beyond what even the most sensitive industry would expect. This is why US equipment is so reliable. Most other countries have problems with bad shells and things falling apart. US stuff works like a charm. Ukraine hasn't had a single report come out of US equipment failing in a way that prevented them from destroying their target. That's why.

Second is documentation. The US requires extensive documentation of how every single part is produced - from raw materials to the shipping of the final product. This is so that any part of the pipeline can be salvaged if it goes bad. Mine run dry? They know six backups to start sourcing from. Factory fire? They can have a new factory mass producing in a month. It is impossible to interrupt production of our complicated death machines.

Third is transport. The US military transports its own shit. They're good at getting things places fast, better than any US company, but bad at getting it there cheap. Well-defended cargo planes designed to manage missile attacks are more expensive to operate than trains and people driving cars on tiny commissions.

What percentage is graft? Less than you think. Still a lot.",1672531237

As a massive uncharted fan (there hasn't been a game series I've been as excited for going to pick up the next game) people write this one off. I think mainly cause so many people passed on the vita in general that they didn't even play it, and it was also a much shorter game with a single location similar to the first one which after the globe trotting of the next games seems slightly underwhelming.
I loved it. It was a great entry to the series let alone portable, and loved seeing sully and Nate together in the ""earlier days""",1672531237

"TwistedWonderland","t5_yn8br","Azul uses water/flora elements. He also has HP regen, which shouldn't be a problem if you're already planning to use dorm Leona but having other attack cards on your team wouldn't hurt. It also doesn't hurt to use defense/healers but that's up to you if you'd rather have just Leona do the carrying lol

For Vil, you only need to have a Vil on your team to activate the bonus; it can be any one, just make sure it's Vil.

However for Leona, it has to be dorm Leona specifically. If you don't have him then you'd need to borrow one from a friend. I have a maxed one, if you need to borrow him I can drop my FC to you, but dorm Leona should be pretty easy to find on the guest selection menu ~~I'm just assuming he's common, I could be wrong lol~~ (Also make sure to use Vil on the same turn as Leona's 2nd spell, just in case you're unaware)

As for your cards levels, I'd say you'd need around 30, going by the freebies the game offers you. But if you want a more comfortable battle, go for 40-60.",1672531238

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","TLDR: Agreed, they turned a great franchise into a blatant cash grab. It's upsetting to watch.

Frankly, I'm grateful the new heroes can be used in custom games regardless of having earned them or not, but please. Locking them behind a battle pass in the first place was a terrible idea and the devs knew that.
 It's a shame to see such wonderful titles go to shit because the devs no longer care about a good reputation. Look at Diablo Immortal as an example of this downward spiral. üòî

I also paid for OW1 and really enjoyed playing it when I did, and was even willing to do Quick Play stuff. But now I just camp custom games since that's the one place new heroes are actually usable at any given point. But if I had to bet, they're eventually gonna paywall that too.

It‚Äôs internal and people probably don‚Äôt notice it but I can‚Äôt help but feel really weird. 

But for now I have my condition completely managed. Being in fluorescent lighting for hours at work was causing the major issues so now I work in a room with windows and high LEDs so I‚Äôm not bothered daily by them. If I do get stuck for some time in fluorescents, often it had to be in small spaces, then I do get that weird feeling but it doesnt cause me pain and isn‚Äôt prolonged. I used to not be able to go to the grocery store, but that is no longer an issue. 

So it‚Äôs still an issue I have but no longer a daily problem.

You have to pay it all out of pocket first, THEN they'll send your charges to insurance for whatever coverage you might have. We were not able to do that, and went with CCRM. The staff there has been nothing but lovely to work with and I would definitely recommend them. They never mentioned a BMI restriction to us. MCRH was very nice to us too, but after doing the IUI's we couldn't afford to move on to IVF with them.

"PubTips","t5_3h5w8","There are a few things that aren't working for me. 

Your first paragraph can be shortened--cut right to the chase. You don't need to mention character arc when introducing comps or dance around the time period the book is set in. Just say it.

The southern twang (I presume) is a bit distracting with the constant apostrophes. I don't think you need to mimic the dialect/accents in your manuscript when querying, but this is more of a personal preference.

The plot doesn't work for me as a young adult suspense novel. You spend all this time setting up the backstory and family dymanics, and how your MC is now trying to survive on their own, and then out of nowhere we get this unnamed person (or monster) out to do MC harm. I'm not feeling the suspense. All I get is this random stake that gets tossed in at the end of your query.

As a whole, the query isn't luring me in. Given the quiet and historic setting of your book, is the writing atmospheric? I don't get that from your excerpt, but if it is, I'd try to showcase that more. If you're going to stray from contemporary thrillers and mysteries, then I personally think you need to capitalize on the vibes of this small coastal town, especially when the plot is a bit....bare bones.",1672531240

As for the last comment about Sapowksi.

Honestly, he was always a bit of a sellout and a scrooge/miserly figure.   I think (and i could totally be wrong here)... he became more of a scrooge when his son died in 2019 and after the CD projekt Red legal dispute when he tried being money grubbing for more money.

On one hand, he's definitely money grubbing and a sellout, on the other hand, i wonder if his sons death sorta just spiraled him into being a scrooge. Apparently he  created the witcher/dedicated it to his son, so i wonder if maybe his death sorta just soured the franchise for him.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","The probability of blastocysts reaching adulthood is relevant because the other option has the certainty of the newborns already being born.

The newborns are born and that is a guarantee. The blastocysts have a chance to not even be born, you intentionally made that into a possibility.

If there's a chance a blastocyst won't make it to term why would I choose that over the certainty provided by a born child already being alive.

Life experience when born provides more meaning than if cryogenically frozen or if your being gestated. So if I can only choose one of those to be experienced it would be life after being born, so I choose the option that guarantees that.

I don't know why you intentionally don't want to add a guarantee of blastocyte survival to your hypothetical because then all of this has to be considered and it's already a very restrictive hypothetical scenario

What difference does it even make if I was alive: hypothetically? They'll always find someone else to brainwash and continue the dreadful cycle.

Capitalism is great if you already had capital to begin with, especially if you were at the beginning of it's creation/introduction to a society. Only gets worse overtime for the rest ü§Æ , All the rich people we serve are also disgusting humans that should never be anyone's role model in life (becoming rich is to become evil, iykyk).",1672531242

The will to live makes humans make brash decisions we would otherwise not make if we thought rationally instead of doing what the will leads us to, for example, we pick the wrong partners because we are more driven by lust and our desire to procreate than picking who would actually fit us.

"starseeds","t5_2umvz","You can call me a dragon starseed. My discovery about my origin mostly came through deja-vu and feelings of familiarity. A few years ago, I started experiencing a sort of obsession for Cynder from the Spyro series, though I knew that character since my childhood.. Not an affectionate kind of obsession, more like she was reminding me of someone. I was practicing communing with other entities at this time, and I already knew about my kinship with dragons. When I asked who she reminded me of, they answered that Cynder reminds me of a lover I left behind coming to this world. Back then, I wasn't sure what to make of the answer or if I heard it correctly, so I thought little of it and continued with the day.  
  
Some months later, synchronicity brought me to a Youtube video, a song that spoke to me on a soul level. It was my lover speaking to me, I just knew it. It brought me to tears. The next night, I even dreamed of her. I didn't see her, but I felt her presence. I heard her voice. Heard here laugh. We were up to mischief together, just like the old days. Through auto-writing, I learned that her name is Chynstrixx. I've drawn an interpretation of her.",1672531245

People who don't know any better fall for it because they come off so confident and are so convincing, even they believe their own bullshit when they speak. People who know better can see right through their bullshit and just avoid engaging them in intellectual debate because you can't win with a person who can't see or admit fault *ever*.

I am no exception to the rule, I adhere to objective truth which means I don‚Äôt cherry pick and assert truths that suit my circumstance‚Äôs or accept ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù as supporting evidence for my narrative.

The other thing is u overrated younger girls that‚Äôs why u craving it. But being in a relationship with younger girls have it‚Äôs own issues eg; u got your shit together you want to settle and they don‚Äôt, or they are needy. So what I‚Äôm saying is any relationship has it‚Äôs own issue you can‚Äôt relate it to age or age difference.you just decide what Kind of issues you are  happy to deal with.

What does it mean that we tread the same earth as divine beings?

Your wife made an agreement with her mother behind your back. Then, she waited for you to be caught by surprise in an awkward situation. Forgive the terminally ill grandfather. But, if he and the grandmother wanted to take a child to Disney, they could've taken your wife when she was a child. They did not. Now, they want to take your children alone without you and your wife. Why wouldn't the grandparents also want to spend that time with their daughter and her husband, too? If they take your children alone, what happens if the terminally ill grandfather has a medical emergency in Disney? How does he expect to keep up with two children there when he's seriously ill?Everyone should've checked with you first, and the grandparents should've offered to cover the cost for both you and your wife. Even then, you still would be in the right if you said no. Your FIL can make many happy memories with his grandchildren closer to home. Surely, there are fun things to do locally. Take lots of video and photos of the girls spending fun times with their grandfather - locally. Plenty of other ideas would be better than a big trip away.

"HazbinHotel","t5_igfxt","&gt;It kind of takes away the uncertainty of how much of a difference heaven has in comparison to hell; especially with who‚Äôs in charge and having the audience try to question if heaven really holier in that regard.

The Hazbin Hotel pilot literally opens with an illustration of the Angels of Heaven standing over a pile of demon corpses drenched in blood with evil grins plastered over their faces. Charlie starts the Hazbin Hotel as a way to get around the annual extermination conducted by heaven. The annual genocides inflicted by heaven upon the demons of hell is literally the cause of the entire series, and is stated within the show as such.

This universe has never kept it a secret that heaven is an authoritarian, genocidal power so I have zero idea why people act as if the show acknowledging that fact is some massive spoiler that ruins the entire series.

"HeartstopperAO","t5_351dr1","The thing about Harry‚Äôs apology though is that it came across as pretty self-involved and insincere. He seemed more concerned with making a show of his apology vs actually apologizing to Nick and Charlie. Additionally, while Harry‚Äôs issue is obviously homophobia, beyond that he‚Äôs also a bully (even more so in the show than the comics). He‚Äôs not just parroting comments, he‚Äôs deliberately targeting Charlie and trying to push him down.

So while I think it‚Äôs a great and important message to show people growing and becoming better, I think in the specific case of Harry his issues are also that he‚Äôs really self-involved. So if he is going to get better, I almost think Charlie shutting the door in his face was needed. &gt;!We do see in the N+C novella that he‚Äôs a bit better, so maybe that moment was a wake up call that Harry needed.!&lt;

(As far as apologies go, I actually think the rugby boys have a really good example of how those apologies SHOULD go. If you compare/contrast their apology with Harry‚Äôs, the rugby boys‚Äô comes across as much more sincere. Their objective seems to be about saving their friendship with Nick/making things right. While I think Harry did realize what he did was wrong, he seemed mostly concerned with saving face. Not about Nick and Charlie‚Äôs feelings.)",1672531249

Buying vintage watches can be tricky: There can be re-dials, fakes, frankenwatches (made up of parts of a few watches), or just in really poor condition. In general, the rule is ""buy the seller, not the watch"" when you make a purchase. By that I mean ensure the store/seller has good a good reputation. As for getting into the hobby, you may want to check out /r/VintageWatches for some other things people have if you want to see what else is out there and popular from a collection standpoint. 

There were tons of factories back in the day (esp 1900 to 1950s) that supplied movements to watch companies. Especially with the rise of electronic and quartz movements so many of them just vanished. There are some amazing Gruens out there worth lots of money, but they are so rare that the odds of them winding up in an antique store are very slim. Here's a post I made a couple years ago about some of my [crown jewels](https://www.reddit.com/r/Watches/comments/ijdyf8/gruen_the_crown_jewels_of_my_collection/)

‚ùó This is a heads up about our updated rule 3: Celebs or public figures ONLY.

 &gt;Only post and comment about celebs/pornstars or otherwise famous people. Influencers must have 100k+ subscribers.

IMO it all comes down to whether or not you enjoy the combat. If you don't, farming is going to be the opposite of fun and won't fix it the issue for you.

"EnneagramType4","t5_jtde9","That is very sweet - and hold onto things like this in your life. They're not only an anchor for when you get older both in memory and emotionally, but put your future into context with your past as a reference. Hold on to this, this is a memory.  


Also, on the subject of artist - yes. Art is how we express our feelings and emotions, and there is not right way to do that (insofar as you don't harm others) ...art is something we express through many mediums, which include a lot more than the bottleneck of language alone. A picture is worth a thousand words, but even a picture of words cast in different contexts and played with different perspectives as it is here, can be art. Abstraction. Art is an expression, and it achives it's purpose when it is shared, and those emotions and feelings communicated to another who gets it.  
So are you an artist? Yes. Very much so...",1672531251

"ADCMains","t5_39cvu","You don‚Äôt want Bork on these champions. Tristana and MF have crit scalings on their abilities, while Jinx rockets only apply on hits to the target of the attack. You‚Äôre better off building more crit to get the aoe crits off.

Jhin wants collector due to the nature of his kit, and he wants his abilities to benefit from the lethality as he deals a lot of his damage with them. Alternatively, you can go rapid firecannon second item for longer range attacks. This is effective on Jhin and not other champions because a single attack from Jhin is significantly more impactful than on other champs.

You should be going LDR third item on any of these champs if the enemy team is tanky. It doesn‚Äôt take much armor built for LDR to outdamage infinity edge, or at least close enough that the cost difference is worthwhile. You also don‚Äôt wanna be on infinity edge while the enemy builds armor and you‚Äôre still working on LDR. Basically, just preemptively build armor pen if you KNOW you‚Äôll need it (you almost always will).

Cut down and LS + 3 pot will give you more damage. However, as potions are consumable, if you use them all up you won‚Äôt benefit in the future. I usually prefer Doran‚Äôs blade for the hp since I‚Äôll always benefit even after recalling. This pretty much goes for any champion. You need to be healthy to all in the enemy, and you need to be safe if you‚Äôre playing a scaler. Dblade just makes more sense for both situations.

Most of my Jinx or Tristana builds look like Kraken -&gt; PD -&gt; LDR -&gt; IE -&gt; BT. 2 attack speed items is unnecessary as Jinx has her passive, tristana has her q, both champions will take lethal tempo, and PD already gives you a ton of AS. However you also cannot skip out on PD because it‚Äôs so cost efficient (going Mythic -&gt; LDR -&gt; IE is very expensive and will heavily delay your spike) and given their auto attack nature, the MS and AS are very needed (MS is effective against tanks as their abilities are limited in range and very dodge-able).",1672531253

"CatAdvice","t5_2sn56","Tips/toys for helping cats transition to an enriching, indoor-only environment:

1. If you have non carpeted floors or a large, empty storage bin, I highly recommend the HEXBUG nano Robotic Interactive Automated cat toy Amazon sells for like $7-$10:
https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00TTU9RAQ/ref=cm_sw_r_awdo_WQTP19CX915TZBE9CZYX

It‚Äôs designed to move like a sentient creature‚Äînot just straight or in circles‚Äîplus, if it gets knocked on its side or back, it can sometimes get back upright!

The LR44 batteries last a long time &amp; are easy to replace.

2. This one is loud but you can technically remove the ball if you‚Äôre trying to sleep, on a phone call, or trying to concentrate:
https://www.walmart.com/ip/Morovilla-Turbo-Interactive-Scratcher-Cat-Toy/19856412

It includes both a toy AND a scratching pad (which you can replace after flipping it over to get the best out of both sides).

3. Rechargeable flopping fish (also noisy but has on/off switch). I think it‚Äôs like $15 or less on Amazon in the USA. It holds still until touched:
https://smile.amazon.com/Potaroma-Electric-Flopping-Realistic-Interactive/dp/B083S3ZXDF
They also apparently make a bird I‚Äôve yet to try.

4. Interactive/puzzle feeders can make cats take longer to eat (which helps control their weight) while also fulfilling their natural instinct to hunt their prey (which makes it more rewarding/enjoyable for the cat).
Here‚Äôs one similar to mine:
https://smile.amazon.com/Petstages-Nina-Ottosson-Buggin-Puzzle/dp/B0872J3XV9

A smaller option for non-carpeted floors:
https://smile.amazon.com/PORTOWN-Dispenser-Tumbler-Interactive-Training/dp/B08R55R993

5. Ensure your TV is secure (i.e., can‚Äôt be knocked over or damaged if cat bats at the screen).
Then open YouTube &amp; search for ‚Äúvideos for cats‚Äù or open this:
https://m.youtube.com/results?sp=mAEA&amp;search_query=videos+for+cats

There are 8-10 hour videos of mice, fish, birds, squirrels, etc. that keep my babies entertained for hours.

It‚Äôs like having a window‚Äîbut better (because there‚Äôs always something stimulating happening onscreen). 

My cats‚Äô top favorites:
https://youtu.be/6pbreU5ChmA
https://youtu.be/S-DC2PfMiSg
https://youtu.be/2AgVMA02lTw
https://youtu.be/xbs7FT7dXYc

If it‚Äôs night time, we play/watch these (so their eyes won‚Äôt stare at bright videos in a dark room):
https://youtu.be/kPIdexXzWEM
https://youtu.be/ZIK6XCJ4tgA
https://youtu.be/VDmX50GKtys

 !!! WARNING !!!  1 of the night-time ones has a couple instances where a spider crawls across the camera which makes it look HUGE &amp; it startled the crap out of me, lol.

If it‚Äôs snowy, I play this video (I don‚Äôt know if cats care if the seasons match‚ÄîI may be anthropomorphizing on that one lol):
https://youtu.be/8fpfdAKcBfU

These are better than looking out a window since there‚Äôs always something stimulating onscreen for the cat to look at.

6. Find some kind of ‚Äútube‚Äù for the cat to play in. Here‚Äôs one made specifically for cats:
https://a.co/7czvALs
But honestly, I just buy like a $7 collapsible laundry basket from Walmart, cut out the bottom, &amp; then cut off any handles/straps my cats could get stuck in. 

It‚Äôs literally their favorite thing in my entire house, especially if another cat plays with them through it.

7. Fountain. Since most cats don‚Äôt drink as much as they should, investing in a quality water fountain that promotes proper hydration can seriously help you avoid expensive health issues down the road.

Inexpensive ones are usually made of plastic (which can cause cat acne &amp; other issues) so I strongly recommend paying $50+ for a ceramic or solid steel fountain that‚Äôs easy to refill, clean, &amp; maintain.
I have 2 of this one (which is currently on sale for $50):
https://a.co/byvz5H6

Below is a $70 wireless option I haven‚Äôt tried yet but plan to buy with my tax refund (it can conserve energy/run on low until it senses your cat):
https://petlibro.com/collections/dockstream/products/dockstream-battery-operated-water-fountain

8. Cat scratchers / trees. Yes, I saved the most expensive for last but it‚Äôs also the most important, IMO.

Your best bet will be watching for pet store sales (this year, my roommate &amp; I bought 2 expensive cat trees at half price by taking advantage of a 1-day, 50% off sale offered through my Petco Rewards app right before Black Friday).

Best of luck!!!  You‚Äôre doing the right thing keeping your cat inside.",1672531254

I emphasize benefits because I do not believe salary should be a sole focus; one must consider the whole package (benefits, retirement, pension), or ‚Äúcompensation.‚Äù

If you factor in PSP (yearly bonus), Kaiser new graduates will easily push *over* the $150K mark. If the unit requires calls, the Stanford nurses and UCSF nurses will easily hop, skip, and jump over $150K as well. Call rates are 30% base rate per an hour and 50% base rate per an hour, respectively. 

Yes, there are nurses who get paid more to kick it at home than nurses who are actually working. üòÇ

"phish","t5_2ql29","I get it. I don't advocate it either but the only ways I know of are to wait fairly in line, go down to a friend who saved space via a tarp or simply barging down. 

Not perfect in the least but its now way better organized now than the horror stories I've heard from the fan-made checklists and the all out sprints to the rail. 

I did lottery for the rail once at Dick's and it was civil, orderly and they even had a big shade structure for all of us to chill under until we had to line up Southwest Airline style and then we were slowly escorted in, in a line, to prevent people doing the mad dash. Then later a big ass tarp was put down and security put the nix on it. Wasn't perfect but it worked. I wouldn't do more than once a run or even more than once a year but every once in a while it's kind fun to be up there, but only if you can be FIRST row. I imagine second row and back gets a bit dicey with people being douchey. Having hands on the rail its easier to hold down some space. And having something to lean on is also dope too.",1672531254

"MoscowMurders","t5_7el1lf","I‚Äôve said this before, and I‚Äôll say it again‚Ä¶PLEASE upload your DNA to GEDmatch! 

If you have taken DNA tests on any of the major ancestry sites, you can upload your data to GEDmatch. Be sure to select the option to ‚Äúopt-in‚Äù and allow law enforcement to have access to your profile (the default is opting out). It‚Äôs very easy. Law enforcement and the general public do NOT have access to your full genetic profile if you have concerns. 

It took me over five years to do upload mine (just laziness). I had assumed there were plenty of my relatives on the site already. I had dozens of close relatives on ancestry, so surely at least a few would be on GEDmatch? When I finally uploaded my profile, and even today, three years later, my closest relative on GEDmatch shares 33 cm of DNA with me. This means that someone would have to go back 11 generations (the 17th century) to attempt to find a match. The next closest match I had was 17cm. In other words, until I uploaded my profile, if anyone even remotely related to me had been a Jane/John Doe or an unsub, it would be virtually impossible to find a match through forensic genealogy.

That's just an example of scale, but you need to have clear borders and not repeated values because it will not be representative sample. 

For example 30 being high and low value, it means if someone actually is 30 you can't place him just in one group and it is repeated data if you have him in both. That's why new group is n+1 (n= high end of previous group).

Also groups have more narrow scale   
(18 -24; college time, first job maybe, some people start living entirely on their own depending on culture, maybe first mature steps,   
25 - 30; first serious careers steps, more money at disposal, starting a family maybe etc.,

"dancemoms","t5_2u0sl","Well mainly it has something to do with the ratings of the show as well as the amount of competitions attended. They also throw in some 2 PT episode specials in the later seasons, so that definately has something to do with the later season's episode count. Season 3 also had 6 extended episodes on top of the amount they have. If you take a look at ratings for the show, Season 3 was the most popular season and had the most live viewers of the show seasons. It also has the most reunions + special episodes from the show in an entire season. Season 1 was filmed in April, so due to the competition season it was a short season. Season 4 the ratings started to drop, but not as bad as it did until season 5. I'm pretty sure s5 only has 31 ep's, unless you're including the Throwback specials.

S1 - 10 Competitions Attended

S2 - 25 Competitions Attended

S3- 27 Competitions Attended + 2 from CADC + 1 from Starbound Dancer Cares Foundation

S4 - 25 Competitions Attended

S5 - 25 Competitions Attended

S6 - 28 Competitions Attended

S7 - 23 Competitions Attended

It seems that they all average the same amount of competitions besides s1 as it was filmed during the 2nd half of the dance season. So the episode amount differ between seasons has to do with the extra episodes such as reunions, throwbacks, specials, etc. and would be added in as ""filler"" episodes so there's more episodes to the season and not the competitions. Suprisingly Season 6 has the most competitions that they attended even though it was a very weak season for the show and that season 3 still has more episodes due to the ""specials""",1672531256

So it's ""illogical"" for there to never be evil or sinful people?

Also, does this rule out certain miracles?

&gt; No, a demon simply has to exist for an angel to exist.

Why?

&gt; Because the people choose to follow demonic path.
&gt; 
&gt; Your argument is essentially the same as saying ""if a gun is able to be used to kill something, that means the person who shot is forced to be a gun.""

It's very cute though to think you -according to Qatar's distorted west-aimed propaganda- know Islam better than all scholars Muslims around the Islamic world.

"goodworldbuilding","t5_36lezf","**Flame Phantom**: Most monarchies around the world don't require anything special. Either you're the eldest son or the favorite son of the previous monarch gives you a 99% chance to become the next king. In some countries, it's even stated that only sons can inherit the throne, daughters do not have that right. Empire of Albion is more free regarding this as they allow princesses to take the throne, their priority is decided by age and generation. Empire of Valholl chooses the eldest son among sons, then daughters. Great Novgoroussiyan Empire is very strict about their crown heir, demanding the heir to be capable of leading the country. 

...

Then you have the *United-motherfucking-Empire*, which, in the past, turned this into a public election that would make the USA's 2020 election look like 2 kids arguing. Because emperors and empresses back then had lots of children and they followed meritocracy which favored the talented with real abilities rather than age and sex, all sons and daughters of the ruling monarchs were prepared to be heir candidates. They were taught from a young age about how to become a proper ruler, then sent out to live with commoners so they could understand what the masses desired in their future leader, understood their hardships, and knew that monarchs could never distance themselves from people. Then after a certain amount of time, they started the Crown Heir Election, citizens from all around the Empire would vote for their chosen heir. 

However, there were 6 people who had more authority in this. They're the Arch Lords, monarchs of constituent countries that make up the Empire. Their votes equals a thousand... not that much considering the UE's population in 1600 was already pass 80 million lives. They did, however, have a voice about who was worthy and who was not. Because the next monarch must be someone capable of uniting all 7 constituent countries and over 100 different races under one banner, they could not let an imbecile, incompetent incel sit on the throne. As such, incompetents were disqualified from the get-go, those who could stay in the election were real deals, the top among tops. Only then the election would start. 

Candidates could do whatever ***legal*** action to win. Note that they could only choose leagal things, as such kidnapping, threatening and assassinating others were not tolerated. If they were found doing so, they would be disqualified immediately and dragged to the law court, where they were judged like every other criminal. In the Empire, laws are absolute and even monarchs are lower than laws. Legalism at its finest. An election can last for even 2 years, when it's over the Crown Heir was named and everyone else was granted nobility, a villa and a land to collect 15% taxes. They did NOT, however, had authority over those lands, unlike Western nobles or even Imperial nobles who were originally warlords. These ""royal-nobles"" were under supervision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to make sure they would not try to do anything stupid, such as rebelling. Their nobility was also ranked down each generation so to keep the title for their descendants, they would have to work and contribute a lot for the Empire. Otherwise they'd be casted aside. 

The Empire did not discriminate any gender, so all children of the ruling monarch, both princes and princesses alike, as long as they were legitimate kids, could join the election. That's why they had so many empresses. However, with the new law that outlawed polygamy of all kinds (many wives, many husbands), the royal house has shrunk down considerably in the last 2 generations. Now the ""election"" is just for ceremonial reason only. They still pick the most competent kid to be the next monarch, btw. 

... Not that it really matters as the Empire is now a constitutional monarchy and the Prime Minister is their de facto leader in peace time.",1672531257

You have repeatedly mocked trans people, referred to them as having a mental illness, called people such lovely things as ""manwoman"", said that trans people are deluded, and refused to accept anyone's peer reviewed studies that support transition for trans people. All of that is actively showing that you don't support trans people. If you straight up said it, you'd just be repeating yourself, at this point.

they're trying to turn it into just another FPS, they removed all of the CC and stuff which yeah sometimes sucked to work with, but it doesn't seem like the same interesting game i used to play. add the matchmaker woes, the lack of free skins or things to do, how long it takes to see progress in ranked... it just kind of feels like they aren't taking what players say into account at all and they're just changing stuff in a ""throw shit on the wall and see if it sticks"" kind of way. and none of it seems to be something the players want there.",1672531259

**Moore‚Äôs Black Forest Tort ( no cherries)**

**Cake Ingredients\***

1 ¬æ C Flour

1 ¬æ C Sugar

1 ¬º tsp Baking Soda

1 tsp Salt

¬º tsp Baking Powder

‚Öî C Soft Margarine

4 Sq ( oz) Unsweetened Chocolate 

1 ¬æ C Water

1 tsp VAnilla Extract

2 Eggs 

**Chocolate Fill Ingredients**

1 ¬æ  Bars Germans Chocolate

¬æ C Margarine 

¬Ω C (+) Slivered Almonds

**Whipped Cream Filling**

2C Whipping Cream ( Heavy Cream)

1 Tbs Sugar

1 tsp Vanilla Extract

***Cake Prep***

WARNING -  This cake is delicate, and hard to de-pan - an alternate chocolate cake recipe, chocolate rich but not overly sweet should work.  Needs to be enough for 4 x 9‚Äù round pans, medium high.  A box, one-bowl, or ‚Äúwacky‚Äù cake may be too moist and sweet to really work here.

\-------

Bring Margarine to Room Temp

Preheat Oven to 350F

Melt and Cool the Unsweetened Chocolate    ( Melt Choc in double boiler or gently in Microwave.   Microwave  - in small glass bowl / custard bowl break up chocolate.   Microwave on high for 30 Sec.   Let rest for 2-3 min, Microwave 30 Sec, remove and stir ( should be starting to melt) return to microwave for another 30 Sec.   Remove and stir, let rest a minute, and stir again.   It should be pretty warm and will continue to melt.)

In large bowl combine all of the ingredients EXCEPT the eggs.   Beat on low to medium until smooth, 2-3 Minutes, scraping sides.  

Add the eggs, and continue beating on medium for 2 minutes.  (Not on high, this may put too much air into the batter) 

Prepare 9‚Äù Cake Pans ( I use 2, if you have 4 all the better, 1 may not really work).   

Cut a wax-paper circle to fit the bottom of the pan. ( cut a wax paper sheet, fold in half, then quarter, then once more to make a ‚Öõ wedge, align to bottom of pan, and cut an arc.  Unfold and check how well this fits in the pan.  Trim to fit as needed,  You will need 4 of these.)

Grease the pans ( shortening) liberally, place wax circle in bottom and apply shortening to top of wax paper.  ( I know this is a lot, but this seems to be needed,)

Pour ¬º of the batter in each of the pans, about 1 ¬º C each.

Place in oven and bake for 15-18 Min -until toothpick check comes out clean.  ( you can not re-use the toothpick - sorry) 

Once done remove and place on cooling rack.   After a few min work a thin knife around the edge of the pan.  Let cool some more, I then flip the cakes onto parchment paper on a cooling rack.

Clean and re-prep the pans, and bake the next two the same way.

You and slide the first two off of the racks because they are on the parchment,

‚Äî------------------

Prep the Chocolate Filling

Melt the 1 ¬Ω Bars of Germans Choc like above.   Let it cool, until it is warm, not hot.

Toast the Almonds 

Turn up oven to 400.   Spread slivered almonds on baking sheet, place in oven USE THE TIMER - 3 minutes, remove and stir - redistribute the almonds, 3 more min and check, then 1 min at a time.  Watch these like a hawk.    Once they start to toast - they go to burnt very quickly.

In med / small bowl Mix the Margarine and chocolate  - will be pretty thin.   Once blended stir in the almonds until uniformly coated and distributed in the chocolate mix.

‚Äî----------

Prep the Whipped Cream filling

In large bowl place Cream, Sugar and Vanilla - beat until it is whipped cream, do not over beat.   It should hold peaks firm.  

‚Äî------

Assemble Cake

Place a cake layer on your serving plate ( probably will not be able to transfer this once assembled, maybe if you use a waxed cardboard cutout ?) 

Then coat that cake with ¬Ω of the chocolate/almond filling ( just on top of the cake to the edges, not down the sides)

Place a cake layer on the Chocolate

Put a little less than half of the whipped cream filling on the cake.  ( a table knife warmed in hot water can help spread the whipped cream)

Then another cake, chocolate filling, cake and then whipped cream on top.

We ‚Äúplop‚Äù the whipped cream on so it overhangs the edge.  .  

Using a carrot peeler, shave curls of chocolate from the last ¬º of the Germans Chocolate bar to decorate the top.

‚Äî------- 

This needs to be refrigerated to set up.   If you want to wrap,, I place in freezer for 20-30 min.   Then the whipped cream should be pretty firm.   Lay out 2-3 strips of plastic wrap, so they overlap, and stick together - then use that to cover the whole cake.",1672531260

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Ah, but have you considered, Jolteon is the electric one (which, according to me circa when I was like, eight years old, is always the coolest element) and looks cool, so therefor it's the best one and you're wrong? Didn't think so.

Jokes aside, though, it's still probably my favourite Eeveelution (the only other contender being maybe Umbreon, though they're a solid bunch all around). You could argue it's a little basic and that 'electricity = spikes' isn't the most out there idea, but I don't really have a problem with its simplicity; it's still the most appealing in terms of look to me, the 'coolest' in terms of design while still retaining Eevee's overall cutesy look. 

Ironically, I don't think I've ever really liked Vaporeon much; it's the most distinct looking of them all, but it just feels like too much to me. I'd go as far as to say I feel like the mermaid features don't fit with what remains of Eevee's fuzzy woodland critter look and make it look kinda ugly. My opinion is probably shaped a lot by my tastes when I first interacted with them (with a, ah, much 'simpler' mindset than I'd assess something with now), but even if I cognitively recognise that one of these is much more creative than the other, it doesn't really change that it just looks much worse to me. Sometimes less is more, or something.

Oh, and Flareon exists too. It's cute, I don't have much to say about it. Towards the lower end of that list but it's not bad, just don't gravitate towards it much.

Hope you have a happy new year!",1672531261

I am very proud of this piece. It consists of 14 of my favorite images I have finished processing this year. Some were imaged in 2021, but I only got around to finally creating the finished product this year. An interesting anecdote is at one point I was robbed while traveling and lost nearly 6 TB of data. I was extremely extremely lucky and the cops caught the guy and I got all of my stuff back. But, had they not a lot of these images would not exist as I was not very diligent with my backups‚Ä¶ something that has changed since.

There is a lot of variation here. Galaxies, nebula, milky way panos, star trails, and more. I am hoping to learn even more techniques and improve for 2023. Happy new year!

"Pathfinder_Kingmaker","t5_idyrj","Narrative wise Trickster is essentially a demigod of karmic punishment.

Animewise it somewhat reminds me of the dark personality of the king of games in the yu-gi-oh manga (which I only know of I haven't actually read it). The way they command their armies also partially involve boardgame tropes so there's that.

Now, in terms of character building I'm not so sure. There's nobody that screams 'master of games' to me in terms of class fantasy, be it in the game or paizo in general. And the mythic powers don't help much in that regard. The trickster builds tied to crits are always very interesting and they lean on the trickster theme of being lucky, or as one mentor puts it 'the world conspiring to give you what you need/want'. You can't go wrong with crits whichever type of character you build, especially since everyone in the party benefits from them.",1672531262

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 50 words.**

They come to the Temple every day and seem delighted to learn all about me. They act like a righteous nation that would never abandon the laws of its God. They ask me to take action on their behalf, pretending they want to be near me. ‚ÄòWe have fasted before you!‚Äô they say. ‚ÄòWhy aren‚Äôt you impressed? We have been very hard on ourselves, and you don‚Äôt even notice it!‚Äô ‚ÄúI will tell you why!‚Äù I respond. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because you are fasting to please yourselves. Even while you fast, you keep oppressing your workers. What good is fasting when you keep on fighting and quarreling? This kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me. You humble yourselves by going through the motions of penance, bowing your heads like reeds bending in the wind. You dress in burlap and cover yourselves with ashes. Is this what you call fasting? Do you really think this will please the Lord? ‚ÄúNo, this is the kind of fasting I want: Free those who are wrongly imprisoned; lighten the burden of those who work for you. Let the oppressed go free, and remove the chains that bind people. Share your food with the hungry, and give shelter to the homeless. Give clothes to those who need them, and do not hide from relatives who need your help. ‚ÄúThen your salvation will come like the dawn, and your wounds will quickly heal. Your godliness will lead you forward, and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind. Then when you call, the Lord will answer. ‚ÄòYes, I am here,‚Äô he will quickly reply. ‚ÄúRemove the heavy yoke of oppression. Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors! Feed the hungry, and help those in trouble. Then your light will shine out from the darkness, and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon. - Isaiah
&gt;
&gt; ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúThe days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. It will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not remain faithful to my covenant, and I turned away from them, declares the Lord. This is the covenant¬†I will establish with the people of Israel after that time, declares the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. No longer will they teach their neighbor, or say to one another, ‚ÄòKnow the Lord,‚Äô because they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.‚Äù - Hebrews

They are learned behaviors which can also be unlearned (a better term would be 'weaned off'), to more appropriate behaviors.

"snowboardingnoobs","t5_3gip3","Well yeah, basically if you want to improve your turns you need to figure out how to use your body to get the board to tilt higher on edge. For most people that's just bending. But if you have particular issues that make bending difficult then you might have to go for something a bit more unusual. It's certainly worth trying a wider duck stance if you find that helps. If you have to make an adjustment to your movements because of your physical limitations, I'd also say that inclining a little more over your heelside edge is probably going to be more effective for getting your board to turn than bending at the waist. Just because inclining will still tilt your board on edge, but bending at the waist achieves nothing for board performance. 
Maybe you need to think about getting a 2nd board with different binding angles for when you're feeling more freestyle.
I'm a snowboard instructor, I don't have a degree in biomechanics unfortunately so my knowledge only goes so far. But I encountered a channel on YouTube called Squat University that addresses some of the different ways you can adjust to different body types (at least with weight training, not snowboarding).

"PenisSleeve","t5_280bcn","Well first off - good for you for sharing - not easy to do. Short answer: 

1) get a cock ring - will help get / keep the erection. This one from adorime is great on Amazon -  https://a.co/d/5rn4ABB

2) make sure that ‚ÄòToys‚Äô are an accepted thing in your sex repertoire (e.g. using wands, dildos, vibrators) - always centered around her pleasure 

3) getting into light bondage helps (blind fold restraints) - as your partner will be more open mentally to try new things. Here‚Äôs a good simple restraint from Amazon: https://a.co/d/e840YWd

4) instead of going full sleeve (like Timmy etc) - I suggest going for open ended sleeve - bad dragon make some good ones (try flint, Magnus, cracker). This is less intimidating and can be positioned as minor ‚Äòenhancements‚Äô, as she‚Äôs still be feeling you and you also can get some sensation. (Link to flints sheath: https://bad-dragon.com/products/flintsheath - note that for BD you‚Äôll have to wait for their inventory drops before being able to purchase) 

Finally, position it all about you, it being your desire (psychologically) to have a girthier penis etc. and along the way she gets an added bonus of pleasure

Best to play the long game here, but hopefully adopting the above steps for several weeks can help. 

Hope this helps - good luck!",1672531265

My birth wasn‚Äôt  bad the only crappy part was that my cervix was not at all ready so they did the balloon and pitocin and had to basically force me into labor and the balloon and pitocin together was ROUGH! There were some hours there once they did it that I was begging for reprieve and they tried fentanyl - which kinda helped for about twenty minutes but yeah no. There was some delay on getting me the epidural because of my previous back surgery and concern it wouldn‚Äôt work (the anesthesiologist scared me about it) but let me just say, it did work when I got it and HOLY SH*T that thing is Gods medicine lol I went to sleep got some amazing naps in and they were able to up the pitocin and my body wasn‚Äôt fighting the pain anymore so when I was 9.5 cm I felt the small urge to push. So they sat me up for twenty minutes and I kid you not I listened to my birth playlist and I cried tears of joy because I was so excited to meet her. And then I pushed for like twenty minutes, it was so easy, I felt absolutely no pain just pure joy and excitement and then she was here! Couple small labial tears, 5lbs 10oz at birth and besides the bit of stress about being able to get the epidural and those few hours of eff this pain from the balloon and pitocin it was honestly a very positive birth experience! Only downside my BIL came to our small Christmas Eve dinner at my moms and was coughing , I asked him and he played it off and told me it was just the crud and I‚Äôd be fine‚Ä¶ well I wasn‚Äôt, I had even cancelled going over there for Christmas because I was concerned but i went into labor that morning‚Ä¶ AND after the birth I got a cough which turned out to be influenza a so I haven‚Äôt been able to hold my baby without a mask and that‚Äôs been the hardest part. it broke my heart I stayed away from her as much as I could except breast feeding for the first couple days and yeah it sucks. I was so careful I was vaxxed, I wore my mask everywhere and all I went to was a small Christmas Eve thing where I trusted my family . They all feel horrible especially my BIL but like he knew he was sick he knew I was very pregnant and he ignored my sister when she told him to go to urgent care or not come if he was sick (she came ahead of him cuz he was working.) so just be careful out there!

"nvidia","t5_2rlgy","Since you're doing machine learning and have 4k monitors, the 4090 will have better long-term value from having more raw power before showing its age.  The value proposition depends on how often you plan on  upgrading your GPU.  If you upgrade yearly or every other year, the 4080 will probably hold up just fine, but for 3-5 year upgrades, the extra upfront money for the 4090 will allow you to hold out longer than the 4080 before the GPU starts showing it's age and holding you back.

So putting some rough numbers on this, a $1200 card every 2 years is $600/yr before resale is factored in, while an $1800 card every 5 years is $360/yr and resale is probably a nonfactor at 5+ years out.  Of course, you can't predict what the future of GPU prices looks like, unfortunately, so there's no guarantee that you can buy the same class of card at a similar price point in the future.  If that's the case, getting a higher class card today amd holding it for 5 years may be the better option, hedging against future price hikes.

I do think that prices will have to get more sensible, given the historic slump in GPU sales.",1672531266

"rum","t5_2rg5e","Bourbons ...ecch.  They were my father's drink, but I've never warmed up to them.

Try an Irish whiskey like Red Breast.  Quite nice.

Or how about a Balvenie Caribbean Cask Scotch?  It's aged in rum casks, so there's this soup√ßon of rumminess that is quite fetching.  

You'll find Scotches tend to fall into two camps: malty and approachable (like the Balvenie), and peaty smoke-bombs from the Islay region, which are often shall-we-say an acquired taste.  If you don't like Bourbon, you probably won't much like Islay Scotches at first.

For Scotches, mind the [legal terminology](https://www.gentlemansgazette.com/blended-scotch-whisky/).  ""Blended scotch"" means malts mixed with neutral grain spirits that often add burn and little else.  ""Blended malt"" means a mix of single-malts; they're uncommon but often very nice.  Single malts are the reflection of each distillery's art.  There's quite a bit of nuance.

In any case, neat is preferred, especially this time of year.  A few drops of pure water broadens the experience.",1672531266

So I'm running 32Gb of 3600 ram (Corsair vengeance pro RGB), do you think I should up that in addition to the cache/hdd? I do some HD and 4k video editing, nothing intense, just basic editing for my YouTube videos... 

A second question I had after posting this is, am I able to use the WD Black SN770 SSD as a cache for 2 x HDD's? And would I be better off using the 2 HDDs separately or rather putting them into some kind of RAID configuration (once I get the 2nd HDD, which will probably be in a week or two). 

I really appreciate your input, I don't have really anyone to turn to for this, it goes over everyone's head, including my own apparently LoL!

You can avoid doubling up if you're always playing multiplayer where one person dumps the points into the global skills for recipes since they won't give anything extra if more people take them

"Damnthatsinteresting","t5_2xxyj","I was listening to a lecture on the foundations of neurobiological anthropology (this is a paraphrase; I will see if I can find the lecturer in my notes) and out of nowhere and unexpectedly (well, maybe not so unexpectedly as he was speaking about abuse reactivity) the lecturer said, with regard to how complex human brains are and how there's this feedback loop between behaviors and creating/establishing neuronal pathways (ie, how repetition creates habit, habit creates physical pathways in the brain, these pathways inform our entire physiology, our physiology mediates how we experience reality):

*Children who have experienced terrible abuse suffer the equivalent of brain damage, we may even speak of it (abuse) in terms of an acquired brain injury. Although it's not always long term and some of the affects can, to a degree, be reversed with the appropriate therapies and treatments. Some people fully recover in terms of being able to manage their lives in productive and appropriately responsive ways but as we now know with PTSD, or Complex PTSD, it has no cure. But it can be treated, in many cases, successfully.*

*However, the likelihood of an abused child receiving appropriate interventions at the right time in their lives, the time when an intervention would be most effective in remediation, is low. Now imagine that child, suffering from the emotional and physical trauma of abuse, imagine him or her growing up believing in the absoluteness of the world they'd been exposed to and socialized into in which they likely perceive their abuser to be the most powerful being in their universe, who do you think they would most identify with? Being (from a child survivor's perspective)  a powerless victim or a powerful abuser? Most people don't like the feeling of powerlessness, and children who are still developing, still growing and learning, all they know is that they weren't powerful enough to protect themselves and if they had been powerful things would probably be different. Some kids freeze, some fight, some flee each of these modes has a specific function in protecting the child and acts as a defense mechanism even in the case of abuse reactive behaviors directed outward onto other people, animals, objects.*

*Kids act out their pain, their emotions, they aren't articulate enough yet in their developmental stage to really verbalize what their emotional states are, the complexity of their emotional state and so acting out their experiences of powerlessness in an abuse situation, having been abused, sometimes a child will take on the role of the abuser, to feel powerful to gain a sense of security and control, in some ways proving that they are not vulnerable - that is an aspect of abuse reactivity, that is how some children who have suffered terrible abuse can go on to hurt animals, other children, family members.*

I heard that lecture about 10 years ago and it stuck with me. This is what the admiration some people have for psychopaths reminds me of - admiring what seems to them to be a powerful being when really, they (psychopaths) are sad, broken, incomplete human beings who will never know or understand the full richness and depth of a whole humanity connected to the amazing range and complexity of emotional attachment and affinity, empathy, love, friendship.

I'm glad you are where you are in your journey, and I am glad you embraced your humanity (which includes being vulnerable; courage is the ability to feel fear but do it anyway and dealing with trauma takes nothing but courage) instead of avoiding it as way too many of us do.",1672531269

My first job was a cashier at a supermarket. 5.50/hr at the time.  at that point, I had zero work skills, and hadn't even graduated high school.  Nowadays, that job can literally be done by a machine. I would have been laid off if I still worked there. (plus the company went under lol)

over the years, I gained experience and skills, and was able to get a better job that paid much more.  

Wages are a price, just like anything else.  it's the price of labor.  and it is subject to the law of supply and demand. more difficult/dangerous/unique jobs naturally pay more, because less people are willing or available to do the work.  A sanitation worker can make north of 80k/yr. ironworkers who build skyscrapers can make well over 100k. I don't know anyone who would do that job for minimum wage, so they have to pay more in order to get workers.",1672531269

"ChristianApologetics","t5_2t6hc","&gt; Right, I will never talk about when an ancient text is dated until I know for sure whether or not the figures in the text are or are not divine beings. 

No, that is not what I said. I said that you have to remain neutral on it, which is the exact opposite of demanding certainty as to something's divine status.

&gt;That's just going to be a perpetual blocker to making any assessments about reality that are related to ancient traditions, I guess. No more analysis of any sort allowed on ancient texts with miracle claims. You have achieved the ultimate conversation stopper.

No. You can look at other elements of Mark to date it (for example, who is he speaking to, what events he talks about and so forth), you just can't use your preconceived notion of if Jesus was divine or not to date it, which absolutely is bad scholarship. Proper scholarship is neutral on matters of theology.

You would certainly be upset, right, if a Christian said that because it is a prophecy and the Holy Spirit was guiding Mark that it had to predate the destruction of the temple. You're just doing the same thing but the other way.

&gt;This criticism of scholarship is untenable if you apply it to the real world.

I'm not sure what you mean by tenable, but it is certainly a very potent criticism of a number of people who call themselves scholars.",1672531269

Sabonis and KAT are not guys who you can survive with playing the 5 in a deep playoff matchup, and Gobert looks like he's slowing down and already had troubles with perimeter players (although with better surrounding talent in his prime, he arguably would have been totally fine).",1672531269

"KnowledgeFight","t5_12png7","I have pretty strong negative feelings about the pledge of allegiance in schools. It is absolutely _bizarre_. In middle school is when it was reintroduced/made mandatory (again) in my state. I remember having arrived late by school bus in high school once and the allegiance was already going over the PA-system, and instead of being able to hurry to my class, a school administrator grabbed me and made me stand silent in the hall for the pledge. It was bizarre to me then, and it is absolutely bonkers to me now; having lived overseas for the last decade only sharpens my sense of _what the fuck?_

Alex's whiny, ""Don't-say-Christmas-or-you'll-get-arrested"" rhetoric is like nails on a chalkboard to me. It's worse than how he sounds now, honestly. Around 2003 is when I was really beginning to pay attention to politics and form my opinions, and hearing his shit-ass 2003 takes throws me back to then and I do not like it.

"idahomurders","t5_7elrxg","Complete speculation-

I‚Äôve seen this discussed a little bit but I am trying to put some additional pieces together: 

Motive Theory : BK was supplementing his income from selling stimulants and using them himself as well. 

Some one in that house may have either 

1) threatened to report him for these acts 

2) bought a large quantity and refused to pay


Support: 

BK displays behaviors associated with addictive personality traits: There‚Äôs a video remarking on an alleged history of drug abuse and relapse. 

The vegan behavior possible links to weight loss (which is another habit of people with addictive personalities) 

A side effect from stimulants like concerta (a common adhd med) is anger and explosively angry episodes 

There were comments from a peer that he was coming in looking really tired following the murders - could be signs of withdrawal to distance himself from the substance he was selling. 

Following this, there seems to be another behavioral change. He suddenly engages with people and is described as chatty. 

This is reported as a side effect of stimulants and may indicate a point where he felt comfortable with using again. 


The victims may have used medications to aid in studying: 

Illicit use of adhd/stimulant medication is very high among the college population. 
Purchases seem to peak close to major exam events (midterms finals etc) 

There‚Äôs not a negative stigma associated with this act - College students were polled on using adhd medications to help ‚Äúcram‚Äù many participants went to far as to identify it as acceptable. 

The demographic for purchase is usually white middle/upper class (male female is pretty close) who live on campus (Versus commute) who actively go to college parties and are receiving their bachelors degree. 

This is a theory 
This is speculation",1672531270

"news","t5_2qh3l","I realize you are only the messenger here, so please don't think I am attacking you - and I will say that for a lot of folks your advice is probably sound, but, just...allow me to jump off your comment for a moment, because I am at my wit's end due to currently being in the seventh level of appeals process hell, and have been over and over *and over* for the last year with two different, but both *very* commonplace but name-brand-only drugs, one of which is a non-scheduled drug for chronic, debilitating pain and without which I went *three months* early this year (because the system is broken AF), and a huge part of that issue is my doctor is either remarkably lazy, astoundingly stupid, or both, (I'm going with lazy, because you just can't be THIS stupid and get a medical degree...or at least I *hope* you can't). 

 I just don't know what is going on with doctors these days. Everything with him is a long drawn-out, miserable affair for me, as in, it's like he has an oppositional defiance issue with this one subject, just doesn't want to do it so he doesn't, and I say this because during literally *every single renewal* since either my insurance company, or the prescription management company (did you know they're different?) or both - I really don't know which it is because our system is such a byzantinium nightmare set up to make it so everything is as opaque and hard as possible for patients, presumably so as to make them give up and just accept shit care, which increases some conglomerate parent company's quarterly profits - changed things early in the year to make getting name-brand-only medications a thousand times harder than before (I went years without it being an issue, *years*. Then all of a sudden, nope). 

But I digress, this physician who is - and this is another revealing little tidbit about how shit in general the system is local to me - the best I've been able to find (I'm serious when I say every single other one I've managed to try in the last seven years also sucked, each in different, but equally intolerable, ways)  and who is 1. close to me, 2. who was/is taking new patients *and*, most importantly, 3. who takes my insurance (a increasingly formerly very good, but high deductible PPO), simply doesn't include the very first thing necessary in the appeals process when submitting the request, the reason for the need for the name-brand drug, something called, ""The Documentation"". 

So, the process stalls out instantly, as in it is auto-rejected literally upon the receipt of the request, but, no one tells me he/his ""appeals team"" (I have doubts this team actually exists) failed to include The Documentation. 

Then the doctors office doesn't inform me of this denial, ever, which I need so I can try to immediately follow through so I don't fall into an extended gap of care. They don't inform me, even though they get immediate confirmation of approval or denial, so, I am left hanging in limbo, hoping against hope for the approval and a call from the pharmacy that the drug is ready, just waiting and waiting in pain and/or dysfunction, until I dedicate half a fucking day or multiple days ferreting the information out of someone (i.e., I send pleading, impotent, mostly-ignored messages to the doctors office, or leave totally ignored voice messages to them with the answering service, or I sit on hold for hours, over and over, with Express Scripts, that miserable asshole concept of a company; Pharmacy Benefit Management companies like Express Scripts are a shining example of just how broken our system is). 

Anyhow, over and over my doctor (and his staff) simply haven't included The Documentation, which sounds daunting but is, in fact, a simple paragraph explaining why I can't be prescribed the generic (allergy or other serious reaction to insipients, additives or ingredients). 

And then, when I finally talk to someone it's usually at my next appointment *which I have to schedule *two months* in advance* -  in other words, it often takes *two months* to actually talk to someone directly about the denial because they simply don't respond to portal messages (the only way to send them) and don't have a direct line to the office. 

So there I am, two months without my medication, and the doctor's all, with brow furrowed in a vague imitation of  sympathy, ""*shakes head*, It's very hard to get this drug approved these days because of Covid and availability issues and whatnot. Oh well! *shrugs* ""... 

...But that's a lie. Because every time, when they finally, *finally*, did their job and properly followed-through, it's gotten approved within a couple of days

And, all that is AFTER I always remind them ahead of time that they absolutely, positively, *must include The Documentation when submitting the pre-approval request* and then *must include it in the inevitable appeal* (I think the system is set up to auto-reject every. single. initial pre-approval request, carte-blanc).  I even send them the *exact wording* they have to use when submitting it in order for it to get the approval, in  other words, I do half their job for them, and STILL they don't follow through. 

I also always open my own appeal with Express Scripts when they fail to do so, and provide them with the the appeal number. I do literally everything I can to get it going, and they just don't do the job.

I cannot stress just how asinine the communication system with my doctors is now, and I mention this because it is just one more nail in the coffin of our medical system. Where I live, being able to just *call and  directly talk* to the office is a thing of the past, instead, as I detailed above, I have to languish, for days, or weeks, or months, for a response, and this is after logging onto an online portal that has spotty accessibility at best, and wherein I must send a character-number-restricted message that takes them days to respond to (if they ever do). 

And, on that note, thanks Cedar Sinai, you massive asshole of an ever-expanding monster of a medical business entity, for swallowing up all the local private practice physicians and installing a system where patients simply *cannot* call their doctor's office directly. You're a peach. 

Anyhow, sorry for the rant. You seem like a nice person. Happy New Year and all that.",1672531271

I do disagree with many people‚Äôs take on the barn scene, though. It‚Äôs heavy handed for sure, but it‚Äôs meant to be a playful scene (as evidenced by the music), underscoring the already existent tension between the characters. In my opinion, it‚Äôs trying to show in 30 seconds what is a more complicated dynamic in the book (which even then isn‚Äôt all that well developed if I recall‚Äîbut it‚Äôs been a while since I read it).

I have a habit of dealing only either direct or from very reputable resellers and have never had a problem that didn't get fixed, regardless of country of origin.

"arknights","t5_3ptom","Reports from the sis's account.

So, yesterday, she asked me if she should pull on the Ebenholz banner. Part of her reason was that she wanted to get one more crack at a 6-Star before her 6-Star Selector expires (she could get off-bannered by someone she wants). I approached it from usefulness (hard-hitting but extremely conditional, making him unwieldy and awkward to use) and lore (she's trying to read events and chapters in release order, so she has not read LE yet, but I told her she'd probably enjoy it very much when she gets here and that it would absolutely activate her BL neurons). I also asked her if she was interested in Hibiscus Alter, which she was.

Since she's pretty well set up in terms of Arts damage already and she can't quite judge the event story yet, the only thing she could go on was appearance. I suggested to her, pull if you like his aesthetic, and even then only until your first 6-Star.

She started with her singles. Got Tsukinogi as her guarantee (so basically an extension of her Joint Op pulls, since she did not get her back then) after 10 pulls. After that, it was onto the 10-pulls. She also got Pot 5 on La Pluma, and she got Hibiscus the Purifier after 40 pulls. At pull #52, she got Ebenholz. Her luck with feature operators continues to astound me, and I'm happy her pulls went better than mine did. Sadly, she did not get a Blue Poison, who she is still missing (but she still has her 5-Star Voucher, so we'll see how that goes).

She also got Aciddrop and Chestnut to Pot 6 for her 4-Stars.

In any case, onto the Selector now. For a long time, I've known which 6-Stars my sis was interested in. She's always liked Hoshiguma (I advised her to wait for a shop appearance and use the Selector for someone more impactful) and Ifrit, and she has been interested in Passenger since before the game started primarily because I would constantly tell her about updates on the journey of Godsenger. She would also like to round out the Lee's Detective Agency Ops, of whom she is only missing the 6-Stars. She already has just about every meta-relevant operator on the Selector, as well as operators that she just likes (Surtr and Kal from their Joint Ops; Baggie, Thorns and Ange from shop, Mudrock from pulling for Horn, both of whom she got within 10 pulls of each other; SA, Mostima and Saria from recruitment; Exu from starter banner; Phantom as an off-banner on one of the limited banners; Mountain off of the Near Light Selector pack, which I got her as a birthday present), so I was sure she'd go for Aak, Ifrit or Passenger.

Imagine my surprise when she picks Eyja. Apparently, she's always liked Eyja's design, and she's enjoyed playing around with her in the Support slot. Surtr, Goldenglow, Amiya, Angelina, Ling, Kal'tsit, and now Ebenholz and Eyja. Man, I remember when she had next to no Arts or True damage options, and now she has nearly all of them.

And she will have at least 120 pulls going into Ideal City. I don't think she's ever gone above 70 pulls before getting the feature Limited op. And Irene broke her curse of failing to get the not-Limited rate-up op on those banners, so I'm hoping her luck continues to thrive. ~~I wish she'd raise more of her lower rarity ops though and work on more masteries in general. Heck, at least give Bagpipe or Perfumer their module so you can access SSS, whether you do it or have me do it for you~~",1672531275

I read on their website some time ago that they just treat all blood from AFAB donors as though it might have those antigens - simply because it's very possible to have been pregnant in the past and never have known it (ie: a chemical pregnancy that might have just seemed like a late period at the most).

I guess they just process blood from AFAB donors more and break it down so that it's safe to use for different types of transfusions.",1672531275

There was a window coming into this year where if he really showed out he could have made that front office really stop and take notice - think  Jalen Hurts - but I think he missed his opp.  He's been up and down this year, at best plateaued from last year but most likely a little worse.  If Houston went 6-10 and he played really well, there'd be a chance he could keep the job, or at least make it more complicated.  Getting the top pick though sort of seals it, IMO.

Still, he's shown enough that something is there.  As others have said, think Minshew type - a high end backup.  He will most likely have another opp at some point.  And who knows - even if they draft a QB at #1, it's possible he still starts next season and maybe if he takes another step up in that time he can at least parlay that into a trade or starting gig somewhere down the line.",1672531275

Is there a way? Sure, though probably not on google earth data.

The easiest(hah) way would be to use machine learning, probably some kind of GAN paired with DTMs.

The actual easiest way is to just use more common methods that aren't based on realism. Poisson distribution, delauney triangulation, etc. With tweaking, the results will be quite similar",1672531275

Basically, the idea is that humanoid beings express words and meanings in an enormous but finite number of ways, and the Universal Translator holds a databank with all those ways, so whenever encountering a new species the UT is able to work out a translation matrix either instantly or very quickly. The Skrreeans' language is based on a highly unusual syntax which is why the UT takes longer to figure it out, but still has it licked within a few hours.

There's also various fanon ideas about ships' exchanging universal translator protocols during contact and them figuring out how to translate one another electronically before their captains even start talking to one another.

In Enterprise, Discovery and TOS it appears that the UT is electronic and built into communicators, but in DS9's *Little Green Men* it appears - at least for the Ferengi - to be implanted directly into the auditory canal and may interface with the brain, at least potentially explaining the lip-synching.

Prodigy I think also established that the UT is in continuous operation on Federation outposts and starships, to the point that Federation citizens don't even bother learning one another's languages, so when the UT fails the Andorian crewmembers can't communicate with the human ones and so on.",1672531276

In physics, it has been confirmed that some things are mathematically deterministic and some things are not.  There are random effects in Quantum Mechanics confirmed to be truly random, for example.  There are some cosmologists who theorize everything was determined at the big bang and we are just watching it play out, even though there is no way to test this.  IMHO, Determinism is similar to other untestable theories like String Theory.  Academics have very limited paths for advancement and ways of increasing their incomes, so it is very profitable to create interesting theories that cannot be tested, then makes lots of money writing books and giving lectures on them.  Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking both critics, for example.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb",""" I went to see them in the hospital today."" I remarked to my co-worker over the cube wall.

""How are they?  Any change from the new treatments?""  I heard him get up to walk around to my cube.  Once there, they bent down and patted me on the shoulder.  They knew.

""No, it may be weeks or even days now.  It doesn't matter.  I shouldn't have even been there.  It's *family only* time according to the nurses.  I told them I was like family, their *work* family. "" But that wasn't the whole truth.  I loved this person with my entire heart.  I had spent time with their family.  Their spouse was an amazing human.  So it wasn't even like they were some monster for me to hate.    The nurses saw it in my eyes.  Their spouse seemed oblivious, or perhaps, they just *understood* and pitied me.  

""Hey, I got this thing I want you to read, and have an open mind about.""  my coworker handed me a business card, fine vellum, out of his wallet.  It smelled vaguely of sweat and fire.  As he handed me the card, there was a moment of electricity as it touched my hand.

""Woah, what is this?""  I cautiously asked.

""It is, different things to different people.  For me, it, Well, this guy got me out of a jam once.  He told me not to pay him back, but to pay it forward, which felt stupid at the time.  But here I am, I think paying it forward.""  He studied my face for some form of acceptance of the help, or understanding of the power I held.

***Old Scratch Consulting, no problem to big, no soul too small.***  underneath, there was a phone number, toll free.  *Operators are standing by.*

*""*This?""

""He is a problem solver.   Just call.  it's worth the conversation.""

I sat on the card for a couple of days.  I got the call from the spouse that they were asking for me.  When I finished crying, I pulled the card out and dialed the number.

""Hello, Old Scratch Consulting, with whom am I speaking?""  the voice sounded slightly computerized, or digitized maybe.

""Hi, I'm...  Baily.  I need.  Well, I need a miracle.""

""Ah, yes, Baily, you have a friend who is ill, is that correct?""

""Yes, how did you know?""

""It's our business to know.  That's okay.  We know time is of the essence, we will have one of our consultants see you shortly.""  &lt;click&gt;  the line went dead.

&lt;Knock Knock&gt; the door vibrated from the hits.  I jumped up and walked over seeing a massive chest in a suit and tie taking up most of my visible range.

I opened the door to see a large man with extremely red hued skin standing in a charcoal colored suit that was perfectly tailored for his frame.  He had to weigh 400 pounds if he weighed an ounce.  ""Ahem, will we be conducting business here, or inside, Baily?""

""Come in, Um, I invite you in."" I added.  He ducked his head down and sat on my love seat, removing a folder from his briefcase.  He put on a pair of half moon reading glasses and opened the folder reading the papers in front of him.  ""Ah, hmmmm, I see, "" came out of his mouth.  Then finally, ""We can fix this for you.""

""I haven't even asked?"" I stammered.

""It's all here, in your file.""  He handed me the file, and it had everything.  When I met Pat.  When my feelings started, my attending their wedding, my discovery of their cancer, all of it.  It then had a proposed solution at the bottom of the 3rd page of the document.

""It says here that you can cure Pat.  But I have to give up my true love to do so.  What kind of fairy tale bullshit is this?""

""Have you been meeting with the Fae?""  His face showed concern and a little fear.

""No, but you are saying that I have to give up true love to save this person, who I believe IS my true love, they are just married to the....  Well, they aren't the wrong person, not really, but they aren't ME.""  tears snuck from the corners of my eyes.  ""How about I give my soul and we just make it even.""

""Oh, that's not how this works.  I swear sometimes, fantasy books make this job so much harder.  We want something from you to fix this person, but it isn't your soul.  We need your anguish, your heartache to do this.  So, you get to know Pat is cured, and then you don't get true love.  This frees you up to have as many meaningless flings and affairs you wish all without commitments or complications like children or worrying about someone growing old with you.  It really is for the best for you.""

""And they can be cured.""

""Of course, not by those doctors, but, you know we can.  However, you can't tell anyone of your particular sacrifice.  If you do, Pat dies instantly.""

That last part.  How, I thought to myself.

""The same magic we use to cure, will disappear the moment it is revealed.  And, the cancer will be back, but at a growth that would have taken all that time.  It could be quite messy for poor Pat.""  

Somehow, in front of me was a pen, and a contract detailing the terms.  

""You aren't going to let her die while I am thinking about this are you?""

""Don't take too long.""

I signed the document and handed it back over to the demon in front of me.

Let me clarify.

This happens all the time.  The school recognizes that a service is needed, but in order to get paid for services rendered they require specific codes to bill under. Its fraud if all my notes indicate Im treating autism and no formal diagnosis of autism is made. 

Autism is a heavy diagnosis that requires a battery of tests to identify and formally diagnose. It cannot, for instance, be casually made with an intake assessment at a community mental health clinic. It requires specialized testing be clinicians with particular credentials (child psychiatrist or psychologist, pediatric neurologist, or developmental pediatrician). The school likely does not have these clinicians on staff (few if any do - maybe a child psychologist, but most have social workers), and seems to be requesting collateral documentation to move treatment forward. So again, its a pretty common request.",1672531276

You have already wasted X years with this person, don‚Äôt waste 5 more and then have to go through the legal and emotional turmoil of a divorce. It is definitely easier (the pool is still bigger) to be dating at 32 than to be divorced and dating at 38. My friends who are dating at 38 are having a much harder time - there are fewer single people their age and many of the ones that are single have ex spouses and kids and it‚Äôs very complicated. 

Also, it‚Äôs hard to see anything in your post that suggests you even love her or like spending time with her. I can‚Äôt imagine being married to someone I didn‚Äôt even really like. Please think through this carefully before getting married.",1672531276

Far from the only scenario where you need to avoid an accident.

Pedestrian steps out into roadway unexpectely. Car slides from other lane over to yours (spinout or otherwise)

Car unexpectly pulls out of driveway/slides past intersection

etc. 

""I maintain following distances that are safe""

Is great! It also has very little to do with the advantages that substantially more grip give you.

&gt; ‚ÄúI have snow tires. I will ALWAYS be able to stop in time no matter what‚Äù. 

Never said that one, but don't worry, I am substantially less likely to get into a car accident than you.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","It's not really a retcon, because we don't know much about what happened by the end of the original trilogy. We know Obi-Wan was Anakin's mentor, which is preserved, but the question of how it all happened is left unanswered. The prequel trilogy is about telling that story.

And it's entirely up to us what we think about the prophecy and balance, but I found the whole matter to be a clear sign that Anakin is *not* the Chosen One, and it's likely no one will ever bring ""balance"" to the force, whatever that means. Premonitions can be wrong or misinterpreted, something Yoda clearly states, and the Jedi can be wrong. As a plot device, though, it explains how the Jedi could remain so blind as they desperately cling onto a prophecy that might be wrong or misinterpreted.

On the flip side, we can assume that the Jedi were partially right, but they failed to see Anakin's turn to the Dark Side. He was the Chosen One, and he did destroy the Sith. In this case, the inconsistencies begin in the sequel trilogy bringing the Sith back, because the prequel and original trilogies at least tell a complete story of how the Sith were defeated, just not in the way that the Jedi imagined.

Of course, I'm ignoring everything outside of the first two trilogies. If some story tries to expand on the lore of those two but ends up breaking something, it's on that story, not either of those two.",1672531278

"ChronicIllness","t5_2vh1a","Thank you! It helps a lot to know someone else gets it and shares my feelings!

Im definitely a smile in pain kind of person but it's not a normal smile. It's like a teeth clinching grimace smile. I can't imagine just laughing at a joint dislocation unless it was like, clearly this is a laugh so you don't cry or scream laugh and I'm sweating from the pain I'm holding in. I will say dislocations are probably less painful in EDS than in the general pop, but have you ever whacked two bones against each other? Doesn't feel great.

What I never can understand are what people like your friends or others are experiencing that makes them think they're having dislocations. You know? Like I know they believe this and are having some sort of symptoms. But I'm really doubting the vast majority it's actual dislocations. Like what is it getting mistaken a dislocation?

I definitely hear you on the seeking medical can despite my fears. Maybe I should just bring it up as my joint has been hurting, swollen, and bruised, and looked strange rather than self diagnosing it as a dislocation. If my joint is still this painful in the morning I think I'll actually go to urgent care to get it looked at and make sure it's getting reset and immobilized right so it can heal.

I am really enjoying what I‚Äôm doing. Salary is very good (ofc lesser compared to US banks in a front office position) with a very good work life balance and people are usually extremely smart. 
The job in a rating agency is different because you must learn and obey to criterias. These are agencies‚Äô documentation on how they do their rating on a specific topic (has not a legal value, but it‚Äôs the framework of the work). 
I don‚Äôt know much about corporates, but I guess it‚Äôs really about valuation, corporate finance etc and you are to talk with top exec managers from the corporate and they respect you a lot for your position
I actually found the job way more interesting and learning way much more than in a similar position at a bank where first years are only doing PowerPoints and repetitive tasks

I even took several breaks at a gathering I was hosting! It helped to sit in low lighting while listening to a song/music or taking in silence for just a short time. I don‚Äôt know if this is helpful or not, but it‚Äôs a tool I always have in the back of my mind that I wanted to share. I‚Äôm so sorry that you are feeling this way, but I‚Äôm glad that everyone will be gone tomorrow so that you can recharge. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done, but don‚Äôt be afraid to take a walk outside or take a break in another room if you need one. It‚Äôs absolutely okay to do so. üòä Sending good vibes your way and hoping that you can recharge soon! ‚ù§Ô∏è",1672531282

"ffxi","t5_2qn97","&gt; Will the population drop? Absolutely. That's every online game.

Yes, the population *will* drop because the majority of people will get tired of playing a game in the state that it existed in 15-20 years ago after realizing how much tedious bullshit there is.

&gt;You are objectively wrong.

Objectivity has no spot in the equation, *especially* when you quite literally agree with me that the population WILL drop - and when the population DOES drop, what does that mean for an online game that is almost exclusively population-driven? It'll be dead in the water; a ghost town, if you will.

&gt;But the amount of idiots here that try to dismiss liking this era as nothing more that hype and nostalgia

It IS hype and nostalgia, unfortunately. The (not-so) crazy thing about nostalgia is that it's both potent, and blinding; it's a powerful driving force, and it's VERY blinding because people who get so excited for something like this almost *always* forget the bad things, and only remember the good.

People who want to play ""FFXI Classic"" pretty much always forget the tedium of travel, how you could spend *hours* or even *days* with your party flag up and not get an invite for a host of reasons, effectively stonewalling you from leveling a job you want to level; they forget how one party member disconnecting or needing to leave can cause a party to collapse. They forget the hours they spent running from place to place, only to die and not get a raise, thus making them spend even *more* time traveling.

They forget and dismiss the tedium, the bullshit, and all the crap that EVERY player experienced back in the day. That's quite literally what nostalgia does; the good memories are imprinted upon you, and you have a tendency to block out or just forget the rest.

Sure, there are people who aren't totally clouded by nostalgia and are fully accepting of the good and the bad, but the **fact** of the matter is that most people *are.* That's just how the fucking emotion works.

I know this full-well because *I* was originally hyped to play my favorite game ever in the state that it was in when I first hopped on the train in 2006. After a day or two, the endless running, the agonizingly slow leveling process, not having enough gil to buy *anything* besides a handful of things, even being denied party invites because I didn't have a weapon I quite literally had no way to afford - that, and more, made me remember how much I *don't* actually want to play. It's why my WHM still sits at level 16, and I haven't bothered leveling a bit more to even unlock my subjob.

People such as myself will be the norm, regardless of what your emotions tell you.

The population will drop off sharply, and sure, the server will remain alive and somewhat playable, but it won't have anything *near* the player count it does right now; that's what hype and nostalgia will do it over time.

Now, run along. You're annoying.",1672531283

"disneylandparis","t5_320wm","Hi!

First off, you got to explain what DAS is, in Europe we don't really have special discounts for like service members, not even our own.

We don't have a rope drop like in the US parks. Our big thing are the early magic hours which you get with a stay in one of the hotels of Disneyland Paris. But no special ceremony or anything. I would say arrive before 9 and you should be good. If it's a national holiday or weekend it will be busy though. My own rythem is: start with early magic hours, go for a brunch in Disney Village and go for a break in my hotel room and come back around 1 when the crowds have dispersed into the lines of the attractions.

One of the things you definitely have to do is our versions if Haunted Mansion and Big Thunder Mountain. They have recently refurbished and look amazing. They share a backstory even. 

There is nothing here of anything DVC. It's even a very foreign concept to us Disneyland Paris people. There's one lounge that I know of but that's for old stake holders and is very exclusive.

I would think public transport runs till late to Paris, but Paris is very large, so if you are closeby you'll definitely get back, but if you're staying at a suburb it might be more difficult. I would check out some hotels in Marne la Valle. I mostly stay at the Ibis budget near DLP for a night to go to Seqouia Lodge the next day and straight to the parks.

If you need any advice, I know a lot!",1672531283

The video card is a 4080.

I take it M.2_2 is the lower M2 port?  It was unclear via the manual which I should use. 
Would the M.2_2 port provide better performance than the M.2_1 while keeping the video card's PCIe at full throughput?

Unfortunately this is in a super tight ITX build (coolermaster nh200p max) where I had to physically cut the case to get the GPU in.  So it'll be a little bit of a project to get in there to swap the M2 port but probably worth doing to maximize performance from the drive.

Abu Dharr reported: The Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, said, ‚ÄúAllah Almighty says: Whoever comes with a good deed will have the reward of ten like it and even more. Whoever comes with an evil deed will be recompensed for one evil deed like it or he will be forgiven. Whoever draws close to Me by the length of a hand, I will draw close to him by the length of an arm. Whoever draws close to Me the by length of an arm, I will draw close to him by the length of a fathom. Whoever comes to Me walking, I will come to him running. Whoever meets Me with enough sins to fill the earth, not associating any partners with Me, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.‚Äù Source: SÃ£ahÃ£iÃÑhÃ£ Muslim 2687

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I feel this. 

I was misdiagnosed as NOT having ADHD when I got tested my Junior year of high school because I was struggling so hard and couldn‚Äôt take the normal class load and wasn‚Äôt going to graduate on time. The ‚Äúspecialist‚Äù concluded I didn‚Äôt have ADHD because I was able to focus on that computer test where it shows letters and you have to hit the space bar when you see the letter X on the screen. First of all, he was watching me the entire time, AND I knew there was a limited amount of time for this testing to be done. If he had walked out of the room and said we have all day, watch what happens when I have no externally imposed structure. 

I was finally properly diagnosed around age 30, and just knowing why I‚Äôve struggled so hard all my life was a huge relief, that it wasn‚Äôt all my fault. My parents felt so bad, but they just didn‚Äôt know what they didn‚Äôt know. 

Just be glad we‚Äôre finding out now! I see some folks saying they‚Äôre only finding out in their 50‚Äôs, or later, and there are some who will go to the grave never having known and carried that burden forever. It‚Äôs still a burden knowing, but every once in a while I remember to cut myself some slack. 

Lastly, I think we need to get over mourning the loss of the life we had dreamed that never was. I‚Äôve been doing that for the latter half of my 30‚Äôs, and the last 5 years of my life have been the least vibrant and enjoyable as a result. 

I‚Äôm going to work hard to get to a place of deep acceptance of where I‚Äôm at and move forward from here, to create the best version of my life I can. Who knows what‚Äôs possible if we don‚Äôt move in the direction of finding out? One thing I know is, if I keep living the next decade like I have the last, I‚Äôm not going to be in a good place at all. Time to cut my losses, and free myself from the burden of guilt and shame. And hopefully, a year from now, these won‚Äôt be just words on a Reddit comment, but a life well-lived. I hope the same for you! Hang in there! It‚Äôs not our fault! But it is our responsibility.",1672531283

"KidsAreFuckingStupid","t5_3948y","Several options depending on what I want to teach my kid right now.

1. Leave kid fake stuck and let her figure it out herself. Teaches problem solving, independence, not to do stupid shit while a parent is busy....

2. Fix it once and tell the kid what is going to happen if you they do it again (""you'll get stuck and be sad"" - then let that happen and explain, ""see, you got stuck and were sad like I said"" which will teach them that you make rules for a reason and your warning about consequences is true. ""No no. If you put your hand in there again I'm going to have to take it away."" Then do it. Teaches consequences and that you will follow through in them.)

3. Keep letting them stick their hand in and ""reacuing"" them because it's a game of cause and effect for them. This teaches them basics of social skills and how to interact with others, how their behavior will cause specific responses from people, how they should respond to other people in distress, etc.

4. Remind yourself this is temporary and even though you're dying of boredom your kid is learning real important stuff right now and just let it go.",1672531284

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","I‚Äôm late forties and re-training back into IT after a period in management and some efforts towards moving into trades (like you, I‚Äôm an avid handy person who has reno‚Äôd half my house). 

Trades are really not geared to mature re-training entrants - certainly in QLD, most trade certificates have a pre-requisite of a carpentry or bricklaying qual, it‚Äôs a closed shop for established post-apprentice trades, pretty much by design, even the managerial quals typically require a prior trade. They really don‚Äôt want people from alternative pathways. And as I found while working a physical job during some money troubles during Covid, it is not easy as an older person to sustain physical labour day in and day out, even if you can do very strenuous things at your own pace. I had just rebuilt my back yard and had serious physical fitness at the time, but I still struggled, because at the end of the day, when it‚Äôs your own project, you choose when you work and when you stop, and you don‚Äôt do that as hired labour. (I mean, you can a bit as a contractor, but you can‚Äôt do too much of that and keep getting work). Trades are also notoriously vulnerable to weather and economic pressures.

 I would say if you are dead set on a trade, do something not weather dependent and somewhat less physically intensive - built-in wardrobe installation, auto electrics, that sort of thing, where you work indoors and there is a limit to the size and weight of the parts. Ideally, find a niche within the handyman scope that avoids the need for a qual - wardrobes, pet enclosures, converting gazebos and verandahs to screened in rooms, custom built in bookcases, caravan fit-outs, that sort of stuff. You‚Äôre probably better spending your time and money building something like that than subsidising your life as an apprentice, if you can even find one willing to pay mature adult rates.",1672531284

First, the grandparents are Alec and KIM, this connects Alec even more to Kim, every event surrounding this baby, will necessarily include Kim. It‚Äôs one thing to navigate step parenting children, adult children are fairly easy, if any of it is ever not awkward or uncomfortable, but grandchildren?? While Alec is publicly reliving his glory days in morose monologues, fond memories of days before Hillary, and tromping through Syracuse woods loudly imagining the road not taken.  Hillary is seeing the future.  Her terrible parenting will now be made very obvious bc Kim‚Äôs parenting will be front and center, Ireland‚Äôs parenting will be seen and Hillary‚Äôs children are going to look feral and neglected in comparison. And Kim‚Äôs grandparenting is going to be seen.  Do you think Hillary can resist the spotlight that will now be on Ireland and her Bebe?  She hasn‚Äôt yet shown the grace to even like the announcement or comment on the post.  Having watched how she handles crisis, I think she is spinning a narrative and an approach to this new twist in her life.  Her advisors are all either nonexistent or she just ignores them.

If she doesn‚Äôt, she going to be scrolling through IG pics of the adoring grandparents with their first grandchild and she and her brood will be the dirty little socially unacceptable secret in the background.",1672531285

Don't be a dick with your rating. Users who give consistently low ratings will be banned. Nobody has time for incel or trollish bullshit.

If you don't like pussies, that's fine, just go somewhere else. Maybe try /r/ratemydick or /r/nofap or whatever.

We're all here to have fun, so don't ruin someone else's by being a dick.

Per my previous comment see section ‚Äúword of advice‚Äù for the advice. However, I will expand upon it. The optical flow sensor on the bottom doesn‚Äôt read water very well and causes it to do weird things, dust induced a similar problem. I‚Äôm a UAS instructor and a taught a group of people to fly this specific drone, many had issues keeping positive control and it wasn‚Äôt for a lack of flying skill. It struggled with altitude and position hold often, and a breeze of 5mph was to much for it. Also the Wi-Fi/Bluetooth video connection is not encrypted which means anyone can tap into and see what the drone sees. This was a problem when I was teaching that group how to fly. For the lack of position and altitude hold I‚Äôve formulated an experience based opinion that it‚Äôs cruddy. But still good enough if you‚Äôre learning to fly.

#December Mod Report

* We have 3 new mods: 

 * /u/GallowDude, /u/Xyyzx, /u/AmusedDragon

* We have a new flair system. 

 * [Get your flair here!](https://flair.r-anime.moe/set)

 * [Actual announcement post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zulfds/santa_snoo_has_a_gift_for_you_new_flairs/)

 * [Previous meta-comment here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zbuuan/meta_thread_month_of_december_04_2022/j1jvng5/)

* We hit 6 million subs and released a [quiz](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/znt0js/ranime_6_million_subscriber_quiz/)

* We signed up for this [Reddit feedback mechanic](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/zmq1nn/testing_a_community_member_mod_feedback_mechanism/). So some members of the community may be getting forms sent to them asking them about their experience with the subreddit. There might even be some custom questions from us.

* We made some slight changes to our moderator activity requirements. You can find it on our [mod page](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/wiki/mods).
 
**Ongoing Discussions**

* We talked about unloved wiki pages and what we want to do with them
* How we want to create more flairs and get the community involved
* The idea brought up in previous [meta threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/zbuuan/meta_thread_month_of_december_04_2022/iz5jzpl/) to delay episode discussions was talked about but there are some technical problems and some other concerns. It's probably possible but we aren't very interested in tackling it right now.

A factory also manages a stockpile of resources it needs. When it runs low, it sends a ‚Äòcall‚Äô and opens an input. When it receives that resource, that input closes. So say two factories both call for andesite alloy. The alloy farm hears two calls, and sends out two stocks of alloy. If the redstone is right, It doesn‚Äôt matter what factory calls first or what order they are in on the line, the deliveries pass by both. 

A factory product is ether called manually by the player, or maintained as a stockpile to be delivered on the main line.

So it shouldn‚Äôt matter to you what you need to connect unless you have yet to build a farm for it.",1672531286

For example not jaywaking is a pure lawful action.

Doesn't mean every time you cross the street at the designated crossing point, your alignment moves to neutral. It makes no sense. A lawful, good, neutral or evil would all do the same, so it shouldn't impact their good vs evil alignment. This action has nothing to do with good or evil, just obeying the law, why should it affect the good vs evil axis?

On the other hand, there CAN be actions that move on both axis. Like saving someone wrongfully imprisoned by the authorities. This is both good (saving someone) and chaotic (breaking the law).

This action moves on both axis, but not all actions have to be this way.

The Kinross incident is an interesting case, where a USAF pilot and his plane disappeared in 1953 after spotting unidentified objects. This happened somewhere south of Lake Superior.

Speaking of lakes, we have 5 of them.   There's a few sea serpent type cases, and even some unidentified submarine objects.

We've got some cool stories.  There's been a number of UFO flaps, a famous one in Detroit area in 1966, and another one in Muskegon in 1993-94 that was on a Netflix episode of Unsolved Mysteries recently.  Lots of ghost stories and hauntings, including the Dice Road haunting mentioned recently in state news. There's been a decent amount of Bigfoot and Dogman sightings. I've been to a number of conferences,  for Bigfoot, UFOs (including MUFON), ghosts, paranormal stuff in general.

It's a neat state, for sure. Though I do try to travel a bit, and check out other weirdness.  Went to Roswell in '06 but mostly just saw the museum and stores.   I didn‚Äôt want to mess around in the desert or at Area 51.  Point Pleasant,  WV is neat, not just because of Mothman or the Flatwoods case nearby.

"feminineboys","t5_2vmuo","Howdy, 
So it‚Äôs totally going to depend. I recommend trying it with the lowest cost option and seeing how it works in your hair.

Though, since writing the last post, I‚Äôve cut out all pomades and hair clays in favor of just not using shampoo. 

So current routine:
I rinse my hair thoroughly in the shower with medium to cold water
then I let it dry combed back, (being sure to allow all water to dry)
Next apply corn starch, working it through the hair until it disappears. Add a little and work up. 

End result should be a soft fluffy head of hair. 

My hair has never been healthier, though I lost a little volume switching to no pomades, Clays, shampoo, or heat, but I‚Äôve cut out most of my hair care cost and it‚Äôs so effortless.

(Small warning) if you‚Äôve never gone off shampoo before, your scalp is gonna over produce oil for a few weeks. That‚Äôs normal, just keep regularly rising with warm to cool water, drying, and powdering as normal.

And that‚Äôs all I think
Good luck on your hair care!",1672531288

"Gnostic","t5_2r6g8","Abraxas is representative of a lower aspect of the Highest God, the Ineffable or Pleromatic Fullness. Abraxas is often depicted as an angel or guardian in Gnostic literature.

I never mentioned Sophia however, but Abraxas is often depicted as a member of her aeon.

Our very Republican governor bucked the Trump administration early on, followed what science we knew at that time, and worked in tandem with our state health director to keep us safe. His daily TV appearances were honest yet somehow reassuring. (I disagree with nearly every policy this man has or has tried to implement, but he just comes across as kind and fatherly. And I know he did his best at first. I'll never vote for him, but I'm one to give credit where due.)

I will wear a mask in public forever if I need to. And continue to get the shots and any other scientific medical advancements to fight this plague.

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

"mexico","t5_2qhv7","A la hora de comprar autos y motos, creo que hay que pensar a la defensiva. Es decir, de entrada cuestionar al vendedor porqu√© lo vende ? Cu√°nto tiempo lo tuvo ? Que problemas le di√≥ ? Piensa que el otro es un posible estafador. Busca en los detalles. 

Sin querer sonar como machista, pero si vas acompa√±ada de un hombre puede que la piensen un poco m√°s antes de estafarte. 

Cuando un coche te interese pide al due√±o copia de la factura y tarjeta de circulaci√≥n, para que puedas verificarlo en REPUVE. Ah√≠ aparece si alguna vez fue robado y luego recuperado. Si fue recuperado por robo, siempre vas a tener que estar cargando tus papeles del juez donde exhonera al auto del reporte de robo, de otra forma los polic√≠as te intentar√°n extorsionar cuando te detengan y en sus sistemas desactualizados siga apareciendo un reporte vigente. El nombre de la tarjeta de circulaci√≥n debe corresponder con quien te est√° vendiendo. O al menos la factura debe estar endosada a su favor. 

Huye de los coches con factura de aseguradora. En el mejor caso son autos recuperados de robo, en el peor son chocados o siniestrados y los reparan nomas donde ve la suegra para revenderlos. Aunque ye aseguren que est√°n al cien. No compres problemas. 

Tambi√©n dile al vendedor que vaya contigo al C4 (en CDMX hay dos, b√∫scalos en Google para hacer cita) para que los peritos examinen el veh√≠culo (y busquen n√∫meros de serie remarcados en chasis, motor, caja de cambios etc) si est√° limpio de cualquier asunto jur√≠dico en vigente o cerrado. Si se niega, ah√≠ ves jejeje. 

De igual forma, pregunta alg√∫n mec√°nico cu√°nto te cobra por revisar un coche que quieres comprar. Dile que necesitas inspecci√≥n de motor, caja, suspensi√≥n, debe meter su scanner para inspeccionar la computadora. 

La vida √∫til de un auto est√° pensada en 8 a√±os sin fallas mayores. Despu√©s de esa edad, los autos se deprecian m√°s r√°pido por obvias razones. 

Pide verlo durante el d√≠a, a pleno sol. Busca los detalles: ambos faros deben ser del mismo tono, misma edad aparente, mismas condiciones, al igual calaveras, espejos y todo elemento de colisi√≥n. De otra forma, el coche ya ha sido chocado y tiene una refacci√≥n de baja calidad (se decolora r√°pido, se cuartea con el sol y lluvia). Todas las puertas, salpicaderos y fascias deben ser del mismo tono exacto. De lo contrario probablemente fue chocado y reparado en un taller marca patito. Al igual las llantas. Si todas son id√©nticas y tiene desgaste id√©ntico, adelante. Si est√°n desgastadas m√°s del interior que del exterior o viceversa, problema de suspensi√≥n, amortiguadores. Si tiene todas llantas de diferente marca, el vendedor no es cuidadoso, o maneja con el Qlo y ha reventado llantas en baches. Problema de suspensi√≥n a la vista ! 

Finalmente un auto es como un beb√©, requiere muchas atenciones, no solo es echar gasolina y listo‚Ä¶, contempla gastos en derechos, tenencias, verificaciones, preferiblemente tener d√≥nde guardarlo, cada que sales buscarle estacionamiento, debes revisarle muy seguido la presi√≥n de llantas, nivel de fluidos, etc‚Ä¶las vestiduras se manchan hay que lavar o pagar, se ensucia todos los d√≠as aunque no se use.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I‚Äôd always liked being the first gym leader. I, too, was a novice trainer years back, and vividly remember the day I obtained my first gym badge. I remember the nervousness that gripped me like a Kingler who‚Äôs territory I had just intruded into before entering the gym. The rush of adrenaline that overcame me as Roark and 10 year old me were locked in a fierce back and forth, and the elation as I got to call that first badge my own. And of course I remember Fauna and Styro, my trusty partners at the time, without whom none of that could have been possible. I fell in love with the pokemon trainer life at first sight, and spent much time from thereon out training with my partners. I made many new pokemon friends along the way, and with them by my side I eventually managed to best the most fierce trainer of them all; Cynthia. I‚Äôm no poet, but even if I was I couldn‚Äôt adequatly put into words how I felt as her garchomp fell at the hands of Concorde‚Äôs dragon claw, my own partner garchomp. I felt like I was on top of the world.

Well, all that‚Äôs a bit far in the past now. I grew older and dedicated my life to meeting more friends across the world. Maybe that explorative spirit of 10 year old me is what made me pick up the position as first gym leader in the small alpine Crystallia Town in the south of the Peralia region. I guess I had seen most all of what Sinnoh had to offer and wanted to see what was in the wider world out there. Let me tell you, if a younger me figured out that even Cynthia was holding back in her final battle against me due to the gym leader‚Äôs code I would have been crushed, but‚Ä¶I always had a bit hunch. After all, there‚Äôs no way the first gym leaders of any region never progress further than that first gym level. 

I‚Äôve now filled that first gym position for almost 30 years with Christmas the Snover and Locke the Sneasel as my partners, and have become a little bit of the ‚Äúgentle village grandpa‚Äù to the kids around here. They remind me of me when I was a young kid, good memories. Unfortunately, not all can be good memories. Nowadays the young ones just don‚Äôt have the same kind of respect for us gym leaders as we used to back then. We all feel like the greatest in the moment of victory, but more and more kinds come in from out of town to just quickly stop by, walk through my gym, get the badge, and leave as quickly as they came. I‚Äôve always offered all trainers a hot chocolate after they made it through the cold stairs up the hut that is my gym. In days of old they‚Äôd accept with a smile, often a ‚Äúthank you‚Äù as well. Nowadays they just want to get to beating to me without any of the human connection, and it‚Äôs definitely made being a first gym leader less fun. As I mentioned before, gym leader code restricts us to fighting at a specific level of skill and strength, and me being a first gym leader neither of those levels is particularly high. Christmas and Locke are good chaps, and at this point I‚Äôm starting to feel bad for them having to get beat up by what I can only describe as pre-pubescent jerks. 

‚ÄúYou should stop going easy on them‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt notice Annabelle entering my gym. She‚Äôs the oldest daughter of the helmir household, an absolute sweetheart who sometimes brings me jam apples when the winter is particularly cold. 

‚ÄúYou know I can‚Äôt.‚Äù I replied halfhearedly.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon grandpa, show them that noone should mess with the glacier guardian!‚Äù. I must be getting old, as I didn‚Äôt notice her little brother Matthew coming in either. Glacier guardian‚Ä¶that‚Äôs something I haven‚Äôt been called in a while. A honorary title the village kids gave me some 20 years ago after I made it clear to some no-good thugs why they maybe shouldn‚Äôt mess with our villge.

I'll disagree with the limited non-corruption paths for GGGB.  You can dump Eric when he goes on his Africa trip and get yourself single again.  You can even turn the gymbro player Jack into a committed relationship with marriage at the end.  Or you can have Ashley explore her feelings for her best friend Eva and go down that route.  You can even model down that route, so long as you don't actually turn to porn.  Now, the relative worth of those routes is definitely something that's up to personal preference, however.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Ok let‚Äôs talk dollars and cents. You‚Äôre currently making $20/hour. Is that a full time gig?

If so that‚Äôs $40k/year before taxes so about $30k per year take home pay. That means you have about $2500/month to work with. I don‚Äôt know what your rent is, but let‚Äôs say rent plus cell phone and all utilities is $1000/month. That leaves you $1500 per month for gas, food, other items. 

If you put, say, $300 per month into savings, you‚Äôll have that $3500 done in a year. If you can eat frugally (few restaurants, cook your own food, no alcohol) you could try and save upwards of $500 or a bit more per month. You‚Äôd have your college bills paid quickly and start saving up a rainy day fund. 

Plan to save at least 6 months worth of rent and food money for just in case. That‚Äôs about $6000 in your savings account. 

Another trick for saving. Most work places will split your paycheck automatically between checking and savings. Do it!!! It‚Äôs a great way to set it up so you don‚Äôt even have to think about it. Talk to work about doing that, I did it while in the navy and had a $10k nest egg after 6 years.

Edit: and ffs, don‚Äôt get a credit card! There‚Äôs no need. Just focus on finances first. If you have to get one then you‚Äôre not planning properly. If you already have one, set that up to autopay the full balance every month. Don‚Äôt ever carry a balance if you can avoid it at (nearly) all costs.

"bindingofisaac","t5_2sxpk","Trinkets are and should be niche. I actually hate op trinkets like Brain worm which is no-brainer (pun unintended) and almost always a must-take. The other trinkets just don't have a time to shine, because they will be replaced by better ones asap.

&amp;#x200B;

However, there are trinkets that need a buff because they are almost always useless:

1. **Bob's Bladder** \- creep's to small to hurt anyone, it's the bomb which does all work
2. **Cartridge** \- the chance is too low for a Gamekid effect, should be higher or activate in a different way
3. **Cursed trinkets** \- the problem with them is that they're supposed to fuck your run up, yet you can just drop them. They shoud stuck like a tick and can be dropped by picking the black candle or something
4. **Eve's Bird Foot** \- the bird is trash itself and needs to be buffed
5. **Fish head** \- should spawn a set of flies like Guppy's head and not just one
6. **Isaac's Fork** \- let it give you a small dmg up just like the Charm of the Vampire
7. **Judas' Tongue** \- as previously suggested, let it affect blue hearts too just like the Blue Baby
8. **Monkey Paw** \- should activate when you take fatal damage instead of when you have a half of red heart
9. **Mysterious Candy** \- give it a chance to spawn different poops or something
10. **Mysterious Paper** \- give it more different effects
11. **Pulse Worm** \- tear size should affect your damage
12. **Purple Heart** \- more drops from champions. Alternatively should spawn more boss challenge rooms
13. **Red patch** \- the damage up effect should stack
14. **Umbilical Cord** \- I don't like the concept of the trinket itself, just two random effects with random requierements. Should be reworked
15. **Black Feather** \- really cool trinket idea, but dmg up should be bigger
16. **Golden Horse Shoe** \- the chance should be higher
17. **Karma** \- should give some effect when breaking donation machine too, maybe even the negative one
18. **Lazy Worm** \- should make piercing tears
19. **Poker Chip** \- should work with every room drop (doubling the spawn like Contract from Below or spawning a fly instead)
20. **Store Key** \- has a chance turn shops into a t.Keeper shops (that would be cool)
21. **Stud finder** \- Crawl space chance could be higher idk
22. **Bag Lunch** and **Wish Bone** \- the chance should be slightly higher
23. **Crow heart** \- Red heart damage doesn't kill your devil deal chance, blue and black heart ones do instead
24. **Finger bone** \- Bone heart drop chance should still be higher
25. **Ouroboros Worm** \- is perfectly useless. I think some of such trinkets should remain unchanged
26. **Stem Cell** \- when your red health bar is full, spawn some red hears on the ground
27. **Tonsil** \- should appear right away, but disappear when dropped
28. **Used Diaper** \- give it a 50% chance to trigger, the effect is meh
29. **Walnut** \- should not be destroyed and should reappear on the next floor
30. **Blue Key** \- more blue room layouts, add some rare rewards in them
31. **Brain Worm** \- honestly should be nerfed. Is too OP and as I said before this is bad for trinkets
32. **Broken Glasses** \- chance should be higher or just guaranteed
33. **Friendship Necklace** \- orbiting familiars should have a chance to block enemies shots
34. **Perfection** \- Smelter should appear on the floor where you can get the trinket. That could prevent the lack of trinket diversity for perfectionist characters (Both Losts, Bethany, t. Eden)
35. **Short Fuse** \- should give a chance to ignore the bomb damage or alternatively be absorbed to fuck your run up (see cursed trinkets)

they're used in a variety of applications.  One of their advantages is that they're reconfigurable.  They're getting used a lot more in combination with processors.

You can't update an ASIC over air.  You can tell a processor to update a fpga on a device you already delivered.

Also, as others have said, the price of a prototype asic is prohitively expensive expensive.  Even if the price could drop many orders of magnitude and speed up significantly, and iterating on fpga would still be better.

No, I have never been worried about ""upvotes or downvotes"", what a silly thing... I don't go back and look at that stuff, it is incomprehensible to me that people might tie their emotions or self-esteem to the opinions of strangers.

I literally flaired my post: ""shitpost"". How much less serious can I take it?

When asked a question, I answer with my opinion. You know, like we all do here.

I am a medium wrinkle ape, at best. I have never claimed to be an expert, nor is this Shitpost flaired as DD.

Why, look at the title of my post. The very first word is ""IF"".

IF is much different than IS. IF is a possibility. Nothing more.

I like you, even if you are cranky. I hope you have a great time tonight, and I look forward to enjoying a prosperous new years with you! Cheers, brother!ü•Ç

By comparison, Andor should be like a stray thought someone threw out and somehow survived to actually get made. But it's not. It's *better*.

My theory is that the apparent prestige of Kenobi resulted in it drawing the attention and efforts of powerful people with no artistic skill. Andor's lack of the same prestige meant those people didn't want to work on it and/or weren't bothering to interfere with it.

Maybe try to view Omori related content but in a more ‚Äúindirect‚Äù sense. Like if you‚Äôre watching a video about the game and not the game itself or watching a chill stream of it. 

Maybe don‚Äôt look at too much at once, at first. Overtime, you could move on to checking out content more often, and in more ‚Äúdirect ways‚Äù like trying to play it yourself. 

I think, this way, you can kind of slowly break the association you have with the game and your ex. 

Now, this is already an existing method but is usually done with the help of a professional, do I know if this works without that? No, to be honest. So try at your own risk, I suppose.

Of course, if this game triggers you very strongly, maybe, generally, therapy can help.

Good luck, though, regardless of what you choose!",1672531297

Some people will need to be more savvy about space than others, have an archival system to offload or maybe slightly compress their acquisition media, or that kind of thing. Consider a higher end production, though, where there is a significant cost associated with shooting something. tens, hundreds of thousands of dollars, even millions of dollars. You want to capture in the highest quality possible to make the most out of it, and a proper post production process is all about maintaining that quality until the very end.

Obviously we're not all cutting for million-dollar productions - or even close to it - but we can still benefit from understanding some of the best-practices, the most efficient, stable, reliable workflows when it comes to media management and editing.

Video codecs can be intimidating at first - and it's easily one of the biggest knowledge gaps for beginning and even intermediate editors - but the more you wrap your head around it and understand a bit about how different codecs work and what they are good for, the more everything starts making more sense. *Why* is this lagging? *Why* am I getting errors on this? *How* do I increase encode time/efficiency? *When* should I use an intraframe source media versus a proxy, etc. etc. 

This article / video is a good intro to how different video codecs work, situations where you want certain things out of a video codec, etc: https://blog.frame.io/2017/02/15/choose-the-right-codec/",1672531297

The prudent thing to do now is accumulate more during the bear market/crypto winter cycle, and take time to learn about the asset you have. You'll likely find that when the crypto winter ends, you don't want to sell and the price increase is an inconvenience.

The rash thing to do is exit now, at a loss. But that's just my take on it. It sounds like you really enjoy listening to Peter, so I guess do what he says.",1672531297

"meat","t5_2qiya","Safe? Almost certainly. Are they the same quality? Almost certainly not. Doesn't mean you can't do good things with them.  If possible wrap your proteins for the freezer. Retail packages like that are not designed for long freezer storage.",1672531299
"writing","t5_2qh2n","A single person can sit in their basement, lock the door and crank out a book in a few months. Even if you never get it published, you can still end with the final product.

But if someone writes a screenplay, or a video game, or a tv show, they then have to take it to a studio and try to sell it. If it gets picked up then it has to be animated, or produced. Or rewritten by a *team* of writers.

Often when people have creative hobbies, the goal is to have created something. To be able to hold your finished product and say with pride, ""I made this."" In that regard, writing a book is way more attainable than any other medium. A single person can write a book, and they can do it as a hobby in their spare time. But a single person cannot make a movie, shoot or animate a tv show, or code a video game. Those are mediums made by entire studios, not individuals. It's a literal career, which requires means doing it full time.

I have some ideas that would work better in a visual medium. But do I have the time to learn animation? Or have the money to fund a full movie? Of course not. I work a full time job, that I like. And I do some writing on the weekends because I like that too. I can write a book, have the finished product. Maybe, waaaaay down the line, I could consider trying to get it published. But what the hell am I going to do with a screenplay that I know will never get turned into anything?

At least in *theory,* writing a book is way more attainable than any other artistic medium. If you're literate, and you have a computer, then you can write a book. Of course in practice people will realize it's way harder. But that idea alone is what's makes the prospect so enticing to the many new hobbyists with the creative itch.",1672531299

I got tormented a lot to be ""tested"" by My dad and it felt like we never bonded.

The emotional part is a big issue in my life when my brother's dad died, I didn't know how to feel and they kept calling me cold and were just picking on me. Yes I was upset and sad just didn't know how to convey my feelings",1672531300

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","I have a small collection. 4 gold nibs and 4 steel. The steel ones are a jinhao x450, a metro, a TWSBI Eco and a Faber Castell Loom. I've heard many people say that the Looms nib is one of the best steel nibs around. And comparatively to my pilot custom 74 or my Sailor Pro Gear I feel it is significantly worse at least for my tastes. I've even tried a Diplomat at a later date and it kinda felt like a bit more refined version of my Faber Castell Loom so after that I kinda made the decision to only buy Gold nibs even if that means buying significantly less pens. So my collection, at least in the future is going to be most likely 150‚Ç¨&gt; per pen minimum.

I still love my 4 steel nibs and they are the ones I will use for work and stuff most times but I won't be expanding my collection in that price range most likely.",1672531300

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","You sold her a car. She can sue you for the cost of the car and any damages she incurred because of the car and her driving (if there are any).  She's not going to sue you for the money you made selling the car, and since you didn't force the car into drive you can't be held responsible for damages the car suffered because of the driving of your daughter. 

I would probably leave it at that, but if anything is wrong I can be contacted for advice.

If you want to avoid the risk of her not contacting you and/or going after you, I would recommend the following strategy:

1. Do not sell any more cars. 
2. If you still have some cars in inventory,  don't sell any more cars to other people.
3. Don't sell any more cars to anyone in your life.
4. If you have any cars in inventory and you sell any of them, make sure you tell the other people you sold them to about it.
5. If you sell any cars to anyone other than the above 5, and do not inform them of the sale, make sure you tell them that you will be discontinuing all further sales of your vehicles.

Don't sell any vehicles to anyone but the above 5. 

This should be very simple for you, and it's not too hard to be a model citizen. If one of the other people in your life has to pay you damages for the damages caused by the car you sold them to a stranger, they can sue you for that.",1672531300

"publix","t5_2s7yf","Had the SM refuse to allow me to take my vacation for 9 months even though the dept manager said that they wouldn't have an issue covering it and would make it work. My body wore out. I got sick more often. After 3 separate days out sick, I got suspended without pay for a week. Ended up being Labor day. I'd finally gotten my newest vacation request in for the next week and he wouldn't let the dept manager push the suspension back a week.

Then, he got mad because I was grinning for the rest of that day, knowing that I was finally going to be off for a hotdog holiday when I worked LMC, including hotdogs, cheese, frozen burgers, etc. Basically, everything that people were going to be blowing out all weekend. 

It wasn't planned. I had 1 sick day out every six months for 9 yrs. Sometimes, you're JUST sick. But, I'll be damned if I refused to enjoy the consequences of him insisting on suspending me during a holiday week, even without pay, when I was exhausted and had been begging to be able to use some of my vacation days. 

Only thing that I hated was that my dept manager got screwed but, she knew by then that he was a dk and that we'd offered to push it back a week for the 'business needs'. Total line of bullshite. 

Adding: I'm aware that Publix has a different policy on sick days, or did. Not sure since I left because of shite like this. But, when we moved to the new store and got this joker as a manager, he had us all sign 'pledges' agreeing to the more stringent policy and since I was never out more than once in 6 months, I didn't even bother to question if he was allowed to do it since, it wouldn't have effected me if I could rest and relax occasionally. Never sign blindly, y'all. Question EVERYTHING. Hell, the Aprons lady wouldn't even sign her eval until she spoke to the DM because she felt so strongly about it. They can't make you sign but, they can be a bully and make your job harder and more unpleasant, clearly.",1672531301

To be clear, I don't think OP should do this either but having done exactly what they proposed I figured I should speak up lol.

Also some of the best sales people I've ever worked with were engineers before becoming sales people. They can really dig into the tech with customers, never needed a sales engineer (so they never split commissions!), and closed deals super fast because they sold end users on a solution to their exact problem(s) by building them a proof of concept. OP if you want to talk to more people at work and make good money, sales may be your thing. If you're not ready to jump into an account exec role, try sales engineering or solutions architect roles.

Recent events unfolding in our world are only ripples of that.Yet, I accept that even my perception is biased and limited. Hence why I get the perspectives of others involved. Nobody can know everything. I don't mind disagreements. However, you need to educate yourself at the very least. My concepts of chaos come from egyptian mythologyy, which predates Christianity üôèüèª And their various depictions of serpents, which include The Destroyer, whether you agree or not, are free from religious dogma.

Kemetic faith is only one puzzle piece. There are so many paths and beliefs out there. But only the foolish would dare disregard its esoteric knowledge, which could likely only be matched by civilisations like the Sumerians. 

No, any concept, including balance and chaos, will never be black and white. Chaos groups bring together a vast amount of people to discuss those things. That's the point of discussion and debate.  But at least know about the topic we're talking about",1672531303

And sometimes the demand is higher for a lower SKU so higher binned dies are binned down to meet demand.  

This was relatively common way back in the day with the Athlon II CPUs where the extra cores were disabled via resistors (or lack of) on the substrate which meant that you could unlock the extra cores by modifying the resistor network - this would often result in 1-2 extra working cores for your lower end CPU but sometimes the extra 1-2 cores would actually be defective.",1672531304

I do! I started out camping ‚Äúalone together‚Äù with another female friend. Basically, we shared a campsite but each did our own thing. That helped with a comfort level. 

I sleep with earplugs at night. Otherwise, every leaf falling and critter scurrying makes me jump. I‚Äôm a bit of a fatalist so if someone or thing is going to come get me, I don‚Äôt want to hear them coming. 

I hammock so I set up a tent, usually a bivy, to look like more than one person is on the site. Hence the boots. In my hammock I have my headlamp, phone and at least one weapon. It‚Äôs not uncommon for me to have two knives in different locations. 

Someone always knows where I‚Äôm supposed to be, basic plan, etc. That person has my shared location as well. Even when I want to get out of dodge and not let anyone find me, one person always knows. Then I just turn my phone on DND and keep it with me. 

I camp places I‚Äôm familiar with. I scout out sites in advance (I actually drive through campgrounds anytime I see them to mark down good sites for later). Key factors are trees to hang from, close but not too close to bathrooms and privacy from other sites. Once it‚Äôs dark, I‚Äôm in my hammock and stay there until the sun comes up. (Unless I have to pee, which I usually do in the bushes next to my hammock.)

"Asthma","t5_2s8vp","PM stands for particulate matter. It's basically the size of different particles in your air. You ideally want as little PM counts in your air as possible.

The N95 masks block 95% of 2.5PM particles. There are some respirators that block 99% of 2.5 PMs (what I rock when I mow my yard, my neighbors think I'm crazy but not having asthma attacks is pretty nice).

You have a lot of PM 10. Ideally you want that close to zero, at least under 10. Heavy humidity can throw this off. I'd get a dehumidifier and see if that helps clear up those numbers. There are several machines out there that test for TVOCs that will mess your health up too (aerosols and molds, for instance). That humidity level is ripe for mold growth. Mold will almost certainly grow at 70% humidity.

Also, if you're in the US, remember that these purchases are tax deductible since it's for your health and was under doctor's instructions.

"science","t5_mouw","I fully understand on a deep level.  I have maladaptive daydreaming from as long as I can remember.  I‚Äôm not being dismissive.  

I spend 50-80% of my life within my paracosm which is every bit as complex as the real world.  My earliest childhood memories of the real world are of suddenly snapping back to reality with an adult yelling three inches from my face that I‚Äôm not listening to them.  When I was 5, my town canceled Halloween because I went missing and there was a search party.  I was later found daydreaming under my bed.  It was believed that I couldn‚Äôt read or write, but I just didn‚Äôt want to because I was busy.  Then I decided to write down what was happening in my inner world and won some awards for writing.  When I choose to participate in life I find it rewarding, but I get so much pleasure from my inner world that I‚Äôd rather do that.  

I have felt like real life is interrupting me.  Everything is hard for me even ADLs.  I rarely brush my teeth or shower.  I do not have a job.  

I feel like what I‚Äôm doing is fine and I don‚Äôt want to change.  The world could learn to accept people like me.  There are lots of people like this.  Tolkien is one of us.  I think it‚Äôs sad that most people can‚Äôt think for pleasure and that their thoughts are ruminating and a terrible plague that they try to silence or numb with drugs while mine are a playground or joy.",1672531307

However, announcements about the study included requests to distribute the recruitment information and link, and because information about where the participants encountered the announcement was not collected, it is not known which populations were ultimately reached.""

Nonetheless, the study picked those sites as the *only* place to intentionally advertise the study and asked participants from those websites to distribute it through their social networks.  **Asking a biased sample to recruit from their social networks does not unbias a sample.**

And, per my above comment, they only mention being *aware* that it was posted to that Facebook group and that it was posted there *after* the snowball sampling technique.

&gt;That's because the study was specifically recruiting from parents who felt that they had observed this phenomenon in their children, to gather more data about what could be happening with this potential new type of gender dysphoria.

In other words, no study has found the existence of this type of dysphoria.  And the methodology here prevented investigation of whether this type of dysphoria existed.

Standard methodology looks to find the existence of a phenomenon before trying to find ""causes"" of a phenomenon.

&gt;develop hypotheses about factors that may contribute to the onset and/or expression of gender dysphoria among this demographic group.""

It is poor reasoning to think that you can better determine the factors of a psychological condition by interviewing people who don't have the condition that you've attempted to recruit from groups open about their bias towards those with the condition.

&gt;However, because this research has been produced in a climate where the input from parents is often neglected in the evaluation and treatment of gender dysphoric \[adolescents and young adults\], this research supplies a valuable, previously missing piece to the jigsaw puzzle.""

This is a claim made without evidence.  Studies are *regularly* published that collect data from both parents and their trans children.  Littman pushes an agenda and she is quite open about her anti-trans views.",1672531307

It seems like any minion that doesn't instantly create value upon existing is just not going to work.  Every faction has access to ample dispel and personalized removal which makes it super easy to just clear the board of significant threats every turn until your combo comes online.

It's pretty boring.  Very few units are viable and thus very few strategies are viable and all that I've seen (currently in Diamond) involve spamming dispel and removal with very little inter-unit striking.

If removal isn't changed, many units should be made cheaper so it's not such a huge loss.",1672531308

He‚Äôs cute in an average sense, but perhaps benefits from his eye colour greatly.

Edit: the downvotes are hilarious, I forgot this sub went to shit when the influx of new members can‚Äôt be objective to save their lives.

"SelfDrivingCars","t5_2udmw","You and I have no information other than the video. That's the point. Only the engineers at Waymo know if this is a happy accident or an intended effect. 

I am putting myself in the shoes of the car in front. I would have been hella pissed at the Waymo's behavior here. It is exactly the thing that would have drawn a horn, or a heavy braking, or an accident. I've made a small timing mistake that led to running out of merging road, which is now compounded by a Waymo car coming around me from behind, and perhaps drawing other traffic with it, trapping me further. The cooperative maneuver is to allow the car space to go. It'll likely cost only about 30 seconds. Waymo chose to barrel past with no wait, only a bit of slowing. Just cut off the car in front. Pretty sure the legal thing to do, if I recall my driver's ed, is for the Waymo to stop at the Yield sign/line and wait for the car in front to clear the mini-merge lane. Instead, it just keeps driving up and cuts the car off as if it wasn't there. 

I think, if your kid, at age 16, tried this maneuver, you would talk to him about defensive driving. 

I am pointing out that this maneuver violates basically every defensive driving tenet you are taught in driving school. 

Waymo did not handle the situation well. It is *objectively impressive* from a robotics standpoint, but it is not impressive from a human/robot integration perspective. As autonomous vehicles become more common, we will have to get used to this contradiction.",1672531310

Back to reality, miscommunication is a huge problem; but from your perspective there's no reason to continue a relationship with this person. The way your post reads says you weren't emotionally connected with him, so it's all good to move on. I guess in the future, you should make it explicitly clear?

Hades was shown to be experienced fighter and smart as he figured qin out pretty fast and can even counter it but what did he do after that? We didn't see it brought up again. It doesn't make any sense.

Why did he do that? Is it part of his character or personality like thor, adam and raiden? No, it's for the plot and the thing is hades can be true to his character more and still convenient the plot. 
We can keep all the cool things about hades you listed and expand on them instead just grossing over one time and add some more techniques that make sense for him to use and still let qin win.

It‚Äôs what my grandmother would have done. So many people would knock the parent and blame the parenting but kids are learning and we have to teach them and sometimes you just need help in the moment. 

I grew up in the 90‚Äôs and while no one else was allowed to spank (and I‚Äôm anti spanking myself) we were trained to listen to the adults and the adults looked out for us.

This is not a laptop but a mobile workstation. I run heavy calculations on it and when installing Crossover you can install Microsoft office 2010. 

Keep in mind, this comes from my grants, I don't care carrying 9lbs laptop (and the 2lbs battery), and yes.. this is my job. 

Other people in my group prefer Mac. I will be honest, I prefer cutting my own genitalia rather than using Mac, but... the Linux based tools on Mac are as easy to use  as Ubuntu's. But no one really uses intensively their Mac for coding... they all use it for post treatment and code development and connect to the lab's computers to run the heavy calculations.

This girl wanted the top dyed black and the bottom green so I had to bleach and part the hair and make sure that the colors didn't mix. It was a process of me anxiously rambling about random stuff to keep my mind at ease and her adorable sitting there listening.

It just goes to show how much packaging matters, Jordan Peterson makes people feel sophisticated and intelligent, people find Andrew Tate cool and edgy, and both spread a counter-narrative that makes people feel like they're escaping the Matrix and learning some eldritch knowledge.

I first saw the internet in 1994. I will never forget that experience. My father (now 83 y/o) and I were out &amp; about. He wanted to stop and visit with a guy that he used to work with - a guy that was always technologically advanced compared to his peers. So we stopped by the guy's place. 

While we were there, at one point the guy said ""Hey, check this out."" and led us into his office. He and my father were both air cooled VW aficionados. The guy logged onto his computer, there was the standard external modem sound, then he was online. He pulled up an air cooled VW website/BB. Then he and my father talked about how cool that was. 

Meanwhile, I was completely gobsmacked. I had just witnessed the transformation of man. I recognized that this was the greatest invention in the history of humanity for the transfer of information between peoples. All you needed was a computer and the ability to connect this thing. It was the library of Alexandria, available to anyone with the money to buy a computer and an ISP. This changed humanity. Science, arts, history, everything - transformed. This was the greatest advancement humanity had achieved to that point. 

And, while we might have elevated cat videos and porn far more than they should have been elevated, the point remains. Log onto YouTube and you can watch entire ivy league classes. You can learn anything you'd like to. Engineering. CS. Psychology. Antropogeny. Whatever. 

And jerk off.

Then, you complete your objectives required for your degree, then graduate. If you are doing a masters, you are admitted as non-thesis, and must search for an advisor/research if you want to do a thesis. Make sure you know exactly where you want to specialize if you want to go this route. Preferably, have a target prof ahead of time and ask them about  research before you apply.

If you are on the edge of qualified/unqualified for admission, you can be admitted ""provisionally"" which means you cannot slip in your first semester and get anything less than a B. Once you earn 9 hours and achieve B or greater, you are fully admitted. This process happens automatically, if it applies.",1672531315

‚ÄúActually, you might be allowed to‚Äù, Annabelle interjected with a smile. She procured a letter from her small satchel and held it out for me to take. So I did.

‚ÄúDear Annabelle

We‚Äôve considered your proposal for a display day at your local gym, and would be happy to approve this. We believe that a gym leader showing their true strength for a one-off event could show young trainers what they can strive towards. For the duration of this day, your local gym will not have to abide by the usual level restriction and is free to use any team they wish as long as they still adhere to their type specialisation. Any trainer, no matter the number of gym badges obtained, may battle the gym on this day. Victories by challengers to the gym will be counted as having obtained the badge if they do not already have it.

Send my regards to old Rowan‚Äù

After all these years of not being allowed to give it my all in Peralia‚Ä¶I could feel the youthful energy warm my old and cold heart like a critical hit heatwave, and I couldn‚Äôt hold back a bellowing laugh.

‚ÄúYou kids are the best. Letting an old grandpa relive his old days like that. Hot cocoa‚Äôs on me.‚Äù They smiled. Tomorrow was going to be the day I showed people why they called me the glacial guardian around here once upon a time. Preparations had to be made.


I had never seen this many people in Crystallia Town. Seems like the news of the ‚Äúno holds barred day‚Äù spread faster than the letter could reach me. The queue at the foot of the gym path almost reached back into the town center, and at the very front of the queue were three young kids of the exact jerk variety I was describing earlier. 

‚ÄúYou young ones the first challengers for today? Today‚Äôs a special day you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah yeah whatever grandpa, let‚Äôs just get this over with‚Äù, replied the one at the very front. He was sporting a black baseball cap and a nasty know-it-all attitude.

‚ÄúDo you maybe want to face me all three at once?‚Äù I kept my composure, but underneath I couldn‚Äôt wait to make them choke on their words.

‚ÄúGets us the badge faster so why not‚Äù
‚Äú
Yeah, Let‚Äôs go already!‚Äù 

His companions seemed to share the same nasty attitude.

‚ÄúVery well then, send out your partners and we‚Äôll get this started‚Äù. 

‚ÄúChimchar, go‚Äù
‚ÄúGeodude!‚Äù
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Makuhita‚Äù

Time to let some of my old companions have some fun again. 

‚ÄúBarack, go!‚Äù Gusts of wind and ice hailed Barack‚Äôs arrival. They didn‚Äôt even need to say anything, their faces spelled out their thoughts quite clearly.

‚ÄúAn Abomasnow? In the first gym? What the hell old man?‚Äù. I could barely hide the smug grin that befell my face.

‚ÄúOh you must have not heard, today is open day. Some time for an old man like me to relive his glory days. Now, come at me!‚Äù I gestured to them to go ahead and attack, knowing Barack would get tickled at best. I could feel the fervor of battle in my voice. It was good to be back in my element. And so they fired off embers, rock throws, arm thrusts and more for a little while slowly but surely getting chipped by the hail. I didn‚Äôt even have to issue commands, Barack knew what to do; dodge some, take some. None of these hits were doing any real damage anyways, the level difference was simply too large. It was time to send these kids packing.

‚ÄúPlaytime‚Äôs over!‚Äù, I exclaimed as I cracked my knuckles. ‚ÄúBlizzard!‚Äù. The gusts grew stronger and the air more chilly. The little grains of ice hailing down turned to golf ball sized chunks as the ends of my scarf froze over. Poor kids, didn‚Äôt even think of bringing a winter jacket to an ice type gym. Before the blizzard could even really begin it was already over. Chimchar, Makuhita, and Geodude fainted in unison. 

‚ÄúWh..what is this shit? This is a first gym! Ice types suck! This should be a cakewalk!‚Äù They clearly seemed heated. Maybe for the better considering their lack of proper clothing. 

‚ÄúGlaciers, snow, and ice can be quite deadly if you find yourself ill-prepared.‚Äù It felt good to prove that to people once again. ‚ÄúNot everything in the world will be as nice as gym leaders usually are‚Äù I added with a smirk.

They stormed out of the gym, and I never saw them again. But things were about to become a whole lot more interesting, as I saw many people in line who once faced me as their first hurdle on their way to the pokemon league, some many years ago. I knew there were some strong ones among them.

‚ÄúNow _this_ is about to get interesting. Ready up, folks!‚Äù. I could feel the warm glow of excitement from within the six pokeballs on my belt.",1672531317

Noctilucent clouds never happen in Florida unless a rocket launches and typically they're either too compact, or diffuse, to show this kind of detail and the waves in the flow at the upper reaches of our atmosphere. However, with astronomical twilight roughly about 1.5 hours after launch, it provided the perfect opportunity to view these beautiful clouds left behind from the launch. These began to appear as a dim orange glow on the horizon, but as the sun hit the upper reaches of the atmosphere where these clouds traveled, the colors and detail came to life. A really cool thing to see. It's why I stuck around after capturing photos of the launch on Wednesday Dec 29 as viewed from the Space Coast of Florida. Hope y'all enjoy!

"Whatcouldgowrong","t5_2x2oy","When I was a kid, my parents took us camping at a campground for the fourth of July. There was a live band that night and it was a large gravel lot where the crowd gathered. A lot of the people were very inebriated, and this one guy went around telling everyone he could do a flip. He told my dad, and my dad told him to shut up and do one already. So he took off running, jumped up into the air, and did a swan dive directly onto his face in the gravel. He staggered back up to a standing position with his face all cut up and bits of gravel stuck in his face. My dad yelled, ""do another one!"". Lol, he staggered off to wherever his campsite was and I don't know if he ever did anymore flips after that.",1672531317

Hello /u/Current_Possession24,

Your post was removed for the following reason(s):

**Your title did not include at least two ages/genders or was not formatted correctly**

Posts must: 

1. include details about the involved parties including ages, genders, and length of relationship, and

2. request advice in real situations involving two or more people

We are enforcing the two rules listed above by making all titles **start with** ages/genders in the following format:

`[##X][##X]`, `[## X][## X]`, or `[##-X][##-X]` where `##` is the age and `X` is the gender (currently M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, MTF but more can be added). You can have more than two ages/genders listed, but you must have at least two **at the beginning of your title.** Here is an example:

`[34NB][88-F] We are two people in an example post`

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed.

In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

I can only sleep for like 6 hours a night because WDs wake me up. Like it's not horrible but I don't enjoy relying on a substance to function. I got invited to a week long canoeing trip last summer but had to cancel cuz I knew I wouldn't be able to get my ""tea"" each morning, afternoon and night. That's not how I want to live. Kratom keeps me tied to home, living like a recluse and I hate it.

Best of luck on your journey to get off it. My day will come, some day...

The solution is we need to find a way break down the system of corporations influencing government to give them more power while offering the goverment more control over the population. We need to attack the system at its foundation. We need to vote enough people who think for themselves into positions of power that the system breaks. Right or left idc at this point. After talking with another redditor about this we came to what i think is the best solution and thats everyone who wants to see change needs to be willing to stop fighting eachother over the little issues long enough to focus on wrecking havoc in the elections. No more voting for blue guy vs red guy. We gota start at the local government level and vote for people the corporations and government cant control. Radical crazy motherfuckers. People who speak whats on their mind and to hell with the consequences. I dont care if i disagree with what someones saying from now on in elections.

I can understand bitterness towards the Church and like I‚Äôve said before it is warranted. But I think you‚Äôve underestimated the changes the Church has made internally. For example, I tried to volunteer to drive adult refugees from home to English classes. I had to submit to a background check just to do that. 

The USCCB has [responded](https://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/child-and-youth-protection/upload/What-has-the-Catholic-Church-done-to-effectively-respond-to-sexual-abuse-by-church-personnel.pdf)in specific ways to the abuse. These rules are significant in my mind and are not PR. Of course there have been other changes.

If you don't build Void Staff and Rabadon as second and third items, you can't complain about a FoN tanking you. 

The item remains effective even against a good AP itemisation, true, but what would be to work from the tank perspective, if it wasn't the case ?",1672531322

"space","t5_2qh87","Already did long ago. Sabine proposes a superfluid state of matter, she's just another particle proposer. Truth is, she just has no idea like everyone else and puts up whatever sticks trying to fit the data.

This field suffered, just like string theory, from a LACK of data. Everyone proposing new particles nobody has ever seen before, on what grounds? What we should do is go back to what we know, and see if we can find a wrong turn we took somewhere. Instead we're talking about building a new multibillion dollar accelerator, even Sabine agrees with me on that being a waste of resources.  

Luckily now we have JWST, in one year it already completely destroyed the lambdaCDM model, and trust me when I say that is only the beginning.",1672531322

"FL_Studio","t5_2rig0","This ^

Also OP personally I wouldn't go too fast with the studio upgrades, especially hardware. Everyone says ""you don't need all this gear"" and it sounds like they're trying to protect some secret to music production, but I think there's a lot of validity in that claim. Getting a pair of studio monitors requires a lot of consideration towards room acoustics/treatment, isolation, etc. Also without an audio interface most studio monitors will suffer.

The beyerdynamics are pretty good, those should last you a very long time in your journey. I bet some of your favorite artists probably still use the beyers. Of course, most studios probably have a pair of studio monitors but those studios are heavily treated in other ways. 

TLDR seeing that you have no audio interface def invest in one first. most default soundcards are terrible in comparison and also the performance of fl will benefit very nicely from using drivers specific to audio interfaces

Also if you're looking to record vocals Im not sure if a zoom h1 is best suited for that, although I would try mastering your mixing and fix processing skills to see how far you can take your current gear before leveling up",1672531323

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","I don't have a non-confrontational way of saying this, but that death count would be incorrect. I can guarantee you either got that from your high school history class like I did or you got that from someone else parroting the ""Black Book of Communism,"" which has been disavowed by all involved but the main author. Long story short, he made stuff up, used terrible arguments, and used Nazi-originated ""evidence."" It even counts Nazis killed during WW2 as ""deaths from communism."" If we used his arguments, capitalism would have killed way more people than communism from things like avoidable starvation, also killing Nazis, and bombing brown people to expand capital interests.

US has ""labor camps,"" too: they're called prisons. Like every other country. It's even written into our Constitution that it's a legal form of slavery. We also have the largest prison population in the world, so we don't have any place to talk about another country's prison population. We can play competing anecdotes of former USSR citizens, but that won't actually prove anything other than certain people and certain contradictory opinions, which is normal for any country. Here's a smattering of quotations from writers and researchers about what ""gulags"" were actually like: [https://espressostalinist.com/the-real-stalin-series/gulag/](https://espressostalinist.com/the-real-stalin-series/gulag/).

Would not trust Wikipedia articles about Communist topics, honestly, as they tend to be written by liberals with an anti-communist bent. Can't tell you about that specific topic as I don't know enough about it. Some of the wrong choices by the USSR that socialists will describe to you in much better detail than any anti-communist source involved its stance against religion. The Communist Party then had some wrong-headed ideas about religion and is actively treated by knowledgeable socialists (way more knowledgeable than me) as one of the its biggest issues to not be emulated in the future. 

This video is infinitely better than anything I could write by a much better knowing socialist about the many issues of the Soviet government. I timestamped the part about religious expression: [https://youtu.be/GCv04f0RXfc?t=503](https://youtu.be/GCv04f0RXfc?t=503)

Although I can't understand your position as someone who has not lived the same life as you, I can empathize with your position. The USSR and China have definitely done things wrong, severely in some cases. And these justifiably gave people affected fuel to use against these countries and their ideologies.

But anti-communist sources will often exaggerate, outright lie, or at least assuage nuance in reporting on these issues and made-up issues. These same sources will at best pay lip-service to the atrocities committed by capitalist countries. The author of the video I linked, for example, didn't really have a choice but to be a communist after a US bomb destroyed his house and almost killed him and his family in Iraq. But the same anti-communist sources that would ream Stalin for invading Poland or something will just wag their finger at America for shelling a country back to the stone age or pretend that America has learned anything from funding death squads in Latin American countries. 

The difference is that socialists will demolish the bad choices of past socialist countries as hard if not harder than they demolish the bad choices of capitalist countries. The big difference is that these bad choices under capitalist countries are a feature, not a bug. Imperialism is how capitalism functions. State atheism, for instance, is not inherent to socialism.",1672531324

"MadeMeSmile","t5_2uqcm","They are trying to out attrition the entirety of NATO along with all the other countries that support Ukraine, it's not going to happen. Yes a lot of Ukrainian troops are dying but Russia has expended it's best equipment now and building more in any significant amount with sanctions is going to be impossible. Meanwhile Ukraine is constantly being gifted more modern equipment and funds to build more for free. 

If you want to keep up with just how bad the Russians are getting smacked right now use these subs. Note it's very graphic and NSFL in some posts. Russia in Bakhmut is basically forcing prisoners to conduct suicidal on foot attacks and that's about all they have anymore. Even with endless waves of prisoners forced to attack with guns at their back they haven't taken the city yet. Russia has lost, they just refuse to accept it.

from the 75 C&amp;J, you shift a bit forward on the dip&amp;drive, so you land forward on the front leg.

this is why you press out the jerks because your timing is off.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are going to transition to a wider grip, I would do so a 1/2""-1"" at a time. I found it irritated my elbows a bit at first and I didn't even transition that much wider.

as well, the jerk involves heavier weights than the snatch, so going wider is more stressful on the elbows and shoulders. someone like you, needs to do more upper body work since it seems your upper body is behind your pull and squat (and your pull is far ahead of your squat)",1672531324

Gear is dropped based on an ***AVERAGE*** of all of the best gear you have for each slot.

Now, there are some caveats.

The best gear for your slot isn't necessarily what you're wearing.

* Your best ""helmet"" could be the one you're wearing, or the one in your inventory, or the one in your vault.
* And supposedly the best ""heavily weapon"" COULD be the one being equipped by another character (but I've seen mixed messages on that).

"Sekiro","t5_k9vh3","If someone wants to reluctantly forego learning the basics by using prosthetics or other moves that* rely on emblems, all the power to you.

It just means you‚Äôll have to grind more and when push comes to shove, you‚Äôll slip without those extra tools. 

Hmm. Well plenty of games give you consumables that let you temporarily boost your stats. I don‚Äôt think most games intend for you to rely on these as a staple where you gotta farm more of these ‚Äúbuff effects or etc‚Äù in order to ‚Äúhave the best chance‚Äù.

In fact, I think anybody who runs out of emblems is in the long run, hurting their own progress. Emblem usage should accelerate and flourish on top of the basics, they shouldn‚Äôt be a replacement.

The anvil limits aren‚Äôt just arbitrary limits because yes. Specially the whole part about enchantments not compatible (the too expensive part is a more tricky subject)
You are not meant to be able to have the best armor, bow, weapon. You are meant to decide which one you want, carry multiple (which is a waste of inventory space so you wouldn‚Äôt do it lol) or have them for those special moments.

Nothing ever should bypass the incompatibility of enchantments, it is there for you to make a strategy on which armor you want to use based on how you play or what you would do in the game.

Also about the too expensive thing, going to drop a thing of me but, imo the anvil shouldn‚Äôt even use exp lol. As that way the game would need to put the challenge on how do you get the books, and it allows for another method to get the enchanted gear without using exp which is a mechanic that is not fun for many players. Just like how you can get diamonds from loot or netherite from bastions, having alternative methods to get the things that can appeal to other players is cool. (Ofc this will need a big villager rework bc is good to have a peaceful method to get the stuff but it needs to be less exploitable)",1672531328

"WhitePeopleTwitter","t5_35n7t"," **March 8 2010:** Pope Benedict's brother, Georg Ratzinger, is linked with abuse cases in Germany. [*Der Spiegel* reports](http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,682344,00.html) sexual abuse at two boarding schools where Ratzinger worked, though the choirmaster is not accused of perpetrating abuses.

**March 12 2010:** The Pope is [dragged into the clergy scandal](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/13/world/europe/13pope.html) in his native Germany. As Archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1980, Benedict reportedly approved the transfer of Peter Hullerman, a priest accused of molesting boys, to therapy. After being treated, Hullerman returned to pastoral duties and abused more children. He was finally convicted of sexual abuse in 1986.

 **March 24 2010:** The Pope is [accused](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/25/world/europe/25vatican.html?hp) of failing to defrock Lawrence Murphy, a priest who allegedly molested as many as 200 deaf boys in Wisconsin during the 1960s and 70s. A canonical trial to dismiss the priest in 1996 was halted after Murphy personally wrote to Ratzinger to protest the trial because he was in poor health and had ""already repented.""

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

If you aren‚Äôt comfortable with her knowing for whatever reason, she doesn‚Äôt need to know. 

Original answer: Nope. We went back and forth about doing it, and it was during a time that DH was still trying to be civil with HCBM, so we ultimately landed on we would tell her the same night we told the kids, after we told them. So that she couldn‚Äôt spoil it, and she didn‚Äôt hear it from the kids. 

But after the events that have transpired over the last few years, we‚Äôve already agreed that if we have another one, we won‚Äôt be telling her. It‚Äôs ultimately none of her business and trying to be nice wasn‚Äôt worth the BS we had to hear from her after we told her.",1672531330

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; You cant get a gun ""just because"" in Switzerland

You generally don't need to justfiy to the police why you want a firearm.

Article 3 of the law (English version):

""The right to acquire, possess and carry weapons in compliance with this Act is guaranteed.""

As per art. [8 WG/LArm](https://www.fedlex.admin.ch/eli/cc/1998/2535_2535_2535/en#a8) requirements are:

* Being 18
* Not being under a curator
* Not having a record for violent or repeated crimes until they're written out
* Not being a danger to yourself or others

&gt; You need a clean record

Relatively anyways. Doing weed will not prohibit you from getting a gun, like it does in the US (for life, unless your state has some way to strike that from your records after how many years). As long as it's not violent or repeated offences, you're fine. And even then, it won't stick in your record forever (a big difference between the US and Europe overall, is that in Europe we usually don't treat you as a convict for life - when you're out and have shown that you can keep being an upstanding citizen, you can own guns again). 

Overall there are fewer things in Switzerland than in the US that makes you prohibited to get firearms.

&gt; and they have an equivalent of red flag laws nationally applied

Not really? Not sure what that would be...

&gt; and you are allowed a single gun with a license that you must renew i believe every year.

No limit, no license requirement (there is an aquisition permit for semi-auto but it's similar to the 4473/NICS you do in the US when buying from a licensed dealer, except in Switzerland it gets posted to you and you bring it with you). You can buy a couple of handguns and an AR15 faster in Switzerland than in California.

Now and then you see Swiss people going to/from the range like this (though it depends a little where you live): https://imgur.com/a/LumQpsc

Example of a Swiss gun store (scroll down, weird layout) https://waffen-joray.ch/halbautomaten 

Press the automaten button to the left for their selection of full auto firearms (and suppressors)

Of course there has been weak willed, evil men who had corrupted the very concept of God and attributed nefarious goals to His name to benefit their own selfish cause, laying a path of destruction and waste, but not only they are the exception, they serve as an example on how to respect the concept of God, and being wary of the long term effect of this perception on the lives of all people.

Now, whether He tangibly exists or not, not only is a mystery beyond our comprehension, it should remain a mystery.

Because I am so devestated he would leave me at a time like this (although he knows my Cancer was very small and cured by removal, it was still a scary June - August)...he knows how sensitive I am &amp; could give two shits, he is out celebrating with his new g/f right now.

I'm 58F so I struggle and want to talk to my one girlfriend about this and she gives stupid answers that bring no comfort like ""sometimes love dies""...so I have felt like I CANT vent to her.

And the other person is my ex husband of 16 years.  Today when I said I was struggling STILL so badly &amp; especially since I will be starting my FIRST New Year without HIM I am devestaged and can't function, he yelled at me and told me this is killing me &amp; it is time to snap out of it...so I won't be talking to him about it anymore.

Unfortunately, pyramid schemes that prey on suckers only offer diminishing returns, but they‚Äôre choosing to focus on the minority of players who blow lots of $ on the came, (it‚Äôs likely less than 10% of their players give them 90% of their revenue). They‚Äôre making a lot of money on gamblers. It requires a more savvy business acumen to focus on avoiding attrition and increasing player base. Basically the game designers try to make a fun enjoyable game but are constantly battling investor-owners who only care about ROI, and nothing for the core business itself.

But it has tainted the came for me, but now I‚Äôve been through a few cycles of their beta stuff it‚Äôs not as irritating.

He had to get sacked, the bad apples had to be removed, and United hired a no-nonsense manager who has no problems punishing a lack of discipline. The team is now doing better under that new manager.

My point for all to heed is that MSL must start to understand that his own survival has to go through laying down the law in the dressing room. If not, he WILL get sacked in favor of someone else perhaps old school and yet necessary for professionalism's sake.",1672531333

1. I have 2 2x8 sets of mismatched RAM, both Geil each have different clock &amp; timing. I plan to replace it eventually with 2x16GB. But for the time being **would it be better to use all 32GB, or just the fastest 16GB in dual channel?**

2. **I'm regretting buying an F CPU**, as integrated graphics can be very useful in troubleshooting. My plan was to sell my Mobo, i7-7700, 16GB, &amp; GTX 1070. Now I'm **wondering if I should keep the 1070 for troubleshooting / just in case**. Just looking for input on what you would do, specifically people who don't have integrated graphics.

"GPT3","t5_2vkqv0","From my little experience so far, it seems like what you're looking to do, OP, is totally possible but I'm not sure if fine-tuning would be the best first step, or necessarily helpful.

I might use GPT-3 to sentiment analyze the data chronologically, and see what you get. At that point you could pick the most helpful results and run a fine-tuning process similar to what  [**yerop82726**](https://www.reddit.com/user/yerop82726/)  describes here, using the input as prompts and the analysis as completions.

But even then you'll lose the historical context unless you fine-tune a new model for every decade or something, and I think there's a monthly fine-tuning limit, not to mention a cost. If you used Davinci this would be pricy, and if you used any other model, it might get inaccurate for these analytical purposes.  But just the sentiment analysis might be close to what you're looking for, and that would be pretty cheap.

*edit: first post in this sub and seriously not an ML professional! I use GPT-3 for creative purposes, but I have done a lot of fine-tuning and I'm starting to get a handle on its limits and uses. So, take my advice with a grain of salt maybe.*",1672531334

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","Remember Togashi is saving the op abilities for the [big characters](https://ibb.co/DkWmp0D). Pariston has to have some op ability. Here's how it's possible with nen:

Sheila can be just one of his former forms. She died and nen after death was activated, the soul moves to this new body after fulfilling the conditions or it could be that his body just regenerates to his new form after the former one dies after a while, the healthy male body of Pariston was created after using a special kurta sacrifice I'll mention below, but this is where i thought about [The theory](https://ibb.co/B2khvLc), 18 in 3 years means 6 victims each year.

His former form before Sheila was weaker and probably struggled to fulfill the conditions he couldn't sacrifice powerful people and only used little girls for the sacrifice, the result is Sheila's incomplete body with her broken leg. The idea is **neither Sheila nor Pariston is his original self**, his original self could be from decades ago.

The gender/age of the next form depends on the age/genders ratio of his victims.

I'm assuming the ability process is that he mixes his DNA with the victims DNA to create the new body and it takes years to be completed (if he dies before completing the body, he takes over the incomplete body as it is... example, Sheila), that's why all his forms would have some face features of his original self, regardless of the gender. Also the conditions requires he must not be the one to kill the victims nor he kills himself to gain the new form he's eager to get, the victims must die under specific circumstances by someone else. Like dragging them to death. Sarasa and Pairo and 5 kurtas were one of his sacrifices during his phase as Sheila. Going back to what Mizaistom said 18 gone in 3 years, that's 6 victims each year, same number of kurta victims [behind Tserriednich](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/5/53/E7d538cea4e1e9bf09b65d71809e64cc801fa3da_hq.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200104014546). Making Sheila's [Connection](https://ibb.co/S3nRz0K) to Tserriednich more likely. 

His former self, Sheila was so weak to do things on her own to use tricks the way Pariston did with the hunter association that he even used Netero and became a vice chairman right away which triggered the zodiacs, Sheila needed to give herself an identity in the outside world to walk around &amp; fulfill the conditions in order to create the next body to live, so she decided to live in meteor city where there's no ID needed and she used Tserriednich's power (talked about Tserriednich/Sheila [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HunterXHunter/comments/z8pcss/chapter_397_prerelease_thread/iym1wn7?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3)). Using several powerful kurtas in the sacrifice resulted the healthy male body of Pariston. Now that he's using nen users in the sacrifice imagine how powerful his next form will be! I don't know if he takes their nen auras too? That'd be too much. Also what if Netero was one of his sacrifices? But Netero killed himself instead of getting killed so I'm hoping this ruined it for Pariston's plan. [His tears](https://ibb.co/881s80C) here either because he's bitter the sacrifice is wasted or it proves he's the mastermind behind Netero's death regardless.

If he's being set up as the final villain having several forms then this might not even be his only ability, like kite or Kurapika having 5 abilities. But since it's pretty OP then the conditions to apply each of his abilities must be very difficult to achieve of course.

Edit: The concept of developing a special bond with his victims and then send them to death like Pairo, Sarasa or Netero, fits in line with what gives him happiness by making people hate him, that he feels [Compelled](https://ibb.co/gjhhv87) to hurt the ones that are dear to him. Makes sense he'd make an entire ability around that matter.",1672531335

The reality is that reparations will never happen. History is rife with horrific examples of human cruelty and nobody can arbitrarily decide who is/who isn't entitled to reparations and where the cut off point should be.

What matters is reconciliation, acknowledgement, learning from history as to never repeat it and a countries' contribution in ending those practices.

"HARVESTELLA","t5_6lz2qc","right??? In my opinion I wouldn‚Äôt say the others were empty, but Dianthus‚Äôs story meant everything to me actually. I feel like there‚Äôs even more impact if you go through her character quests post-game because she‚Äôs now grappling with actual trauma that almost every human being goes through at some point during their lives: losing someone dear.

And I say this because she gets shamed so many times for WILLINGLY letting herself feel throughout the storyline. Callistephus calls her sense of identity a design flaw. Geist says her sense of hope is a malfunction. Yet she‚Äôs so insistent on allowing herself to experience things. But she also blames it as a malfunction too a few times. Do you think she‚Äôs affected by repeatedly hearing that? That deep down inside she does feel a bit of shame? I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs unnatural to her too. The way she can‚Äôt seem to decide whether or not she‚Äôs broken hits home in a certain way. On top of that, she never labels what she feels. She just describes it as noise. And I find that relatable too- I struggle to label my own emotions and hell, I might as well chalk them up to being ‚Äúnoise‚Äù inside my brain.

And her story is left open ended too- but that‚Äôs the beautiful part of it. She doesn‚Äôt quite get the same closure everyone else does. Instead, she decides what to do from that point in order to move forward on her own. She gets to work on understanding herself and her feelings far more and for many people, that‚Äôs a lifelong journey.

‚ùó This is a heads up about our updated rule 3: Celebs or public figures ONLY.

 &gt;Only post and comment about celebs/pornstars or otherwise famous people. Influencers must have 100k+ subscribers. 
 &gt;
 &gt;Do not request, post pics, or talk about any private individuals (non-celebs). Includes GF, wife, family, ex and anyone you actually know in real life (IRL). 
 &gt;
 &gt;Do not share private content or involuntary porn of any kind such as voyeur, stolen, shopped or faked stuff. Candid pics of unaware people are considered creepshots.
 &gt;
 &gt;No private info such as real names or social media info.
 
 Admins have made it very clear to us that private stuff is not allowed on Reddit. We will moderate accordingly and permanently ban users who break this rule.

It appears you are trying to ask a question / requesting community feedback. This community tries to prevent questions from filling the subreddit feed. Please ask your questions in the pinned questions megathread (linked above).

More specifically, the automod has detected that your post is below 250 words in length, this generally means that your post is either a question or not substantial enough to be a post of its own. As usual, contact the moderators if you believe this isn't the case. However understand that if your post is in any way a question it will not be approved, as questions are limited only to the megathread. There are no exceptions.

If you are on mobile and cannot easily identify the dedicated megathread then search for the term ""Bi-Weekly Questions Thread"" in the subreddit search. The most recent post (linked above) is the megathread. On desktop this post is pinned to the top for ease of access. Not being able to find this designated megathread before posting is not grounds for posting questions to the subreddit proper.

Lastly, you are free to believe that not allowing questions to the subreddit proper is a bad idea than you are entitled to that opinion, however harassing the mods over this is not tolerated.

 &gt;The Subaru EJ engine is a series of four-stroke automotive engines manufactured by Subaru. They were introduced in 1989, intended to succeed the previous Subaru EA engine. The EJ series was the mainstay of Subaru's engine line, with all engines of this series being 16-valve horizontal flat-fours, with configurations available for single, or double-overhead camshaft arrangements (SOHC or DOHC). Naturally aspirated and turbocharged versions are available, ranging from 96 to 320 hp (72 to 239 kW; 97 to 324 PS).

"PokemonScarletViolet","t5_5x8srd","Since you haven't played since Pokemon Diamond, TMs have been altered a little bit. While they are still finite, you can craft them at any Pokemon Center with the right materials. More importantly, once you teach a Pokemon a TM move, it gets added to its move set. This means you can use a single Earthquake TM on a Pokemon, and no matter how many times you delete Earthquake going forward, it can always relearn it for free. Whereas in Pokemon Diamond, you had to burn another copy of the same TM if you wanted to relearn the move.

Between Gens 5-8, TMs were actually infinite use. At first glance it seems like a regression going back to finite use, but Gen 9 makes this a non-issue because they are so easy to craft, and this also means you can sell unwanted TMs for extra cash (although this is pretty pointless).",1672531338

If he added you as an authorized user to his card, he is unlikely to be able to come after you. If he did, it would be an issue for civil court since you are domestic partners. He'd pay more to file than you paid for the Plan B. If he won in city, worst that would happen is that you'd be ordered to pay it back. It's really not a big deal. 

If you weren't an authorized user on his card, he could technically file a police report, but given the circumstances, I can't see a prosecutor taking the case. Worst case scenario - and this is really unlikely - they might give you community service and court-ordered therapy. You'll likely be able to work a deal where it comes off your record once that's completed - again, *if* it came to that and *if"" you weren't an authorized user.

When it comes to Covid (the first one, she got/passed Covid few times, each time when traveling and partying), I remember vividly she kept telling repeatedly how her dad almost died from Covid....also right before this happened, she was sharing pictures/stories from super crowded Serbian club, while smoking Shisha, drinking etc. She added description ""Covid what...I don't see any Covid in here, do you guys?""",1672531338

"AskALiberal","t5_2ukxe","I'm not trying to make the West out as angels, either. Geopolitics is often quite realist and quite utilitarian, with a degree of realpolitik that often doesn't show in domestic issues. There's certainly an intertwining of corporate interests in Western foreign policy and the deep connection between capitalism and the liberal world order is distinct and problematic, but trying to paint the Ukraine situation as an issue solely with the military-industrial complex while ignoring the impact of Great Power competition on it is so ridiculous as to almost be out of touch.

Sure, there are plenty of issues with the LWO, even beyond what you said - exploitation of resources and populations in developing countries, the climate crisis, and so on - and the US and its allies have made a significant number of foreign policy mistakes in the last century, but that doesn't invalidate the idea that a rules-based global order based on access to economic participation through adherence to said rules isn't sound. It's certainly a hell of a lot better than the great power competition and nationalism of the Post Napoleonic era through the World Wars. 

And if NATO expansion were just a ploy to sell weapons in the Eastern Bloc, the sheer amount of Soviet era military equipment that was being used by even NATO countries in that area up until quite recently means we did a piss poor job of that. Hell, the Romanians are still using *MiG-fucking-21s*. 

As for the Ukraine situation, the possible choices of policy range on a spectrum from one extreme of ""Let Russia do whatever it wants"" to ""boots on the ground"". The latter is awful, but the former is also awful, and while I'd be willing to hear out an alternative like ""The US should leverage it's influence to force a negotiation and compromise"", support for Ukraine is the least bad option.

As for the issue of NATO enlargement, the US and it's allies didn't roll tanks into Warsaw, Budapest, Riga, et al and demand those countries join. That was a decision made by those countries to secure their own futures. What was NATO supposed to do, hope that the new Russian state would become a responsible neighbor and partner, and tell Poland/Lithuania/etc to pound sand and hope that the nascent Russian Federation played nice? We tried engaging the Russians and drawing them into the European community through trade, and we even turned down Georgia and Ukraine's attempt for membership at the 2008 Bucharest Summit *essentially specifically so as not to antagonize the Russians*. We even *let Putin steal territories in the Donbas and in Crimea with no significant response whatsoever* and what did that get us? 

I'm not saying the US has been perfect here, there's been plenty of mistakes. But let's not act like a group of countries that spent half a century getting brutalized by a government based in Moscow were unreasonable in expecting a new government based in Moscow, containing many of the same men, who were in the process of turning one of their own cities in Grozny into one of the most notable examples of the horrors of modern warfare, to be aggressive towards them at some point in the future.

I'm more than happy to hear out alternative solutions, either to the current crisis or in retrospect regarding the post-Soviet era of Russo-Western relations, but giving Russia a green light and pointing the finger at the West because NATO dared to welcome Eastern Europe instead of trusting Russia to be a good neighbor despite centuries of evidence to the contrary, all because you're cynical about the US arms industry, is a bit absurd.

It's not an issue of my, or anyone else, being uncomfortable with that, either. It's the this reflexive, cynical rejection of the LWO offers no solutions or alternatives, and applying that sort of policy in any official capacity would just crumble the global security order, plunge us back into a multipolar era of great power competition, and give dangerous Right Wing Nationalists exactly the sort of international system they'd prefer.

I'm not trying to stifle discussion, either. If you have an alternative to the Ukraine war, the Russia situation, or the LWO as a whole that's actually productive and constructive instead of just shitting on US foreign policy I'm happy to hear you out on it. That sort of perspective isn't common outside of Russian and Chinese propaganda mouthpieces and I'd be very, very interesting to hear what you have to say.",1672531339

But, the device takes care of the formatting.    If it sees a drive it doesn't recognize,

as soon as you open it with HD Homerun Config, your only choice is 'Format'.

You can also check the system log of the device, and it will show that the formatting

occured.  (maybe only until the next reboot).

The file are (as best I remember)

/media/HDHomerun

really-long-filename-for-episode-title

It is trivial to copy the contents to a new hard drive with linux.

I used ubuntu.   ...as xfs support is built in.   You can even use linux-live

(booted off a thumb drive)

With windows 10/11, you can install wsl2 (must be 2, not 1) and with a lot

of effort access an xfs formatted drive.

"communism","t5_2qolz","These are claims, but not arguments. The ""theory"" of social fascism has long been exposed as an anti-marxist sham, and even repudiated by some of the more nuanced Stalinists (e.g. Dimitrov), so I am surprised you give that as an example. The concept of bureaucracy has nothing  to do with marxism - anyone from marxists to fascists can easily point it out. But you can treat the matter in a marxist way by relating bureaucracy to the development of class forces. This is something that many Old Bolsheviks (you know, those who actually made October happen) elaborated on throughout their struggle for workers' democracy in the 20s, and they were all either killed or imprisoned for it. 

The argument I made is that the ""revisionism"" (if you want to use that term) happened by way of the complete replacement of cadre in the Bolshevik party, and not just at the top (where clearly all of Lenin's closest allies were removed or killed) but also throughout the rank and file, which was over 90% purged by the rising bureaucracy (this is over 100,000 people). The argument is that if you parrot old lines and fail to see that ""revision"" happened  back in the 20s, then you will more likely fail to identify bureaucracy  as it appears in other places (e.g. the CP leaders in the CIO). In other words if you don't see old bureaucracies you will create new ones. 

The concept of the ""degenerated workers' state"" is not very special either: if workers' took state power (as they did in 1917) and then a bureaucracy usurped that power from the workers, rising on the backs of famine and industrial collapse, then the workers' state can be said to have ""degenerated"". You can use a different word here if you don't like that one, but it doesn't change  the fact that the working class in 1917-1918 was literally in power, losing it perforce during the Civil War, and never regaining it. The ""factional struggle"" was not just a disagreement on policies but a struggle of working class revolutionaries to  rebuild industrial democracy rooted in the soviets, to regain what the workers had lost during the war, against a rising tide of bureaucrats (mostly ex-tsarist officials who joined the Party) who did not want workers' power for obvious reasons. That the leader of this bureaucracy was an Old Bolshevik with good credentials is something that really confuses MLs for some reason. It is no more surprising than Mussolini crossing the class line. Nationalism is very tempting when the socialist movement is on the defensive.",1672531341

 &gt;Only post and comment about celebs/pornstars or otherwise famous people. Influencers must have 100k+ subscribers.

 &gt;
 &gt;Do not share private content or involuntary porn of any kind such as voyeur, stolen, shopped or faked stuff. Candid pics of unaware people are considered creepshots.

 &gt;No private info such as real names or social media info.
 
 Admins have made it very clear to us that private stuff is not allowed on Reddit. We will moderate accordingly and permanently ban users who break this rule.

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","I have 193 Co-op games played in Vermont and average 101,030 for damage. High damage is 306,532.

You will get a LOT of games playing Vermont in Co-op where the slow ship speed and that absurd reload really hurt you but you also have games where you get to shoot some and those guns are brutal.

I run the Brisk Capt skill + a speed flag to help me get close(er) at the start and run MBM3 vs APRM2 to lower reload from 40 sec to 35.2 sec and it helps a lot.

GK does really well in Co-op full secondary build. The main guns aren't overly accurate but you get 12 of them ( I run 420's). But the secondary's are excellent and the ship is decently fast. Over 487 Co-op games in GK I average 115,536 and have a high of 318,448. Schlieffen is better then GK offensively in Co-op with the torps but it doesn't have the armor and HP GK does if you do go mid and get focused.

BB's absolutely can excel in Co-op as you say. You just need some time. Those 3-4 DD games usually kill you but the rest of the time you can do really well. 

You are screwed 99% of the time in a 3-4 DD game if you play Vermont in Co-op but if it is just 1-2 DD's and you get some time you can really wrack up the damage with those glorious guns.",1672531343

"NonCredibleDefense","t5_i41xc","To be fair, with that section I had more NATO in mind, rather than EU. In theory EU shouldn't have as many concern regarding supporting Greece under those circumstances since there's no such stipulations for Turkey.

But yeah, a lot of this things hasn't been tested so we don't know if it would hold up.

As for Greek military spending, isn't it quite high all things considered? Turkey doesn't have a much larger air force as far as I know and at least Greece is upgrading their F-16s, whereas Turkey isn't?

As for why they are siding with Turkey is because of the extortion from Turkey, he's threatening to release a ton of migrants and at that point EU in the past folded for many of the demands. Then again the euro crisis and Greek spending in the past has also aggravated the Greek / EU relationship. 

Shit can be complicated at times. Even so, if Greece were attacked I sure would hope EU and NATO would honor their commitments. Considering how much aid has been sent to Ukraine with which they had no such agreements, I sure hope the agreements would be honored.",1672531344

You no longer have to cope so hard with a 70 year old man putting in more work hours in a week and creating 500000 jobs while making tons of people wealthy because you got to the bottom of it.

Obviously your work should be valued as much as the guy who created jobs for 500000 people and made a ton of people millionaires. I mean he might have created jobs for half a million people and donated billions to charitable causes, but you scoured some dude's internet history for a great ""gotcha"" that obviously has no holes. You both bring the same value to society obviously so I'm in agreement you deserve to earn as much as him. Did you find my post about how I fucked your mom and was disgusted by her smell? I hope not, it's really embarrassing, but I know I can't hide anything from you internet wizard.

Those kinds of apps can vastly change you into basically a completely different person.  Bad teeth become straight and white, poor skin becomes smooth and glowing and even eye color, hair, wrinkles and weight can be very easily filtered.  To me that's just false advertising.  You're no longer presenting the burger at its best but creating a CGI burger that doesn't actually exist in the real world.   So that's my line in the sand.  Sure, show yourself looking and feeling your best, but when I see photos that are manipulated, I hit the next button because that's a whole bag of problems I don't want to stick my hand into.",1672531346

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","Point to the exact line i defended genocide. Thats an enormous accusation. 

I havent robbed any agency by describing the conditions zimbabweans started with and were forced and continue to be forced to endure. Thats like saying its denying agency to jewish people to state the holocaust happened.

I have stated that people who blanketly compare botswana to zimbabwe not only are comparing 2 countries with vastly unsimilar demographics. But extensively different histories, and there is an immense amount of hate made by white westerners to zimbabwe because it actually got rid of its colonizer class, no different than Haiti or Algeria. That tendency likes to misrepresent all of Zimbabwes problems as just mugabe and co completely destroyed their country because they wanted to. To hid the numerous atrocities and plagues of colonialism that are still causing problems. Mugabe and co certainly did cause enormous amounts of harm, Mugabe specifically being a sellout and turning into an ugly character. I have stated both constantly throughout my comments.

Revolutions always cause turmoil, theres rarely many Revolutions that doesnt cause immense trouble for the restructuring of society...thats like practically a defining feature. Haiti, weimar, france, portugal, russia, indonesia, serbia. Theres numerous examples. 

You keep going on about how the ANC or Zimbabwe is just as corrupt and just as racist as before which is absolutely nonsense if you think about it for more than 2 seconds. Once again I agree with you, the ANC are corrupt sellouts  i however feel they didnt go remotely even close to far to solve apartheids problems because they still kept the underline system in place minus the bantustans and segregation. Capitalism and its unique racial history are still present in South Africa and Zimbabwe.

If you are arguing that the ANC is racist because it fails to solve the plight of Black South Africans i would agree, but to act like the milquetoast slap on the wrist the white abusers has been given is racism is laughable. For fucks sake Botha didnt even get shot. There were plenty of white people in both SA and Zimbabwe who were against the regime, many even joined MK. Coincidentally they arent targeted or hated (with unfortunate exceptions as with any society dealing with racial conflict). The colonizer class isnt at fault for apartheid because theyre white, they are at fault because they are colonizers. I am white. The Arab and Ottoman colonizers of Zanzibar and North Africa are also colonizers. 

Why do you keep talking to me like the problems in Zimbabwe of South Africa are my personal choices??? Lmao im not from either country. In fact i havent stated much in these comments except for large amounts of material and social history, i rarely dive into my personaloral feelings. If that were the case you would know i feel despite what good things ANC or ZANU did they will ultimately continue on this path because there has been no organizational or material change. If my moral opinions were shown there would be a lot more prison sentences and executions for people like Botha and Smith. 

Im going to Reiterate the my thesis again loud and clear. There are many problems wrong with these countries, many of them their own choices. Denying their extremely recent colonial history and their ongoing factors they have no control of is denying the legacy of apartheid.",1672531347

Which is why if you offer full payment on initial debt, you can negotiate that shit away, but you'd have to bring it up.

You're trying the run around approach which is another way around this.

Just be sure to get in writing from the leasing company that after the payment you owe nothing else after it, including fines, late fees, or anything else via them or a 3rd party.

They may be resistant because even if you pay them, that agency still gets their cut, and the fines and stuff usually offsets that.",1672531347

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Oh yes. 

I've seen a lot of the driving issues in the comments, kind of same here. Except my parents wanted me to have a job so they were fine with me getting a license. But they wanted me to know I was still under their control. The day I started driver's ed, my mother had us there early, and while we were sitting on a bench outside a local high school waiting for the instructor, she threatened my life if I ever ""acted out"" again (this was on the tail end of being imprisoned in my house for 4 months because my mental health was so bad I was self-harming, one of my teachers found out and the school psychologist reached out.) That didn't specifically pertain to driving but I don't remember her specifically threatening my life any other time.

There were a bunch of rules around ""my"" car. Insurance and gas were paid for by them, which I can't complain about but it was really just another reason to control everywhere I went. I offered to pay for unsanctioned trips but they wouldn't hear it. I couldn't call it ""my"" car, because it was their car. I was the only one who drove it, so calling it mine was less about ownership and more about responsibility (but not to them apparently). I was allowed to eat in it, but after I accidentally left a small chocolate smudge on the seat (caused no damage) I was not allowed. Four months later, I was on a medication that I had to take at specific intervals and had to take with food, so I had to drive to McDonald's and pick up food that had to be eaten in the car. The following morning a singular fry was found in the seat and I lost the car for a couple weeks. There's a lot more there but you get the picture.

As mentioned above, I was imprisoned at home for several months just after I turned 15. An old friend had passed away unexpectedly and it was the last straw for me mentally. I started self-harming, and eventually told a teacher who told the school counselor who then called my parents. There's a lot of background here, but the counselor wanted to start seeing me and my parents wouldn't allow it. I quote, ""You shouldn't be talking to anyone if you have problems with your family."" I hadn't said anything about family problems. I cited my friend's passing as the only reason I wanted to go and was told I shouldn't feel that way because we were never very close. In the following months, I was abused in many different ways, I suppose to teach me a lesson about self-harming and asking for help. I never let them see it after that, that's for sure. And shockingly, that was not a good solution for my mental health. Go figure. 

The clothes! I never realized that was such a common experience. NMom insisted on buying most of my clothes because it meant she controlled what I wore. I genuinely didn't understand that style could be a form of self-expression until I was 17. It blew my mind. I wasn't allowed to wear ""skinny"" jeans (read: anything fitted below the knee) until I turned 18. Tank tops were frowned upon but grudgingly allowed in some circumstances. Nothing remotely low cut or fitted at all. No leggings unless covered by a knee-length or longer dress or skirt. My mother would only buy me pants that were two sizes too big. Anything that actually fit was me trying to get attention. How did they justify? I was taller than most girls and had curves. That's it. Was such a shock after I moved out that I realized that I could wear clothes I liked that actually fit my body. Even more shocking was that clothes were supposed to fit. 

There's lots of little things. Once my brother threatened to call CPS. NMom said they'd never believe us over her. I believed that, and I still know it was true. They were too covert to be seen by law enforcement. Past that, she never acknowledged that anything she did was abusive. 

Food was so heavily controlled I'm surprised I managed to survive 18 years with them. Especially in my teen years most food in the house was low or no carb because of their diets, but they didn't want me eating their keto food so my options were very limited. Lots of Goldfish, applesauce, and sandwiches. I was very lucky if I could pack a school lunch that I actually wanted to eat. Parents had no idea what kinds of food I liked/disliked and I had almost no variety growing up. Quantity was heavily controlled too. About three weeks before I moved I was eating a singular pancake for dinner. First thing I'd had that day. This was in the thick of my eating disorder. My father walked in and said ""Are you sure you should be eating that much?"" ...yeah.

Phone was taken away frequently and constantly monitored. Couldn't use after 8:30-9PM depending how my parents were feeling that day. They had a VPN installed so they could see everything I was doing and would have periodic phone raids to make sure I wasn't doing anything I shouldn't be doing (like talking to friends about how hard it was living there or documenting any of the abuse). Made me really good at hiding things.

if her family was told by someone from Disney that she self termed then it‚Äôs true that ‚Äúthey‚Äù said that but if she‚Äôs been there since January 2022 it makes no sense for her to self term when her program was about to be up anyway in January 2023, programs are a year maximum. 

Winter Garden is considered to be greater Orlando and that‚Äôs why OPD would possibly be involved. 

Her family may have said something but could‚Äôve possibly been silenced, or it‚Äôs very possible that she got caught up in her work schedule during the holiday season so they assumed it was that, CPs have been working 11-12hr shifts lately on top of 6-7 days considering we are short staffed‚Ä¶ they have also been deployed to different areas (hence why she may be in a different costume). CPs also have the opportunity to switch locations halfway through their program, they can also pick up shifts at other locations (other possible reasons for costume changes).

I didn't have to focus at all to know the content and was always top of my class.

I had a new hobby or interest every week.

As soon as I had to take responsibility for my own learning it was a nightmare and my grades rapidly fell. University was so bad, I barely made it through.

As an adult, even now thankfully medicated (which i wish i had as a kid), life is hard. I am very fortunate that my current job is fairly ADHD friendly (as well as ASD friendly) and pays pretty well. There have still been unfortunate incidents where I have not done stuff on time or stuffed up social situations or misplaced things. Luckily they let it slide I'm the scheme of things as I'm really good at my job. 

 I had a previous job that I ""stopped getting shifts for"" because I'd be bored and undisciplined and staring into space. But even now, I misplace things everyday, can't stay on top of house chores, have trouble regulating my interests (also related to asd), constantly interrupt others in conversation, lose money because I don't pay enough attention to due dates or sales, miss appointments, etc. It sucks and is most definitely a disability.

It's the sort of description that someone who specializes in ditch-digging could say about the code, as long as they're capable of reading, and making a set of guesses.

What your error is is that you have no technical aptitude whatsoever, you're not even slightly a coder, and so you have no standpoint from which to realistically judge the quality of the output that ChatGPT is giving you. Sorry not-sorry to be so blunt about it, but while you want think think you know everything about anything, you really just don't. You should stick to what you're good at, and leave coding-related concepts to the people who are actually any good at it.

You're amazed by the response that ChatGPT gives, because quite frankly, you don't even know enough about coding to be in a position of analyzing whether it's correct or not. For the portions where it's correct, you can't tell me or anyone else why it's correct, you just have a feeling that it is. Again: You're not a coder, and please stop pretending to be one. Just stick to the areas where you actually do have some level of skills. If you want to really delve deeper into something, then start out with the standpoint that you know nothing, and don't trust some random chat bot to fool you otherwise just because you want to believe it to be true.",1672531349

1) Loaded question, I don‚Äôt think those ‚Äútaint‚Äù what I‚Äôm going for at all. I‚Äôm a socialist because I believe in economic democracy and Marx was a very influential socialist theorist. Wheat and chaff.

&gt;‚ÄúI have no interest in real girls!‚Äù So claims Okumura, the president of the school‚Äôs manga club. He‚Äôs your typical otaku, obsessed with a sexy (fictional) 2D manga character known as Lilliel. Then the new school year starts, and a (real!) 3D girl named Lilysa whose passion is cosplay joins the club. Lilysa convinces Okumura to become her photographer‚Äìand guess who her favorite manga character is? Not only that, but Lilysa is into modeling the fetishy stuff! The boundaries between 2D and 3D start to blur as this hot-blooded romantic comedy unfolds.

As far as the SSD goes, is it connecting at USB4, or USB3.2 20Gb? I see you say &gt;20Gb/s but idk how much higher and for how long. Copy dialogs could always be reporting a bit wonky so if it's not dramatically higher than 20Gb I'd say there's still a chance it's connecting at USB 3.2 20Gb right?  

I've thankfully got DP1.4 working on my TB3 dock, although I couldn't speak to the TB branching. I'm unfamiliar with that feature.  

As far as my comment regarding TB3 vs. TB4, I was essentially asking if - beyond the thermal issues - if you got better results and/or features with the TB4 dock despite the TB3 cable in the middle. But rayddit519 seems to have disputed it a bit.  
If it were notably better, I wouldn't mind upping to a TB4 dock.

"Hypothyroidism","t5_2s0tv","Yes count calories, but also make sure you aren‚Äôt eating foods that you may be intolerant to. Gluten is a heavy trigger for me, if I eat gluten I‚Äôll easily balloon up 5-7lbs in water weight and lose it within 3 days after not consuming gluten / foods high in sodium. 

Someone else commented about insulin resistance which is something to look into but I don‚Äôt know much about. For me looking at my diet and cutting out gluten / making sure to cook nightshades , or foods that made me hold on to inflammation helped. 

Getting your dose correct can be a pain. I am currently on 112mcg of Synthroid, recently was 88mcg, and im slowly trying to get my TSH under 2. My recent lab was 13.2 because I slacked off and took my medication in the morning and ate too close after, had caffeine too close after, and probably didn‚Äôt wait long enough (4 hours or longer) to take my supplements which contain Iron and other things that could inhibit the uptake of the medication. If this sounds like you, be wary lots of things can inhibit the uptake of your medication leading you to gain weight.

I use an app called Lose It! Which helps me track my approximate calories which has helped alot. I love the function on there being able to scan barcodes on the packages and helps me track approximately how many calories im taking in. While its not perfect it helps keep me within the range I need to. 

Lastly look at any vitamin deficiencies as they often pair with Hypo. For me getting my VitB and D under control helped me lose weight. I went from 200lbs and currently I am plateaued at 160lbs trying to get down to about 150. This was all done with moderate to no exercise (my jobs have me walk alot but i work part time), calorie tracking, being on the right dose, and getting vitamins in check. The weight loss took about 1 year. It takes time, give yourself patience.",1672531354

"babylon5","t5_2rhrd","JMS described his illness in his book more in detail, although not naming the diagnosis. His symptoms were paranoid delusions and hallucinations, looking for coded messages to himself in the script, newspapers and on TV; his speech turned into nonsense rambling and he admitted to ""hearing voices telling him things about people"". The symptoms are typical for paranoid schizophrenia. However, the diagnosis is only schizophrenia if there's no other underlying other illness. But in his case, JMS said in the Phoenix video that ""he had physical issues, which led to psychological issues""; and his minder lady Sandra Bruckner wrote in a FB comment that he had a physical disorder that caused a mental illness. It was not disclosed what illness that was, but there are many which may lead to psychotic disorders in some unfortunate cases. There was a comment on Usenet around 2000, so well before the reveal at Phoenix, which stated that O'Hare has been suffering from ""clinical paranoia""  for a very long time, which unfortunately influenced his career several times as he was sometimes violent when not well and his condition sometimes required heavy medication, which led to rumours of drug use, but that was not true. He was flying in and out of LA and often took his stepson with, probably to keep an eye on...? He just separated from his long-term GF, the boy's mum, at the time the pilot movie was made and possibly a pair of supervising eyes was gone with that.
Jerry Doyle made several unflattering comments about him on his radio show, there's another usenet entry from 2010 citing him, describing the symptoms of search8ng for messages in the script, it's impossible he did not know it was mental illness. He also usually did NOT always give names to the stories on his show but people just assumed he was talking about O'Hare. Now that Jason Carter's brain injury and his behavioural and personal difficulties were made public, it raises the question whether Doyle was taking the mickie on both of them, as Jason also had disagreements with Jerry.",1672531355

Yeah it makes sense that the sample size is small.

Emergency doctor here, used to box in university but stopped due to concerns re: brain health.

This is one of those ‚Äúhow long is a piece of string?‚Äù questions.  Heavy bag and mitt work is generally OK but ‚Äúnormal sparring‚Äù varies massively from trainer to trainer, gym to gym.  Some places are still doing old school hard sparring that‚Äôs basically full power.  

We know getting punched in the head is not good for you.  The more frequently, harder and more regularly you get punched, the worse it is.  The consequences for most people are concussion and post concussion syndrome.  Long term there is a risk of CTE which is irreversible.  Certain conditions are associated with greater likelihood of post concussion syndrome - migraines and seizure disorders being the most common.  

For most people the risk of dropping dead during light sparring is rare but a large arachnoid cyst like you describe can rupture with relatively minor trauma and the consequences are life threatening.  I‚Äôm not a neurosurgeon so I can‚Äôt tell you how likely that is but if I were in your position I wouldn‚Äôt roll the dice, so to speak.",1672531358

I'm not saying I'm better than you...  I just want to do something differently than you did... I do NOT get it. 
I planned to go unmedicated with my first and got this every. Single. Time I told another mum my plan. All of them had chosen to get an epidural. I laboured unmedicated for 15 hours before my cervix started swelling closed and I needed to be transferred to hospital to have an epidural placed. When those people found out how my labour had gone down, it was like they were happy I didn't get what I wanted. So confusing to me. It was a very ""told ya so"" attitude, that was super hurtful. 
I will say that labour and delivery was infinitely easier post-epidural, and I understand entirely why some mums choose this route from the start. 
I plan to try for an unmedicated labour and delivery this time as well, and the comments are only worse this time around because I ""couldn't do it last time"", so why would I expect to be able to this time?  Hard eye roll. It's definitely frustrating. 
I can even tell my partner wishes I would get the epidural from the start this time - because it was so much less stressful for him after the epidural was placed (understandably - I was no longer screaming like a demon, and he didn't feel so helpless). But still. So frustrating.",1672531358

"centuryhomes","t5_2sq4s","Definitely subfloor, looks like maybe fir. 

Fir is pretty and old fir is harder than new fir, but still pretty soft. If you're super careful with it you might get 5-10 years of wear out of refinishing it before it starts to look rough, but be aware that it will scratch and gauge fairly easily, and may ultimately start splintering. 

Flippers will refinish this and call it hardwood floors all day long because it's the cheapest way for them to get a superficially nice-looking floor and flip the house. If you're going to stay in the house for a while, I would just be aware that refinishing it is a stopgap solution, and it will need a proper topfloor eventually, whether it's you or the next owner. Go easy when sanding, as it's easy to go too deep and expose the tongue.

If it was me, I would look around for good prices on proper unfinished tongue &amp; groove hardwood, put that down over it, and give it the stain and finish you want. It will be a little more money up front and maybe a little more work, but it will give you a lifetime floor, not a ""good enough for now"" floor.",1672531358

NT people seem like they stack up memories to hold onto because they do not have anxiety or worry based issues causing them to constantly question their position in society. If they have always done one thing and never seen a potential negative in it, then they likely never will unless someone like us shows up to make them aware of that fact. They seem to get upset because we tend to be a bit better at that side of things, thus why we are so ""inflexible"" regarding our moral integrity. We don't need as many or typically as stark of ""learning moments"" to teach us how to feel empathy and compassion like they do because we typically pick that up one time and build our future logic based on that. (Whether concrete logic or metaphorical logic)

So far we have been treated like NT is the bar, and we are ND because we diverge from that bar distinctly. But it's more like NT represent a kind of static homogenous group and we're all the colors popping out of it. We don't know what colors we are yet because we've been too busy trying not to be victimized that we haven't realized we can all be infinitely unique colors of our own and still exist in a balance or harmony--all we know currently is we are not this same ""color"" we have been told everyone else is for our whole lives. Even the term ND or ASD or ADHD leaves us thinking we're supposed to be carbon copies of one another, when in truth it just means we share commonalities that for some reason aren't really seen in NT society.",1672531359

Hello, I am CF10, C17, Cf28 and Cm8, and you may be wondering what that means. Here is the answer for your question, Many of my mates at the refuge Sara Morocco where we are do not have names with 900 dogs, and 180+ cats we had to develop a system, so in order to keep track of every rescue , SARA began assigning each of them codes,  until they find a name either through Reddit ( which has always been a great support) or those that wish to follow our progress or if they are really lucky they are named by those who want to give one of these pups their forever home

CF10 is a code. The letter C represents the current sanctuary they reside in( we have 3 in total) , these pups are staying at the Clebs shelter, and the letter F or M represents the gender.

With over 900 street rescues we do try to give every dog the name that they deserve. Most of our rescues come to us with a terrible start in life, and they are more than just a number. But as you can imagine, we do run out of inspiration and we have to have a system to know which dogs need, medical care, rehabilitation, neutering and when possible adoption

I had this happen to me years ago when I was driving my brother's Hyundai sedan to a bar in Saskatoon.  The doors also unlocked automatically once you stopped and put it into park, and some guy got into the car.  Now, this was long before Uber was a thing, and the guy knew he got into a random car, but he thought he could convince me to drive him home.  It took a fair amount of talking and convincing, but he finally gave up and got out.  After that incident, I disable the automatic unlock feature on any vehicle I own that has it.

The Turkish yakamoz is specifically the reflection of the moon on water, but can be used to describe any kind of light reflecting on water, or even the sparkle of fish.

Kawaakari (Japanese) is the ‚Äúglow of a river in the darkness, surface of a river gleaming in the darkness, gleam on a river at dusk‚Äù.

Not water, but
‚ÄúAlpenglow (German: Alpengl√ºhen, lit.‚Äâ'Alps glow'; Italian: enrosadira) is an optical phenomenon that appears as a horizontal reddish glow near the horizon opposite to the Sun when the solar disk is just below the horizon. Strictly speaking, Alpenglow refers to indirect sunlight reflected or diffracted by the atmosphere after sunset or before sunrise. This diffuse illumination creates soft shadows in addition to the reddish color. The term is also used informally to include direct illumination by the reddish light of the rising or setting sun, with sharply defined shadows.‚Äù



If you prefer an adjective, there‚Äôs ‚Äúlambent‚Äù‚Äî‚Äú(of light or fire) glowing, gleaming, or flickering with a soft radiance.‚Äù",1672531360

So that entire part of your argument is non-sequitur, because a mask will capture some of the aerosolized components you vape out, while it won't capture others. So unless you have tested whether what is being released through a mask is the aldehydes, free nicotine, aerosolized glycerol, or allyl alchohol, and what is captured is something else, you really have no argument in that regard.",1672531361

I did however use minox for over a year on my face to help with beard growth and saw minimal sides. If you are as healthy as you claim the typical minox sides should be very manageable. The derma rolling will increase the effectiveness of minox, which is why I suggest going minox first to see if you get sides.

I'm also planning on getting an HT and will be booking it for NOV. I bought a nice derma pen and will derma pen only until then and see if I get any results, maybe if you reach out in 3 or 4 months I can let you know if it did anything. Also you should use a bit more punctuation üòÖ",1672531362

I'm only 8 weeks with this one, and while I don't want an abortion I still hate being pregnant.

also the headly grange stairwell was basically a huge room with a lot of nice sounding wood and tile in it, like most other live rooms. if you have access to a big live room, by all means use it, but trying to use a small concrete apartment stairwell or something is gonna sound much more reverberant in a way that will box you in to a very specific sound that may not be applicable for the music you want to make. you're not gonna sound like john bonham that's for sure",1672531362

Was not trying to fat shame Tuna at all in my earlier post‚Ä¶Women have had to deal with that crap since the dawn of time and I even prefaced my post by emphasizing that she looks perfectly fine. I was simply bringing up the very topic that she brings up all the time.  She acts like she loves herself and we should all love ourselves too no matter what shape we are‚Ä¶ positive messaging that I believe in.  And then YET she tries to filter and post herself to look the skinniest as possible. A long history of doing this.  It‚Äôs fucked up. 

But the second you try to say anything about this on this sub people go up in arms because (understandably) they might have hangups about their own bodies.  It becomes a bit of a pile on and there‚Äôs no point in responding because it becomes sort of like mob mentality so I just block one by one.  They are also the types to become self-righteous and start raging without really considering where a person is coming from. Part of the stems from the toxic cancel culture we‚Äôre living in. I don‚Äôt even try to explain my viewpoint to people, I just block them because they have their own issues but want to make you the bad person for making them feel a certain way about themselves.

"AskScienceDiscussion","t5_2vlah","All vehicles that leave Earth fly horizontally for most of their propulsive flight because that's more efficient than flying straight up.

If we ignore the atmosphere and if a vehicle could accelerate instantaneously then it wouldn't make a difference - you just need to reach 11 km/s no matter what direction (as long as it's not into the ground). With a realistic propulsion (10+ minutes to reach 11 km/s) flying upwards means a significant part of your thrust is just fighting gravity. You want to fly horizontally as much as possible to minimize gravity losses. You can't launch horizontally because of the atmosphere, of course, but once rockets are through the denser parts of that they go to a largely horizontal flight profile.

An example of a recent mission getting very close to escape velocity (going to the Moon): [Hakuto-R with telemetry](https://youtu.be/UaaF0IgzGSI?t=1045). It's at 124 km when it reaches a velocity of 2 km/s, and 180 km when it reaches 7.4 km/s (initial orbital velocity) a few minutes later. It then coasts for half an hour before accelerating to 10.4 km/s at an altitude of 330 km, leaving low Earth orbit to go to the Moon.",1672531362

It's not his fault he was raised in a patriarchal society, that his father is a misogynistic piece of shit, that all of these factors give him blind spots when it comes to sharing the load at home - none of this disqualifies him from being a feminist, but the fact that he is aware of his shortcomings and is always working on becoming a better ally does, in fact, qualify him as a true feminist. Just like the fact that I was raised in a conservative misogynist culture which taught me to always prioritizes other people's well-being over my own doesn't make me any less of a feminist. These things all are just signs that my husband and I are flawed human beings who are products of the environments we were raised in. Being a feminist doesn't mean you have to be perfect. This is a bad faith take that is unnecessarily exclusionary and is actually counterproductive to a movement that is trying to promote equality for all.

Price has been determined by demand and perceived value, even when games were regularly under $5, games like Bucky were $10 because they were fun and uncommon. Darkwing Duck played into the same fate. Then youtube collectors started calling these games gems and the prices boomed. Is Buckys a rare game like Flinstones, absolutely not, but it tends to be an uncommon game in stores. As for how you determine rarity, unless you take every game into account on eBay, by way of how often its purchased and how often its listed and compare those directly to one another i.e. compare Bucky to Darkwing to Sampson to Mario/DuckHunt...ebay seems like a poor choice to determine rarity. There are plenty of people who have researched distribution and compiled list of rare games, but if you're choosing to do it anecdotally, to me, ebay seems like a poor choice.",1672531365

"DarkTide","t5_2t7ck","as someone said :

&gt;As to your edit (everything from ""I think the steam rating"" and below), I'll respond directly in a substantive manner, because I thoroughly disagree:

Fatshark has feedback threads on this subreddit and on its official forum. It also has player metric data for both engagement, gameplay duration, and purchasing trends. Steam rating brigades are doing *absolutely nothing* to inform Fatshark of something it didn't already know from these forum locations. What it *is* going to do, because this is *literally always what happens* when a game's rating is suppressed, is scare away any potential purchasers/casual players, who will never again look back at the game once its release window is passed and it dwindles from the zeitgeist discussion. There's no better and more salient metric of this than *Vermintide 2*. You know what *didn't* increase Vermintide 2's playerbase in any meaningful way? Gameplay improvements that came months after a caustic release. You know what *did* increase Vermintide 2's playerbase to the highest it had ever been by a country mile? Prerelease hype from Darktide in the month of November. Darktide was all people were talking about, and it wasn't out yet, and Vermintide was now available for a limited time, and the player count *skyrocketed*. Not because the system was better than at release, not because the Steam ratings were higher after release, but because word of mouth carried the game onto players' computers. Those same players will never again look at Darktide after this puerile ragefit about some utterly inconsequential 10 buck cosmetics and a marginally delayed full crafting system release.

Never again.

The community that claims to ""want the game to succeed more than anything"" is literally killing it, full stop. It is curtailing any sort of word of mouth momentum on other gaming forums because people unfamiliar with the game only see ""48% rated"" and decide not to play it at all. By the time Fatshark is able to implement the systems that it *already told us were coming* and *explained why they were delayed*, this window will have closed. I've already had multiple people in my friend circle who were going to possibly play the game with me and have decided against downloading it not because of perceived problems with whatever is actually in the game but because ""Steam says it has bad ratings, I'm not interested anymore."" Any alteration to those ratings three months down the line will do absolutely nothing for sales or player count. New content *might* bring back retired players, but not new ones.

The purpose of game criticism in a live service game is to have the developers see it and respond to it. They *have* seen it, and they've been actively responding to this criticism in their dev posts. Whatever pressure they would have to change something would come very obviously from internal and external metrics of player count. Steam ratings are not for them. Steam ratings are for other consumers, and those consumers do *not* sit down and read through a thousand writeups detailing that a bad review is actually ""this is a great game but I'm angry that the shop is an hourly reset, and despite the good gameplay loop I will make this bad rating as part of a bandwagon effect to make the game look bad to new players but no worries I'll change it four months later if I remember."" They see numbers, make snap judgments, and then move along.

The people most responsible for the low playerbase and minimal discussion in non-specialist forums and inactivity in GamePass are the *players themselves* who are cutting off reinforcements with overblown bullshit about pReDATorY CosMETiCs, et al. They are entitled to do that. I think they are assholes for doing it, but they're entitled to it, and Fatshark as a company should have been aware that they would incur backlash because their consumer base contains a large number of socially maladjusted mid-20s men with persecution complexes. But don't walk around with this self-righteous bullshit of ""I'm trying to help the game!"" to make yourself feel better. Even if you do think that, the actual practical effect of your behavior, and the behavior of others in your mindset, is to doom this game to a small playerbase and insufficient funding for future content. If you wanted this game to succeed and also wanted to see changes, you would post your comments in the clearly identified ""please give us your comments here so that we can make changes"" venues, withhold any personal spending on mtxes, and if you don't like the game, don't play it. They'll see all of that and determine whether it's worth it to bring you, and others like you, back to the game with whatever changes you've proposed. The current tactic of sabotaging the Steam rating as a protest maneuver hurts you, hurts me, hurts the playerbase at large, and does so with no appreciable benefit and very obvious long-term consequences.

Edit: Side-note, for posterity. I've played gacha games. I *presently play* gacha games. There isn't a goddamn thing in this game that even *begins* to approach ""predatory,"" and the fact that people on this subreddit keep throwing that word around completely obfuscates its actual meaning. Full character skins are, like, 12 dollars. That's about how much full character skins have cost in other video games with mtx cosmetics for going on 15 years now. There are no p2w elements, the devs have explicitly stated that there won't be, there are no other limiters held behind a wallet, no BIG SALE boxes that pop up every time you make a minor bit of progression, no $99 dollar packs, no wallet-based PvP, nothing. *The Warhammer 40k tabletop game* is more predatory than this video game. A *single box of troops* costs more than this entire game does. You wanna see a predatory mobile game? Go download AFK Arena. Its whales spend several hundred thousand dollars a piece to achieve ""full power."" You get a fully functional game for 40 dollars, and if you feel like it you can get some extra cosmetics for the cost of a single Five Guys burger. 

What this game has is a fairly standardized ""baseline game with a secondary monetization feature of fluff cosmetics"" system that every other game since 2010 uses because the cost of the game itself is *cheaper* than *NES games* in *1990*. Inelastic consumer expectations have led to game prices freezing in the same place they were in the early 90s, while cost to produce such games has *drastically* risen, making it impossible to finance a game unless 1. you sign onto an exclusive platform agreement for subsidies; 2. you incorporate mtxes to get residual income from whales; or 3. you are an indie developer who releases a ""retro"" 2D pixel art game and has three people total working on it. Games like Darktide *cannot exist in the current market* without mtxes. Flat out. If you want Darktide, and want it without any mtx, then you need to pay the actual sticker price for what a game like this *should* cost accounting for inflation and computational power increases, which according to various sources is somewhere in the ballpark of $300.

You want to spend 300 bucks on Darktide? No? Then enjoy being subsidized by people who are willing to spend some extra money on cosmetics. That's the rub. Game development is a business like any other, and game studios/investors determined a decade ago that they have to lean into mtx shops if they want to keep selling games for under 60 bucks and still make enough money to pay their employees.",1672531365

There's a small exodus of people moving mostly to the Midwest, where housing is cheaper, and towns are not so crowded.  Now those  locals are going to complain about Oregonians destroying their piece of the pie.  A lot of the housing that is being complained about are the multi-story apartment buildings in the center of town.  Those buildings have much less impact on the things we love about Oregon, the wild parts.  I do think it is a basic human right to have housing.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u","&gt; do you think people would be happier in a world where people are averse to torture or would they be happier in a world where most people are pro torture?

Whence a generalization to ""most people""? I thought desirism wasn't saying things in general? People are happiest in a world where Nazis like to torture and torturees like to be tortured (compared to the alternative).  We can go check their brain states and see this, empirically. They don't have any false beliefs.

&gt; This is by the way the exact same response that utilitarians would give to your scenario.

It's another reason why utilitarians are *wrong*. Desirism just has an extra difficulty, because it tries to hold to a weird claim that there are *no* other reasons to action, which kills any sort of generalized reasoning.

&gt; The golden rule would instead be something like ""do things that people who have desires that would generally tend to fulfill other people's desires would do --- and --- don't do things that people with desires that would tend to frustrate other people's desires would do do"".

Is this a desire? ...because we have a dilemma for that... If it is a desire, then it doesn't have any generalized normative force; it's simply an empirical matter to check if individual brain states happen to contain it; if it's not a desire, then it's not actually a reason for any action.",1672531368

And the PBO told us in February 2020 CPP is ""not sustainable"", while in March 2021 they upgraded it to ""sustainable"" - but just barely, as per the methodology used.  

Instead of listening to Liberal propaganda, I'd suggest you actually look at the facts.  CPP isn't some sort of slush fund just brimming to the top with excess funding; it is chugging along but any significant deviation from their assumptions (i.e. sustained downturn in assets) would quickly deem CPP to be not sustainable - *especially* when you consider the enhanced CPP now coming into play (i.e. higher obligations).

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","&gt; This is simply not correct. Amazon, our current shining beacon of Capitalism, steals wages from their workers, steals their time, refuses to give them breaks, and indirectly forces people to degrade themselves by pissing in bottles. ""A small portion of how the workforce spends their time"" is nonsense,

This is mostly just propaganda imo. Source: I have two friends I used to work with who started out at an Amazon warehouse. They were children of Mexican immigrants, did not go to college and worked in a warehouse together in California. They used Amazon's internal DBA classes and eventually ended up at the HQ in Seattle. I have also worked in the Amazon warehouse for a week (mandatory for new employees a few years back). It is challenging work of course, and 100s of thousands of people work there, there are obviously going to be bad examples and we have legal pathways to deal with such cases on a case by case basis. If you don't like working there just leave. There are other opportunities.  Also if you are working so much in a job you don't love, something needs to change in your life, you need to either upskill or reduce unsustainable consumption habits. And in any case, just sue the companies that you feel are violation labor laws. If you just don't like a company, just leave and find a different employer. 

&gt; This system is not ""fairer"", it is unfair.
I disagree, it is as fair as it can ever get. In what other world can a POC such as myself dream of creating as much value as white people in the West possess. 


&gt; We're speaking because publicly-funded research into the internet happened. Then it was privatized. We'd be speaking on another platform if reddit didn't exist. There would just be more of them, and they'd be less centralized. A fundamental difference I feel I'm detecting is that you don't think anything would happen without a profit incentive on large scales.

There is most definitely room for public investment in a Capitalist economy. It is arguably one of the cornerstones of it. It is a necessary stimulus where the state can fund very long term bets that is just too risky for private ventures to take on. Public funding exists in a beautiful synergy with private enterprise. I don't see this as an indictment of capitalism which literally just means that people who are good at allocating resources get more resources to allocate. 

&gt;  Indigenous communities have been living this way for thousands of years. None of this is done out of ""charity,"" which I find ineffective. 

Which indigenous community? lol. Everyone is indigenous somewhere. Yes of course hunter gatherers and such small communities had such a structure without the concept of money but they were still lacking the immense benefits of agglomeration that such a system affords. Prime examples are infant mortality, rule of patriarchy, diseases etc. Also most ""indigenous"" communities wiped each other out constantly. Going back to a state of nature is not a solution. It is easy to speak for it in our cushy air conditioned spaces today while none of us will willingly go back. Also no one is stopping you from going into it. 


&gt; It is mutual support. I'll build you a house if you give me heart surgery, that sort of thing. 
THIS is literally a capital market. I build a house for you, I get 10 points of which I can redeem 5 points for food and 5 points at Chuck-E-Cheese or whatever. 


&gt; Are you a capitalist as in, ""I believe in Capitalism,"" or are you a capitalist as in ""I'm an owner and I have employees""? What country do you come from, if you don't mind me asking?

I am a Capitalist as in ""It liberated me and my own from poverty, it enabled me to have dreams, and it enables me to compete fairly with the white man on equal terms in creating market value"". I am a south Asian. 


&gt;Then, have a navigator? That work is not more valuable.  


But it is. Only a person with a vision can lead. We would have been riding horses still were it not for Ford and probably any other leader. We are only disagreeing on the way the leader is elected.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","The detransition numbers are indeed overinflated by conservative media and transphobes. Off the top of my head, if I remember right, something like 1-2% of the population is trans in some way or another, and not all of that 1-2% actually medically transition. Of those who do transition, only about 1-2% detransition, and of that tiny fraction who detransition, the vast majority do so because of external pressure (family rejecting them, transphobia, etc.) and not because they realized they‚Äôre not trans. Most people who detransition eventually end up beginning transition again. 

Running those numbers, with the most generous estimates: 2% are trans and we‚Äôll assume all of them transition, and 2% of them detransition, and 5% of detransitioners do so for genuine internal reasons. 0.02 x 0.02 x 0.05 = 0.00002, or 0.002% of the entire population, just two-thousandths of one percent. In the US with a total population of 330,000,000, that‚Äôs just 6,600 people in the entire country, and that‚Äôs with the most generous assumptions and estimates. In comparison, there are statistically about 3.3 million trans people in the US. 

So basically, actual detransition is extremely, almost impossibly rare. It does happen though, and luckily most of the medical care and mental health resources that are available for transition also help with the detransition process for them.

So if your feelings change great gimme a call maybe we can try again, if not then I ask you dont contact me anymore and respect my wishes so I can reroute my energy toward finding her.‚Äù  



End‚Ä¶goodbye. If she contacts you with any bullshit just do not reply. Only reply if she says ‚Äúok lets try again.‚Äù 
(But i dont know why you would want to, she sounds awful.) 



  Right now she has zero respect for you. She wants to drag you along to suck off your attention and give her an ego boost that she can keep you around (in case it doesnt work out with another guy.) You arent number 1 on her list‚Ä¶.why do you have no respect for yourself? 
   
It hurts doing no contact, I know‚Ä¶I amazingly pulled it off. I thought I was literally losing my mind at points. Like crying, punching the wall, punching myself‚Ä¶.but i never contacted her.
  

  Guess what, she came back!!! No contact is incredibly strong and attractive.  But the problem is by the time they come back, you are already over them‚Ä¶that was my case.



 So simple answer:  ‚Äúhey you are an ex!! If you arent interested in exploring romance then dont contact me anymore.‚Äù  
  

If she texts you back with any bullshit IGNORE!! Be strong, let her feel how serious you are with your silence..

It's just that both the West and Russia fed the myth that Russia is a superpower. For the Westerners, it kept the fear of an external bogeyman alive (a great distraction from domestic problems).

"Cosmere","t5_2t7vi","Also, why always in half? Shardblades are long -- I get it. But why always the spine? And even without atium, dodging Blade is supposed to be pretty much possible with the reflexes of pewter Burning, as they are similar in effect with Lights. Remember: Thugs are basically Radiants without Surges and the healing: pewter provides endurance, reaction speed, strength, very minor healing, temperature resistances, and wakefulness. It also gives a great sense of balance, which is by far the only thing seemingly abscent among the effecfs of Stormlight. So, I think that it's possible to dodge that Blade somewhat consistantly if no shapeshifting is involved, and if it is, then atium would probably still make it a nutcracking game... unless Kaladin uses his Surges somehow :0 like, if he affects his opponent with them, atium isn't gonna help see that.",1672531373

"ibs","t5_2s3g1","I read to try the FODMAP. I highly recommend small amounts but more frequent than regular meals. I also recommend taking probiotics (i personally take Garden of Life RAW Probiotics Colon Care - the shelf stable kind but there is probably something better out there) or eating yogurt that has probiotics (most do). 

If FODMAPs doesn‚Äôt help, try the BRAT diet - bananas, applesauce, rice, toast (crackers and chicken broth are also ok). Then build from that. My IBS started after a bout of colitis and my aunt who has issues post-colon cancer recommended that. It helped me until I was able to experiment a bit and see what the triggers were for me. Like I found mashed potatoes and grilled cheese is ok for me when I started to build on that. 

I honestly never committed to the FODMAPs because I found that my ibs-d is more driven by anxiety and stress rather than specific foods. Try to help him relax/take his mind off things. It‚Äôs hard because that all kinda snowballs once it gets started. Stress triggers it which makes me more stressed which causes it to get even worse‚Ä¶

Heating pads help with pain/cramping. I really like the Gaiam relax ones on Amazon - specifically the lower back one as it covers my lower ab area well. You microwave them so you can take them with you as you go from room to room. 

Also, has he gone to a doctor? I will say mine prescribed me an anti-spasm medication as well as an antacid. They helped a little. I learned recently she failed to tell me that antacids make the anti-spasm less effective so it is better to take the anti-spasm before eating and then the antacid after eating. 

Sorry for the book. I‚Äôve been dealing with this for about 8-9 months now and I understand the frustration. I just wanted to share what I have learned.

It's so hot, people would evaporate, flesh, blood and bones. You'd be reduced to a superheated cloud of plasma made up of some trace elements also found in the human body.

And that's just if the sun is entirely non-magical, which I don't think is a given. For example, would the flame-freezing charm do anything against fiendfyre? Probably not, right?

I have read dozens of articles over the years about Boquete and the nearby towns, but have decided I would not live there.  I'm too established in Ecuador.  Also, the fact that almost all international routes to David require change of planes in Panama City is a turn-off for me.  From David, land transportation to Boquete can be another 40 to 60 minutes.  Bottom line -- Boquete is too problematic logistically for an Expat who likes to travel outside Panama.

"UnsentLetters","t5_2seir","I did not say thoughts don't have meaning. Many thoughts indeed have meaning. But people tend to accept thoughts that pop into their heads and give them meaning when in fact there is none. In my case, after I stopped talking to the person I mentioned, when he popped into my head I initially thought it was because I missed him. I gave my thought of him that meaning. But then one day, he popped into my head and I questioned the thought and concluded, based on facts, that I did not miss him but my mind had become accustomed to thinking of him. The thoughts were a nuisance. There was a time when I missed him but it was while we were still talking to each other trying to find our level, which we never accomplished. 

Though I appreciate you thinking you know how I feel based on what you have written I can assure you, you do not. And my experience has no bearing on yours and vice versa. And to be clear, I did not say love bombing was love, to the contrary. Tbh, it seems like you have given meaning and context to a passing comment by me but it is not my meaning nor is it my context. Finally, I am not waiting to find true love. The idea of true love seems funny to me---as though love can be untrue. If a person's feelings are untrue then I can assure you it is not love. I am in a happy and committed relationship and have been for a long time. It has all the right contours but it is real and real is not perfect because people are not perfect. I do not believe in normative sunshine or the idea that ""loving thyself"" is the panacea to finding someone who will love you in return. And for me hope and wishing are forms of future tripping, cravings that take you out of ""now"". As you see, we do not perceive things very similarly at all. Though, I do think we share one common characteristic, kindness and compassion for others. Happy New Year to you. Thank you for the dialog. =)",1672531376

"merval","t5_32kag","Bienvenido! En general los posts de ""tengo X y quiero invertir"" o ""por donde empezar a invertir?"" son muy comunes y muy repetitivos. Las respuestas son siempre mas o menos las mismas y no aportan a subir la calidad del sub por su naturaleza, ademas de que suelen ser poco completas porque solo son recomendaciones sueltas que NO es lo que deber√≠a estar recibiendo alguien que reci√©n arranca en el mundo de las inversiones.

Por esto, desde la moderaci√≥n solemos cerrar este tipo de threads cuando se vuelven muy repetitivos y recomendarle a los usuarios los siguientes tips:

1. Leer las [guias para principiantes](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/collection/e6a7524c-6445-470e-a2b1-2246387c0c15/) (usar new reddit para ver bien los posts).

2. Leer posts anteriores de [PRIMEROS PASOS](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/search?q=flair_name%3A%22PRIMEROS%20PASOS%22&amp;restrict_sr=1).

3. Leer la [wiki](https://new.reddit.com/r/merval/wiki/index).

4. Usar el buscador para ver si la consulta ya fue tratada.

5. Usar el [THREAD DE CONSULTAS DIARIAS](https://www.reddit.com/r/merval/?f=flair_name%3A%22CONSULTAS%20BASICAS%22) para evacuar consultas puntuales que no ameritan un thread.

6. Usar el filtro de [TUTORIALES](https://new.reddit.com/r/merval/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3A%22TUTORIALES%22) para encontrar gu√≠as aprobadas sobre distintas tem√°ticas.

"starterpacks","t5_34o9s","Idk man, from my experience there‚Äôs no greater core workout than squat and deadlift with good form. In my personal opinion, core specific workouts are a massive waste of time. The purpose of your core is to stabilize you, something that sit-ups, crunches, etc. don‚Äôt really do. Now, pull ups with your legs locked straight out is a different ball game tho. Almost every important lift hits the core pretty hard: squat, deadlift, overhead press, farmers walks, and even shrugs with heavy weight. If you do everything right, your core strength comes naturally; but if you use a smith machine and isolation exercises exclusively you‚Äôre over all foundation is going to have a lot of cracks simply because those things can‚Äôt simulate the stress that heavy compound lifts put on your body.",1672531377

I would pick whichever you enjoy more. Which admittedly is hard to know as an MS0. I think Anes vs IM is a common split among those that end up doing anesthesia (and gas certainly gets former IM residents.). But the practices are very different. It‚Äôs possible you would enjoy both. But there‚Äôs probably one you‚Äôd like more (or something else entirely different).

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","&gt;In what world will D4 be good? Blizzard has a disastrous track record for the last &gt;15 years.

Yeah and wow still the most played MMO at western. Millions and millions of people still play Activision Blizzard Games, last COD for example break again the record of sells.

&gt;All the preview development diaries have been clueless.

This means nothing, most of their public are casuals and they don't fucking care for any of this.

&gt;The videos look like a slightly-reskinned D3. It's going to be shit.

D3 also doesn't look awesome when it launched and a lot of people make criticism about the graphics looks cartoon and lost the diablo vibe, the game still sold more than 16 millions of copies and was a absolutely success, when Diablo was dying due to lack of content it still had more players than PoE ever had, and Diablo 4 will not be different, it will sells more than players numbers at PoE all leagues history together.

&gt;It would be one of the biggest surprises ever if it was good.

If the game is good it will put poe on standby for a long time, if it's awesome it'll kill it, just the name of Diablo will sell more than anything poe could imagine done to attract new players and never achieve that level.

I'm not defending Blizzard over GGG, bit the reality is most people know Blizzard and GGG kill their game by themselves, they lost players without even have a competitor. I hate Blizzard and think they are shit, but GGG basically become another Blizzard IMO, and it's impossible to deny the reality, D4 will be a success, if the game will last longer is something else, but for sure it'll sell more than 10 millions units easy.",1672531378
"centrist","t5_2qx8j","&gt; loopholes that are especially favorable to wealthy people

The article says the ""yacht deduction"" is just part of the mortgage deduction.  Getting rid of the yacht deduction while keeping the regular mortgage deduction would add complexity to the law, not simplify it. 

I'm fine with eliminating the mortgage deduction for everyone, that simplifies the law.  But note most of the extra taxes would be paid by non-wealthy people.  

I agree that the business pass through 20% is really ""egregious"".   We should simplify the tax code and get rid of it.   However, I don't see it as particularly important to ""wealthy"" people, since it is capped at $165k/$330k of income.  

I agree the ""private plane loophole"" is both wrong and especially favorable to wealthy people.   However, getting rid of it complicates the tax law, it doesn't simplify it. 

So, not much in terms of ""simplifying that hits primarily wealthy people"".  

I looked at the others.  Four apply to specific states.    A number are business expense deductions.   We should have deductions for business expenses, there will inevitably be gray areas.  I agree with the taxpayer on two out of three, and the third needs more facts. We should certainly get rid of the carried interest loophole for fund managers, note that it is primarily about ""wealthy"" people.  However, it's possible that getting rid of it complicates the law.  A couple are medical expenses.   I'd be happy getting rid of all deductions for medical expenses, but only after we rationalize our medical funding system.  ""Backdoor Roth"" we should get rid of, but I'd get rid of all Roths.  etc....",1672531378

"Anbennar","t5_3po7z","1: Ally Lorrent (They hate Gawed). Rivaling Gawed should make this easier.   


2: Always have the biggest army possible (until you get powerful enough, that the AI fear you,  then it wont matter)   


3: Build forts at the choke points on the dragon coast, use attrition, well picked battles and the defensive bonus to win.   
3.1: Build a fort on the damestear island (dont remember its name), lure Gaweds forces onto the Island, send out your navy, blocking the Island, attack Gawed, Gawed cant retreat due to the navy blocking the strait, when Gawed lose, their army is wiped, send navy back to port, repeat.   


4: Loans, mercenaries, slacken recruitment. The AI cant use loans well, you have a human brain, so you can. Going into a deficit to win an all or nothing war is worth it in the long run.   


5: dont state the northern Kobold provinces that are disconnected from your land, you cant defend them and stating them only adds war exhaustion and gives Gawed more warscore.   


6: Plan your expansion. If you manage to win the war, try to go for provinces that will be easy to defend in a future war, because Gawed WILL be back and Lorrent WILL backstab you once you get to strong.   


7: Hire highest possible level advisers (easy as Gnomes) and dev your easily defensible land in the Dragon Coast, this should allow you to outpace Gawed quick enough.   


As for Purging vs not Purging? Purging losses you dev, causes unrest, rebellions and devastation, letting them live lets you convert most of the important provinces through the mission tree and is probably the easier route if you are struggling. You can always purge them later, when you are safe from Gawed.

The fake blur effect is obvious, the software on phones is pretty good at it, and for a facebook post this isn't the kind of thing anyone would notice, but photographers will catch it real quick because they know well what the real thing looks like. With a proper lens on camera the amount something is blurred depends on how far it is from the center of the focal plane, the further out the more blur, the closer the less, but in your image you can see for example the armature that connects to the power cable is out of focus despite being at the same point in the focal plane as the car itself. Imagine the focal plane, the 'in-focus' area, as a slice of the world where the focus ring on the lens is moving that slice closer and further from you while the aperture controls who thick that slice of sharp focus is. You get blur both near you and far from you because what's in focus is wherever you've put the focal plane. By combining those settings you control what is in focus, but software effects depends on things like color and contrast changes to detect what is near or far so with the power arm on the car not being yellow the software thinks its part of the background and blurs it out.

I think you've got a good eye given this photo, if you take the plunge on getting a camera you'll have a good time with it, there are lenses (tilt-shift) that do the miniature effect when used a certain way and that has a look that's hard to duplicate perfectly with software.",1672531379

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Yes, the council of Trent anathematized the doctrine of sola fide. But it fundamentally misunderstood and misconstrued what the Reformers were saying. It was never about mere belief. If the Christian faith is only a collection of facts I must affirm, then no thanks! The Christian faith is based on truth, yes. But it is by faith that the truth of the Gospel is applied to us. And it is in faith that we live lives that reflect the life that the Holy Spirit put into us! 

By my reading, the council of Trent stands in pretty stark contrast with Vatican 2 and with even more recent statements (like the ones I mentioned in my first post). I believe that the Roman Church did in fact go through some positive reform on this issue. You might be interested in checking out the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification (written by Lutherans and Catholics, and later signed by other Protestant denominations). 

Personal experience can be a strange thing. I would never want to discount someone‚Äôs experience, particularly because I have a number of people in my life who are ex-Catholic and feel very strongly that they were lied to. And indeed, I believe that Roman Catholics are very wrong on various points (like Confession as a ‚Äúsecond plank‚Äù of salvation and the role of Mary and the Saints). But I grew up Protestant, so I can‚Äôt relate to their experience. I can only speak to the facts as I have come to understand them. I am convinced that there are many Roman Catholics that are my brothers and sisters, just as there are many Protestants that are my brothers and sisters. Likewise, there are Protestants and Catholics who are self-deceived and lack faith in Christ. What is the ratio? Don‚Äôt know.",1672531379

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The prophets‚Äîwhose dual mandate was to draw closer to God and by extension draw God closer to us‚Äîingested their selected substances one by one. Mushrooms, LSD, DMT and the like sent these honored and chosen men deep into the recesses of their minds, bodies, and souls, in search of the ever fleeting presence of the divine. 

Every trip failed.

The inward journeys were as deep as an ocean but as wide as a puddle and failed to ever deliver true connection with the One Most Sought. However, what they provided was an outward expansion of the inner-being of each of the prophets. That is to say, these trips yielded a deeper understanding of the universe and a more true insight into the human condition. Yes, in the classical sense, not a single trip allowed the prophets to touch the divine.

That is, until one fateful trip.

The men gathered around, 12 total, bearded all, and took their respective places in a semi-circle. Each prophet sat with his arms set atop his knees, palms upward toward the heavens, facing a menacing bronze bear. The bear represented the creator God known as Ursa.

On that fateful evening, each prophet ingested their respective tab of LSD and focused upon the great mother bear before them. The gentle strum of a harp echoed in their minds as they each journeyed into the unknown.

The prophet Inga saw colors pouring out of the gaping mouth of the bear, pooling into 7 distinct bodies before him. ‚ÄúThe 7 Mother Waters,‚Äù murmured Inga.

The prophet Uft saw great beams of light piercing the mother bear‚Äôs eyes. These light beams cut through Uft‚Äôs midsection and at once illuminated heaven and Earth and all that existed beyond. ‚ÄúThe Light of Life and Death,‚Äù whispered Uft. 

The prophet Angt witnessed the ground beneath the statue ripple and breathe as though it were alive; the ground swelled around him like a great creature endeavored to breach the surface. Angt felt the ground open up beneath him and swallow him whole.

Angt fell.

And fell.

Further still.

Until he sat motionless before a living, breathing embodiment of Ursa the Creator. Angt threw himself prostrate at the feet of the great and terrible beast and prayed to the Mother for mercy.

‚ÄúLord Mother, Ursa thy name of power and creation. I am but your humble servant. I but endeavor to know thine glory still and to spread word of thine acts. I pray thee show mercy upon my body and soul. Amen.‚Äù

The Mother scooped Angt into a paw so large that it enveloped the prophet completely. The warm embrace overwhelmed the man with a simultaneous feeling of comfort and terror. 

BE AT PEACE, PROPHET. YOU NEED NOT FEAR THE MOTHER. YOU SHALL KNOW AND BE KNOWN. YOU SHALL SEE AND BE SEEN.

Angt stared into the eyes of the Mother and saw the Light of Life and Death. He saw his future and his past. He was at once alive and dead‚Äîin a state of superposition‚Äîvibrating between all that he had lived and would live. 

Angt felt the multi-colored streams of the Mother Waters wash over him changing him as they cleansed his body. He was black, then white, then every shade of brown, gray, orange, and red. He lost himself, but knew his identify with more certainty than he had ever felt. 

He was human. He was divine. 

He was creation. He was creator. 

The Mother raised Angt to her mouth and devoured his Earthly body in a single gulp. Angt felt no fear, no pain. Only relief. 

The prophet sat within the stomach of the Great Creator and saw the world as it was. And the world as it would be. He felt adoration for the Other. He knew that just as he gestated within the stomach of the Mother, so too had the Other. Just as he would be liberated from the Mothers womb, warm, and crying, so too had the Other. The prophet learned‚Äîwhile in the Mother‚Äôs warm embrace‚Äîthat all life shared a central nexus point. And that nexus point united all of life still. 

Angt‚Äîstill in the Mother‚Äôs womb‚Äîspoke aloud. He had said the words before. He thought he believed the words before. He even thought he had understood the words before. Angt knew nothing until he touched the divine within and without. 

 ‚ÄúWe are all one.‚Äù

Like the punctuation to his phrase the world crescendoed into a cacophony of joy and anger, shouts of happiness and pain. The world exploded from the Mother‚Äôs womb and collapsed back into it. Angt saw himself. He smiled. 

And then nothing. 

Angt awoke to see 11 bearded men huddled above him. Their eyes glassy, pupils still dilated. Inga asked, ‚Äúwhat did you see?‚Äù Uft inquired, ‚Äúwhat did you feel?‚Äù 

Angt sat up and replied simply:

‚ÄúEverything.‚Äù

"stunfisk","t5_2sn6d","OU, but it's debatable. Flareon is a genuine offensive threat, being the best mixed attacker out of all Fire types. Hitmonlee is far more questionable, but being the only Fighting type with good STAB in a format dominated by Normals makes it far closer to being usable than many other pokemon listed in that graphic (like Seaking, which is literally worse than Golbat)

For the record, with how the community comes up with its VR, there are a *lot* of usable pokemon that don't get ranked. Only a small subset of players get to vote, which means that by the time you account for players not ranking a pokemon either because they don't agree that it's worth using, or because it's not used enough by top players to form meaningful opinions, there's little input on niche pokemon. Everyone draws the line in terms of viability at different points and everyone disagrees how these niche pokemon actually stack up against each other. This means that only a few people with votes rank each fringe pokemon, a small enough amount that it gets excluded due to small sample size",1672531380

"Hellenism","t5_2zipp","It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt rly know if I believe or not, just, I‚Äôm gonna be rambling a lil, sorry if it makes no sense 

I feel the need to clarify, when saying i don't believe i don't mean i think there's no way they exist, it's that i don't know if gods exist

, My grandma was really religious, she grew up in a nunery, really really religious, and i really loved her but even tho she was so religious when she died(i was under 6 i think)  my grandma's pastor told my father not to tell me ""she's with god now"" cause i would get angry and skeptical, cause i would both start hating god and not believing, I would get angry at my father believing it's not true, so my father just ended up telling me that it's all part of a cycle, that she didn't disappear but she just isn't here anymore and no one really know where she is


Ever since i was a kid i had troubles with believing in stuff, and it's not like i get called by gods but I‚Äôve always done things a certain way to talk to ‚Äúgod‚Äù or nature? Or the universe or wtv, like ever since I have memory I say thank you every time I picked a flower, I see the ocean and am grateful, I place flowers and rocks in places I feel they need to be for something/someone but every time I do this I wonder ‚Äúwhy am I doing it?‚Äù


 Like since I was a kid till now sometimes I get angry and scream at wtv is there ‚Äúwhy would you do this to me?‚Äù What god would allow this and then I get angrier and start thinking there aren‚Äôt any gods and get even angrier believing I‚Äôm getting angry at nothing, so I‚Äôm just getting angry at nothing and then I spiral back into apologizing to something that never answers me because I feel like I need to, it‚Äôs just I can‚Äôt bring myself into fully believing there‚Äôs something but the idea of just conforming to emptiness is terrifying and sad to me

Even with the saying thank you when picking flowers, sometimes I pick one and say thank you and then immediately go in my mind ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not thanking you, why would I tank anyone for this flower there no one is here and the plant doesn‚Äôt feel anyways‚Äù but then seconds passes and I just feel wrong so I go back and say ‚Äúsorry thank you‚Äù and keep spiraling into ‚Äúnothing is here but thank you but sorry but I‚Äôm talking to no one ‚Äù

Like sometimes I‚Äôm cooking and think ‚Äúwow hestia sure is wonderful‚Äù but then I just think ‚Äúno I‚Äôm the one cooking nothing is helping me‚Äù and just end up feeling as lonely as I did before 

I don‚Äôt know, I guess I just want a connection with something but idk if I can believe in said something or at least not blindly but there‚Äôs nothing proving me there something

1. Tell them to knock it the hell off.
2. If they don't, tell them it's time for therapy or you are leaving.
3. If they refuse therapy, leave.
4. If they accept therapy, see if it works. If it does? Great.

"fragrance","t5_2sda0","I have no personal experience with Fragrance du Bois so have nothing to say about their quality. I have doubts about the claim that they are all natural, though. Notably this is what they claim:

&gt; ‚ÄúAt Fragrance Du Bois, our promise to you is that we use only 100% pure, sustainable and the highest quality natural perfume oils and extracts from sustainable sources around the world.‚Äù

To me this is very awkwardly worded, and I suspect intentionally so. It would be really easy to just say ‚Äúwe only use natural ingredients in our fragrances‚Äù but they don‚Äôt. Instead they make this statement that I think literally says that the natural ingredients they use are the best and pure, instead of saying only naturals are used. They also don‚Äôt include any ingredients lists on their websites. 

&gt; since they are now available to many at Marshalls, TJ Maxx or TR Maxx along with MFK, Tom Ford, Nishane, Memo, Parfums De Marley,‚Ä¶

The fact that those are available from TJ Maxx says nothing about their quality. You‚Äôre buying into manufactured exclusivity. 

&gt; where LV failed was the have Blues....

I wonder what this means to you. Is this ‚Äúno blues‚Äù something FdB claims? To my nose ‚Äúblue‚Äù mostly means aggressively aldehydic opening.

P.S. I don‚Äôt believe natural ingredients actually means natural smelling anyway. A ton of excellent fragrances are made mostly of synthetics.",1672531381

"wownoob","t5_35idp","15-18k sounds normal for that ilvl.

First, follow the advice from /u/kalimdore here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wownoob/comments/zzqpzd/i_do_no_damage/j2d47a8/

I suggest running a sim on both a Patchwerk boss fight (this is going to be a single target raid boss sim).   Pretty much the equivalent of a Terros fight this tier.  I also suggest you run a 6 minute dungeon slice sim. Which is going to simulate a 2 minute  dungeon boss followed by 4 minutes of mob pack pulls.  These will help you get an understanding of what your damage profile should look like if played computer optimally over a long ST fight and in a dungeon.  Also, make sure you look at the advanced options.  It will likely sim you expecting you to have all buffs, food, flasks, potions, etc. that you are likely not to be using.  Turn off the stuff you know you won't have so you can see a more realistic expectation.  You can also turn it on if you want to see what the difference is, but in a dungeon slice, you don't always know what you'll have (other than warrior buff) so expecting full buffs an only having your own will make a difference in what you see and can expect to be attainable. You can also sim it a few different ways so you can see things like the difference between Lust and no-Lust. Finally, scroll to the bottom of your sims and look at the opener and rotation that they do.

If you want to get even more advanced in depth on your analysis.  Once you get the gear score to run LFR, do so, and before you start type: /combatlog   -- This will save your fight logs to your [WoW Install]\_retail\logs folder on your computer and you can then upload it to warcraftlogs.com 

Once you upload it to here you can look at your performance compared to other Fury Warriors.  You'll hear this called your parse.  And it's the percentage of other Fury Warriors you out-DPSed.  A couple things to note about this:  1.  Ignore the leftmost number.  That compares you against ilvl 200 Fury Warriors who come in and blast LFR to look cool.  2.  Pay attention to the ilvl Parse towards the left side.  This compares you to other Fury Warriors within a couple ilvl of you and is much more accurate as to how you performed.

Once you're fully demoralized, remind yourself that you're still learning and taking the steps to improve.  Then look at the Damage Done tab of your fight to look at what you cast when, and how many of each cast you did.  Then find a really high parse of another Fury Warrior with a fight time that is similar to your own (a fight that is even 10-20 seconds longer or shorter is going to look significantly different and affect the parse.  That's potentially a major CD being utilized), and then compare what they cast when and what you cast when.  

Also look at your uptime.  How much of the fight did you spend not attacking because you were moving or doing mechanics?  Minimizing this time (while still doing mechanics and proper rotations) is the true skill of WoW.

Finally, take the link to that log and check it on https://wowanalyzer.com/ which will compare your rotation and fight to something similar to the raidbots sim and give you a report full of pointers.  Telling you how many times you could have cast an ability and didn't, and will also mark some of these as the biggest things you can improve.

Good luck and always be casting!",1672531382

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","I believe ""industry standard"" is a bit of a misleading phrasing. I believe that you may be referring to commonality. Just as how we moved from 720p to 1080p and then to 4K, it will be a matter of technology moving to that point. We have already seen a huge shift from mostly 60Hz panels to panels all the way up to 240Hz panels. 120/144Hz panels are becoming more common and affordable. As more powerful graphics cards become more affordable, the monitor standards will change. The theory is that the higher the frame rate, the smoother the motion in games. If you want the math on how to figure how much more work the GPU is doing, you can figure out the basic picture load. Each pixel is usually a 256bit value in RGB with backlight. The pixel count is easy as it's the resolution such as 1920X1080 just multiplied out- 2,073,600 pixels per frame. At 60Hz or FPS, just multiply 2,073,600 times the frame rate and that is a very rudimentary amount of bytes per second the GPU is expected to push. 1080p @60fps= 124,416,000 bytes per second for baseline graphics with no filters or anything.",1672531384

Second: equipment sans battery $1.3/W ($54,000).  You may be able to get a significantly reduced installation fee given the large size (like 3 large systems all in one install).  For example, one permit, one design, one mobilization, etc. Suppose it takes 3 - 4 days.  What is that worth? $10k? $20k? $30k.  The going rate for install of a typical size system is $1 - $1.7 per Watt.  But yours is not typical.  So I assume that the install is highly negotiable.  Then add battery. You will also probably need a line side tap - so higher electrical costs.  And maybe you need new higher Amp service.  So again - why such a large system?",1672531385

America is the only country where there's a worth to splitting massacre and mass shooting. One because they have so many, two because they constantly have gun control debates where the information would be useful split up.

The wiki explains that there is no official definition and so lists several definitions that other noteworthy groups have used. If a shooting fits multiple it is included.

""The most lenient of definitions"". Yet again, there are only 8 definitions listed, which specifically do you take issue with.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","My mom had one club foot when she was born in 1957. I never knew until she told me either, but it made sense why she always got special shoe inserts to be more comfortable. 

My baby is 1 year old now and was born with cleft lip and palate. I was also born with cleft lip and palate so I was familiar with it, but heartbroken that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to breastfeed and my baby would have to endure surgeries and potential bullying in the future. 

I would never trade her in a million years, but yeah I‚Äôm allowed to wallow every now and then! I wish none of us ever had to deal with health issues. It isn‚Äôt fair.",1672531387

Just look at all the details stripped from franchise mode from previous generations of consoles to current versions, or the complete laziness with this year's edition. (Couldn't even be bothered to include last year's sack totals for defensive players in a season when TJ Watt tied the all time record.) If they were going to actually put in effort they've had reasons to give the mode the reboot - or at least shot in the arm - it needs. Next gen consoles. The Fix Franchise hashtag that got attention. NFL players openly calling the mode trash. They have only implemented cosmetic changes to franchise, really.

I accepted years ago it was always going to be the same imperfect game mode. But this year was the breaking point for me. No updates to play now. The sacks being missing. Postseason wins counting as losses for coaches. The draft glitches. It's the worst edition ever in terms of immersion when there's just no excuse for it.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","Okay while these comments are incredibly amusing (I had a good laugh) I also understand where your coming from. In my personal opinion I think it‚Äôs seen as acceptable to have a slight drop in gpa with harder classes you just don‚Äôt want to have too much of a drop. That would be a downward trend. If you got a 4.0 in all your freshmen classes then anything but straight As will lead to a gpa drop. Sometimes you won‚Äôt get an A in orgo and biochem and physics even if you got all As in freshman classes. That‚Äôs okay. 
Someone else said they think it would be anything more than a 0.4 drop which makes sense to me. But even then, you‚Äôll be okay. Going from a 4.0 to a 3.8 is not the end of the world. Going from a 4.0 to a 3.5 is also not the end of the world. It would be more reasonable to call that a downward trend than the former example. It‚Äôs all going to be very subjective as there is no clear definition or cutoff number for what is a downward trend. Overall I wouldn‚Äôt say that ANY drop in gpa is considered a downward trend. I would say that going from straight As to straight Cs is a concern though that should be addressed on your application if you have a chance.",1672531388

Den finde ich √ºbrigens richtig b√∂sartig, denn nur zum Vergleich ‚Äì der Konflikt zwischen Israelis und Pal√§stinensern hat in seiner gesamten Geschichte etwa 70000 Todesopfer auf Seiten der Pal√§stinenser gefordert, d.h. im Verlauf von √ºber 70 Jahren. In den Todescamps der Nazis hat man etwa 2-3 Tage (!) gebraucht, um die gleiche Zahl an Juden zu ermorden. Soviel zu ‚Äûin Israel √§hnlich wie in Hitlerdeutschland‚Äú. Der Vergleich ist einfach so extrem und offensichtlich an den Haaren herbeigezogen, dass es mir schwer f√§llt, ihn mit blo√üer Ignoranz zu entschuldigen.

(Nebenbei: Assad in Syrien hat seit 2011 ungef√§hr eine halbe Million seiner eigenen Staatsb√ºrger dahingemetzelt. Dass dich das ‚Äì rate ich jetzt einfach mal ‚Äì vergleichsweise wenig juckt, deine Emp√∂rung einfach nicht so anstachelt, liegt daran, dass hier das Element einer j√ºdischen Tatbeteiligung fehlt, und dieses Messen mit zweierlei Ma√ü ist ebenfalls ein Zeichen f√ºr eine antisemitisch durchtr√§nkte Weltanschauung.)

Satz 3 ist ebenfalls eine Form von Antisemitismus durch die Hintert√ºr, weil er das Spezifische, was dieser Begriff ausdr√ºckt ‚Äì Hass und Feindschaft gegen Juden ‚Äì rein sprachlich aus der Welt schaffen und somit unsichtbar machen will durch einen semantischen Trick, der allerdings keinerlei Basis in der tats√§chlichen Bedeutung dieses Begriffs und seiner Geschichte hat. Der Satz stellt den Versuch da, begriffliche Unterscheidungen einzuebnen, um das blo√üe Sprechen √ºber Antisemitismus unm√∂glich zu machen. Ein sprachlicher Trick, der ebenfalls auf denjenigen, der ihn anwendet, zur√ºckf√§llt und ein klares Anzeichen daf√ºr gibt, was es mit seiner Motivation auf sich hat.

"Business_Ideas","t5_2wk90","You don't need to open a hosting business, you can resell it as white label web hosting. There are many companies that give a reseller account with no cost such as reseller panels. You need only a big budget for advertising this business. It's too hard to compete in this niche. but I am here to help. If you are familiar with hosting, think of their affiliate programs and you are still in the same niche, but in another business model of Digital Marketing it's Affiliate marketing.  
You can choose one company to register as an affiliate, fill your fav payment as payout method and start promoting it.  
How to promote?!  
YouTube is the biggest Advertising platform  
in their tutorial blog you will find "" How to create a blog a step by step"" video  
Download it and create a new channel.  
Upload the video as an unlisted video.  
put your affiliate link in description.  
Create a Google ads account.  
connect your YouTube channel with your Google ads account.  
Start promoting this video as an infeed ad campaign. not skip ads campaigns.  
It depends on your budget. You can hit $100k as an affiliate marketer with only one program.  
Most hosting affiliate companies programs pay between $50-$125 per sale.  
If you get a million views and you spend $50k you can make between $100k- $150k.  
Another affiliate program you can hit $100k is builderall.  
it's all in one saas software as a service.

"ColumbusGA","t5_2rn8i","&gt;That LE encounter - wtf? Did you file a complaint?
That encounter was with sheriffs at the lake Oliver entrance.  After this, I found another place to park downtown, but it does cost me an extra $300 per year in gas to drive down there.

I did not file a complaint, I honestly have no faith in the complaint process.  I worried that filing a complaint would just serve to antagonize the deputy and I don't want to get jammed up in something like that and have some kind of beef with that guy, for me, as I remind myself, it's about the ride, the ride, the ride. 

&gt;Why aren't you allowed on the base? It does feel weird just riding into the base with out doing anything for security.

I was stopped by an MP several months ago just past the Ft Benning Road riverwalk entrance.

The MP had a host of complaints, but the main one was that I did not have a visitors pass.  Unless the policy has changed, pedestrians and bike riders accessing the base via the riverwalk are NOT required to have a visitors pass, I do agree that this seems a unusual, but I'm almost certain that this is still the current policy.

Way way back the base i think the base was just ""open"", I remember my dad would drive through there and use the ""back gate"" as a shortcut to get to LA(Lower Alabama).

Back in the day(1990s), when there was an operating ""gate""(for cars) at south Lumpkin road, the riverwalk was routed through the gate, but the guards pretty much just ignored riverwalk users, if you started to stop they would just wave you through...exactly like at the ""new"" entrance. 

At some point, the South Lumpkin Road car gate closed, but they did leave the riverwalk access intact and riverwalk users were allowed to enter and leave pretty much un-monitored.  They did have cameras at times.  I used this access point frequently, for years, often pretty late,  sometimes going right past MPs parked\driving near the Ft Benning Road entrance.  

No problems, ever. I did my best not to appear creepy, I avoided the residential areas and stuck to the main post surface streets, I have multiple tail lights and a pretty nice front light, I'd ride by the MP station all the time, I'd always give a little wave at the MPs patrolling.  I also did a bunch of loops around a few big parking lots, but they were well lighted, pretty much deserted and completely visible to the patrolling MPs.  After some years, I figured I'm OK....   

When they started construction to route the riverwalk through the Ft Benning Road gate a few years ago, I was gravely concerned.  I honestly figured that was it for me riding my bike on base.  

I closely monitored the local newspapers and Ft Bennings facebook pages, eventually some info popped up saying that riverwalk users could continue to access the base via the riverwalk through the new gate route.  No visitors Pass Required, ID RECOMMENDED(I was so happy!!!!):
https://www.facebook.com/FortBenningGarrison/photos/a.279361392211351/1825894934224648/?type=3&amp;paipv=0&amp;eav=AfYhwlIpAAt_ut8TJVFAKIYe3WbYCAwYAPSPmIvKMc-ioNNKHuika5fCVlRYBLRsGA4&amp;_rdr
   

They eventually changed that and now REQUIRE an ID, but still no visitors pass is needed for riverwalk user's access:
https://www.facebook.com/BenningFMWRfans/posts/pfbid02TvLqEhPNK5w9xLieHzJw16Q4KWWwLFKCPzQGoQnhiERkiuYCH4j6gJKjyz6XsxGTl

I tried my best to politely explain that no visitors pass is required when accessing the base via the riverwalk to the MP, but he would not listen.  He would do that ""thing"" where he would ask me a question and then when I would try to answer he would just talk LOUDLY over me.

He emphatically repeated several times quite clearly that if he ever sees me on Ft Benning again he would arrest me on trespassing charges.

I have not been out there since then, I really miss it, it was a really great part of my ride.  The roads in the main part of the base are wide and not much traffic at night at all, the few cars around always seem to follow the speed limit and drive carefully in general.  Sometimes you can see them shooting at night on the ranges, they have some tanks and airplanes on display here and there.  The jump towers are really cool, neat when it's so foggy you can't see the top of them.
 
tldr; I was kicked out of Ft Benning and told not to ever return because I was riding my bike in Ft Benning on the riverwalk without having a visitors pass.  As far as I know, a visitors pass is not required for riverwalk users in Ft benning.

I think that since you are working out there, you should not have a problem like this since you will have a CAC(?) access card.",1672531390

Also the blending of tobacco in Cuba has not kept pace with the rest of the world and Cubans are limited to puros meaning all of the tobacco is from Cuba rather than from a variety of nations. Having said that, Cuban cigars have a unique flavor that some people absolutely love. I love it. But I am not willing to pay $30 a cigar for that flavor except very rarely. Cigar culture can be elitist. Especially among people who are in love with the idea of cigars but not the experience of cigars. If you are a lawyer making a million dollars a year in Beverly Hills, you are going to give a MonteCristo No. 2 to a client rather than a Nicaraguan cigar or a Dominican cigar. And yes the reason is to impress and to demonstrate that you can get Cuban cigars. That part of cigar culture is completely bullshit.

Amtrak doesn't compete with flying, and shouldn't be compared to flying.

Rather, the train competes with **driving** -- either a long-distance bus, or driving yourself.  The advantages over a Greyhound should be obvious; and compared to driving yourself:

* The train runs 24 hours per day; doesn't stop to sleep overnight.
* YOU are not driving, watching the road, worried about gas, finding a hotel.
* If you're in a sleeper, your meals are included as well as a bed.
* On the train you can get up and walk around as needed.
* In place of *""Remain in your seat with your seat belt fastened""*, Amtrak's rule is *""You must wear shoes in the public areas of the train.""* (Makes sense, too -- you wouldn't want to have a toe sheared off transiting between cars!)

"BoysPlanet","t5_5h02tq","Most of this comment is moreso targetted at the Twitter confession (not going to actually copy &amp; paste this essay to Twitter because I refuse to use Twitter more than I have to):

First off, there aren't even that many idols on the show? Hui is the big one obviously, but the UP10TION/TO1/Nine.i/Withus boys aren't even *that* popular (according to the fancam views ranking). Excluding Hui, the next highest fancam view ranking is Keita at #9, and then Woonggi at #14 and Dongyeol at #17, but otherwise Top 20 is void of active idols (not counting Kim Jiwoong of INX because he's more known for his BL drama acting and I don't believe INX is active anymore).

So then you have the other known contestants who are known mostly from prior survival show appearances that are mostly taking up the top spots, but why are they being conflated with idols? The logic here really makes no sense to me. Even if they have fame, they still have not had the chance to be in an actual permanent lineup, I don't get the argument that ""they are taking up spots of other new contestants"" at all since they themselves have never been in a permanent lineup (in fact, I believe the only one that's been in a final lineup period that promoted for ANY amount of time is Lee Seung Hwan with 1The9, and that was just 9 months).

Also, this is the pre-season. ""Contestants that have pre-show popularity are more popular in the pre-season"" is not the dagger that people think it is. If this was the final or pre-finale ranking, there may be more of a point, but I don't know what some people are expecting. Of course people are going to prioritize, ""I've seen them in a survival show before and they were good"" over ""Oh hey, I liked this fancam of X new contestant, guess I have to stan"", as the former simply has a lot more content to go off of. 

Once Episode 1 starts, it's guaranteed that a bunch of new names and faces will shoot up to occupy the Top 9/10/11. People have had the same complaint every season of ""I'm concerned the final lineup will be half active idols"", but this has never been the case (you can try to blame rigging but the only active idol they've rigged out was Jinhyuk, since Gaeun wasn't active and Jonghyun wasn't rigged out, also NU'EST was on the verge of disbandment anyways) [EDIT: Dongho was rigged out, I just remembered, but anyways he wouldn't count because NU'EST was basically disbanded].

----------

EDIT: Actually, let's dissect the final lineups:

* Kep1er - Yujin doesn't count (CLC was effectively disbanded, she said so during Episode 1), neither does Yeseo (she left Busters in late 2020), so that's 0/9 active idols.

* X1 - Seungwoo and Wooseok count (Victon and UP10TION), Seungyoun doesn't (UNIQ was inactive), so 2/11. If you add Jinhyuk in there because he was rigged out, 3/11 (which is by far the highest ratio of any of these lineups).

* IZ\*ONE - Eunbi doesn't count (her prior group was long inactive by the time she did P48), so 0/9 or 3/12 depending on if you count the Japanese members as ""active"" idols (but that was the whole premise of the show as around half the contestants there were the Japanese idols). I personally would use 0/9 (ie. 0 out of the 9 Korean contestants that made the final lineup were active idols). After School wasn't active and so Gaeun doesn't count.

* Wanna One - Sungwoon counts (Hotshot), Minhyun doesn't (NU'EST was on the verge of disbandment), so that's 1/11. You could throw Dongho in there as well, but NU'EST was disbanded, so still 1/11.

* I.O.I - Chaeyeon counts (DIA), no one else was in a debuted group yet (Pristin/Gugudan/WJSN/WeMe debuted after), so 1/11.

That's not a lot of active idols in final lineups if you ask me.",1672531391
"mormon","t5_2qky2","Funny story. Your sweeping generalization is exactly why exmos reference the CES letter so often. The biggest challenge in talking to active devout members is the fact that you're not really listening. I've been through it time after time, with family, friends, coworkers. Active members aren't interested in hearing ex members' stories, experiences, thoughts or feelings. Instead they (like you) try to find ways to dismiss them. No one leaves the church for exactly the same reason. And very very very few leave because they stumbled across the CES letter. But for some it's a useful doc to toss out rather than to share their own experiences. Because when you share your experiences with someone else and they dismiss them, it's like invalidating that person. People don't much care for that. So it's easier to toss something else out instead. 

It's funny (and by that I mean it's really not) how active members feel they're doing the world a service sharing their beliefs and stories, but feel that it's an affront when others do the same. I've watched a thousand times as members have pushed unwanted views on others, and watched just as many times as they've shut others' views down. Very rarely have I watched an active member just thoughtfully listen to an ex member.",1672531391

And the ideal situation is that we put some effort into figuring out how to enjoy them. It‚Äôs about communication and trying things until it works. Just shutting off and saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to just because you want me to‚Äù is definitely going to hurt some feelings. 

Ultimately it‚Äôs her choice what she does or not but you can‚Äôt just leave it at that. We all have to do things we don‚Äôt initially want to do sometimes. I don‚Äôt want to go spend time with her parents sometimes, or give her a massage, or let her take some time to herself while I watch the kids, but I do it anyways for her. 

I‚Äôm just saying there needs to be a lot of discussion and seeing eye to eye before you resort to blanket statements like that. Just saying I‚Äôm not into it and that‚Äôs that is quitting on your partner. Is there some way that she can get herself into it? Has she tried? There‚Äôs more to it than just shutting down if you‚Äôre not immediately into it.

For example I might not want to go see her parents but I can think of conservations i might want to have with them, or take a nap beforehand if I‚Äôm tired. For a massage I can think of how much she‚Äôd appreciate it and how it might be relaxing for me or put on headphones and listen to a podcast.

"abusiverelationships","t5_2ua08","I recommend following Nicole LaPera/the Holistic Psychologist on Instagram or reading her book, How to Do the Work.  I've learned a lot from her. Please don't feel that you need someone else to validate your pain, you feeling that it was bad and painful is valid enough. I wonder too, if you feel like you are an attention seeker because your feelings/emotions/pain WERE invalidated as a child. It is okay to have feelings, to need attention, to voice your emotions. I grew up in a household that suppressed my needs and opinions, even punished me for showing emotion. I myself have forgotten a lot of the memories and details, except for the more traumatic events. I only realized this recently in therapy. However, my nervous system has not forgotten. The anxiety and stress from growing up in that environment still remains. I definitely recommend talk therapy as well, or journaling if you prefer writing.

Also, sometimes is takes years from being out of an abusive situation for someone to finally realize that they were in one. The brain really does try to cope by normalizing and suppressing.

I'll be honest, I looked at your post history. As some also with an ED and BD, it took me too long to realize that focusing on eating/controlling food intake/ and then binging was majorly related to my out of control childhood/emotional suppression.",1672531395

"fuckHOA","t5_3ej9f","There should be like a charity or fund or something informing people that a HOA is a terrible thing and makes no sense as far as land ownership goes. 

It seems like there are many reasons why people should agree on reporting local laws or bylaws, but none that can just hold a person's life

Making a HOA disbandment cause would probably leave a lot of our buying power alone to ourselves as well

Housing values will go up or down, a HOA is just ""the line most go up"" version of wall street (mostly up with the new babies every generation)

It always collapses on the well meaning people. And the vast majority of the sociopaths. So why not be safe and just find a home where you like that you can sell for something that's not just renting and dumping your money into the void.

I'm planning on buying soon but not here. Not North America because this is such a shit throwing festival of accidents.

I'd like a nice place to send my kids, show them the world. USA and Canada are on the rim of things. Also New Zealand does not exist. So they will be the first to explore their culture.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","High effort posts deserve high effort replies. I'll do my best to honor that sentiment.

Round 1:  Jedi are a non-factor in this, IMO. When facing actually competent enemies firing kinetic projectiles at high velocities, light-sabers do little to block. While they could attempt to use the force to stop the bullets, the fact remains that the Spartans and space marines will deploy a huge volume of fire, regardless of cover. However, the tau are have a pretty good range advantage, especially with the sniper drones. However, Linda has had some pretty impressive shots, and with the help of cortona, should be able to neutralize the drones.  **8/10**

Not to mention, the battle will take place in a town with a lot of cover, so the range advantage is further nullified.

In essence, you've put a team good at exclusively close range and long range tactics against a much more well rounded team. I don't see how the second team could win.

Round 2: Given that the first team is unaware of the second, I think the jedi might be able to force a death trap. However, I fail to see how they would be able to overcome the much higher reaction times of the Spartans and space marines. Not to mention, neither team is dumb and will stick in a single pack. They will spread out, and try to win by attrition (something Team 1 is good at).  **7/10**

Round 3: Same as round 1, but even worse considering the hyperintelligent cortona will be able to take advantage of round 2's confusion. **9.5/10**

Round 4: You are talking about a -50 wind chill. We are talking 10 minutes to frost bite, hypothermia doesn't take much longer.  Spartans are fine with this thanks to their suits. I am not aware of any space marine cold resistance, so I will leave it here. The Jedi are absolutely screwed. Same deal as with the space marines with the tau. Thus, it devolves into a worse round 1.  **9/10**

Bonus rounds 2&amp;3 are fully stomps for round 1, that equipment is no joke.  **9.5/10**

Bonus round 1 is interesting. The drones could probably overwhelm linda, in which case the match devolves into a 6/10 brawl, advantage team 1.",1672531396

I am saying that this is a misrepresentation of the actual information presented in the article they get that click bait number from, and that in context that 90% seems to be caused by a faulty algorithm selectively removing one kind of perceived hate very thoroughly, rather than an actual disproportionate hatred of white men. 

The statistic isn't faulty, the way it is presented out of context and the way it is being used to back a narrative of persecution are.

Survivorship bias is when you skew your data by focusing on the things that pass your specific criteria (in this case posts removed by the hate speech algorithm) while ignoring those that don't, resulting in a skewed picture of the issue.

In this case focusing on only what was caught by the algorithm creates a narrative of extremely disproportionate hate aimed at white men, and ignores that this only counts what the algorithm removed while ignoring both what may have been wrongly removed and all of the hate speech that wasn't.

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","I'm pretty sure the reason Leviathan is a dlc and not in the main game is because Bioware simply didn't have the idea for it until after the game was released, likely after the extended endings failed to fully assuage the fan outrage. So the Leviathan was an idea that came out of trying to find a more satisfying explanation for why the Reapers were doing what they do. It still didn't settle all of the anger, so eventually they just made the Citadel DLC as a way of just giving everyone a satisfying conclusion to end the game on.

The Omega DLC was definitely foreshadowed by the game, since it is an obvious result of Aria's storyline and is foreshadowed by her outright saying she's going to take Omega back someday. But Leviathan comes out of nowhere - there is no hint toward it until it's dropped on your lap (other than deep lore hints that could have had other explanations).",1672531396

I was their HRIS and benefits supervisors (being massively underpaid and over worked) I was fed up after they told me I was over paid and not managing my time well and they put my desk in front of the new HR director to keep an eye on me. This was after 10 years of managing their entire benefits and HRIS, but ofcourse when leadership changes no one knows. I left in the middle of open enrollment and an HRIS implementation for them to figure it out. No notice. Nothing. Just a sarcastic note that said that they were right, I over estimated my value so it should be no problem to replace me and feel that the advice to move on was great. Apparently the HR director (who was later fired) cried and freaked out. It was a beautiful disaster

I never said women cant think for themselves. Quite the opposite. This one is important. I actually believe women are capable of being adults and making their decisions. I said people like you dont consider women equal adults because merely being manipulative and *coercing* women into sex work is borderline sex trafficking for you. And thats the problem with todays society, weak and soft people are celebrated, zero accountability, can blame patriarchy, toxic masculinity and everyone else for your decisions. Us men - we dont have the luxury. You either put in the work and improve yourself or you are a loser and absolutely no one cares about your struggles - which is fine. Im not even go into the non binary thing. Dont litter your mind with ideologies that have dogmas that cant be questioned. The ideologies that dont care about the individual but care about the the group you belong to are very dangerous. All isms know the answer before the question and are not open for honest discussion. 


 Stop saying strawmanning without calling out on exact thing I said. I get it, you think manipulating women is borderline sextrafficking and people like that should be in prison. No one in the fucking world would ever care about men being coerced. Like wtf is that? Kindergarten? This is my final reply. Ill happily disagree with you.

"TheExpanse","t5_2xi70","The Sol system invested majorly into the ring gate systems and was counting on the ROI's to sustain itself. Think about how countries today trade with each, how much plant/capital/equipment is distributed around the world, the logistics of the whole operation in terms of trucks/rail/ships/pipelines/etc. there are in today's global supply chain, and then have every continent in the world except Europe suddenly disappear along with all of their resources and productive capacity. Also, it's winter. What happens to Europe?

Earth was already severely depleted before the events of Leviathan Wakes and then it suffered a costly war with Mars, an asteroid bombardment and subsequent global impact winter, and then another war with Laconia which culminated in the occupation of Sol. At the same time, every interstellar investment Sol made from the time of the rings opening and their closing was lost all at once, including all the goods which were in transit at the time. Just the economic fallout on a ledger basis would've caused wide-spread asset toxicity and crippled the entire economy, let alone the tangible consequences in terms of things like insufficient energy for heating due to the sudden loss of energy imports.

I'm not sure Sol would've even had enough ships or people left to make the Belt operational again considering how many of them were off-system when the rings shut down. The plant and capital invested in the Belt were probably re-deployed to the colonies long ago or would've been left derelict and would've necessitated rebuilding/refurbishment before they became operational again, let alone the politics of a post-gate collapse between Earth, Mars, the Belt, and the Laconian remnant.",1672531401

"TenantHelp","t5_2xuez","Much of what you‚Äôve asked is dependent upon your municipality.  Within CA, statewide most rentals must adhere to AB 1482, the tenant protection act.   Paraphrasing here, but it caps increases at 10% per year (5% market rate and up to an additional 5% based on inflation).  Length of tenancy is immaterial to rent increases.  A LL can terminate a lease with cause (specific reasons allowed under 1482).  You can google AB 1482 and its provisions.  Note that not all rentals fall under 1482 (our SFHs are all exempt, as are any units built within the last 15 years, and other exceptions) so you‚Äôll first want to understand if your property is subject or not to 1482.  A good explanation of the allowable rent increases and notice periods is found in the [CA Tenant‚Äôs Rights Handbook](https://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/California-Tenants-Guide.pdf). 

Depending upon where you‚Äôre located you may have additional protections from local rent control laws that are more stringent than AB 1482, such as Alameda, Oakland, San Francisco, LA, etc.  Research your local city laws to understand if you have further protections.",1672531401

AITA? 
Long story short, my husband of 4 years had an affair with a coworker...he currently still works there and sees HER. 
He doesn't always work with her but this past Friday he did. His family's Christmas party was that following Saturday. I told him I couldn't see his family because I was in too much emotional pain. He decided it was OK if I don't go but that he was going to go to the party still, without me, and take our 2 girls (2.5 years and 18 months).
I am furious that I am spending Christmas eve alone because he's a cheater....so AITA?

"stalker","t5_2r74m","Chernobylite was surprisingly good and fun. RPG-lite systems such as dialogue interactions, consequences of choice, and relationship statuses with individual. As well as an XP leveling system with perks and points to upgrade your preferred play style.

Voice acting was very likable and cool. The Russian voicing with English subtitles made it immersive, and every character is chock full of charisma and style. Loved the dialogue and acting.

Graphics are actually amazing, which is interesting when you consider the relatively low budget the game had. Then again, the original STALKER trilogy was budgeted on a small Ukrainian dev team too.

Music is good, atmospheric, and a bit cliche. Some of the game also has cliche horror. But still enjoyable. 

Overall? 8.5/10. Didn't regret it at all. Solid good time.",1672531402

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","This pretty much. Ranked and QP are very similar. Difference is it gives you a rank so you can see if the games thinks you're getting better, worse, or maintaining.

If you're worried about ruining it for other players then two things. Mute chat. Some people are just super anxious. Use pings instead. The second thing is.. it's ranked, it is not professional. You'll be put into games with people around your skill level so if you feel like you're dragging your team down.. well chances are they are doing the same thing so don't worry about it.

Ranked is just intramural sports with a handicap applied to keep things fair. Go for it.",1672531402
