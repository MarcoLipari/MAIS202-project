"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Okay, so (as you can tell from my posts elsewhere in this thread) I am very vocally **pro**-vaccine. Viruses and other pathogens are as big of an existential threat to humanity as you can get. On a population level, we *must* vaccinate if we want to have a snowball's chance in hell of having a healthy(ish) society that cares about and protects its most vulnerable members.

**HOWEVER** - at the individual (rather than population) level, unless you happen to be in an area with a currently-ongoing outbreak of the specific diseases for which we vaccinate, the *realistic* difference is going to be somewhere around zero. Not exactly zero, but not very non-zero.

Now - I personally would go with Pediatrician A, not only (and not even so much) as because of personal safety or philosophic reasons, but because of what each respective pediatrician is *signaling*. I personally prefer someone who takes a hard line based on contemporary medical research over someone who is willing to waffle because of Internet-inspired pearl-clutching. I don't argue with my accountant and I don't argue with my lawyer and I don't argue with my plumber - because if I thought I knew better then them, I wouldn't be bloody-well wasting my money on them. Same thing with doctors - I do my research, I can read Wikipedia and various online twaddle as well as anyone, but at the end of the day I don't have an MD.

this if from your pov.

Start on his left arm.  this is what seduces which is the biggest threat, burn that down asap. normally the wing and left leg dies by the time the arm is dead.

After that jump up and kill the left and middle head, the reason for this is the middle head does damage to the ground.

After you kill the 2 heads, assuming everything on the left side is dead, just stand on the ground and inch your way to the tail, you should not be taking any damage, his tail can one shot you, never ever ever be on the ground on the right hand side.

once the tail is done its ezpz, just kill the right arm and right head. the right wing and leg are always already dead from attacking other things.

i would assume op is probably getting one shot from tail damage which is easily avoidable, you shouldn't even move to the right side untill the tail is already dead in case you fall or whatever. seduce arm is top priority.

Having Arts NP doesn't help either, they are hard to be fully utilized for her own brave chaining, since she won't get the 20% NP, for comparison Buster will still deals even more damage in Buster Chain, and Quick still gives 10 star bonus in Quick chain, Arts, basically they are 'used up' of its usefulness after reaching 100% NP.  


Her actives, are not so bad, but really not specialized either, having secondary on Mind's Eye is not desirable, since Mind's eye should be saved for enemy NP, and critical damage should actually be flexible, their functionality are contrasted that it's impossible to be fully utilized except by sacrificing other effect.  


Also, being old gen servants suffers, they are HEAVILY outclassed by the sheer utility of newer servants, while DW seemed to anticipate Gil's consistency (because AUO), this isn't the case with Orion (nor Atilla).  



The little tidbits, she has Sky, Divinity, and Archer class. 

Being an Archer, she will deal 0.95 than she actually is, so let's reduce her base attack by 550~, Sky deals slightly more damage against Earth and deals lesser damage against Man, most of the servant in the game are Man.  


Now her signature skill, Anti-Male, seems so good, 50% damage, but let's see, it's only active for a turn, there are only few monster which is classified as 'Male' and most annoying and strong servant bosses are Female. 

Artemis herself is classified as 'Male', since it's Orion who was identified as the servant, she's an absolute nightmare as bosses. But isn't as deadly in player's hand.",1451606415

He got me a Zomei tripod and a Manfrotto minipod.

Haven't used either yet, but will do so tonight in Vegas. 

He also got me an IR remote and a Joby torchlight. 

Very happy with the haul this year. 

I ended up getting him the 35mm f1.8. He's pretty happy as well. ",1451606417

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","If your computer is already compromised TOR will do no good

Running vulnerable applications like torrents will also compromise you and Other people on network

You  may want to  modify your torrc file and avoid exit nodes in 5  eyes

As mentioned already here and on TOR website, enable NoScript always. Also remember TOR is just for TCP

You can isolated VMs like Whonix or Booting Tails or PfSense + windows to only allow TOR connection

If you are paranoid use VPN + Isolated TOR

And then there are rogue nodes. A adversary controlling both your exit and entry node can de anonymize you (Although this very hard). Avoiding this 100% is hard. Running own Exit node and using it may help but tor changes circuit every 10 mins on normal so you will need many exit nodes to remain normal.

And yea there is nothing to worry abt someone breaking the encryption unless they build a quantum computer

I cant give links for further reading as i am on mobile. But google is your best friend. You may wanna startup with the TOR white paper and other research papers

You may already know this, but there's a great ridesharing application to make it much easier for people to attend Bernie events together, **and ultimately go to caucuses and polls together with the goal of increasing voter turnout!** It’s called RideWithBernie and it's integrated into the official Bernie 2016 Event map. There's just 3 simple steps to set up your rideshare and make Bernie proud:

1) Locate and click on the event you wish to attend on [this map](http://www.bernie2016events.org/#zipcode=&amp;distance=50&amp;eventtype=R&amp;eventtype=CW&amp;eventtype=E&amp;eventtype=D&amp;eventtype=B&amp;eventtype=O&amp;daterange=all-events) and then click on the blue “carpool” button on the event popup.  

2) A page will appear with basic instructions that say: *How ridesharing works: Fill out a quick profile. Contact nearby drivers or passengers. Confirm with text/phone calls.* - click to the next page.  

3) Then, just fill out your first name, phone number, and location you’ll be leaving from in the text boxes - and then you’re done with set up!

"Xcom","t5_2si6x","The jump from Normal to Classic feels like a difficult spike because that is the point at which the game starts to teach you about loss and how to deal with it.

Several changes from Normal to Classic make this apparent:

* The A.I is unshackled, meaning they will (almost) always take the ""best"" course of action against you. They'll do things like aggressively take flanking shots or lure you toward other pods if the pod has a single survivor. Sometimes, they'll forgo a shot to lob a pinpoint accurate grenade at you. You have to study and learn all the enemy's new tricks and traps if you want to survive.

* Having a satellite over a country is no longer guaranteed to keep them in the project. At max panic, a country has a 50/50 chance of defecting even with a sat. Without a sat, up to 4 countries can leave at a time, rather than 2. You have to race to stop abductions completely if you want to stay safe.

* You do not start with a free sat, making panic management in the beginning that much harder. You also don't start with the OTS, making getting those squad level upgrades take longer. Your tactical play has to compensate for this.

* Global panic starts at 8 rather than 0, meaning countries get to red panic even faster with fewer abductions. Unless the RNG is absolutely perfect, you'll need to learn to go without some funding or bonuses.

* Soldiers get -1 HP, meaning they die easier to even normal shots without ranks or armor to keep them safe, especially early on. Aliens also get a plethora of stat bonuses, too. You have to learn and get confident enough to bring lesser ranked troopers in the tactical game to absorb losses you would not have had in normal.

Getting that perfect play on Classic is very difficult and at times up to RNG completely. But trust me when I say that you are meant to lose some things in Classic. That jump in difficulty is all about learning to cope and carry on despite taking a licking.  

Impossible is similar, but takes it to the extreme. You have to carry on with even less.",1451606431

"politics","t5_2cneq","The problem with your argument, the thing that totally invalidates it is that you assume that any form or definition of ""conservative"" (or ""Conservative"") equates to racism. 

Racists can be conservative, liberal, socialist, progressive, libertarian, or apolitical.

There is no causal connection between conservatism and racism. If you think I am wrong then provide proof. Simply because someone is a conservative and a racist does not mean that trait is consistent among all conservatives. Racism is a personal defect. 

Conservatives are opposed to Liberal political philosophy. Liberal philosophy is a strict, static path towards socialism and control over the people by elites. Liberal philosophy is no longer a simple desire to expand rights and freedom as was the classical definition at the time of the founding fathers.

[My Fleet](http://i.imgur.com/iOx9bbN.jpg?1)

For my first (half) year, it has been very progressive overall. A lot of hard-to-get ships have came in this short time (Yamato, Akizuki, etc.) so I'm really grateful for that. Overall just the growth of the fleet and all the progress through the maps and Spring-Fall events are my pride and joy. Notable shoutouts to: 

-**Haruna** (especially) for finding Yamato, single handedly carrying Spring and Summer events while the fleet was still in its infancy, and just being the prime vanguard of the fleet.

-Choukai for her contributions in clearing event and monthly EO maps. Your sister is the Queen of AA saving the fleet from the plight of bombers, but you are the executioner with your god-hand day and night battles. Others helped wipe floor of enemy fleets, but you were always the one to put the final nail in the coffin.

-Yukikaze for her godly cut-ins in the darkest hours. Another event and monthly EO star, your torpedoes sank even the most ruthless of bosses in times the rest of the fleet was heavily damaged. 

-Shoukaku for being boss despite her short time. I promise to get you to K2A before January ends.
-Everyone else in the fleet. There's too much to name, every ship has their special moment and their contributions this past half year have impacted the fleet one way or another. 

-And then there's you guys here. Thanks for the tips, advices, memes, etc. It's been great so far, keep it up for the next year.

For the next year, Musashi and Zuikaku are top priorities. Teruzuki and Unryuu if the chance comes by. Their sisters are lonely without their siblings around. Also to be more prepared for events and overall stockpiling. All my events thus far always start with average 20k resources and 100 buckets...absolutely horrid for farming and progression in general. Lastly, learning to fleet set-up properly without always relying on guides, advice, composition suggestions etc. Too often have I stuck to looking up info for maps and compositions and following everything word for word, really doesn't help if there's certain equipments or ships I lack.

Happy New Years everyone.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Everything is distant, and empty. It's like your soul is dead. I've been able to will myself to work, function, and do well, but every social interaction is taxing and hollow. It is like another job. It is an act. You forget what happiness and sadness *feel* like. Imagine a spiral that keeps repeating, an optical illusion. A broken record. That is how your thoughts play out. On repeat. All the time. You forget how to be human.

From that hollow interaction, You realize how lonely you are, and that this is how it will always be for the rest of your life. Even though you crave a connection, it doesn't seem truly plausible. If you have people around you all the time, you're still always alone. You will die alone and be forgotten within a generation or two. You want to be forgotten. Humanity will be forgotten eventually. The cold, expansive universe does not care that you or anyone else are here.

It is a weakness that hides behind absolute truth. It is a leech that sucks the life from your soul and a sickness, a weight, that clings to every inch of your flesh, working hand in hand with gravity and decay to lure you into your grave. It is a whisper that you do not belong to this world, and only to the void will you feel at ease. The void calls us all home.

Personally, I don't think it's used to portray Avery &amp; Dassey as innocent, but I suppose some might view it that way.

"asianbros","t5_34gxb","I'll give a shot at explaining. The Asian financial crisis is an uncommon black swan event, unluckily, China faces even worse challenges that require hoarding of trillions in reserves. China, for example, has huge capital outflows every month that devalues their currency. To stem the outflows China needs to prop up the currency and the only way to do that is with reserves. China has reserves because of problems like this, a lack of stability in its own currency, lack of trust in its own currency, and finally leading it to value having the currency of its worse rival more than its own. This is really bad. China is a huge country and should have no problems spending its money and borrowing at great rates... yet it does. Because the economy is not stable and the country is not stable. Avoid mainstream media like the plague on any economic topics. People like Romney have been saying that China devalues its currency in order to support exports. However this is not really true, has no desire to devalue its currency because it corporations borrow massive amounts of dollars. If Yuan goes down billions of dollars of debt will be added to corporate balance sheets. What China is doing is propping up the Yuan (with reserves) to support the corporations. However in order to get into the SDR China would need to let the Yuan float more, hence the current devaluation. See ""Mundell's Triangle Theory.""

So yes having reserves is better than not having reserves, but not needing reserves is better than having reserves. China should stabilize its currency and political situation and then spend all the reserves, invest in the military, education, healthcare, one belt one road, environment, etc there's tons of things to do. Hoarding cash is a sign of weakness, hopefully by 2030 or whenever you think China will become a real superpower this situation will be reversed itself.

Japan's reserves are political baggage because it has a high debt to GDP ratio. Meaning, it buys T-bills because America wants it to buy T-bills. There are a bunch of books about this. In reality the reserves are barely relevant considering Japan's own debts.

Other Asian countries like Korea and Taiwan have a geopolitically insignificant amount of reserves. But you can be sure their T-bills are also politically motivated.",1451606435

As for Lucas, he's out. If the prequels and the edits to the originals were ""his vision"", then I'm good to let him go. So I think your friends are wrong to treat that as a valid complaint against the movie. They shouldn't judge this based on what some other guy *might* have done.  

Still, the movie does have problems. I didn't like some of the odd conveniences, like Luke's lightsaber being on a random planet at a random cantina.

"pureasoiaf","t5_3288z","""King"" is relative.  There's a notion that the blood of a king is powerful not because some schmuck recognizes him as king but because of the king's force of personality and inherent nobility.  Mance is a good example, because he wasn't born a king but was given that power by acclamation.  Khal Drogo was obviously a king as well, and Daenerys is obviously a queen.  Robert Baratheon was obviously a king.  Stannis... less obviously, though for some reason Melisandre thinks he is.

Here's something to think about: Robert's children.  He had a whole bunch of them.  Gendry.  Edric Storm.  Mya Stone.  Bella.  Plus more in King's Landing that were killed.  Jon Arryn was going about ""the seed is strong"", whatever that meant, but we have good reason to suspect that there's some way in which Robert Baratheon passed his king's blood to his children just by being their father.  It is *not* clear that Joffrey and Tommen, despite sitting on that metal chair, ever had king's blood.

For the characters I think of as having king's blood, just look at the leaders we know of.  Jon Snow, *yes*.  You can argue that he got it from Rhaegar.  Maybe.  Also with king's blood: Euron.  Neither is actually king, but both have the kind of larger-than-life personality that being king requires.  My guess is that this is what king's blood is.",1451606440

At this level it's mostly a case of understanding that the software is generally built to do X and your actual business process is Y and finding a way of making them work together. 

The core of what an ERP does is hold records and moves the data.  Basically like a massive spreadsheet that everyone can work on at once.  

Someone else in your company obviously signed off on the decision to implement this ERP, so don't stick your neck out.  Start to break each of the core business processes down and document them.  

This consulting company is obviously going to be doing the brunt of the work.  From what you have described they should be the technical and functional experts in the system.  At this point you want to make someone else sign off on EVERYTHING.

SQL requirements, server hardware specs, user functionality etc.  You basically get to play the role of managing the whole thing.  Personally I think it can be a really good career move and easy money, but if it's not what you want to be doing I would make that clear to your management ASAP.

When I started I was around the average age for the player base.cas I got 2 years older I began to get a little lover, but at the same time as every 8 year old in the fucking universe was getting their I pad, the pocket edition was rising in popularity. Suddenly I found the average fans age plummet to 4 years below me. That was a total turn off. On top of that the game was beginning to just become shitty modded servers. I wanted some vanilla fun like I had been doing for the past year. At the same time because a lot of mine craft you tubers began noticing a shift in their demographic, their content also changed in order to better accommodate that demographic. A rather small youtube I had been subscribed to since about 20,000 subs and was a fun guy (jeromeASF) later came on to become in the top 50 most subscribed channels on youtube. He completely changed his channel around in order to attract more viewers. Mine craft was becoming a business. Most mega servers would last 1/2-2 years and have some cool gamemodes, but there were always perks that made it pay to win. That really killed it for me. On top of that the uber popular team crafted nexus server was more like spy to play since higher paying people had priority into games.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I gave up on nursing bras after my first kid.  It's surprisingly difficult to find actual nursing bras past a certain cup size.  I sure as heck didn't wear them in the hospital, but I'm the sort of person who doesn't wear a bra unless it's 100% necessary (as in, I'm not entirely sure where my one and only bra *is* at this point).  I've never in my nursing life worn a nursing tank.  They just don't exist in my cup size at all, near as I can tell.  (I'm a J-cup at this point, and praying they don't get larger again once my milk comes in like they tend to.)  Both things, to me, go in the category of ""Probably nice to have for most people.""  

I've never done a birth plan.  Well, I've written them out for myself, but never turned one in.  In theory, if you have one it should be in your file, but I'd definitely print out a copy to hand to your nurse when you're in a room.

I've never given my nurses a gift.  I've intended to give something to the midwives, but never managed to.  You will have one or two nurses during your labor and probably the same during recovery (depending upon shift change), but once you are on the postpartum floor things can get a little weird.  One hospital I was at was a teaching hospital and I lost count of how many different nurses I saw.

As far as a lactation consultant goes, I'd call and ask questions beforehand, especially about training.  I had a hospital admin for the system I deliver at brag that all of their nurses are trained in lactation, but when pressed he couldn't tell me *how* they were trained, and honestly my experience has not been positive overall, though to be fair, at this hospital someone always did stop by to see if I needed help.  If you've got the finances, and have trouble, you want an IBCLC-certified lactation consultant.  You may not need one at all, though.  It's possible to have problems breastfeeding, but it's also possible not to, and occasionally getting hung up on doing it the ""right"" way makes things harder.",1451606447

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Yeah. Some games that are more like Risk, include Nexus Ops and Kemet.

**Nexus Ops** (1-2 hours/up to 4 players): It's a light hex-based war game where attacking and winning battles is how you win. Combat is resolved through dice rolls and there are different units you can buy which have different combat values and different abilities. You're all basically space trading companies hiring alien soldiers to fight for you over resources. Game ends when someone gets 8-10 victory points. You get victory points by winning a fight as an attacker or by completing secret missions that you get per round.

**Kemet** (2-3 hours/up to 5 players): If you want something with more depth and no luck, you can get Kemet. It's another attacky war game where you play as egyptian soldiers fighting for their respective god. Combat are resolved through card-based combat (everyone has the same 6 cards) and there is a tech tree that is shared by everyone. (Techs are basically things you spend money on to have its permanent effect in front of you.) It's a lot heavier than nexus ops, but if you have people that hate dice it's really recommended.

Nexus Ops is naturally easier to learn and play, but I prefer Kemet as it tends to be more epic and plays a bit longer. The only thing you really have to do about Kemet is print out a page for each player that details all of the tech in the game. If you have that, the game becomes a lot easier to play and once everyone has had a game or two under the belt, has a lot less downtime waiting for a person to make their move.",1451606448

There's some suggestion that Dragons aren't actually natural but are firewyrm-Wyvern (wyverns live in Sothoyros) hybrids that were created (possibly) at Gorgossos (or maybe Yeen)?

Also...given that there are rumours that animal-hybrids experiments (possible leading to 'the blood of the dragon') were also performed there, perhaps the ""lizardmen"" aren't natural but *freaks* left over from the earlier hybrid experiments?

Yo creo que hay evidencia super solida, pero es una bomba para la construccion de realidad de las personas. Es como si a una comunidad religiosa le quitas de golpe la existencia de Dios.
Por ende la humanidad protege su sanidad mental, buscando la explicacion ""racional"", que siempre va a estar, si uno la busca.

La ufologia es mucho mas esceptica que el criterio de la gente comun, son los primeros en descartar y estar alerta a los fraudes.

Pero por darte un ejemplo:

esta foto no es borrosa:

http://www.billymeierufocase.com/images/quiz3/quiz3-6.jpg

Cual es la respuesta? es demasiado nitido para ser real: es claramente un modelo.

Entonces la gente esta dispuesta a aceptar evidencias suficientemente borrosas para ser suficientemente inexplicable por metodos tradicionales.

Cuando si aplicaramos solo el sentido comun nos dariamos cuenta que es ilogico que nos sintamos tan soberbios en ser la unica inteligencia en todo el universo.

La pregunta no es si existen los extraterrestres. la logica indica que de seguro existen.

la duda esta en si nos han contactado.

Pero nuestra razon nos fuerza a intentar explicar los moais (por ejemplo) con rudimentarios metodos de troncos.

Thus is the former is okay so is the later.

------------

Seperately I do know a bit about American history. I never said Americans never had the right to demand independance, I said it wasnt really neccesary to fight for it as they wouldve been granted it freely. They did have the right to fight for it, which they did, but just because they have the right to doesnt mean they must exercise that right.

However it was hypocritical of them to fight and demand independence then turn around and deny independence for the confederacy and use force of arms to prevent independence in that case.

"Mistborn","t5_2s9ue"," I have problems with the Bechdel test, namely that it overly generalizes and it's often used as the sole justification to criticize a work. Just reading that wiki page, Mistborn passes both the ""Sexy lamp"" test, and the Sphinx test. [If we include the second trilogy, it also passes the Russo test](/spoiler). 

That said, I think it narrowly passes this test as well. I'm almost positive that Vin talked to noblewomen about things such as house politics and merchant deals. Also, I think a lot of Tindwyl's conversations would count, as there is a difference between having a conversation *about* a man and having a conversation which *mentions* a man.

All that said, I would tend to agree with you that women aren't super well represented in this novel/trilogy of novels. I imagine a lot of it can be explained away by setting or story reasons (Vin being a bit of a loner, or the setting being in a time when women were not super involved outside the home), and to be honest, I can't think of a time to include more interaction which wouldn't feel forced, but nonetheless it is lacking. It is a shame, and I hope you are able to read past it as they truly are good books.

The trap door used to release the ""bombs"" is the first one of that type I've seen, but I've only recently started buying new Lego sets. 

I did go back and forth quite a bit before buying because of how far above the $0.1 per piece rule of thumb the pricing was but I think the larger average piece size balances that out. I got it for $90, which is significantly cheaper than the $120 converted price you're dealing with, though.

Rengar is in this weird spot where his kit is instagib someone with no counterplay and forces the entire enemy team to always be as 5 and to always have their cam locked on themselves with their fingers on flash/hourglass, its just a retarded design and everyone has faced that rengar that does this to them ... even when he isn't that big he can still do that. Hes a feast or famine champion, hes either worthless or broken and no just because hes worthless sometimes doesn't justify it. His kit is also not a kit that can be fixed by nerfs or buffs, change any number on his kit and he will still be feast or famine just more towards one or the other. The champion needs yet another rework.

**Akali** - Shes a stat check... she either kills you or doesn't, there is no real outplay potential on her kit or skill its all just click them.

**Annie** - So much damage CC AoE thats instant. Annie is easy and there should be easy champs but not with this mechanic. She has so much instant gauranteed damage that is backed by CC, late game Annie can end games with Flash+R which just shouldnt be the case. She needs reliability changes badly on her kit. I actually thought of the changes I'd make to make her more interesting with more counterplay as well.

Then, on Halloween, I topped for a scene that went fantastically, splendidly, *ohmygodwhatisthisfeeling* well, and it feels like my inner Domme has bloomed in an outburst of fiery glory--and now I want to learn ALL OF THE THINGS. I've been practicing simple rope ties and will be investing in some canes and a needle kit as well! 

I'm planning to dedicate time this year into developing my skills and style as a top and practicing with my kinky friends whenever possible. I've always been envious of the magnetically confident tops in the local scene and am so ridiculously excited to finally (sort of) feel that way too!

The reason they are slow is probably because there is not one person with an exclusive job to recruit, screen and support volunteers OR the person in that role hasn't had proper training. The number one complaint of people that want to volunteer is that they never hear back from agencies that they apply with that volunteer, or, by the time they hear from them, they aren't available for volunteering anymore.

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","There's is literally all the evidence to support it. 

Every single wheel and tyre wind tunnel test I've seen, as well as rolling resistance tests comes out (on current wheel and tyre combinations) 25c or larger. 

The only reason some tyres come out with an Aero advantage for a 25 is based on the wheel and tyre combinations.

Continental notes their 28c gp4000 has the lowest rolling resistance, as did independent tests (I didn't study the results in detail of tyres I don't use, so my brain has gp4000s2 figures)

I don't recall seeing any pro bike video (gcn does lots of those) running anything smaller than a 25.

I'm sure there are people who prefer running what they are used to, I'm sure there are manufacturers keen on people using other combinations (the advantages are slight but they exist) but going forwards, bigger is better.

All things being equal, at the same tyre pressure, the larger tyre has a lower rolling resistance. Thanks physics!
There is a sweet spot however as we want to run lower pressures on larger tyres.

Agree

&gt;  Definitely not as much value for money.

This is true. But the price we pay is largely a function of our wealth. That is why a big mac costs more in Aspen than Houston. More expensive employees, more expensive real estate, etc. 

If we switched to socialized medicine, the cost of things would be relatively unchanged if we kept the services the same. Compare a US hospital where th delivery rooms look like a suit at a Four Seasons hotel versus the group rooms with peeling paint in the UK where patients are dying from dehydration. 

Night and day. 

The reason we've not adopted single payer is because prices will go up even more. Some states have tried, they aborted when they looked at the economics. 

&gt; because healthcare is a right

Hahaha. Good one. Healthcare isn't a right. Owning a gun is a right. Healthcare is not. 

&gt;  Nobody should ever have to chose between health and fun.

But members of the EU do this all the time. The EU has crushing taxes on the working poor. The poor in this country have more disposable income than the middle class in Europe. 

Our working poor could easily afford health care on average. But as Obama said, they opt to spend it on other things. 

&gt; If you're so lacking in empathy you'd rather people suffered than help them you have my pity.

If a 4-person family has 4 iphones with data plans, DirectTV with Sunday sports packages, 3 cars less than 6 year old, and manages 2 nice but not lavish vacations a year, would you say they have enough money for health care? All of these items are optional. 

If they dont' have health care because they don't have enough money left over, should we ask a more frugal person to pay for it?

&gt; I feel good my tax money goes to helping those in need

$0.50 of your tax money that goes to help poor people is wasted in the machine known as government. You should demand better. With just a shred of competency from the government, we could almost double the help we give people in this country. 

Why not focus on competency from gov instead?

&gt; helping others is part of being human, rather than being a cunt.

Except, you aren't helping anyone with more taxes except gov employees and their special interest groups. Right?",1451606471

To me they demonstrate how far we have to go to reach gender equality and how pervasive the message of male=better can be in our society, to the detriment of all genders.


I see trans people not as falling prey to false ideals of different genders (though of course it's easy to slip into that trap when you strongly want to transition for innate identity reasons), but as natural allies in the fight for gender equality because they/we have spent so much time thinking about gender in relation to society and ourselves. Naturally some trans people will come to exaggerated and harmful conclusions, often driven by the pain they feel from their situation, but many/most become more thoughtful and insightful about these gender stereotypes and power dynamics through transition. In particular, people who transition from one binary gender to another often say that it's hard to transition, in either direction, and *not* end up a feminist, simply due to first-hand experience of the disparities in how people of each gender are treated.",1451606480

It's based off the reasonable belief that a person who hasn't consumed alcohol, or who knows they are not intoxicated, wouldn't refuse the test.  Essentially asking what a person has to hide.

The breathalyzer test is rather minimal, all things considered. You simply blow into a tube and a small handheld machine gauges your BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) based on alcohol presence in your breath. 

A rather simple analogy to this would be dealing with customs when coming into a nation.  If you have nothing to hide, then you're unlikely to protest the customs officers searching through your belongings.  On the other hand, if you're trying to smuggle something into the nation, you would be less likely to allow a search.

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; I don't know but it was enough that he was denied employment in that police department. and the results of that test were completely unknown by the Cincinnati police department because they never did a background check on this guy.

Maybe they felt the background check wasn't warranted. But you're making a good point here and I would be making a trivial excuse by saying that it might not have been warranted. I agree that a background check should have been given...but I'd like to hear the reason why it wasn't.

&gt; Because they killed a kid.

They did not simply ""kill a kid"". They shot a juvenile delinquent two times center of mass because he reached for his ""toy gun"", that looked just like a real pistol, that was tucked into his waist, instead of putting his hands up as commanded. What should Tamir have done? Put his hands up. What did he do instead? Not put his hands up. This is what I mean by being honest about the incident. Just flat out saying ""killed a kid"" is not being fair and accurate. It's not that simple.

Here, maybe I can paint a picture for you that would better match the extremely simplistic scenario of ""killed a kid"":

A boy is standing in an open field. A man walks by and shoots the kid in the head and walks away.

But even in this extremely cold and chilling picture, it's *still* not accurate or fair enough to simply describe the *entire* scenario as ""killed a kid"". Because the more accurate description is ""man shot kid and walked off"", not simply ""killed a kid"". Do you see the difference here?  One is an accurate depiction of events and one is a lynch mob style judgement call. It is this very thing that distinguishes our justice system from a lynch mob. We care about the *facts* and accurate depiction of events, without emotional biases. When you keep saying ""cops killed a kid"" it shows your true colors. It shows that you've let your emotions control you. We cannot be rational when we let our emotions think for us.

&gt; There is no evidence of them doing anything to verify the intentions of the kid or to determine if in fact he was a threat, that is bad policing, period.

You're not understanding the situation. This was not the rosy beautiful suburbs where gun violence never happens. This was a *known* violent area with a *history of shootings* where a previous incident involved a cop *getting shot himself*. These juicy pieces of information are what makes this not simply a ""cop kills kid"" matter and why *you* thinking the cops should've verified intentions is ill-advised. Armchair Policing is what you're doing.

&gt; Let's stop pretending that cops do no wrong and that killing a kid who had a toy gun was somehow justified.

You're doing it again. Twisting my words into something they're not and ignoring all the circumstances surrounding the event. I'm not pretending ""cops do no wrong"". I'm the one acknowledging the evidence and saying circumstances matter. In fact I feel confident in stating that by and large cops *don't* do wrong. Do you like that? Yeah, it's crazy right? Cops. On the whole and in general *don't* do wrong. Not all cops of course, but most. https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-statistics-on-how-many-good-cops-vs-bad-cops-are-out-there

The temptation to jump on the ""fuck the police"" bandwagon is so strong right now and I'm trying my best to tell people to stop getting on it and to in fact, gtfo it.

&gt; Stop defending a cop who killed a kid without following any police procedure.

Again, it's laughable (no offense) that you make such an inaccurate statement. *without following any police procedure*. Without following *any*...not one. Not one procedure followed. You may think I'm splitting hairs here but the difference between ""not following any"" and ""following at least one"" is remarkably significant.

&gt; If you're so hoped up on defending cops go to r/thinblueline and let them know you have no problem with cops killing kids.

I wish I didn't have to be thought of as being ""hopped up"" to defend cops. Like it's such a shitty thing to do to defend cops in general. Fuck'em...what have they done for me lately? Anyway, I visited that subreddit and there's like 5 posts...one of them was controversial because he linked to a CNN article that blasted, over-inflated, and blew out-of-proportion another police shooting incident. But that's pretty much par for large corporate news networks. And yeah, I'm not interested in being part of some echo chamber that just wants to talk about how good cops are. I'm here because I want to hear the opposing views and interject some sensibleness and rationality where I can and challenge preconceived notions and bandwagon mentality.

&gt; Please don't take offense but I think you're nothing but a cop apologist.

Sorry man, but I'm gonna' have to take offense to that statement. ""Nothing but a cop apologist."" Nothing...I am literally *nothing but* a *cop apologist*. Yup. That is my one and only quality. It's on my name tag ""Cop Apologist"". In the words of Homer Simpson ""Oh by the way I was being sarcastic..."" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGrpHszRhTc

Yeah so...no. Just no. Not gonna' give that one to ya'. Who am I apologizing for? Do cops need an apology? Hell no. But I like how you labeled me such a thing, it actually gives me a little insight into your personality. Only a little...but it's a start and I'll take it. :)

&gt; who knows that cops commit crimes and that those crimes are covered up but who doesn't care because it's not your kid and not your neighborhood and not your race who is getting murdered.

Aaaaaand there it is...the race card...snuck it in right at the end there. You sneaky little bugger. Yup, you got me. I apologize for racist cops everywhere. Let me please try and clear some things up.

1. Yes I know cops commit crimes.
2. I know that sometimes those crimes are covered up.
3. If it was my kid in Tamir's shoes and *I did everything in my power to stop him from playing with real pistol-looking BB guns in an area with a history of gun violence* and *he still disobeyed me* then I would *not blame the cops*. Yes. You heard me right. Oops did I just apologize for a cop killing my kid? No. I just didn't blame the cop for killing my *stupid, disobedient, cocky, thinks-he-knows-the-world, son* for *getting shot by a police officer* for *not putting his hands up*.

Gawd you must think I'm just the biggest trolling douche right now don't you? Hey everybody! This guy actually said he wouldn't blame a cop for killing his own dumbass kid! He's a monster!

But wait, it gets better because: 

&gt; and not your race who is getting murdered.

Boom...my race. The big, juicy, race card. Somebody defending a white cop for killing a black kid? Must be racism. No. How about defending a cop for following his training (however imperfect) and immediately subduing a *justifiably perceived* armed suspect with two bullets after said suspect failed to *put up his hands as ordered*. Notice the omission of race in that. Notice how *I'm* the one not bringing race into the discussion. Notice how *you* are.

But let's turn the tables, what if...and humor me for a second. What if it was a *white* kid in a predominantly *white* neighborhood getting shot by a *black* police officer?

&gt; As if naming a profession that does not have a culture of corruption erases the crimes of the police in any way or makes endemic corruption in the police somehow acceptable and reasonable.

As if that was my intention all along. To erase ""the crimes of the police in any way"". Do you actually here yourself when you type these words? Why are you insinuating that my intention is to erase the crimes of the police in any way? I'm trying to put things in perspective, not excuse police brutality. I'm trying to say that in this particular instance, corruption just might not have been a factor.

&gt; You can feel free to stop any time.

I *can* feel free...wow, what a lame thing to say. That was so passive-aggressive. I recommend being more direct: ""Please stop lecturing me."" Or if you want to be respectful and truly kind and understanding you could say: ""It's ok, we all do it."" or ""I understand. I don't mind."" and finally, if you wanted to actually be a reasonable and understanding human being, you could say: ""You know what, I pretty much asked for it and I don't mind being exposed to opposing ideas that challenge my own.""

If you've read this far, I actually do want to thank you and I do mean that sincerely. I have no idea what you're thinking right now or how you feel about me.

When we get home from vacation, I need to confirm with him that I will not be paying on my income in 2016, but he is free to pay on his income when he finds a job.  He's currently unemployed and we don't pay on unemployment insurance.

I would say the safest bet is to do something similar if you have a fair amount of excess income.  If not, the next safest thing would be to give her 5% as others have suggested, but if you don't think of your income as 50/50, this could create other problems.

"de","t5_22i0","&gt; **ZDF-Informationen: ""Keine unmittelbare Anschlagsgefahr""**

&gt; Für den Silvesterabend entschied sich die Polizei in Bayern, auf Nummer Sicher zu gehen. In den vergangenen Wochen hatte es mehrfach Terrorwarnungen in Bezug auf Bahnhöfe im Raum München gegeben. In Zusammenarbeit von Bundes- und Landesbehörden wurden diese Hinweise, in denen von möglichen Attacken mit Waffen und Sprengstoff die Rede war, als ""unglaubwürdig"" eingestuft.
&gt; 
&gt; Am Donnerstag kam dann eine neue Warnung mit ähnlichen Inhalten. Da sie nicht so schnell überprüft werden konnte, entschloss sich die bayerische Polizei, die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu erhöhen. Der Hauptbahnhof München und der Bahnhof Pasing wurden geräumt, Züge hielten nicht mehr an. Nach ZDF-Informationen aus deutschen Sicherheitskreisen bestehe aber ""keine unmittelbare Gefahr eines Anschlags"".
&gt; 
&gt; Es handele sich um Vorsichtsmaßnahmen, die angesichts der vielen Menschen, die in dieser Nacht unterwegs sind, verständlich seien. Insbesondere den Hinweis auf einen möglichen Angriff am Bahnhof Pasing halten die Ermittler für wenig glaubhaft.

Irgendwie fühl ich mich verschaukelt. Die ganze Panikmache war also eine reine Vorsichtsmaßnahme? 

Gleichzeitig dann auch solche Meldungen:

&gt; Die Polizei hat mittlerweile Kräfte aus ganz Südbayern nach München beordert. ""Mann und Maus, alles was laufen kann"", sagte ein Polizeisprecher der SZ. Auch Spezialeinheiten sind darunter. Wie viele Polizisten insgesamt im Einsatz sind, sagte der Sprecher nicht.

Wenn man vorher schon bescheid wusste und nur vorsichtshalber die Bahnhöfe abgeriegelt und auf Twitter Warnungen rausgegeben hat, warum werden diese Einheiten dann erst jetzt zusammengezogen. Alles sehr unprofessionell und vor allem unglaubwürdig.",1451606490

That is also how we ended up with online secure credit card transactions because in the early days of eBay you would have to send a check, wait for it too go through so eBay also played a major role but porn was the ones to make it secure as to protect their users from embarrassment.  As far as Blu-Ray, major movie companies like Paramount and 20th century Fox said they would support both HDDVD and Blu-Ray to give consumers a choice, but less than a week have major players in the porn industry announced they would only support Blu-Ray, those same production companies announced they were dropping support for HDDVDs and all future titles would be Blu-Ray and all that happened in a period of about 2 weeks.

You get to take up the fun mantle of the person who interjects with an 'Actually...' anytime anyone decides to discuss with you any of the popular studies of the moment.

If you train this skepticism well enough and read widely, then you should be able to hold your own in most discussions of history. You'll be no /u/anthropology_nerd, but you'll understand what they're saying and might be able to contribute once in a while.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Well I guess I'm kind of a writer by trade so it would be hypocritical of me not to be okay with it. Actually -- now that I think about it -- my official job title is writer. Basically I'm not turned off by it, but it does make me a little wary.

I would be more down with it if they were a good writer, to be honest. For two reasons:

a.) I have a lot of opinions about writing and I think it's important to support your partner's pursuits. I don't want to constantly lie and tell you your writing is good. Also I don't want to read shitty writing.

b.) ""Writer"" is like ""artist"" in so far as its a label a lot of people like to put on themselves without too much regard to their actual skill. I feel like its a label that should be earned. I draw now and then in my free time but I don't call myself an artist. My drawings are pretty basic and never leave my bedroom. You're a writer when you've spent years honing your skills and have gained the recognition of your peers or readers (most likely through a track record of published work). Of course I'm not saying this is the case for you or even that everyone should define writer this way. It's just the warning bells go off for me when someone gives themselves such a vague title.

This being said I normally date quantitative skills dudes partially because I'm a lot more judgmental about writing/books/literature than most topics.",1451606500

Each of these candidates shape their supporters reality, just look at the terror attacks on Planned Parent hood clinics for an understanding of what lies can do.

My basic process for these is:

1) Check out new features, new posts on sub. See if any of them provide inspiration. (Seeing new techniques such as heart-masking,  Input object in 0.2 leads to new developments)

2) If that fails, pick a random game and try to create it in Unitale. (Flappy Bird, Underkart.)

3) Have a list on your computer or phone of any and all random ideas that come to mind for anything ever. I have a notes folder that has everything from minecraft mod ideas to ideas for Wipeout (the TV show) obstacles. Anything that pops into your mind, no matter how stupid, goes in there if you would ever want to think about it later. That way when you need ideas for whatever, you look in that, browse the ideas, and hopefully something comes up. The side effect is you get reminded how stupid you were a couple years back when you came up with these ideas and thought they were good.",1451606500

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I'm the same way man. I used to be all about ""social justice."" I moved into the poorest neighborhood in town with some like-minded friends, I even tried sleeping on the streets on occasion to understand (to the best extent I could) homelessness and poverty. I did this for four years. by the end of it, I was just really jaded.

One thing that sucked when I pretended to be homeless is that no one wanted to make eye contact with me. I remember we slept near a major arena after a large basketball game. Everyone was happy and joking and walking past us and pretty much trying to pretend we didn't exists so as not to ruin their good time. I get it. Be nicer to poor people. 

But at the same time, my whole season of pitying them was over and done with. I got to know so many poor people in my neighborhood. And I could tell you exactly why each one of them were in the position they were in. They either stuck a needle in their arm, or decided that they didn't need to go to college, or slept with some guy without protection or any myriad of things. Not a single one of them was actually an educated person who had actually tried to do something with their life. 

I used to be a harsh critic of those who praised the free market and capitalism and claimed the US was the land of boundless opportunity. I recognized that there were people who tried hard and were really smart but ultimately could not be successful. But then I learned something... if you get an education and at least try... chances are you'll at least end up in the middle somewhere. 

So when I see a homeless person I think much like you: what did you do to get to where you are? 

Then again, that doesn't mean they don't still need help and that in spite of their poor choices, they still need a burger to eat to get through the day or a what not. ",1451606501

Also V-sync with full screen can induce extra input lag. Full Windowed with Aero on (At least in 7) also forcibly enables Aero's built-in Vsync.

I cannot speak for Win8/10, as i believe they permanently have windows compositing on and no way to go back to classic theme, so for this windows version i would guess full screen with Vsync off gives best result. In case of Windows 7, running in Full Windowed, its best to turn off Aero/desktop compositing or use classic theme.

-------------

If you have Nvidia card you can change the Maximum pre-rendered frames from default 3, to 1. Also helps with additional input lag.

-------------

Mouse smoothing in-game above 0.1 introduces extra delay as well.

Instead of doing the incremental bonus we normally do with Omega, starting at 24%, we are going to keep it at 100% until the last 2 days, where it will then go to 120% and then 144%. To make it easier, here it is by day:

Friday, January 1st at 12:01am through Tuesday, January 5th at 11:59pm: 100% Bonus XP
Wednesday, January 6th at 12:01am: 120% Bonus XP
Thursday, January 7th at 12:01am: 144% Bonus XP

Omega XP bonus will be the same as normal.

Thanks! -Asros

You know what would be awesome? If you could confirm the new mystic mayhem achievement can be even completed since it isn't a full mystic event. That would be super. Lots of us have asked lots of times, and the radio silence from you guys is getting very frustrating! 

Many of us have been out of the office on vacation this week, unable to look in to it. @OperationXIV will be back in the office next week and can get back to you.

To give you an idea on how much work people are putting into this.

The next time we run Mystic Mayhem, it will include the v5 achievement - not completing this one wont delay that. That means that you will be able to complete the meta achievement with the costume reward as well.

&gt;voltage rolled off from about 0.58 to about 0.15 before starting to lose signal

Your opamp has a gain of 11 which means that if you were reading 0.58V on the part of the circuit going into the opamp, the output should be 6.38V.  The only problem is that your opamp can only drive 3.7V which would corresponds to an input of 0.336V.

So with your setup, you're only going to get a meaningful output signal when the input is between 0.15V and 0.336V.  Everything above 0.336V is going to ""clip"" to 3.7V output.

Try reducing the gain of your opamp to 6 by swapping the 10k resistor out for a 5k resistor.",1451606508

Not to mention that the only way ""perfect information"" can help in spades 1:1 is if you have high % of strategic cards, or the converse, nothing but bad so you push it all to your opponent. Please don't act as if knowing which strategy is best is hard for someone who can chew gum and walk in a straight line.  :)

If you see a Layer there, note it's number. Not the hexadecimal one, the normal integer one -- such as '0'.
Run the command 'ResetInputEnableLayer [#]' to remove the restrictions that layer had.""

*SJurgensons worked for me when I put 'DumpInputEnableLayers' into the console followed by 'ResetInputEnableLayer 0'

Which was his first appearance (discounting the holiday special). Just in straight comparison to Phasma, he did a lot (also didn't help that I was expecting her to increase the shields or something instead of just doing following the threat).

And while I do agree, I still can't like Kylo because we have no clue what his motive is. Sure, it's meant to be explored, but we really have no inkling as to why he would even want to be on the dark side (outside of respecting vader, but that makes no sense from what we know of him) which is just too little for me. A good villain is someone who is the hero of their own story, who you understand their motives, and right now Kylo's story seems like he is purposefully being a villain because ???.

I think Sancti Tirgris / (crit) Vaykor Hek are the popular options later in the game when it comes to shotguns. I'm not really knowledgeable about shotguns.

Farm for something else in the void, get 10 billion forma blueprints. In particular they drop pretty frequently in higher tier void missions, especially defense. If you want to be cheap when it comes to keys, I remember doing T3defense and if I didn't like the wave 5/10 reward, I'd just let them kill the pod. You didn't use the key, I don't know if that still works. If I liked the reward, I'd play to 20+ (to get the rotation C reward), going as far as I felt was comfortable when alone with my current frame.

I've only done a few sorties but most of them seem to have one team-focused one and two that are super easy to solo (like spy), I've been doing them with one friend and we've been fine. Defense ones etc can be rough if they aren't the 50-60 misssion.",1451606516

I'll confess that I hold a great disdain for many facets of our society.  The difference is that if a person murders someone, that person has infringed on another person's right to life.  Despite this, crimes aren't based solely aren't based on a person infringing on another's rights.

&gt;If you commit a crime you have *elected* out of society. 

That's not true if you involuntarily or unknowingly commit a crime.

&gt;If society decides that it is better for society as a whole that contract breakers can vote or own firearms then there will be no reason not to allow them. 

I understand what you're saying, but I assert that morality isn't derived from society.

&gt;However society gains nothing from providing these rights to people ~~who have broken the contract.~~ 

There are many protected rights that do not benefit *society*.  We aren't a collectivist society, we value the individual very highly.

&gt;With social contracts when you're out you are out. 

That's not true.  The breach of the contract must be sufficiently large in order to out someone.

&gt;There is no reason to believe a person who violated the contract once will forever respect it 

Society does believe that so long as your violation of the contract is sufficiently small.  You don't have your license revoked permanently for a single moving violation.

And it does one other odd thing. When I get it up over 70 or so, about every 30 minutes I can hear a faint kind of ""rattley"" sounds coming from the engine cavity, and it slows down a bit. If I let off the gas for a second and press it again, it seems to go away, but it's not uncommon for it to come back in another 30 minutes to an hour or so. Don't know if that tells you anything.

"evolution","t5_2qhs7","While it's true that scorpions and lobsters both have enlarged claws, and are both arthropods, it's important to not think that this single similarity means they're more closely related than they are to other arthropods.

As others have stated, scorpions are arachnids. Their closest relatives are spiders, mites, ticks, harvestmen, and any number of other groups that most people have never heard of such as [amblypygids,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amblypygi) [solifuges,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solifugae) [vinegarroons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelyphonida) and a surprising number of others.

The closest non-arachnid relatives are believed to be horseshoe crabs and the rather bizarre looking [sea spiders.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_spider)

Crabs and lobsters on the other hand are crustaceans. Though they have similar claws to scorpions they're much more closely related to things like barnacles and pillbugs than they are to scorpions.

Crabs and lobsters have similar claws to scorpions thanks to convergent evolution. There's lots of ways to make a grabbing appendage, and those two groups just happen to have stumbled across a similar design. Other arthropods have different designs. 

I mentioned vinegarroons earlier, [who have a very different claw design.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Pedipalp_in_green.png) Amblypygids have [yet another design.](http://cdn.c.photoshelter.com/img-get/I0000Pq4e.fqrhyg/s/880/880/AH-MG-1995.jpg) And here's a harvestman with [another one.](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7433/8731143251_7f6358c884_z.jpg)

In fact, if you compare the claws of scorpions with those of crabs and lobsters you see that even they have differences. 

Crabs and lobsters have the [top portion of the claw as the mobile piece,](http://carolinafishmarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/med.-lrg.jumbo_.jpg) while scorpions instead move [the bottom portion.](http://i150.photobucket.com/albums/s106/ryo5210/copie_18.jpg)",1451606525

 Is it really that big of a deal to get spotify to add a screen off feature? 

Plus if I were to get a CC audio, what would be the point of having the first version? 

Why is it always, ""buy the latest product or buy more things, then"" from people like you? 

I am fairly certain that turning the screen off wouldn't be that hard of an update for spotify. 

Is hdmi *solely* for both audio and video? If so I wasn't aware of that. 

Im fairly certain that the intended design of the device is to be a universal audio and video transmitter. weather or not that means it can only do both is not up to you to say. if it something that relies on the TV then, ok, I would understand how my request would be futile.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I'm not sure what I say will help too much but, I've had trouble in the past and still lingering problems. I'm diagnosed with moderate depression and add and take an ssri fluoxetine, and adderall. I did have to make a big change in when and how I use drugs recreationally because there is a difference in using for fun and using to make yourself feel good and as a way to self medicate. I ran into that problem with Adderall and cut it out and only use it for school so I can attempt to be responsible with it. As far as the ssri fucking with other drugs I'm kinda bummed about it but the difference it make in my depression made it completely worth it. 

For a long time I used to drugs to escape and hide from all my issues, but no matter how much shit you take to numb what you're going through nothing will help more than real professional help. If recreational drug use interferes with your recovery then I think you know it'd be best to wait until you're more stable. 

I still have struggles with these issues and I have no doubt I'll continue to. Be safe with what you take and be wary of interactions with your medications you end up taking! Maybe this will help you.

 Best of luck, friend! ",1451606526

-called the cops but didn't press charges


-a friend of that kid made a reddit thread crying about the attack


-Evan Centopani responds to MD forums not denying the attack and generally being equivocative


-friend of kid deletes the reddit thread

My take of the story is that definitely something happened, Evan Centopani definitely hit that kid but the fact that he didn't press charges and deleted the reddit thread makes me believe that he didn't say to us the full story. 

Maybe he was hogging the space, Evan confronted him, kid mouthed him off insulting him and Evan snapped I dunno. (Note: I am not defending Evan lol).

There is a far bigger problem at the moment with people not accepting criticism of players, rather than people being too critical.  
And I disagree, you can absolutely say a new signing has been average over half a season - I mean seriously, we're not allowed to talk about any players until the end of the season because they haven't been given enough time? Don't be daft.  
You're also massively simplifying the criticism, vast majority of criticism for Lallana, Firmino, Benteke, Mignolet etc. has valid grounding and discussion points.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","1: **The game's scares were too weak.**

I believe I mentioned the SpringTrap jumpscare already, but the Phantoms aren't that scary after a while. In fact, you can actually mentally prepare yourself for the scare since you can see the Phantom on the screen for a few seconds. Phantom Foxy is the only one who actually is still scary over time.

2: **The atmosphere was not very enjoyable.**

With FNAF 1, your office (and the whole building for that matter) was extremely cramped. There was little room to move, and the run-down look of the building made the atmosphere impossibly unnerving (that's a good thing). FNAF 2 had three entryways, and was filled to the brim with empty spaces for characters to pop up. Anyone could be watching you from anyway. FNAF 4... it's in your bedroom. That is frightening enough as it is. All that FNAF 3 had was a giant window, an empty doorway and a pile of junk from previous restaurants here and there. Nothing special.

3: **Purple Guy shouldn't have died.**

I'm not saying that a child molester/murderer should have lived because ""everyone deserves a second chance kum-ba-ya"", but rather because in FNAF 4, we learn that he knows how to operate the suit by putting it on another person. Hell, he put it on himself before he died. Which means he listened to the audio tapes. WHICH MEANS HE SHOULD KNOW THE DANGERS OF THE SUIT HE'S WEARING. **WHICH MEANS HE SHOULDN'T HAVE EVEN PUT THE DAMN THING ON.**

4: **Okay, you got me there.**

But, to be fair, the process was long, tedious and very confusing. You need a WALKTHROUGH to know how to do it properly. Which makes me question how the people who made the walkthrough learn how to do it correctly, and how long did it take them to do it?

5: **New characters. As in two.**

* SwegTrap

* Phone Dude

And we really could get somewhere if the phantoms didn't exist, right?

6: **Scott took two months to make the game.**

It's unknown how long it took for Scott to make the first game, so it's unfair for me to say that the game took the shortest amount of time to make in the series. Still, FNAF 4 took three months to make, maybe more, since he most likely worked on it before he set up the first teaser.

7: **I actually agree. The new features were somewhat cool.**

The Maintenance Panel was a nice touch (if a bit panic inducing at times) and being able to toggle between two layers of the cameras was amazing. I also believe I mentioned the increased importance of checking the cameras, right?

8: **What?**

Is that a reference I'm just not getting? Is it blatantly obvious and I'm just stupid? What does it mean?

So yeah, I've already made up my mind. But, we all have our own opinions. And the amount of **bold text** in your reply was **good enough**. :D",1451606527

We do. It's called our state certification. 

The State Law Enforcement Board lays out the training requirement of the police academy. Once that is completed, recruits are ""certifiable"" meaning they can be certified as officers for an agency. 

The ""certifiability"" is the State license. The state can revoke it.

Every single person in this world is different so you get to know a person and you get along or you dont. That applies to sex too. 

I was surprised by how many women I met in my everyday life who wound up being interested just because I let be known that I have an interest in women. I'm not super hot, I'm wierd, and shy.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","It's relatively rare in history for a 'forgotten' heir to rise in power. The threat of being an illegitimate child was very real in many monarchies, effectively disabling them from having any claim to the throne if the string between them and dynasty had been cut, or wasn't within an 'acceptable' marriage.

One thing that has come up a lot from my sister's recent obsession with genealogy is how often even the 'crown' prince/princess/'rightful' heirs are actually basterd children in history, or completely unrelated to the king and queen! Pulling off a bait and switch within the royal family was a LOT easier than an outsider coming in and 'reclaiming' power. A lot of editing had to be done on family trees to justify an addition, and it often caused political strife.

However, there are situations that are similar throughout history.

A lot of famous conquerors and kings of the ancient world claimed they descended from some god or another. By deicising themselves, they lifted the matter out of 'mortal' hands.

A great many people trying to ursurp any dynasty throughout history claimed some kind of heirship to justify their power grab. Some of these were more believable than others... But generally it all came down to how much the populace liked the current ruler, whether they were willing to believe it or not.

The War of the Roses and the resulting House of Tudor (which is in some ways the PENULTIMATE fantasy tropemaker) has some great material to be mined on the subject. The War was over two families with dynastic claims to the throne, and ended with the winner marrying a member of the other family, uniting them into the House of Tudor, which beget the unforgettable Henry VII, who, long story short, had several children by different wives. Elizabeth was the THIRD sibling to take the throne after her father's death, and all three of them had 'rightful' claims to the throne. Her main rivalry with the Queen of Scots ended up being a case of this, with Elizabeth eventually having to imprison Mary because of the threat she represented. The conflict between Elizabeth and Mary is ripe for inspiration if you need rightful-heir drama or want to see how the current ruler might react to a branch member's claim to their throne.

One of my favorites is Cosimo Medici the 1st. While not 'lost', his predecessor died with only an illegitimate son, and Cosimo was from a different family branch, and had lived out in the country most of his life. He was brought in with the intent that he'd be easy to manipulate - and turned out be a powerhouse of ambition of determination.

Inevitably, if you have a character from a 'lost' or missing family the main problem their going to face historically is whether anybody will believe their right - there wasn't a lot of ways to 'prove' one's genealogy before genetic testing. It's amazing how some claimants would bend over backwards to fabricate or justify their right because of this.",1451606533

"ShitRedditSays","t5_2s4m9","&gt; **THEY NEED TO PUT A WARNING ON THE PACKAGE**

&gt; By Rachel - August 21, 2012

&gt; I know it says ""for her"" on the package but I, like many, assumed it was just a marketing ploy seeking to profit off of archaic gender constructs and the ""war of the sexes"". Little did I realize that these pens really are for girls, and ONLY girls. Non-girls risk SERIOUS side effects should they use this product. I lent one to my 13-year-old brother, not thinking anything of it, and woke up the next morning to the sound of whinnying coming from the room across the hall. I got out of bed and went to his room to find that my worst fears had been realized :

&gt; MY LITTLE BROTHER IS NOW A UNICORN and it's all my fault. Sure, you'd think that having a unicorn for a little brother would be great but my parents are FURIOUS - I've been grounded for a MONTH!!! They made an appointment for him with our family practitioner, but I'm not sure it'll do any good, and they told me that if it couldn't be fixed I'd have to get a job to help pay for his feed and lodging D:

&gt; I repeat, boys, DO NOT USE THIS PEN. Unless you want to be a unicorn, and even then be careful because there's no telling that you'll suffer the same side effects.

&gt; SERIOUSLY BIC IT'S REALLY REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE FOR YOU TO PUT OUT THIS PRODUCT WITHOUT A CLEAR WARNING OF THE RISK IT POSES TO NON-GIRLS. Just saying it's ""For Her"" is not enough!!!!

&gt; (I'm giving it two stars because even though they got me grounded, the pens still write really nice and bring out my eyes)

An example would be the swiftness of apparent emotional attachment for all involved. One minute they are strangers and the next they are best of friends and would die for each other. Every main character that I can think of in the entire library had a bit more substance than that. Also, Luke and Anakin both had SUBSTANTIAL training with the light saber.

Better yet if you could bind some macros to a controller that is bluetoothed to your PC using some software, and make the buttons do what you want, and you can bind the thumb sticks to even move the mouse. You could lounge around and use your PC this way. Could be done with a PS3/PS4/Xbox controller, USB bluetooth piece, and xpadder software which you could get for free. This is how I would do it.

It's tough, you know. You hate women, and you're called a sexist. It's like... hey, you fuckers! I hate men *equally.* If that's not social justice, I don't know what is!

And I've been called homophobic so many times.

*murmur of recognition.*

Straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, questioning? Transgendered, intersex? Asexual, pansexual? I just want you to be unhappy. The details of it don't concern me. I just hate you. Please, understand me. I want you *all* to go fuck yourselves. All of you.

And don't get me started on politics.

*Brief moment of non-linguistic vocal support.*

Democrat? Republican? Right? Left? Independent? These are details. What unites you all is that you're human. And it's *that* that I despise.

Fuck, I don't even like *you guys.*

*Warm laughter.*

&gt;In 1941, Short proposed a new variant, the S.36,[14] which was nicknamed ""The Super Stirling"" in a company publication. This Stirling would feature a wing span of 135 ft 9 in (41.38 m) and four Bristol Centaurus radials and a maximum takeoff weight of 104,000 lb (47,174 kg). The performance estimates included a 300 mph (483 km/h) speed and a 4,000 mile (6,437 km) range with a weapons load of 10,000 lb (4,536 kg) over 2,300 miles or 23,500 lb over 1,000 miles. The defensive armament of the S.36 was to be ten 0.50 calibre machine guns, in three turrets. It was initially accepted for testing under Specification B.8/41 (written to cover it) and two prototypes were ordered but Arthur Harris, as commander of Bomber Command, felt that production would be too slow and would be better used to give the existing design improved Hercules engines, for a higher ceiling. Shorts were told in May 1942 that the Air Ministry would not be continuing the project and in August Shorts decided to terminate work.[15]",1451606536

One of my favorite things to do to my girlfriend is to get her naked, cuff her hands together (which could be accomplished with rope if you don't have any handcuffs) blindfold her, put in earbuds (to cut her off from sound) and make her stand in the middle of the room with her hands behind her head and her legs spread apart. In this position, with her senses completely negated, she is totally vulnerable and utterly exposed. 


I tend to start with gentle touches or nibbles from different angles. Pausing in between touches to let her wonder where I am, where the next sensation is going to come from. I'll spend ages teasing her, focusing everywhere except for her pussy. It isn't until she is dripping wet and literally shaking with the NEED to be touched there, that I'll slide a couple finger inside and touch her the way i know she likes. She typically orgasms very quickly at that point. 


Her arms are normally tired from keeping her hands behind her head and her knees get weak after an orgasm, so we'll generally move on from that position somewhat quickly, but I highly recommend giving it a shot. ",1451606537

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","Although I think it's commendable to go on a total no-buy as a goal, if it's going to be really hard for you to stick to long term, you could always really plan things out and not be so strict with yourself. Obviously the essential items people are talking about are fairly important, it's good to have cleanser to wash your face and moisturizer. So maybe allowing yourself a little breathing room with that would be reasonable, or instead of buying more expensive products, when yours run out maybe try buying a cleanser from the drugstore? There's some really great stuff there. 

Sometimes if you're too strict, people tend to binge later on (and yes it happens with food, but also shopping as well) like if you don't buy a single item for months, when a major sale comes on it's so tempting to ""stock up while it's cheaper"" and such, making it easy to give in to temptation. 

Have you thought about a low-buy trial, or maybe letting yourself buy 5 fun items for the year? Not trying to encourage spending, but sometimes that can help people who buy all the time to gently ease into a habit of less spending, and it's not as difficult. 

Also, if you feel so inclined you can par down your collection with project pan, or sell items on MUE, give to friends/family, or if you love everything you own, maybe rotate through what you have so it's like using something new every day without actually shopping. ",1451606537

The problem with making all familiars scale with Isaac's... anything for that matter would make them instantly way stronger than many other items.

To counterbalance that, the scaling would have to either be so small you'd hardly notice or it would split between all familiars, making more than 2 familiars actually a bad desicion.

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","I have some questions for you:


1) why aren't your players enjoying the modules? If they don't have the tools to solve the problems you're throwing at them, then you as a GM have two things you can do. (A) Encourage your players in the beginning of the campaign to have a well balanced team that can solve problems in the meat, astral, and matrix worlds, or (B) tailor the modules to actually fit the tools your team has. The second option is obviously harder for you, as you need to do major surgery to the module or introduce NPCs that augment the team. 


2) Why are your players switching their own characters so often? If they're dying pretty often, you may be forcing them into encounters that are too hard...or your players are making really dumb decisions. If instead your players are getting bored with their chars, encourage them to spend extra time making someone they actually like. 


3) What takes up most of your time between sessions? If it's statting out goons and hosts and challenges, I think you should switch your priorities. Focus on the mission, the story, and the NPC motivations. Generally my players come up with totally crazy ways to tackle problems I give to them, and I generally make their plans work to a certain degree (as long as it's smart and makes sense). Players can get bitter if you force them to complete a mission using your method; give them total freedom, and they'll enjoy the game a hell of a lot more. 


As just some final notes, this game is crazily open ended, and that's what makes it so fun. Let your players be right as often as you can, let them affect the world, and let them help you write the story. If the players end up really liking or fearing an NPC, make them recurring in the story. And never feel like your forced to follow the prescribed path of a module; use it as inspiration and let your players take it in whatever crazy direction they like. ",1451606540

Anyone practicing for active combat situations tend to drop their elbow so their profile isn't as wide, and it's easier to maneuver around barricades, through doorways, etc. They may also have a vest where the rifle butt can slide in and rest, so the difference between shooting positions isn't a huge deal. 

I've practiced shooting with my elbow down but my accuracy is shittier because I'm not used to it.

"Vaporwave","t5_2ugcd","yea most of the time, but for me at least, when i can tell the sources, then those thoughts filter in, but i used to spend a lot of time trying to produce a few years back so that might be why, and this occasionally detracts or adds enjoyment to songs for me. 

but in this case the bigger issue for me is taking good tunes that are already ambient and still pretty current, and just slowing them down a bit, and then people thinking its amazing and is an original production with its mysterious artist name and blue sadgirl art.

its like if boards of canada just sort of started getting bigger at this moment, who make like ambient shit that already sounds hazy and vapory , and then someone else takes it and slightly obscures it to vaporize it more, and then puts it in this album that you thought was all legit (because vaporwave artists still often put together neat arrangements and shit, even though its heavily sample-reliant) and everybody thinks so and put it at the top of their list like this guy did, but it turns out its not. but people still like it cuz it works for the genre so its safe but that shit still feels wrong somehow. its hard to explain. or a worse example would be like if everyone discovered a slowed down mac-plus track and think its dope and say its the best vapor track they've heard this year, without knowing the source somehow. Its a complex feeling 

TLDR;  as i was listening to this for the first few tracks i thought it was all original ambient tracks and was super impressed then i recognized it wasn't that way and i was bummed.

the amount of effort bothers me a lot less than the fact that the tracks that were used were fairly recent with already vaporious content to start, to fool everyone making them think its some obscure ambient masterpiece kinda stinks, cuz although solarfields do quite alright (they were credited for mirrors edge soundtrack and probably other shit) they still arent so well known and they sound great.

Witcher ( all of em, really liked the slavic folklore, monster hunting, quests, and story ofc), Shadow Of Mordor ( liked the fighting gameplay with swords and atmosphere ), Devil May Cry ( loved the fast pacing combat system and story was nice ), AC series ( liked the AC3 because of Connors story and snowy fields and Black Flag particulary ).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","For minimums, it's because the store is charged for every payment they process.  For a lot of major stores, this isn't really an issue so you can spend as little as you want. It's a bigger problem for smaller retailers and that's why any transactions you do using your card may not actually appear on statements as having been debited until a few days later, as stores can save money by processing transactions in bulk. So McDonalds transactions may appear on statements right away but buying something at a local fruit and veg may not. 

When it comes to maximums, that really varies. Some places may have a floor limit in place to stop fraud, so any big purchases with a card need additional approval. They want to make sure they aren't being scammed. 

The minimum spending amount is what you really have to look out for. If you're in the UK, using your debit card to pay for something is a payment your bank will honour so they will pay the retailer when they ask for it, but retailers can have anywhere from 6 months to 1 year to take that money. So if you spend money in a shop and they don't take it, those funds can be made available for you to spend since they retailer hasn't requested it, 4 months later they request it (as they have a legal right to the money) and if you don't have enough in your account to cover it, you get hit with charges.

The countries you mentioned have plenty of corruption as well, and I didn't say that Christian beliefs were the only possible way - but the US has a western culture and a majority Christian population.  We aren't likely to convert to Buddhism or Shinto.  I also didn't characterize all religions as being equal, and specified Christianity for a reason, so your comparisons to ISIS and the Saudis are pointless.

&gt; I'd go on to venture to say there is a negative correlation between secular and crime when comparing countries. latin america is quite catholic - but also very corrupt - and with a lot more crime.

Depends on where you look.

However in London, there's quite a few tall, iconic towers.

Perhaps it's more of a population thing? My understanding of the USA is that there are fewer, incredibly high population clusters (Manhattan NY for example) compared to other countries. Going along the lines of the Older European urban sprawls, built up over hundreds, if not thousands of years vs very modern N.American urban areas.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","To be specific with your first example: suppose you're playing Someday My Prince Will Come in F. Then the A7+ chord falls on the second melody note (""day""), which is an F. This strikes me as the simplest reason why there's an augmented chord here...it matches the melody.

Actually, the same thing happens four bars later--in the second line (""some day I'll find my love"") the word ""find"" occurs on a Bb (assuming we're still in F), so the D7 chord underneath it is kind of a de facto augmented chord.  In both of these instances the raised fifth is basically the minor third of the key we're resolving to. In the first four bars of the song, the augmented fifth is F (resolving to Dm), and in the second four bars the augmented fifth is Bb (resolving to Gm).

In your second example, What a Wonderful World--suppose again we're playing in F. One kind of obvious turnaround in F would be to play F / A7 / Bb / C, super common. If you're squint a little, the F+ is almost identical to A7. So why not just use A7? Well, the singer is going to be pretty much sitting on an F at this point (""world........""), so perhaps playing an E is a poor idea. It's probably helpful to think of this chord _not_ as F+ but as A+. ",1451606558

&gt; A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, i.e., things set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite in one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.

Many modern scholars find Durkheim's definition of a religious community as a ""church"" and sacredness in terms of taboo, as well as his emphasis on sacred ""things,"" to be shortcomings of this definition, and modify it to something more like:

&gt; A religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to the sacred, i.e., that which permeates, influences, and relates to material reality, yet is recognized as part of another reality not subject to the limitations of the material—beliefs and practices which unite into a single moral community all those who adhere to them.",1451606560

So every message I send I have to wait until the iMessage fails, then resend as a text, and although that usually works it will always say failed to deliver after about 5 minutes. So I can never tell if the message actually sent or not.

Someone needs to write a good book or make a documentary on this. You seem very well educated, you should give it a go. Does your family know you're a furry, have they adapted to it? Also I noticed by your edit, you said ""wurdz"" and I know what you meant but it makes me think of another question.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","I suggest you check out Millenaire, MineColony or Minecraft Comes Alive.

Millenaire is more centered around the actual town itself, wherein the inhabitants work and expand the town and its infrastructure over time, which the player can help with. The towns have their own cultures and government and **they mostly do their own thing, but you can still interact with them** by helping them, trading with them, completing tasks for them, and earning their trust and respect. 

MineColony is centered around managing a town. **The player controls the town**, planning it, setting taxes, etc. and has full control over how things pan out. 

Minecraft Comes Alive is about **relationships and interactions** with the characters, or simply **making the default villages more lively**. You can play with this one as well as the others because they alter default villages rather than adding their own.

There's also /r/Civcraft **(server)** if you're interested in interacting with **real people rather than AIs**. Its similar to Towny servers in a way, although it is more **focused on politics with towns/nations having their own governments and all run entirely by the players and there are no set in stone safeguards** to prevent griefing and theft, which is 100% allowed if you are able to.

Edit: There is also the [Helpful Villagers](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2162777-helpful-villagers-v1-4-0-beta-builders-and-more-on) mod as /u/cybercat5555 pointed out, where you get to **~~enslave villagers~~ have the default villagers actually do things**.",1451606563

Been playing this game all year since that night. When I wasnt working or had classes, it was Yugioh night. I also decided to build Yang Zings at the beginning of the year and was extremely excited when the Red-Eyes support was released here (will finally have the deck finished when Tracer gets released in January). After the high of getting my Red-Eyes stuff put together, I needed a cheap deck to build. Luckily, I had a whole Volcanic core sitting in my binder collecting dust, just asking to be played with. So I built Volcanics and now a lot of people hate me (worth it). 2015 has been interesting for Yugioh, I actually ended up losing plenty of favorite cards to the banlist (Tempest, Lavalval Chain, Exciton Knight) but in return, my most valuable card (Trishula) came back and made my Yang Zings shine. This was definitely the year I got much better at this game, Ive built some interesting decks, played against some interesting cards, and its kept me pretty occupied in my spare time. 2016 looks pretty hopeful for Yugioh as well.

tl;dr  2015 yugioh had its ups and downs but overall was pretty dope",1451606570

I think I once counted, and was able to find interactions in each book between Vin and women that were not related to men, and so the series does strictly pass the test--but the test has always been intended as a bare minimum.  You can pass the test and still lack any real and meaningful representations of people different from yourself, and you can actually fail the test while not having this be a problem at all.  

In the case of Mistborn, I consider it a legitimate weakness of the stories.  I'm sorry it is distracting to you.  ",1451606570

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","Guy McPherson does indeed say that collapse of civilization leads to human extinction (which Guy claims that +4C is) in a few weeks via loss of aerosols. However, he also says that keeping business as usual going leads to human extinction in a few years. You could conclude from this that we should keep business as usual going as long as possible, but Guy McPherson himself wants to collapse civilization as quickly as possible so that as many animal species as possible will survive the upcoming warming. Make of this what you will.

As for the ""loss of aerosols = instant +3C (total +4C)"" argument: I don't know exactly where Guy McPherson got this number. Let's do some sanity checks on it:

One, [this](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50192/abstract) says that losing 35%-80% of aerosols means +1C at 2100. Let's assume the worst-case scenario there (and even worst-case scenarios are sometimes too optimistic in practice), which is that losing 35% of aerosols means +1C. Then, if you assume linearity, you could say that losing 100% of aerosols means 3 * +1C = +3C at 2100. That may have been where Guy [got his number from.](http://guymcpherson.com/2015/07/near-term-habitat-loss-for-humans/)

I'm not sure what to make of the ""at 2100"" part. Aerosols wash out of the air in a matter of weeks, so shouldn't they lose almost all their cooling effect in a matter of weeks? Is this simply a trick to not appear alarmist (""yeah we instantly warm by quite a bit, but technically that also means that the earth will be warmer at 2100, so let's report *that*"")? If so, then you could conclude loss of aerosols = +3C from this. Or does the ""at 2100"" part mean ""in combination with other feedback loops and a lot of time you get this much warming""? Input here is welcome.

Two, [this](http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081231/full/news.2008.1335.html) lends credibility to the hypothesis that if you stop U.S. planes from flying, you get instant +1.8C. If that's true, then loss of all aerosols worldwide warming the earth by +3C is not hard to believe. However, the data here is insufficient to draw strong conclusions.

Thirdly, see [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/3yxc06/the_global_dimming_issue/cyhls26) from this thread. That suggests only +0.5C of hidden warming, although that +0.5C will be amplified by positive feedback loops.

So how bad is loss of aerosols? Well, looking at the literature, it's at the very least +0.5C bad, and it seems easy enough to believe that that's really something like +1C when combined with the other feedback loops and some time. However, it's a bit of a stretch to conclude instant +3C (for a total of +4C) from the literature. 

However, scientific climate change papers do have a history of being too conservative and the only empirical study (which does have a tiny sample size) we have makes instant +3C seem very believable.",1451606573

Which makes it impressive that I keep playing, because the game seems to crash every 5th thing I do, and I can't tell why. Randomly, she just doesn't keep running almost at all.

I assume this is my setup, not a normal thing, because I can't find complaints about it here on the sub, so I wouldn't let that deter you, but I guess it's a risk.

First I never said that there is no evidence for God. That is a lie.

The issue here is on the burden of proof. Whether you can shift the burden of proof with a negative statement. You can't is called argument from ignorance. 

a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false (or vice versa).""

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance

It can clearly be demonstrated as a fallacy. 

For example:

Alien life doesn't exist. True because its a negative statement. 

Birds don't exist. True because its a negative statement.

Atheist don't exist. True because its a negative statement. 

You see where I'm going with this. 

""How can anyone prove that something doesn't exist?"" It depends what kind of proof are you talking about. Nothing but logical and mathematical concepts can be proven to be %100 true. 

You can't even prove with %100 certainty that you are talking to a human being. Maybe I'm just a machine. Maybe this is a dream. Maybe you are stuck in the matrix. etc. You can't even prove that you exist.

However you can provide evidence that something does not exist. Its called evidence of absence.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_of_absence

I can prove that a black hole is not in the center of the earth.

This article has a lot of exaggeration in it, and the author uses many of the same tactics she criticizes Fox for using. It's pretty ironic.

&gt; Over the last ten years, everyone I know has lost a friend or family member or mentor to Fox News.

Conservativism is literally death, okay.

&gt; Fox News is playing a zero-sum political game in which every major news story is an opportunity to use their viewers as pawns to advance the power and agenda of the most extremist ideology of the Republican Party.

This isn't true. There's an internal division in the Republican Party between the extreme crazies and the old guard conservatives. Fox tends to promote establishment candidates like Rubio more than extreme candidates like Trump. Fox tends to be biased, but they're not biased on literally every major story, and not always towards the most extreme ideology possible.

&gt; Consider Trayvon Martin. After he was murdered by George Zimmerman, multiple journalists pointed out that Fox News had been oddly silent on the subject. Until they had a firm grasp on how to mold the story to their benefit, they refused to report on it. Then, as Media Matters senior fellow Eric Boehlert explains: “Obama addressed it, and once Obama enters the conversation about race, you know, [Fox News] went from zero to a hundred … they decided that the story was partisan, and that supporting Trayvon Martin was the Democratic position, supporting the guy who killed an unarmed teen was the Republican conservative position, and so they set up the markers, and went for it.”

It sounds kind of like they're damned if they do and damned if they don't, doesn't it? Also, notice how the author jumps to the assumption Zimmerman was evil without even bothering to make a token argument for that position. That kind of framing, where issues are never ambiguous or debatable, and disagreeing or being uncertain or asking for evidence about them is a sign you're evil too, is a classic propaganda technique.

&gt; Study after study after study after study has shown that Fox News viewers are the most uninformed and misinformed people in America. One recent study even found that people who didn’t watch any news programs at all had a firmer grasp on the reality of current events than those who only watched Fox News.

No argument here, but it's worth pointing out that correlation is not causality and we should be careful in interpreting these results. Fox might attract people who are already dumb, rather than propagandize them into existence.

&gt; Rather than adhering to any kind of journalistic standard when reporting the news, or — as is the case with liberal-leaning MSNBC — reporting truthfully on the news and offering ideological commentary grounded in facts, Fox News starts with their end goal in mind and works backwards. How can a news story be used to damage their viewers’ perceptions of President Obama or the Democratic Party? How can a news story be used to bolster Republican politicians, or advance the causes of Republican-leaning policy influencers like the National Rifle Association or evangelical Christians? How can a news story be used to vilify causes championed by progressive Americans?

How do we know this? Did the author ever work for Fox, or did she maybe sneak into one of their planning sessions and eavesdrop on them? I doubt it.

&gt; “The liberal elite” is a concept created by Richard Nixon’s campaign during his bid for presidency in 1960. Feminists who were advocating for workplace equality; black people who were working to end racist violence, segregation, and laws against interracial marriage; and anti-war demonstrators who were weary of the war in Vietnam were making white men uneasy, so the Nixon campaign began branding those activists and their sympathizers as “the liberal elite.” Good old hardworking white men like Nixon were the real Americans, and the “liberal elite” were a threat to a traditional, God-approved, Founding Fathers-sanctioned way of life.

A citation for this historical claim would have been nice. Anyway, the liberal elite is a real thing. [Academia has a notorious lack of conservatives.](http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=217)

I don't think that black people or first wave feminists are usually considered to be part of the liberal elite, although maybe that was different historically.

&gt; Creating a false dichotomy is a propaganda technique used to oversimplify complicated issues and force people to believe they have an either/or choice. The group creating the false dichotomy knows many choices are available, but for their message to be successful, they must convince listeners that their choices are limited. Fox News and its talk radio counterparts don’t simply position themselves against MSNBC; they position themselves against literally every other source of information. You can choose the good guy, or you can choose the bad guy. You can get your news from Fox and Fox-approved talk radio hosts (true patriots who are trying to save the country) or you can get your news from the liberal media (deceitful or delusional people who are trying to destroy the country).

&gt; One of the main reasons Fox News is so effective at using cognitive dissonance to keep people away from other news sources is that Fox has strategically aligned itself with evangelical Christianity. So, if one of Fox News’ teachings is called into question, Fox itself is called into question; and if Fox is synonymous with God’s politics, God’s politics are called into question; and if God’s politics are called into question, God is called into question. Therefore, any challenge to Fox is framed as an attack on God himself.

&gt; Creating cognitive dissonance by framing oneself as God’s true ally and spokesperson is one of the most powerful propaganda techniques of all time. It has worked for fascists on a national scale and it has worked for cult leaders operating out of barns. It is especially compelling in the United States, where our belief that we are God’s chosen people has been methodically woven into our national identity since John Winthrop gave his “City on a Hill” speech in 1630, before ever setting foot on this continent.

This was the best part of the article in my opinion. However, it's left as a sloppy sketch of an interesting idea rather than a fully developed argument.

&gt; Create Enemy

&gt; “The days of [minorities] not having any power are over, and they are angry. And they want to use their power as a means of retribution.” – Rush Limbaugh, June 2009

&gt; “This is the new America; this ain’t your father’s America.” – Dick Morris, November 2012

What's so sinister about the second quote, exactly? Seems irrelevant.

&gt; In the case of Fox, this out-group, again, aligns with Nixon’s definition of the “liberal elite”: people who challenge the oppression of the established power structure.

As I mentioned earlier, the author doesn't seem to understand the conservative mindset. Fox conservatives believe that the liberal elite *is* the established power structure. Viewers aren't top hat wearing mustachioed villains who intentionally support flawed systems of systemic oppression, instead they're old people who don't trust the government.

&gt; + On a November 2012 episode of The O’Reilly Factor, notorious bully Bill O’Reilly lambasted dishonest media culture and “vicious” people from the far-left, saying: “There are entire media operations that exist solely to promote ideology; it’s obviously a bad situation that is getting worse.” He is describing himself and Fox news with alarming clarity, but accusing the “liberal media” of his crimes instead.

Both can be true! All news media is pretty bad, in my opinion, although admittedly Fox is the worst.

&gt; + After unarmed black teenager Michael Brown was shot multiple times by Officer Darren Wilson, Fox News hosts repeatedly asserted that Brown was a “bad guy,” a narrative that included the perpetual presentation of false information.

Is this really bias, though? Stealing stuff and then punching a police officer in the face are pretty bad, no matter what your opinion on Wilson was.

&gt; My goal with this article isn’t to ridicule people who watch Fox News; my goal is to to make plain this deliberate, manipulative cycle Fox traps its viewers inside, so we can use our knowledge to begin to set our friends and family free.

I actually believe her, that her intentions are good. But she's got biases of her own, and they poison this article. In my opinion, people should work hard to fix their own beliefs before they try to fix others'. Otherwise, discussing contentious issues with other people is going to make everyone's biases worse, not better.",1451606585

Then in high school I got a better look even though I was always naturally skinny, and from junior year through my first year of college, I dated a guy after giving him my virginity.

No doubt zatkoff is a nhl BACKUP and can't be expected to steal games. To expect him coming in cold to play better than what you saw last night in Murrays play against the leafs is completely unreasonable. The red wings have missed the playoffs in over two decades for a reason.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I still remember the Rifleman units in WCIII.. how good were those ol' reliable rifle-wielding dwarven bastards.

Needless to say Dwarves and Gnomes are VERY different and should NOT be mistaken. Especially their inventions, Steam Tanks, Mortars, Rifles - all Dwarves. All gained by something that changed Azeroth as a whole.

Before the Dwarf, there was the Earthen - massive, stone-crafted versions of what we call Dwarves. The Earthen were strong, fast, quick and were made by the Titans, creators of most life. The Earthen, alongside the placed Titanic watchers and keepers (refer to previous discussion) were supposed to be the orignial denziens of Azeroth.

However, what Earthen had in power, lost in intelligence. While not ogre-level stupid, they didn't have feelings, or senses. Just like machines. There was however a threat that not even the Titans expected. Among Azeroth, the ever feared Old Gods have seeked to rule Azeroth (destroy it). 

Many battles were fought, many elemental planes opened into Azeroth and many lives were lost. In one war effort, the Old Gods have created a corruption, capable of turning ores into flesh. Curse of Flesh easily spread amongst the entirety of Azeroth, and this affected all life, including the first Tol'vir, Vrykul, Mechagnomes or Earthen - and turned them into fleshy beings.

Eventhough the Old Gods lost the war and were mostly imprisoned in various depths of dungeons, hidden chambers and cities below or far from civilization, the Curse of Flesh, the dreaded corruption wich caused the so-presumed perfection to turn into something out of hand. 

So what has that to do with Rifles and Steam Tanks? Curse of Flesh is the reason why their inventions exist.

The Dwarves evolved, and gained greater intelligence than ever, but most importantly, the ability to properly feel, to act by their own will. Without the Titanic influence, Dwarven culture has grown, their nature for Exploration, love for drinking, explosives.. and mainly, their imperfection. Difference in personalities. It improved them as a whole. It gave them a reason to exist without being bound to a greater being.

Even if that cost them the Earthen strenght, they gained affinity, they became more clever. It is why Dwarves are what they are, why someone had the idea to make a Rifle, a Mortar, a Steam Tank..

The Titans realized this. It was too late to revert all, but.. there wasn't a need. For once, the Titans, the makers themselves, have conceded. Earthen weren't perfect, and Dwarves are not faliures.

Unlike Earthen (and Troggs), Dwarves.. Dwarves are imperfect, and that makes them perfect. By this whole reason you have your Siege Engines.",1451606589

"furry","t5_2qi2h","Huh, fascinating.

I can relate to Windows being confusing; I eventually gave up on the early preview builds back a few months ago and just stuck with Slackware :3

Sometimes the stuff on Sourceforge can be amazing, sometimes it's terrible; that particular project I found was last poked in 2012-2013, so at worst it won't build anymore, and at best there's no real developer to poke to implement fixes or enhancements. And the ""version1"" branch, the only one to support LOR controllers, explicitly has no further development going on. I can't follow the code very well (I'm not a C++ guy, following the structure of a lot of C++ programs is a bit hard for me) so I'd probably use it soley as a protocol reference (if I couldn't find it elsewhere) and reimplement everything, probably in something like D or Go (two languages I know of that are insanely quick, and would thus not have latency issues).

Depending on your mindset it might just be easier to stick with Windows, or an opportunity to become ""that guy"" who makes it possible to use this particular piece of hardware with Windows. :P",1451606592

Even those who were to have ""control"" over the fund after it was taken, were clueless as to it moving, it being used and the return of Autodoge. A bit of a shock for them as I came poking about after so long.

Aye, in all of this autodoge is to be the one getting any end of the stick for it. He knew, and he is the one behind the dogeillionairs account as well given the supposed trust linking fell through ages ago in which more than just himself would have access to the account. 

/u/goodshibe is many things but for the most tends to find himself on the right side of things, in this it was shocking but understandable. Given the person in question lost most of their standing so long ago, coming back and joining with someone whose activity level and dedication could not be questioned was a smart move even if not a move that should have been done. I had all hopes GS would sort it out, and at worst look into it more deeply himself. There is a lot that did not play out here on reddit, and I think had the rules been different here and he more aware then he would never have touched the mess.

As for dfund, there was slight contact prejudgement in their other involved case with those taking him to court, after they did get some result however contact stopped on any legal or claim front. From what I know there has been reaching out to those settling things and as of yet memory says there has been no contact relating to what is to happen with it.

""If you live in a major city, you’ve probably already heard about the newest threat to your life and limb, and your family: carjacking.

""It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos. The youth simply walk up to a car they like, pull a gun, tell the family to get out, steal their jewelry and wallets, and take the car to wreck. Such actions have ballooned in the recent months.

""In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police, and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.

""What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).

Use a stock screener to find penny stocks that have momentum and are worth trading(the best brokers provide this in their platforms). Also check out thomas bulkowskis site http://thepatternsite.com/ and learn about patterns. 

Good luck!

Help your show avoid ending up on the list: STOP CREATING BAD DRAMA FOR THE SAKE OF DRAMA. Stop making otherwise smart people act like children just to throw a wrench in everyone's plans. Stop making characters relapse into coke habits that have never been mentioned. Stop giving characters that have enough on their plates fucking degenerative brain diseases (this is season 2 Friday Night Lights kinda shit; just end it and never mention it again). Stop having scenes where a character is telling the truth and no one believes him; we, as the audience, know he is being truthful, and that's infuriating to watch.

You have awesome actors and awesome characters (kind of) in a unique setting. ALLOW THEM TO WORK TOGETHER WITHIN THAT SETTING. There are 1 or 2 episodes where the main cast gets together on the same page and works against an external enemy, and they were some of the best episodes of any show on TV.

"oculus","t5_2uni5","I get this from /u/palmerluckey; there was a thread a few weeks ago about this whole situation, and Palmer showed up.  Through the course of that thread, he explained EXACTLY what ""exclusive"" meant in this context.  He explained that the Oculus platform means their storefront; if they meant that the games would be locked to the rift, they would have said the games would be exclusive to the Rift, not the Oculus platform (which I assume means Oculus Home for all intents and purposes, which is HMD agnostic, and won't require an HMD at all to use/purchase games).  The reason I believe there isn't legal bindings preventing them from releasing a rift version or a PSVR version, etc. is because Palmer said there isn't.  If they were to fund a game, and have it sold on Steam and Origin and UPlay etc. Oculus would lose their cut of the software sale.  If they were to allow it to be released for all HMDs but only be sold via Oculus Home, they still receive that cut of the software sale, period.  Now, as to why these games are being released only for the Rift initially; that's simple, Oculus's priority is their HMD.  Whether or not the devs will release these games for any other HMD is up to them, not Oculus, not you, not me.  It's up to the devs, and that's all there is to it.  I wish it were a more complex scenario, I really do, I love a good e-argument as much as the next guy, but the argument is 100% manufactured.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I haven't even finished it because they took my favorite show at the time and thought it wasn't as good as it could be, so they changed it a bunch. They completely changed Andie's character from being a likeable if sometimes annoying moron to a complete asshole. So, while everybody was hanging on to his relationship, they just unceremoniously broke it up. This wouldn't be a big deal except it is obvious it was a last minute decision. And then the pam\sound guy thing. Soooo cringeworthy. It was forced drama. They were trying to step up the game in the drama area when they didn't need it. The one thing I liked most about the show was that at the end of every episode, things were as they should be. It should have ended with Michael Scott leaving. There were definitely funny moments after that part, but to me it is not worth the screw ups.",1451606611

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The day my kids were killed.  (tl;dr: they're alive)

My ex-wife was walking with another mom, total of five kids and two adults.  We had a top-and-bottom stroller, a Phil and Ted's e3.  The other mom had a front-back stroller.  There were only two strollers that would fit in our trunk, and the side-by-side version wouldn't fit on the bridge near our house.  

Anyway, an out-of control car smashed into everyone.  It threaded the needle between my two kids, knocking the baby (he was 4 months) into the air by about 15 feet.  He was in his car seat at the time.  The car smashed into the wall, pinning the other mom against the wall, just in the gap between where it hit, on an angle.  The wall was an electronics store, and as such was reinforced against smash and grabs.  

So instead of going through plate glass and slicing everyone to ribbons, the car dented the wall and landed on my daughter.  However, the car manufacturer took this sort of thing into account, and there is a gap for pedestrians between the motor and the bumper.  The driver panicked and reversed, dragging the stroller, daughter and all, away from the crash.  

There was an ambulance dispatch station about 300 yards away.  When the calls came in, they sent ""... everyone... send everyone.""  So everybody came.  In under a minute, five ambulances were there.  I was at work, working in a radio company, and one of the guys listening to the police feed said ""woah, big accident.""  

Then I got the phone call.  It took forever for my dad to show up to drive me to the hospital.  We took the bus lanes; I told him ""best case is a cop shows up"".  We went to the scene and I asked how everyone was, and it was the photographer I talked to.  He said he couldn't tell me what had happened, but told me to look at what wasn't there.  

Not a drop, anywhere.  ""No blood...""  He nodded, and my dad and I went to the hospital. 

If anything had changed by a fraction of a degree, everyone would have died.  In this universe, the hospital didn't keep anyone overnight for observation.  I imagine that the accident was the watershed for the end of the marriage, but close enough for time travel.  ",1451606612

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; but no privately owned business should be forced to serve anybody.

I like how you use the phrase ""privately owned business"", but forget that since these bakers advertised their business as open to the PUBLIC, who owns it is irrelevant. 

You don't get to advertise your business as being open to the public and discriminate.  Many states allow business owners to discriminate providing you make it clear only certain people are welcome at your business and that you are NOT open to the public.  The thing is most business who put up signs saying ""we hate such and such and won't serve you"", tend to not last very long, but some businesses do indeed do it.

As far as Federal law is concerned, the only business that is not allowed to discriminate, are businesses which provide ""public accommodation services"", meaning Hotels/Inn/Lodges.

Now we get to the fun part, some states as previously mentioned do allow full discrimination providing it is posted and you do not refer to your business as ""public"" because you can't both be public, and discriminatory and others do not allow this.  Thankfully we are the ""United States"" of America and not simply ""America"" and we have the freedom to relocate to a state more amenable to our views.  If you can't afford to move, then I guess you can't afford to discriminate, simple as that.",1451606612

Since it's in the political world it takes time and a huge amount of effort to do it.

I think that's part of the reason monetary policy is looked at as the be all end all easy thing to do.

&gt; but if you want a 2% unemployment rate, you can have a 2% unemployment rate.

There's an old adage that slavery is a full employment system.  The reason I bring that up is you did not talk about the wage.  In theory lowering unemployment should bring up wages but that has not really been the case this time.  Wages are not going up that much even with unemployment falling. 

So having a 2% unemployment rate does not mean wages go up that much and that means economic demand itself is not going up that much.   

Now with true fiscal policy there can be wage increase but that gets us into the area of things like the minimum wage.  ",1451606614

Also the place where they have Midburn used to be military training grounds...they can find dud rounds that have to be disposed of so be prepared to evacuate camp on a moments notice.

Last year the police delayed opening the gates for hours, bring reflective emergency blankets (Mylar )so you can put them on the windows to cut the heat down. Have easy access to water and snack like food and sunscreen. It will save you so much hassle. 

There are no motorized art cars at Midburn due to the event and bikes are a waste on the sandy and rocky terrain. Also buy hand sanitizer and toilet paper like it was going out of style. 

The police here are unlike the ones at BRC. You will see a lot of private security who happen to be ex-military, they make no bones about gawking and blatantly walking into camps.

**Bernie Sanders - On Policy**

How does Bernie plan to raise the **minimum wage** from $7.25 to $15 an hour?

&gt; Bernie Sanders wants $15 / hr by 2020, so 5 years from now, which equates to ~$12 / hr today. Likewise, Youth minimum wage would increase from $4.25 to $12 ($3 below minimum), and restaurant and tipped workers would go up from $2.13 (set in 1991) to $3.15 immediately, and increased $1.50 per year until $15 is reached.

How does Bernie plan to pay for a **single payer healthcare system**?

&gt; The US already spends more per capita than Britain or France, because of poor negotiations, while consumer out of pocket costs are 5 times more. We’re already paying for a single payer system, it’s just the consumers aren’t getting their cut.

How does Bernie pay for **12 weeks paid family medical leave**?

&gt; By imposing a new 0.2% payroll tax, which would allow workers to get up to 66% of their salaries as paid family leave for up to 12 weeks.

How does Bernie pay for **infrastructure spending**?

&gt; By closing what he has called loopholes that allow U.S. companies to stash profits overseas.

How does Bernie plan to give everybody **tuition free college**?

&gt; By imposing a tax on Wall Street trades, of 0.5% or less.

**Outreach - MLK Event**

Mary Wilson of the District 1 Democrats: KCDP and District One are participating in Martin Luther King JR Week Celebration of Events, including the Annual MLK Parade. You can have one vehicle and up to 10 walkers to hand out campaign items to parade watchers along the sides of the street.

So there is no everyone starting off as female or male, everyone just starts off as what the 23 from mom and 23 from dad say you are.  Now I understand why some people say we are all female, because if you look at the genitalia region before the genitals fully form, it does look like a tiny vagina, but its not really that.

"Shadowrun","t5_2s4v2","I use [Roll20](https://www.roll20.net/) for rolling dice, tracking initiative &amp; combat phases/turns, handling wounds, etc.

Initiative Macro
&gt;/me makes an initiative roll and gets [[ ?{Attribute 1?|1} [Attribute 1] + ?{Attribute 2?|1} [Attribute 2] + ?{Modifiers?|0 - 0} [Modifiers] + ?{Initiative dice?|1|2|3|4|5}d6) &amp;{tracker} ]]

This macro prompts you for the values of your two initiative attributes (Meatspace initiative is Reaction + Intuition, Matrix initiative is Data Processing + Intuition, and Astral initiative is Intuition + Intuition) and your number of initiative dice (minimum 1, maximum 5) and if your token is selected it also places the result in the turn tracker. The reason I use my own Initiative macro is that the ones that come built in to the Shadowrun 5E Roll20 character sheet don't automatically put the value in the turn tracker.

InitiativeSubtraction Macro
&gt;/me has [[?{Amount?|5|7|10} &amp;{tracker:-}]] subtracted from initiative.

This macro prompts you for an amount to subtract from your initiative either because you're using an Interrupt action or because your ending your turn for the combat phase. The only values allowed are 5, 7, or 10 because every Interrupt action costs one of those quantities, and ending your turn for the combat phase always subtracts 10 from initiative. It requires that your token be selected to work.

For wounds, assuming you're using the built-in character sheets, if you double click on a token and select 'physical' and 'stun' in the drop-down boxes for any two of the bars, they will keep visual track of how many wounds that character has in either condition track (and the character sheet will helpfully keep track of wound modifiers, which is referred to as 'calcwoundmod' in the drop-down boxes). Whenever either one of the two bars fill up, that character is either unconscious or dead depending on which bar is full. You can add or subtract from the bars by using the bubbles that appear above the token when it is selected. The third bubble with have the total wound modifiers, so you can deduct it from their dice pools.

Here is an image showing me setting up a token in Roll20 for wounds: [Token Setup](http://i.imgur.com/JsVwqU0.png)

Personally, I'll only go this build if I happen to have like lulu top, orianna mid, Janna support. And that's only if i've locked in ezreal already, otherwise im picking jinx and just righclicking my way to victory.

On PAPER it's the most dps which is why intuitively people think its the best.  When its taken into the game you realize that this build plays to the weaknesses of ezreal, he has low auto range and his abilities which he would ideally be spamming cannot crit.  (To stack his passive to get more auto's which CAN crit he has to use abilities which CANT crit...)

That's not to say he can't do it(champion.gg shows a 49.64% winrate primarily with this build)It is after all actually the most pure dps Ezreal can output, its more like why the fuck did you pick Ezreal if you wanted to mostly auto.

Paraphrasing what i said before, ""if you love crit as a playstyle and you love ezreal, go for it, its fine"". otherwise maybe considering someone better suited for it. 

Caster style alternatively plays to his strengths of poke and burst and mobility.  (and is way more fun!)

I guess Meyers is 50-odd, and I must say that I'm suspicious. On the side of the defence: if you're a man, there's a very low chance you'll get to 50 without at least some hair loss - but that chance is certainly more than 0%! I've worked with several people who are, if not actually old enough to be my dad, certainly old enough to be my uncle (and I'm no spring chicken myself), and yet sport magnificent heads of full hair, with coverage, consistency, thickness and volume that wouldn't shame an 18 year old.

(Lest that seem a bit creepy - I have been going bald since the age of 25, and my open admiration of a fine hairline when I see it is how I work through my envy issues.)

But the prosecution: if you've still got your hair at the age of 50, you'll surely know that its magnificence is best revealed with a fringeless style, so as to show off your enviably unreceded hairline and its distinct lack of any widow's peak. And this is what makes me suspicious of Meyers! No visible hairline = totally a wig, probably.

Or maybe his mum still cuts his hair?

The King of Knights of the Round Table that is described in legends.
In reality a lovely girl-knight, and yet possesses both purity and integrity just like in legends.
She is known as a holy sword-user, but the holy spear she possesses is actually quite powerful as well, making possible to manifest as a Lancer. 

According to differing opinions, when manifesting as a Lancer, the King of Knights is said to take a figure that differs ""in portion"" to what she was while alive. Whatever that is because the body of eternal youth has grown ""in portion"" due to possessing the holy spear instead of the holy sword and scabbard, or because the magical power of the spear made ""a portion"" of the body grow---

Even if she exchanges the holy sword for the sacred spear, the mentality of the King of Knights does not change. She still is the same King of Knights who became a king by acquiring the sword of selection, who opposed assailing foreign enemies, monsters and occasionally even dragons and continued to fight to protect her homeland.
She will probably become of assistance to the Master in regards the restoration of human history.

Height/Weight: 154cm・42kg?
Source: Arthurian Legends
Region: Europe
Alignment: Lawful Good
Gender: Female
There are various opinions about the body weight or figure from when she is a Lancer.

NOBLE PHANTASM

Rhongomynyad - The Spear that Shines in the Far Away
Rank: A++
Type: Anti-Fort
Holy spear. Also known as Ron.*
Regarded in the same light as the Holy Lance Longinus that pierced the messiah, around the 1st Century AD.
When releasing the True Name, both Rank and classification change.

Originally, this holy spear is the ""pillar of light"" that fasten together the two sides of the world (reality and illusions) itself, and it has been said that, in the unlikely event that this is undone, reality will be tear off from the world.
Being the ""king"" that stood at the final moments of illusion and the Age of Gods, she possesses this holy spear that conceals such tremendous power.

By releasing the True Name, the holy spear will emit a fragment of the power of the light that shines in the far away.
In order to perform this release of the True Name, there is a need to lift at least half of a total of thirteen restrains. Supposedly such property is equivalent to that of the ""holy sword of the star that saves the world"".

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; There is a lot of evidence that 2 planes hit the towers, the explosion destroyed outer columns of the towers on impact, jet fuel fires continued to burn inside the building, weakening its structural integrity, and the building collapsed. There is a lot less evidence of controlled demolition.

You state ""there is a lot less evidence.."", meaning that you have a lot of evidence. But really, the only ""evidence"" you claim to have is that fire weakened the structure, and I've already explained to you in another comment that all the evidence we have contradicts this, instead of supporting it. So your evidence is really just a claim which can be disproven by reading the official report.

But, you didn't react to my other comment, and I'm sure you'll avoid addressing it now. Here it is again in case you change your mind: https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3yxr9x/fire_raging_in_a_skyscraper_in_dubai_lets_see_if/cyhp48k

&gt; The Towers did not fall at freefall speed

Here's what NIST says:

&gt; Since the stories below the level of collapse initiation provided little resistance to the tremendous energy released by the falling building mass, the building section above came down **essentially in free fall**, as seen in videos.

-

&gt; The Towers also started collapsing exactly where the planes hit, indicating that is where the building failed. 

Let's say you wanted to demolish these buildings and make it look like a plane impact caused it, where would you start the collapse?

&gt; I believe the charges and demo equipment around the plane crash would have been damaged or the charges would have exploded on impact from the plane.

Ok, and? The entire building was filled with explosives, losing a few on impact clearly did not impact their ability to bring it down.

Might I also point you to the numerous witnesses of things exploding the entire day while the buildings were still standing.

Here's an overview of evidence for explosives specifically for the two towers:

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Witcher's have more stamina and speed than the average human, and Geralt is the Witcher among Witcher, which has caused him to be faster and stronger than his other Witchers. 

He is a mutated human, and can be killed by normal means. He is actually killed by a polearm in Rivia during a race riot, and saved by the sorceress Yennefer. His armor, especially a fully upgraded set of Wolf School gear, can cushion some damage of projectiles and blades, but only a small amount. Geralt relies on his master swordsmanship, the Quen sign, which creates a shield that takes the hit of any attack and leaves Geralt unharmed, a sign he can constantly recast if he has the Stamina, which is abused constantly by players in the game, especially if using potions that boost the regeneration and cause it to recharge and be used almost instantly, and his ability to dodge and roll at a speed and distance a normal human can't, but it would not outperfom Ruby's speed. It could also be argued, that, since everyone has an Aura, Geralt would also have one, even if he didn't know it. Geralt can also block or parry both strikes and projectiles, even able to send them back at an opponent. Against a weapon, Geralt can parry anything except a polearm such as a Halberd or Spear, and against a monster swing, he can roll and dodge, or take it with Quen.",1451606620

Best quality pick is the Grapevine/Bull&amp;Bush Four Roses (I think it was the OBSO, but don't hold me to that). Such a good expression of Four Roses!

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt; People were raving about being able to pull forward their guns using Etheric Light and you could always find a group to go run VoG since it became relevant again.

Yeah, people raved about that for like a week or two, and then everyone just began to complain about how easy it was to hit 34 and how they made all of the content worthless by making it possible for you to gear up the holy trinity of FB/BH/Gally in almost no time and then there was nothing left to do if you didn't PVP&gt; 

&gt;Bungie has cut off their best raid and left it in the dust, nobody is going to be pissy if they bring it back.

Ohhhh you sweet naive soul. What I wouldn't give to share your positive outlook. If they reuse old content, people will complain about it. They might be happy for like a week, but once the new (old) car smell wears away it will the same series of complaints about how theres nothing to do and bungie is lazy and instead of creating new content they are just rehashing old content

And honestly, that complaint is valid. I personally *dont* think they should bring that content back. I know people think that bringing the raid up to level 42 would just be easy as flipping a switch, but it WOULD take resources, and not to mention if they did that they would likely not just change the levels and health pools, they would want to do something different with the raid, be it add challenges or new enemy types or what have you. Vault of Glass is the past. Raids in MMOs have always been eras, and you may feel nostalgic for it but VoG had plenty of issues and was far from a perfect raid (in fact, it's not even the ""best"" raid as you put it, as far as design, scope, atmosphere, and as an overall experience, kings fall is better than VoG IMO). 

I would *much much much* rather them focus all their efforts, even the small amount of resources it would take to update vog, on the future. I know I am not the only person who feels this way, even though the loudest voice may be saying that VoG should be brought back. 

But that's just a tangent. The main point you are making is that if they brought VoG back people wouldnt complain about them recycling content, and they would. They absolutely would. I would bet on it. ",1451606626

Things we discuss might even get in the game, which has happened with a bunch of things already. Unlike Frontier, who actively avoid talking about any issues in their ""released"" game. They just want to add more features to charge you for.

Currently this alpha game has more things to do than the entire Elite Dangerous Universe. I can list them if you want. It may be a smaller map for now, but there is much more to do. Best part, it only costs $45, for life. No ""season"" bullshit.

But I didn't come here to argue between the two games. I backed both in kickstarter. I pointed out issues, and like always the elite fanboy brigade buries it.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Merchant ship captain here.  We certainly do skip a day heading East and repeat a day heading West at the international date line.  I sailed as second mate (the primary navigation officer) on containerships working the Pacific Loop for several years.  The only difference between the way we keep time now and the way they did it in the days of sail is that we do our time changes three hours at a time.  It works out well because that gives each of the watches one hour more or one hour less than their usual four hour watch.  It also happens that most of the year, there's a nine time zone change between the West Coast and Asia.  

When advancing clocks, moving East, you retard the date one whole day at midnight.  It doesn't have to happen any specific place, but that is how time is accounted for in the official log.  Coincidentally, I've been to this exact position on the planet when I was taking a military cargo to Kuwait.  We transited all four hemispheres at once, earning the citations for ""Shellback"" and ""Domain of the Golden Dragon"" simultaneously.

and while they are perfectly fine as knights, the longer the game goes, the more powerful they get, as you become cavalry which heal every turn while fighting and avoid artillery return fire, and then become landships which can just single handedly melee attack cities to death.

"Shitstatistssay","t5_2u3ds","&gt;If the workers are getting the profits and are liable to the losses, then they are just shareholders, it's no different than capitalism. What you are arguing for is a model that already exists in many companies.

Under capitalism, such a system wouldn't be communist, it would be petit-bourgeoisie, because it relies on capitalism.

&gt;how is the production going to expand with all the capital going to workers and none going to growth?

All of the capital is going to the proletariat *as a whole*, some capital is of course going to growth, but that is still going to the proletariat since they own the means of production.

&gt;My argument from 3 comments ago still stands and you failed to even acknowledge it properly.

&gt;The workers are paid in capital, and I'm sure they can have it. 

Using the Marxist definition of Capital, they're not.

&gt;On top of that if you really know your business you can look for investors and start with no capital at all.

[That is very unlikely to happen.](http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2013/06/13-facts-higher-education)

&gt;Monopolies will not form due to competition.

See De Beers, Microsoft, Standard Oil, AT&amp;T, Western Union, and the [US banking industry](https://i.imgur.com/hTnfTkG.jpg)

&gt;Not true. Another Marxist fantasy. No matter the size, the business has to pay the same price for.

&gt;In fact, reality is the exact opposite. Larger companies grow too many liabilities and have much lower profit margins. Just look at Walmart, Walmart makes 3 cents of profit for every dollar sold, if you can set up a business with a profit margin larger than 3% you are outdoing Walmart.

Simply having a larger profit margin isn't 'outdoing' Walmart.

&gt;The larger the business the more difficult it is to maintain and harness profit.

8 out of 10 small businesses fail. Something tells me that rate doesn't go up the larger a business gets.

&gt;Well, I believe in you, people would be struggling to get food and would have no spare time to provide a new good or service to society.

How do you come to that conclusion?

&gt;Well, firstly, that sounds immoral. Why does everyone has to pay for the fuck ups of a few? 

Because humans are fundamentally social creatures, and [it's beneficial to our survival as a species?](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/study-generosity-is-more-evolutionarily-advantageous-than-selfishness/279336/)

&gt;Secondly, that would create such an absurd moral hazard and a mass destruction of wealth that I can't even begin to describe it.

ARTICLE COPY:

&amp;gt;Major League Gaming, once the largest esports company in North America, is going out of business. In a special meeting on Dec. 21, MLG’s Board of Directors approved an Asset Purchase Agreement granting Activision Blizzard a large majority of MLG’s assets in exchange for $46 million.

&amp;gt;The next day, a letter went out to stockholders informing them of the sale. We have included an excerpt below:

&amp;gt; **[EXCERPT](https://i.imgur.com/t8pyN1m.png)**

&amp;gt;In addition to these changes, CEO Sundance DiGiovanni has been removed from his role and replaced by Greg Chisholm, MLG’s former CFO.

&amp;gt;The move was done as a “corporate action taken without a stockholders’ meeting by less than unanimous written consent of our stockholders,” allowed under Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

&amp;gt;*The Asset Purchase Agreement was also approved by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and the Series A Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Series A Common Stock basis.”*

&amp;gt;Stockholders in this category include Treehouse Capital LLC, Ritchie Opportunistic Trading Ltd., Oak Investment Partners, and Legion Capital Investments LLC—managed by Mike Sepso, co-founder of MLG and current senior vice president of esports at Activision Blizzard.

&amp;gt;*MLG, as we know it, is over.*

&amp;gt;Stockholders not in these categories are largely meeting the decision in disbelief. Some speculate that the majority of the sale will go towards paying off MLG’s debts, leaving little to go around for the remaining stockholders. MLG has filed for multiple debt financing rounds this year alone, for a sum of over $6 million. “I got fucked on stock,” said an affected stockholder, who wanted to remain anonymous.

&amp;gt;MLG steps down after leading the esports scene in North America for quite some time. For many years, the company successfully ran tournaments across the United States for StarCraft 2, Call of Duty, and other titles. MLG also announced that it was building an arena in China.

&amp;gt;However, MLG has also taken on recent blows, such as when rival ESL was named as the tournament runner for the Call of Duty World League.

&amp;gt;Only time will tell how this move affects other MLG ventures, such as the upcoming Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championship in Columbus, OH. The only thing known for sure is that MLG, as we know it, is over.",1451606636

Any invasive procedure carries risk; puncturing of the uterus, infections can lead to sterility, etc. No doctor worth their salt would say ""have as many abortions as you need"". It's like any other health issue. You may need a gastric band to overcome obesity, which is a fairly ""low-risk"" procedure despite it's invasive nature, but no competent doctor would ever use it as the go-to cure for obesity. The same goes for abortion; abortion is a right for people who have the medical need as decided on by them, their partner and doctor. But that doesn't mean forgo responsible sex and birth control because you can just get an abortion. It doesn't work like that.

The problem is that the analogy doesn't work, period. 

The law says that if you sell a product to straight people, then you also need to be willing to sell the exact same product to gay people. 

Your analogy involves forcing a business to sell a product that they normally don't carry and don't serve to anyone. 

It's the difference between talking McDonald's that they have to sell big macs to black people if black people enter the store, vs.  Forcing McDonald's to add sushi to their menu is a black person asks for sushi.

People have asked me that before. ""Domino, why do you visit the league subreddit?"" They ask it just like that. ""Why do *you* visit?...."" ""*Why you*?... Why not /r/dota2? Why not /r/circlejerk?"" Surely it must in my nature to shit post everywhere I go. I'll tell you why I visit /r/leagueoflegends. It's none of your business. Okay, now I don't want any conversations about what a mysterious, dank and intelligent man I am. I am a League of Legends genius. In game, my nickname is SKT1 Faker. My skills will bite your face off. So don't question Domino or you'll get bit.

Memes and [references](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1E9ucBTHsg) aside, I visit because I want to stay up to date with the current meta and the way the game is played. I also enjoy watching great and funny plays and to stay updated on the competitive scene. Also, this place is great for comment karma farming. 100k in only 2 years! It's a great subreddit to casually shitpost and joke around. 


&gt;**What types of content do you want to see, and why?**

When I'm looking at competitive post-game discussions, I want to see serious discussions. I'm glad QT retired, because seeing ""Raise ur donger"" on every Dig post-game post was annoying as fuck. I don't mind memes, but most tend to be low effort and spammed for no reason. There's no sense in 300 guys spamming the same meme trying to farm that precious karma. Every thread there's usually only 1 guy getting all the precious karma from memeing, and the rest should just stfu because it's annoying. 

I also think analysis are great to have on the subreddit. Personally I'm too lazy to read them, but I think they're essential to stop making this subreddit a shitposting shithole full of memes, and any serious thread will get my upvote. The discussion these threads generate tend to even be more valuable in reflecting the game than the analysis itself. 

Clips are great. Some are hilarious like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/3yu09m/for_all_u_teemo_lovers_out_there/) one, some just feature really sick plays. Either way, they're fun to watch. Personally I'm not a big fan of the constant mirin of streamers and their clips, but whatever floats your boat. Different people, different tastes.

&gt;**What types of content make you not want to visit?**

Anything related to the EU/NA debate. It's okay to talk about which region is stronger, but lately, especially during all-stars, it became a massive shit slinging fest where there were no winners and attacks were getting personal. 

Also, the memes. I'm so glad ""Raise ur donger"" died out. Now I just have to wait before 5.5 dies out. Some memes are funny, because they're not being abused. Like the 'Charity is a stripper', or 'top percentage'. Bjergsen and his wards is kind of funny as well. But when I see people bashing GodV/PainEvil because of his shitty play at worlds and call him a shitty mid, I get my jimmies rustled because those people haven't seen him play in the LPL and just judge him based on 4 games where he played shit, and those people are just repeating memes without thinking and without seeing any games. It's one of the reasons post-game discussions are fucked because people enter the discussions with nothing but memes and without any background knowledge. 

&gt;**If you were running the subreddit, what would you do?**

Keep doing what you're doing now. Maybe ban some of the novelty accounts who's only purpose is bashing regions. Those people are to afraid to risk their own karma. Also, we need more anime gifs. Especially ones with defenestration. ",1451606645

We have the lightsaber, ""That belongs to me!"", but the lightsaber has other ideas who it belongs to. 

Kylo is all about the evil Vader, but Vader did turn to the light ever so briefly to overthrow Palpatine and save Luke. Snoke's and Kylo brush it off as a momentary weakness, but it was originally treated as complete redemption. What is Vader's lasting legacy on the galaxy?

Regardless of Rey's lineage, I think she and Kylo represent different parts of Darth Vader's legacy, and her side of it is going to be explored more in upcoming movies.",1451606647

I'd assume the LFG itself already has an infrastructure code in place, as in it would automatically pick up the new category code and treat it as another ""folder"" and make it work as an added one without interfering with other code.

...except that the Netherlands actually has a slightly higher overall homicide rate than Switzerland:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate

So, more people killed by guns, but less people killed overall.

Similarly, can you look at the following homicide rate charts from Australia and find the inflection point caused by their sweeping change in gun control policies?

http://www.aic.gov.au/statistics/homicide.html

Most meta-studies show the same thing; the presence or absence of guns largely doesn't affect the overall homicide rate, and only affects the weapon specific homicide rates at the margins.

Took it, got good enough grades where I was offered a position in Stuyvesant, though I went to bronx science starting in 2006 as my first choice because it was my mother's alma mater and closer to where I lived. I knew many underachievers at Bronx Science and Stuyvesant, and most of the kids from Brooklyn Tech I met were also pretty lackadaisical about their education.

He said ""as long as possible,"" well stop being a baby and realize that maybe its not going to stay that way as long as you want. Developers are working on ways to allow users to transact without expensive fees, but you can go to hell if you think raising the blocksize limit until only a handful of datacenters on the planet can handle it is how to scale bitcoin. If thats what you think, you are an idiot. You optimize the way the clients handle datastructures, build in features, and THEN scale up WITHOUT completely ignoring the fact that blocksize directly correlates with resource demand of nodes. Without a lot of diversely placed nodes, Bitcoin isn't worth shit. If you do not see that, you do not understand anything being discussed here. 

And do not even think about breaking out that ""But third world users argument"", cause its bullshit. Right now Bitcoin fees are expensive to someone making less than 1$ a day, and even 3 cents is too much for them. They can use things like payment channel networks, or off chain transactions. Bitcoin is long past the day of being affordable to transact on chain for these people.

She would know the amyr were created by the very thing all fae fear right?  Yes.  How does felurian act in regards to the amyr?  Indifferent.  Did bast say the sithe destroy anything carrying the influence of the ctheah? Yes.  So why weren't the amyr destroyed a long time ago, why are they still around?  Do you see why I think the theory breaks down?  My thread isn't to prove or disprove selitos=ctheah.  My thread is to find answers to why the amyr are not being hunted by the sithe, why felurian acts indifferent.  If selitos is the ctheah, then the order amyr should have never came to power in the aturan empire.  So for the simple fact that the sithe never even attempted to destroy the amyr, the theory breaks down.  ",1451606652

Only the Jedi and Sith describe themselves in this all or nothing manner, the rest of the universe is *very* gray. Hell, Han Solo is a smuggler-turned-general, that's pretty much the definition of moral ambiguity.

Did Rei ever announce that she is now aligned with a faction or force-side? No, she's still figuring out herself and her place I the greater universe.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","A large number of store's use third-party hosting services that can broadcast their inventory over multiple channels (Ebay/Amazon/TCGPlayer/etc). Unfortunately these services can have hiccups where a card is purchased through one channel but it won't immediately take the card out of inventory via other channels. I have seen this occur for two orders placed mere seconds/minutes apart (more common) to upwards of an hour(totally unreasonable but it happens). The most popular third-party service is aware of this issue but offers no assistance to the store when an error is made on their end. None. It is totally up to the store to shoulder the cost of underselling/receiving negative feedback.

When some kind of buyout happens it is more likely to happen as typically everyone involved is buying at similar times. Usually when this happens the store's have to decide how to make as many customers happy as possible. Typically someone ordering through Amazon/Ebay will receive preference since those sites have extreme demands on sellers when it comes to Customer Service.

2) Malcolm, Dale, ir zibroi would be a good candidate to EE next. Wait to 6 star someone before you decide on an entire team that you're looking for

3) Your frontline looks good unit wise. Mid line you could use a better CM, your lynia would be great actually if you got her E'd and up to 50. If i were you i would take out Haru of your back line, move guin to where he was, and move malcom to where guin was, and put in lynia to CM once you've leveled her up. In the CR position that ravian is occupying victoria would be a good addition, seeing as she has the best reflex buff in the game and she would work well with lynia, who gives a reflex buff of her own to your line.

4) All the units you have are great and used in mono color or rainbow teams, I wouldnt get rid of any of them. 

I'm certainly not an expert, so don't take my word as gospel, do some research on your own, you're in a great place to learn! Also, don't worry about leveling up too fast, the game slows down a lot once you hit the 50-60 level range.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","The irony then, is that when you reach something that isn't like the OT (re: Kylo Ren, Rey), your reaction is to dislike because it's not enough like the OT.

Your gripe about Ren stems around the observation that he's not scary or intimidating like Darth Vader, under the assumption that the film makers were going for that. But the film makers were NOT going for that. They were clearly going for something much different. A soul in flux, in conflict with itself, brash and adolescent.

Your gripe about Rey comes from an assumption that the lead character needs to be an heroic archetype, without fear or conflicting emotions. You mention in other comments that this is ""Star Wars"" and she should somehow live up to some personal view of character types burned in by Luke, Han, and Leia. JJ Abrams went a different direction with her character, and you use it against him. 

I can't decide if you wanted the film to be more of an homage or less,  but your argument isn't much more than, ""it wasn't what I expected."" 

Nothing in your CMV post is contradicted by the movie the film makers set to make. Rey's emotional state is understandable in the context of the film, as is Kylo Ren's immaturity. 

But there's no way to CYV unless you're willing to admit objectively that the film accomplishes what it seeks out to do (one of the only ways to objectively measure a work of subjective art).",1451606656

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Decks play draw spells. Gaining card advantage is only beneficial when it's actually used (eg. tempo). By all your previous logic, choosing worst case scenarios, draw spells ""do nothing.""

There's never a time this card ""does nothing."" Whether you get to choose the outcome or not you're gaining value at either 2:1 mana spent worth of damage, 2 or 4 cards out of their hand for your 1. Up to 2 permanents off their board for 1.

If my opponent does any of these things it advances the game plan, not because of this card specifically, but because of every card played beside it. The end result is I can either kill my opponent WITH this card or disrupt him while winning with my other cards. Your opponent suddenly has pressure on him since at any moment he could die/lose if he A. Loses his dudes/walkers (Utter End, Wraths, Ugin) B. Plays too many cards from hand (over extends) into this or your wrath(s) C. You simply discard them with Jaces since the other cards are better for this match. They could die to one flashed back at any moment. 

Splinter Twin does nothing in a vacuum too. Double my ETB triggers? Yay.

But since you're a scrub who can't play his spells when they're called for, I suppose it's fine. This card is terrible like that Jace, Vyrn's Prodigy. Can't believe people would play a WORSE looter. Rabble, rabble.",1451606657

"Ask_Politics","t5_2t160","Thanks!  One detail on the TPP - *MY* view was and is that it is the job of congress to pass bills, not to just ignore it and leave it to the president.  Turns out that my understanding on the issue wasn't quite right, but it helps explain my next point.

With the exception of Move-To-Amend, I don't think I've agreed with any specific view or bill.  Thus I can't just throw my signature in with thousands of others.  On TPP, everything was either to approve of the TPP or to reject the TPP.  All I wanted was earnest reading and debating of the TPP.  I realize that I'm no where near smart enough to comprehend all the details.

With Move-To-Amend, I told my representatives that I support them.  I even included an early draft of their position.  Both senators said that they support reversal of the affects of CU and other recent Court decisions but they don't want an amendment or they want this-or-that.  In each case I explained why it needed to be an amendment and they needed to use the press-conferences and time in session to publicly support an amendment.

So I'm not a nutt-case.  I understand that **demand** is not ideal but I don't like 'pussy-footing'.  I use positive declarations like that to communicate that I will only be satisfied with positive movement toward resolution.  Perhaps you can suggest 'the right way' to differentiate politicking and solid action?

I think for my girls, some sort of bed/desk unit would work well. They'll be sharing a room. I've got dibs on the 3rd bedroom as my study/work area. But there's a lot you can do to divide up a room so each child has their own space.

Best graphics: Xenoblade Chronicles X. Honestly, I don't like this game as much as everyone else seems to like it, but holy shit, the environments are some of the beautiful I have ever seen in a game. It makes exploring that much more fun when everywhere you go it looks the background for a postcard.

Runner up: Witcher 3. Pretty much the exact same thing I said above, but with a bit darker of an atmosphere to the game as a whole.

___

Best Soundtrack: Undertale. No shocker here, if you want to know why, plenty of people have written about this already. Just listen to it and some of the amazing covers on youtube. I suggest Tsuko G's kazoo covers, they are really amazing.

Runner up: MGSV. A great assortment of songs, both original and not, that really enhance the already amazing atmosphere of the game. Also get used to seeing the word atmosphere. I have a feeling it's going to come up a lot.

___

Best story: Rise of the Tomb Raider. The story of this game, while short, keeps you hooked throughout the game. Perhaps it's better short, because I never lost interest. As with the first game of the reboot, all of the action sequences look like a scene out of an Indiana Jones movie. This time, the story could be from one too. With intriguing villains and plot twists, this story kept me on the edge of my seat the whole game.

Runner up: Undertale. A story based on your actions, that changes depending on the gameplay choices you make. That was a description for the game Quantum Break (which I am very excited for!) coming out next year. Undertale did this almost 6 months before it's set to release. Take that, Triple A games!

___

Best Fan Service: Huniepop. I don't care it didn't release this year, it always wins this award in my book.

Runner up: MGSV. Quiet is fan service. I get it, it's a story thing, but it's still fan service. Not that I'm mad or anything.

___

Best Original Concept: Splatoon. It brought new light to an industry that pumps out the same type of shooting game each year. I am very excited to see more new and innovative IPs like this from Nintendo in the years to come.

Runner up: Undertale. While other games have messed with the idea of mortality and decision making, none have quite hit it on the head like this indie/Tumblr darling.

___

The Game I Can't Shut Up About Award: Splatoon. Since it came out earlier this year, I have been telling Wii U owners that this is an essential game for your Wii U collection.

Runner up: Stella Glow. A small JRPG I found earlier this month, it is an incredibly fun little gem on the 3DS that I hope gets a bit more attention.

___

The Game I Wish Came Out This Year Award: Fire Emblem Fates. I preorder the Special Edition as soon as it was announced in North America, but I just wish it would get here sooner.

Runner up: Legend of Zelda Wii U/Star Fox 0. Both games with planned 2015 release date that got delayed. Hopefully the delays with give us better games as a result.

Runner up 2: Quantum Break. As I mentioned above, this is a Triple A revolving around in-game choices. I am very excited to see how it turns out.

___

Personal Game of the Year: Rise of the Tomb Raider. An amazing game start to end, when I picked up this game in early December I didn't expect to have my favorite gaming experience of the year. Everything that made the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot amazing is taken and enhanced. The action and story in this game feels so cinematic, and in the best way possible, where you feel like you are in a movie. The atmosphere of all of the areas, especially the tombs, is very, well, atmospheric and really enhance the experience. I didn't enjoy completing an game this year more than this.

Runner up: MGSV. A solid game and a great end to Snakes story (although many people disagree with that). I had a lot of fun exploring and sneaking around the atmospheric world while doing missions or just messing around. All in all, very solid game, and a fitting conclusion to the Metal Gear Solid series.

___

Tally:

MGSV: 3

Undertale: 3

Rise of the Tomb Raider: 2

Splatoon: 2

Quantum Break: 2

Witcher 3: 1

Xenoblade Chronicles X: 1

Huniepop: 1

Stella Glow: 1

Fire Emblem Fates: 1

Legend of Zelda Wii U: 1

Star Fox 0: 1

So, imagine something like this:

7 mana in the mana pool

* Rite of Flame

* in response, Chandra's Finale.

* in response, Chandra's Finale.

* Second Finale resolves, copying the other finale and the ritual.

* Copy of Finale resolves, copying the original again, and the ritual.

* ooh, a loop! Repeat until you have a googol-billion mana or something.

* Banefire?

This is also sweet with Storm.

9 Storm + Grapeshot + Chandra's Finale = 20 Grapeshots.

5 storm + Tendrils of Agony + Chandra's Finale = lethal.

The latter is less relevant than the former, since RRR in a tendrils deck is kinda hard, plus it's a 2-card combo after storming, so it doesn't work with LED/Infernal Tutor. However, in a UR storm deck, such as Modern has, it's way more relevant.",1451606666

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

However, it appears to be much less efficient in power consumption than the GTX 980.  Would it be a good idea to just bump the PSU up to the 750W model to be safe?

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I can't deny that the things in this guide are accurate, but in none of these videos is the enemy team trying to keep him out of the baron/dragon pit. In higher ELO stealing is more complicated because the enemy team will do at least one or all of the following every time:

1.) Deny your vision in the pit. If you can't see the hp bar you can't steal it

2.) Have vision over the wall of the pit so they can kill you before you try to steal. If you sit on the far side of the wall and wait you will simply be killed or CC'd. In higher ELO the enemy mid laner or support is usually there over the wall to kill you or knock you back if you make a steal attempt.

3.) Never start a fair baron or dragon, or know to peel off if a fight might break out. This means you're not going to get perfect 50/50 smitesteal opportunities like you see in this video. 

4.) Just keep the objective at 2000~ish hp and let you come in and kill yourself thinking you were about to make a sick play


When I was in lower ELO games I would make tons of objective steals, but as I got better I found that unless the steal is crucial to winning the game I really shouldn't go for it because it's like taking a lottery ticket where 10% of the time it pays out but 95% of the time it makes you throw to game.",1451606676

"swordartonline","t5_2uikt","As for the Sword Skills, they are activated more by having the sword in a position, and then the system assist takes over.  If you were to simply swing the sword, it would not register, but it would be possible to activate the skill faster if you had the exact position of the Activation Stance down and could trigger it rapidly.  Practice makes perfect.

As for the menu, there is usually more than one finger, or a symbol (Alicization's Stacia Windows).  With all of the VR tech, it should be doable to have something check if two fingers are touching and the swipe could have a defined range to operate/open in.  I don't swipe down in front of my face all that much, except to swat bugs, so I don't think it would be too much of an issue normally.  Also, I'm pretty sure the martial arts skills are triggered in much the same way as Sword Skills.  The system assist could suppress the menu while a skill is active, and the skills could be designed to avoid the particular sequence that opens a menu.",1451606676

2. Same as #1 but I don't think so. There wasn't a particular scene that really stood out to me. But that's not to say he wasn't insanely good with conveying emotion without speaking all that much.

3. I thought the plot was pretty basic. Didn't really affect me though.

4. This category however I think it'll easily win best cinematography. The closest movie with this kind of cinematography may be Mad Max for me off the top of my head; and it wasn't nearly as breathtaking as this. 

I'll say that I absolutely loved Birdman, I dug everything about it and wasn't bored a minute of it. The Revenant was easily my most anticipated movie, especially seeing all those amazing trailers. This movie had everything going for it cause everything was spectacular. 
Those long sweeping shots of the battles, and especially the bear scene are easily the most remarkable scenes I've seen in a long time. 

 However, I felt like it just dragged on too much. At parts, I got bored as it was just Leo going from one place to another, sleeping, nature shot, and then something bad happens. I don't know, it didn't click all that well for me. And the flashbacks to his wife, I felt that was overused too much. It was coming off pretentious, like I get it so can we move on kind of deal. Too stylistic. 

I just left the movie a little let down that it could of been cut down a bit. Still I'd give it maybe a 7, or 7.5 at most..

Leonard did nothing until he got hot for a couple playoff games, and has largely been underwhelming this year.  You sound ridiculous saying these guys will be a top 5 team in the League one day.

2. You should do them while you're farming OV. Try to find a party if you can't do it solo.

3. Do you want to be really geared in one class or mediocre in a bunch of classes? For the most part, you can just get by with a +10 weapon. Ele is one of the better classes for OV because you can skip through so many gimmicks. My ele is just using a +10 Mystical Marrelete (lvl 80 pink) and it's enough to do OV/ancient dungeons quickly. 

4. For the longest time, I had a bunch of chars at lvl 70 so I could farm Tower of Despair. They all ended up reaching 85 during that one event where you could transfer the Demon Invites for reaching cap. So they were useful for those 2 things.. Also an assist for holding if you don't have one of those.

5. It's completely up to you, but personally I would wait until I hit 70 or 80 and see if you still enjoy playing. I enjoyed playing Monk up to the level cap. Had plans to get him his OV set and put some resources into him. I can't stand playing him now. ",1451606682

What he sees in his grandfather is (what he believes) to be unwavering commitment to the dark side. He idolizes what he thinks Vader was. Since Ren is so conflicted, he wants the simplicity and strength of the ""pure evil"" that he assumes Vader had. ",1451606682

The main character (Can't think of her name) was so poor at showing any sort of emotion in her character that it made the opening episodes really hard to watch. Her uncle that she meets actually wasn't that bad. But you're right, they overpowered the heroes and then ditched the shows interesting premise that honestly kept me watching for a more in depth science fiction that they think the audience would be more interested in.

I would have accepted the second season about finding why the electricity turned off with the factions that were about the land on the brink of war and shit rather then the stupid nano-bots theory.

I mean, the explanation for electricity would have to be something really out there to explain but surely they could have done better then tiny little robots in the air.

As presented, most people will conclude that there was a huge surge in false reports, especially since OP headlined that there was a 1,400% increase in the *number* of false reports (which is blatantly wrong), rather than a 1,400% increase in the percentage of reports that were false.

Just in case someone does not understand why this is important, let's look at a simplified case.

In 1999, Bixilotanga had 100 reported rapes, with six of the reports being deemed false (a 6% false rate). In 2009, the same city had 10 reported rapes, three of which were false (a 30% false rate). 

There are several ways to report the direction of false reports. You could say that they had decreased by three, or that they decreased by 50%, or **that the percentage of rape reports deemed false increased by 500%**. 

That third reporting method gives the untrue impression that the number of false reports increased, which it did not. In other words, it is true but deceptive.

And then the second half hit me hard. The girl I'd proposed to, and was thinking of going forward to marriage with by next year, and I broke up in truly a ground shattering way. It was a 4 yr relationship, and even 4 months after the breakup, I'm still not able to smile genuinely. A day after the breakup, I failed the exam that would have given me my professional career designation and moved me wayyyyy up. A month after that, I got into a car crash from which I don't know how I walked out. Car was totally destroyed. (Got a new car after) A month after that, I got laid off from the job I'd gotten after graduation. (Got a new job after)

For 2016, I want to turn things around in the following ways: 

1. Be confident in my career choice and move to this new company.

2. Complete that exam that I previously failed and just be DONE.

3. Meet new girls (possibly get into another relationship) and just make new friends who I can do normal things (not just get drunk, or get high) with.

4. Try and smile more.",1451606685

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","&gt; The Kurta Clan massacre didn't have the same purpose.

But they still did it for financial gain, they brutally tortured them so that they would die with their eyes in the scarlet state, there's nothing really mysterious about that. 

&gt; Again, you could say the same thing about Leorio and Kurapika. In Hunter x Hunter being gone for an arc or two doesn't mean you're not important or that your purpose in the story is concluded. 

Again it's not the same. The story was bound to go back to them at some point since they're main characters.

&gt; Compare that to Illumi and the Phantom Troupe. 

Illumi is a completely different case, the Zoldyck family altogether have a bigger weight on the story than the Troupe could ever have. I don't see Illumi having that much importance again in the plot but it's more likely of course that he'll appear again, since Killua is fleeing from him.

&gt; If the purpose of the Troupe's repeated cameos was to make them feel like real people going about their business, then it wouldn't be so intertwined with subplots. Togashi could just show the Troupe doing things if he wanted to and wouldn't have to show them trying to get Chrollo's nen back.

They did virtually nothing on G.I., very little in CA, they had no relation with the main plot whatsoever. They were just cameos nothing more. As i said, in both cases, writing-wise it's justifiable their appearance, but it's not important. I think myself that it's probable that they'll appear again, with another cameo, but no more than that.

&gt; Why even give Chrollo a case. From what you're saying, the only significance of not killing off Chrollo was just to introduce nen exorcism which could have been introduced in any number of ways. That's a pretty weak reason to have wasted all this time. Also, we don't know if it worked or not.

I said in my previous post that the ending at which Togashi wanted to arrive in Yorknew was what we got, Chrollo not being killed but left in the same state Kurapika was when he massacred his clan, poetic justice. That's why Chrollo was given a case in the first place, i didn't say he didn't kill him off to introduce nen exorcism, it was a perfect opportunity. Will he ever be free from jc? we don't know, we can't know for sure. As i've said before, i simply think you're wrong in your assumption of it being a certainty. I don't know what you mean by wasted time?

&gt; It makes for a magnificent arc, but a poorer overall story. It's a waste of the audience's time to keep a plotline that will just go nowhere consistently going. There's no purpose in it after Yorknew, unless Chrollo gets his nen back.

Yorknew was the arc of Kurapika's revenge on the Spider, Hisoka's goal was not the point of the arc. It doesn't make for a poor overall story if you expected something predictable like a rematch to happen, but in the end it doesn't. I for example not once since i saw that arc for the first time 10 years ago ever expected for a Yorknew II to take place in the story, since Togashi had already destroyed my expectations for how i thought the arc would play out.
It's a waste of time maybe depending on your expectations. That'd be like saying that because Gon and Hisoka will probably never fight again that's also a waste of time, when it's not a problem of the story but of the expectations of those who thought such a thing would actually happen again.

&gt; The what, how, and why are the things that Togashi can toy around with while still getting Gon his nen back which would still make it atypical

In HxH there are only two ways of opening your microphyles in the first place. Even if it were done in an atypical way, it'd still lead to a cliched outcome. On the other hand the main character being replaced for the biggest arc ever in the story, and having lost all his powers it's very HxHlike. So that seems as the more likely resolution for Gon's situation in the context of HxH. I don't have the manga with me right now, but as i recall it was only stated that at some point, Gon and Gyro would meet again, and since they didn't actually meet at all that means that they will be in the same place at the same time at some point in the future. That doesn't require for Gon to regain his nen.

In any case i feel the odds are against you if you think they spiders will become nearly as relevant as they were in Yorknew. That'd be like betting that the DC will have an epic, climactic ending... when we should already know by now that it's ending will be completely anti-climactic. 

Just imagine the characters that will be introduced in Gyro's arc, from Gyro's folllowers, new hunters, new nen users, the main characters, etc. With all that it's unlikely that he'd give much more than a cameo to some secondary characters from a previous arc. Also bear in mind that in his entire career, Togashi has only written two very long arcs (CA and now the DC which will surely be even larger). We're speculating, but in all logic, i don't imagine Gyro's arc lasting 10 vols., perhaps not even 8... why would he waste precious time and chapters with some past characters?",1451606687

"InternetIsBeautiful","t5_2ul7u","I can see how you'd interpret his comment that way.  

If you take ""I don't like this thing"" literally, then yes it sounds like he's dismissing the website as ""fake art"" and claiming his is ""real art.""

However, he said in another comment:

&gt;I want people to use my art for their background. It's nothing against the program, its done very well.

He's implying that this program is competition for him, which is actually praise.

His wording was admittedly bad, but in real life his meaning would be more clear.",1451606691

I know that SD/Nexon are not promoting the game right now, in my opinion I do like this.  **If it were up to me I would not want them promoting until the game is in a finished state.**  I don't think DB is in a dire state right now, but first impressions are big and I would rather that players who aren't already on-board see it more polished.  

Its very hard to keep the attention of the average customer and I would rather DB in the best shape possible before they get there hands on it, **most people decide whether they are going to stick with a game relatively fast and they don't give second chances.**",1451606691

For the dressing, mix together 2pts oil to 1 part soy sauce (i do 6tbsp oil to 3tbsp soy sauce), add the seasoning from the noodles, and add sugar to taste (i usually do about a tablespoon, give or take)

Story line: (Freedom) Escaped slave wants to buy family out of slavery and risks certain re-enslavement and possible death to get back to the loves of his life (Django) Emancipated slave wants to buy wife out of slavery and re-enslavement and possible death to get back to the love of his life [Django is Jackson, Samson is Schultz, Linda is Brunnhilde, Junie is Candie]

Opening scene(s) (Freedom) Auction block with chained slaves marching prior to being purchased (Django) Chained slaves marching after being purchased

Quick portrayal of sympathetic individual (Freedom) Samson conversation about evil of slavery while Jackson on auction block (Django) Schultz kills slavers, frees slaves, encouraging slaves to kill remaining slave buyer.

Quickly dashed hopes of earning enough money quickly to purchase family out of slavery: (Freedom) Jackson worked for insignificant wages trying to obtain enough to purchase family but soon realized that they would be dead before he earned enough for the purchase (Django) Django earned $75 and was told how much more he needed to earn and his hopes for instant ability to repurchase his wife were dashed.

Lashing for trivial offense: (Freedom) Jackson's son whipped for throwing seeds. Explicit statement about wasting master's goods (Django) Young woman about to be whipped for breaking eggs. Explicit statement about wasting master's goods

Hero attempting to take punishment for loved one: (Freedom) Jackson begged to be whipped instead of son.(Django) Django requested whipping instead of wife.

Rape of hero's wife: (Freedom) Implicit. Impregnated by Junie (Django) Brutal in screenplay. Cut from final edition.

Hero's last name: (Freedom) Freeman (Django) Freeman. 

Uncharacteristic hero's attitude toward whites: (Freedom) Jackson defiance toward white man even on auction block; Jackson shooting and killing slave overseer (Django) Django openly sassing white men, much less killing them

Antagonistic attitude toward other blacks: (Freedom) Jackson's interaction with blacks marked by antipathy upon initial meeting (Django) Django - hard pressed to find cordial relationship with another slave

Black white partnership to rescue hero's loved one(s): (Freedom) Samson assisted Jackson (Django) Schultz assisted Django

White man killing another white man on departure from plantation: (Freedom) Samson killing Grant, Sr. at Grant's plantation (Django) Schultz killing Candie at Candie's plantation

They say they'll bring up more similarities during the discovery phase of the trial, but there's a lot of ground here. It's all in the complaint they filed.",1451606695

Getting divorced was difficult, but every time I feel that I can't make it I read a poem called Ulysses by Tennyson. 

Here is an excerpt:

Come, my friends,	
’Tis not too late to seek a newer world.	
Push off, and sitting well in order smite	
The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds	
To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths	        60
Of all the western stars until I die.	
It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:	
It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,	
And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.	
Tho’ much is taken, much abides; and tho’	        65
We are not now that strength which in old days	
Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;	
One equal temper of heroic hearts,	
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will	
To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.",1451606698

Over the years I've had over 12,000 parcels and countlessly more lettermail documents.... with zero thefts.  I have however had several UPS parcel thefts, internally.

Now do your homework on mass mail thefts at community mailboxes, which is a rising problem.  And that's ignoring the common problem of wrong slot and Dropbox key mix ups that are inherent in the community mailboxes.

And besides, why are you still fixating on the safety of the mail, instead of the humans?  Where are your priorities?

"bad_religion","t5_2yu3u","&gt; Even then, it's still wrong since there hasn't been any Christian group, orthodox or heretic, that has held the belief that Mary and Jesus have an equal role.

The Qur'an isn't saying that they are equal. It says that they are الهين. Mary is an إله to the Christians, but Jesus is both an إله and الله. That is like saying that because the Qur'an describes both Muhammad and Moses as prophets, that Muslims view them as equals. Do you see how that doesn't make sense? Just because Mary and Jesus are الهين for Christians, that doesn't mean that they are both equal.

In the same way, al-lat, who was a god for the Pagan Arabs was an إله for them. Manat, another diety for these Arabs was also an إله for them, but nobody disagrees on the fact that al-lat held a position above Manat to these people. So while they could both be described as الهين, one was more important and holier to these people than the other.

I'm not really sure how else to explain it. I feel like I've made this pretty clear by now.

&gt; Trinitarian Christians DO claim Jesus is equal to God, but it doesn't include Mary.

The Qur'an isn't saying that they are equal, it is saying that they are both إله. Just because they are both إله, that doesn't mean that they are equal. I don't know why you think that. Moses and Muhammad can both be described as prophets, but they are not equal.

&gt; Additionally the Quran makes it clear that the major flaw in Christianity is making Jesus a companion of God, meaning equal, this is refuted by the famous ""God does not beget, nor is begotten"" and it is this how it has been understood historically, and why many Muslims, considered Christians to NOT be monotheists. 

I don't know of any major Islamic scholar that sees Christianity as monotheistic. But I'm not sure what this has to do with Mary?",1451606701

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","I'm about to go on a short rant, so bear with me.  I will preface this by saying that I was in the Air Force for 8 years, so this isn't some anti-military thing at all.

I really dislike the leeway many people (in America) give to ex-military that excuses so much bullshit behavior.  My own mom did this the other day.  My older brother (He, myself, and my husband are all Enduring Freedom veterans) and I got into an argument because he was spouting off racist shit about Muslims, then later trying to pass it off as though he was kidding (although he's held this attitude for *years*).  

Anyways I was talking to my mom about it, and tries to explain it with something like ""well, he's seen things he didn't want to see...""  Bullshit mom, fuck off with that shit.  He and I had almost the SAME job in the Air Force.  We were both jet mechanics.  He's seen the same shit I have.

I feel like some people feel guilty that vets had to fight in this war that really shouldn't have happened, so now they often give us free passes to act like douchebags.

I can tell you right now that the vast majority of military, both active-duty and veterans, are embarrassed by people like your shitty ex, and absolutely do not condone that kind of behavior.  I'm sorry you had to go through that.

"csgobetting","t5_2zume","There was once a day where VP played Navi twice in a row one was a bo3 and the second was a bo1. At that time VP was playing very well and Navi was shaky. This was my peak of betting and I was playing VERY risky. I played the odds and did a risky max bet on Navi in the bo1 and a not so risky max bet on VP in the Bo3. (Inv. Worth around $800). Went to work and when I got home I saw Vp won the bo1 and lost the bo3. Angry with myself for being so risky I didn't bother betting until two days later and that's when I realized I had accidentally bet on the opposite teams I had meant to. I ended up winning around $600 off both bets ($240 was max bet back then). One might think that would be a kind warning to bet safer and that I might stop betting risky. I acted just the opposite and lost all profits within that month. Just now getting back into betting today. Sorry to see your leaving man.

Just to clarify, this ""category theory"" has its roots in generalizing mathematical objects (sets, groups, rings, topological spaces...) and more importantly the functions that can be naturally defined between them (set functions, homomorphisms, continuous mappings...). It allows certain ""universal properties"" like the isomorphism theorems for groups, rings, and modules to be formulated in a general way. This can apparently be applied to different formulations of logic, hence the interest to philosophy.

Not an hour after I brought the package in, there's a knock on my door. Two cops outside want to talk to me about the package I was seen taking into my house. Apparently my karate-cunted neighbor saw me take the package inside my house and, instead of poking her head out and asking me what I was doing, decided to just call the police instead.

My explanation seemed reasonable enough to me-- but the cops insisted that the package be placed back on the doorstep and that, if I had an issue, I needed to call the post office and the mailman could come pick it up. The cop said, ""Trust me, you don't want a postal inspector involved in this. You'll never get them off your back.""

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of the parts I found the most interesting and telling. There are probably a lot more that I missed, so be sure to give it a read and share what you find!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                    REY 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;               (quietly)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;          ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So just based on the wording of the script, it doesn't seem like Han is *guilty* at Rey's remark, but just sympathetic. This tells me that, in contrast to a few theories I've been seeing, he probably does not know Rey and is probably not remorseful at leaving her on Jakku.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So this is a pretty significant find because we now know for sure that the flashback of Luke is occurring near a Jedi temple, likely during Ben's revolt. This goes against a theory I had that he was actually at the village on Jakku when he touched R2.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It was already pretty heavily theorized, but we now know for certain that Rey was left in the custody of Unkar Plutt (the portions guy).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just thought it was an interesting little tidbit that her series of visions from touching the lightsaber is referred to as a ""forceback.""
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.
&gt;
&gt;This could be nothing, but I just found the wording in this moment to be very interesting, and possibly a hint that this isn't the first time they've met.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!
&gt;
&gt;Another interesting part of the same exchange. Perhaps this is where she learns a few Force movies?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
&gt;
&gt;For anyone who was wondering: no, she doesn't cut off any of his limbs. She scars him across the face. It's possible she destroyed his lightsaber, but we don't know.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
&gt;But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I thought this was an interesting little insight that she had a brief internal conflict with the dark side regarding whether to spare Kylo Ren or not.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted with countless GREEN TREES.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2, who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath and Rey continues her journey.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Not sure if this was already confirmed, but the planet Luke is on is called ""AHCH-TO"". Not exactly sure how to pronounce that.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His look says it all.
&gt;
&gt;Just an interesting characterization of Luke in that end scene.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning...
&gt;
&gt;The last lines of the screenplay. Really adds to the motivations of both characters in those last moments, and I also love the fact that the phrase ""Luke Skywalker's incredible face"" is actually used in the script.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&amp;nbsp;

I don't know what you think I'm arguing. I think the company did their best to accommodate the Muslim workers but they didn't feel it was enough, so they walked out and got fired. I have no problem with them being fired. I have no problem with them asking for accommodation.

WTF? That's not Red Pill.

There is a huge difference between ""developing your own life and meeting your own needs"" and ""emotionally checking out of the relationship."" JFC…

&gt;Going by The 12 Levels of Dread, I'm a bit baffled by the fact that none of the steps involve communication.

If you believe that you can negotiate attraction and respect, go for it. It has never worked for me. Ever. And I've tried. A lot.

Furthermore, I've never actually seen a play-by-play from everyone who advocates such an approach, so I tend to think this is a ""feel-good"" piece of advice rather than anything practical. I can't even imagine an effective, non-cringey way to do that. You can't just talk someone into changing how they feel about you.

&gt;It's entirely the male doing things around the female and never involving her at all, just kind of hoping that she'll do what you want eventually.

That's what becoming more attractive and a ""catch"" entails. You do things, and others respond. It may or may not be your SO, but if it's not your SO, at least you are now a catch and can move on to a brighter future.

Talking about how much of a ""catch"" you are is no match for actually *being* a ""catch.""

&gt;I feel like a lot more relationships have been saved with counseling than with lifting.

First, couples counseling is the least successful area of therapy. I have tried it, and I don't think it is anywhere near as effective as individual therapy. If you are a ""broken"" individual such that no one finds you attractive or worthy of respect, you need to work on yourself first.

And lifting in isolation might be slightly better (after all, you are working to improve yourself), but probably isn't enough to actually make much of a difference. Fortunately, there is way more to dread game than lifting (and, I would argue, lifting is probably the least important piece of dread game).

&gt;I didn't try to spend less time around her in order to somehow get her to want me more.

So you don't actually know if that would work. Got it.

&gt;Problem is, dread game isn't fixing a relationship. 

There is no guarantee that dread game will fix a relationship.

But it does go to work on the one thing a man *can* fix - his own life. Him fixing his own life probably gives him the best shot at fixing his relationship (since the goal is, after all, to once again become the guy that she - and maybe other women - fell in love with in the first place).

&gt;There's an obvious emphasis on the male's needs but absolutely none on the female's.

I don't know how controversial it would be to assert that women want to be with a man that they consider attractive, worthy of respect, and a ""catch."" That seems to be fairly ubiquitous.

Additionally, working around the edges to meet her needs without addressing those bigger issues won't get anyone anywhere. Yes, he might be able to *do* more for her, but chances are, she didn't marry him because of what he did, but because of *who he was.*

&gt;It's just kind of assumed that she only wants you to go to the gym and have hobbies and be dominant.

No. She wants you to be attractive, worthy of respect, and a ""catch."" How you become that is up to you. One fairly decent way is gym and hobbies, but every man is going to have to find his way to that goal for himself. And dominance can never be gained without first gaining respect - dominance without respect is not dominance. It's domineering and forcefulness, which is why everyone calls domineering douchebags douchebags and not leaders.

&gt;But dread game is largely about fixing you.

Because *you are the only person you can fix!* I can talk all day about how my wife should be and what she should do, and tomorrow I will wake up in the exact same situation I find myself in today (and I speak from experience on that).

&gt;The only way to use this tactic is if you aren't invested in the relationship to begin with. 

Elsewhere you have advocated breaking up. Breaking up means you are even *less* invested in the relationship.

Compared to dumping your spouse, I think that dread game indicates at least some greater degree of investment.

&gt;Dread seems very focused on being attractive to ~~other~~ women.

FTFY

If a guy is not attractive to women, how the hell is he supposed to inspire them to want to be in a vibrant, intimate relationship with him?

Would your advice just be to try to talk it out and then dump her when she doesn't really take his concerns seriously (because, remember, she isn't actually all that attracted to him and doesn't respect him)? That might be all fine and good as far as she's concerned (though probably not), but it does nothing to address what got him into trouble in the first place.

There is no reason to preemptively move on when you have nowhere to go and no better chances for the next round. Fix yourself first, then see what opens up.",1451606713

Also if any one wants an example of how just moving spawn worked perfectly take a look at what the server has already done, even better old (1.7) spawn is still there for everyone. The only downside I've seen is old spawn tends to be the site for greifing because it is easily accessible to new players and not many  people go there often.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Played it a few hours since Christmas and my opinion is still the same, glad I didn't pay money for it but it's fun to play for an hour or two.

A ""REAL"" MMF usually involves bisexual guys and everyone is having sex with everyone.  Not my real interest.  At the other extreme is the Eiffel Tower kind of thing - the guys go out of their way never to have any contact, staying at opposite ends of the girl.

The interesting one that gets lost in the letters is the in-between.  These are the threesomes that include double-barrel BJs or DP, either double vaginal or anal/vaginal.

A lot of straight guys are too homophobic to do these.  But some straight guys are secure enough, horny enough, or maybe a little bi-sexual enough to take part in these.

Some guys can get totally into a situation where cocks are rubbing without wanting to turn it into an MMF.  It is a bit unusual the first time.  But after a few, you get comfortable and there are some unique experiences.  

Once did a girl with two other guys with all combinations of DP.  You know you are OK with it when you can tell who is inside her with you by the feeling of the other cock.   One of the guys was uncut, so I could tell by the feeling of the foreskin when we were inside together.

I know a lot of straight guys would get really squeamish with that but we were all fine.  But I don't know what to call that, because it is not MFM or MMF.

But, yes, definitely would do (and have done) with the right people.

But remember something, these guys aren't well balanced people. If their whole life revolves around sex and fetish activities, they're headed for unhappiness. That you can count on. Not that you want that for them but they chose it when they seek to manipulate and hurt someone who loves them and would do anything for them. That's where you come in. Love isn't about doing anything someone wants to gain their love and acceptance. Love is supportive and kind and gentle. It puts the other person of like importance to self. He sensed you were willing to accommodate his whims and took advantage of that.

Get healthy and be good to yourself. If your self esteem has been dinged, build yourself back up. In the end, that relationship was doomed any way. With the next one, look for acceptance of who you are and who you are needs to be healthy and balanced and still loving, only now, let the loving be a two way street of equality in affection and communication and giving.

Earlier this year, FaceIt launched the ""FaceIt Pro League"" or FPL in short. This is basically a league for the top level players who play with FaceIt (including many professionals), to provide a chance for new talent to get noticed I believe. This FPL was only in Europe, and NA wanted to play on a league like this as well, so FaceIt launched NA FPL early December 2015.

The reason so many people talk about it, is because there are a lot of streamers (on twitch.tv) who play FPL in NA (such as m0E, DaZeD, etc.) and it is very enjoyable to watch these games.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I was going to post a separate thread but it's probably best here:

Today marks 2 years to the day since I had my last smoke.  Stereotypical right?  Well I had been combo smoking using a cig-a-like and smokes for a couple months.  Winter of 2013 did me in.  I got some kind of bronchial infection and I almost went to the emergency room a few times because I thought I was dying.  Waking up at 4am not being able to breathe, that fun stuff.  Back then I had a 3 year old and ultimately it came to a finality of “It’s selfish and I’m too young to feel like this”.  So I had already cut down drastically from a pack a day to maybe 3-4 but New Years Eve I decided no more.  

It’s not easy by any means and it’s not a direct replacement but it worked.  You gotta have some balls or drive to shrug them off for good but it’s possible and vaping definitely helped immensely where I failed many times before.  I’ve vaped for 2 ½ years or so now with 2 years steady after having smoked for 14 years.  I enjoy it.  It’s a hobby, it’s stress relief, it’s relaxation, it’s community.  Find what you like and want and go after it.  There are tons of devices to try, different ways to vape, different flavors, and vendors.  Find it and latch on and don’t go back.  It may seem like a lateral step and you’re making no progress (btw fuck people who tell you so) but trust me you are and your health in a few months will be eye opening.  The way I vape now is entirely different from my first 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year.  I like different flavors, use different devices, have different favorites.  It will change with you and there is no wrong way to do it.  Just don’t go back to smoking.  Ignore the vapeholes, the stigma, all that nonsense.  Do it for you and how you want to finally stop smoking.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Let me see if I can translate from idiot for you. 

You said ""all conservatives (implying Republicans) hate gays and Muslims""

He said ""Muslims are, as a general rule, strongly conservative.""

Now, here he conflated religious conservancy to mean ""conservative"" which translates to Republicans. This leap in logic then means to him that all Muslims vote Republican [evidently](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/26/muslims-increasingly-moving-away-from-gop/?page=all).

Now, here is where it gets a little hard to follow. Since you said all Republicans hate gays and Muslims, by conflating the term conservative, he is saying that what you meant is instead of Republican, you said all *Muslims* hate gays and other Muslims. So, obviously that is a generalization and you are obviously a racist/bigot. 

Now, in terms of the generalization that all REPUBLICANS hate gays and muslims, well... that is obviously true since that is their actual political platform and somehow is not racist/bigoted because reasons...",1451606739

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I haven't made a heavy strike build, so I'm not sure about the gem links. 

This tree doesn't look too bad; I would recommend you respec out of the elemental resistances (unnecessary usually). You will most likely be able to cover your resists with gear. 

Another thing is that you are taking some inefficient nodes, such as with the marauder wheel, you don't need all that damage. these extra points will allow you to reach other clusters in the tree to get more notable nodes.

The final thing I notice about the tree is a lack of life nodes. Most characters, especially melee want 160%+ life from the tree. You definitely want at least 4k life at endgame, and these life nodes will help you. Plus, many life nodes have additional benefits, such as increases to armor or life regen.

[Here](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAwEABTwJlg48FCAUcRnpITQhVScgLPs5DjpSOztBP0h4UEdR5lWpXhNfP2CRYMRhUmdYaFhqAXKpdn92rHdTe4x82X7ghMSFUoZgidiKIpd5l7SeV57FrY20L8VTz37Xltlh3DLkUeSt6hjrCe8O7073Mvjr) is a tree I would use. It uses one less point and gets a bunch of life.",1451606740

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;The internet was developed as a DARPA/University grant funded project.
   
There were other people working on things similar to TCP/IP, a data transmission protocol Ex [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_Universal_Packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PARC_Universal_Packet). That's just one component of the the internet. It was private business who adopted the protocol and built the rest of what constitutes the internet, hardware, software, infrastructure, etc. 
       
To say the government built the internet is completely incorrect. 
      
&gt;The World Wide Web (html) as we know it came out of CERN
  
And again there were precursors and competitors. Ex [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext#Implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext#Implementations)
     
That tax money thrown at a specific implementation that succeeded shouldn't be surprising. I'm sure I could come up with many project that would succeed with free money.
    
&gt;the free market was able to capitalize it efficiently
    
&gt;I'm curious as to what the free market alternative was going to look like
   
You've answered your own question.
    
&gt;But I'd like to know what nationwide transportation/distribution system was being considered by the private market  
    
One example: 
   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_highways_in_the_United_States#Super_Slab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_highways_in_the_United_States#Super_Slab)
   
Private roads have been built and are being built. There's rail, airship, transport over slower, smaller roads. Who know what would have developed. 
   
The thing is government took money and built the highway system. At this point the money is spent so it makes sense for people and businesses to use it. 
     
With respect, our lack of imagination isn't an argument. What could have been is unknown. 
   
Some things we do know:
   
1. The cost for building and maintaining the highway system is taken out of the market by the government. Thus any attempts at competing with this model are at a severe disadvantage. The state highway model gets money whether it's successful or not. This isn't true of private enterprises. 
     
2. The state highways systems gave rise to much of the the car/truck culture that many decry, due to CO2 emissions.
   
3. The state planners didn't consider CO2 emissions to be a factor in their planning.
     
*Privately funded rail was successful in one case. It was a very large system. It went from Chicago to Seattle. 
   
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_%28U.S.%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Northern_Railway_%28U.S.%29)
So there are many examples of private interests building large transportation systems.

More importantly than the shit finale is going back and just looking at the main plot device for the club as a whole. A crime/event occurs that would make CNN, RT, and Al Jazeera's front pages, but the club is left operating under incompetent law enforcement's eyes. The Patriot Act, NDAA, Homeland Security protocols...there is no way the club is allowed to move around freely after being involved in international arms trading (Scotland Yard, MI5, and Interpol might be interested in IRA activities), Mexican drug running (DEA, FBI), a FUCKING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING, executing TWO federal agents, a meth lab bombing, prison hits, gang shootouts across California, sex slaves, prostitution rings, and so on.

Just as that misses the point, the previous commenter and you are missing the point. It is not sexist to say what I have said; a member of a non-privileged demographic (in this case, women) does not have to qualify or couch in softer terms her personal experiences or weary statements regarding maltreatment by members of a privileged demographic (in this case, men) so that their feelings aren't hurt.

- I wasted my money on space engineers

- they're not listening to the players

- they're only in this to make money for AI research

- why not fix things that are fubar and everyone wants to use like rotors, pistons, connectors &amp; landing gear?

- Why add more mobs if the spider bugs don't work properly.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","That build will perform great. The only thing I'd say is that you have a motherboard that supports overclocking and a CPU that doesn't. So you can either downgrade the motherboard to one with an H97 Chipset, or upgrade the CPU to the i5-4690K.

As for memory, it's better to split up one 8GB stick into two 4GB sticks, for Dual Channel. So see if you can find a set of 2x4 Ram sticks instead of a 1x8.

I have a Samsung SSD, and a WD HDD, so I can't speak about the storage devices you have, but I'm sure they're fine. 

Other than that, looks great! The R9 390 will perform awesomely. I don't know what the parts and pricing availability is like where you are, but this looks good.

As for learning, I highly recommend you start doing some research into what the parts do and how to put them together. There's are some nice guides in this subreddit's sidebar, and I would also recommend watching some YouTube videos. Newegg has some nice ""How to Build a PC"" videos that teach you how to connect everything. Study up on those beforehand, and follow those videos when you build!

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The way this is written, I'm assuming it's coming from an official source.  If that is the case, my thoughts are do it properly or don't bother doing it at all.

- All weapons should be able to be mounted and displayed singly on a wall mount or some sort.
- Shields are usually paired with a specific sword, so they should also have a way to display the pair together. 
- Books on display honestly wouldn't be impressive just stuck on a shelf. They need a lectern or an easel to be displayed properly, with the lectern offering the option to have the book open or closed and the easel always having the book open (an easel wouldn't really work with a closed book).

- 4 mannequins for a mansion O.o seriously wtf? I'd want a full set of all the artifact armors (originals or the new ones) on display. We'd need 10-13 for that, not counting any new classes/jobs that come out later.

As for weapons only being able to glow when ""active,"" there's the glow-while-sheathed glitch people have been using forever. Surely the devs could figure out a way to incorporate something like that so we could have glowy weapons stuck on the wall.

DAoC, had the option to simply open the housing menu, take a weapon or shield from your inventory, stick it on the wall, and BOOM! the image of the item was then stuck to the wall. you could then move and turn the item however you wanted. I'm sure FFXIV has completely different coding than DAoC... but that's also a 15 year old game. They made something like that work so simply; surely the FFXIV devs can as well.

Finally, you have to actually place the real item on the mannequin/weapon rack? WTELMF? You get a brand new item and want to display it proudly, only you can't because... ya know... that whole actually needing that new item to make your character more powerful. If they won't make it where we can simply place an image of the item in our housing area, then we need something along the lines of glamour crystals 2.0. Some kind of ""blank"" housing items that can take the appearance of real weapons/armor.

Spaying, however, can be different. When a female dog is in heat, an intact male will do literally anything to get to her. You'll have to keep her supervised and essentially locked away from any male dogs that are intact. (This means no trips to the dog park, though they usually have a list of rules banning females while they're in heat anyway.) I would advise spaying her because it will be so much easier for you to have her spayed that you having to watch her closely and clean up after her. Another huge benefit is that it will cut down on the risk of pyometra, which generally springs up fast enough that it requires emergency surgery. If she gets pregnant, then the risk for getting hurt during that or needing surgery to remove the pups will be higher if she mates with a dog bigger than her (like the lab). 

A spay should not be too hard on her. I've seen plenty of small cats spayed without issue. ",1451606754

Obviously, this changes with your relative position east to west in a time zone, but the theory loosely sticks. 12:00 is a common way to refer to the time of noon or the opposite of noon. Any time on the 12-hour clock corresponds to approximately the same position of the sun at its equal time, but on the other side of the transit. So this explains why midnight happens as 12:00 instead of 1:00.

This standard came into place as the Romans developed sundials; their ""day"" started at noon, which occurred roughly at the same time during the day no matter how long the day was (seasonal variance). As timepieces became more complex and we developed clocks that did not rely on daylight to function, it became more functional to make the day change over at midnight while everyone was sleeping.

I'm sorry your puppy isn't doing well!

It sounds like you've chosen to handle this conservatively. That's not a bad option: not all blockages need to have surgery, but it's vital that you and your vet keep monitoring the situation.

Most blockages get stuck on the way out of the stomach. The tight muscular ring, the pylorus, can clamp down on something like a knot in a piece of sting and not let it pass through the stomach naturally. The other place things get stuck a lot is just at the other end. If large, stiff masses can't pass the bend to get in to the large colon, they can cause a 'traffic jam' behind them. It sounds like your dog has passed the first milestone, and that's good news!

Conservative management depends on regular imaging (usually radiographs (xrays)) to see that the blockage, whatever it is, keeps moving. If it does stop moving, anywhere for any reason, the only alternative is surgery. 

My suggestion: if the vet says it's moving and is comfortable with a plan of conservative management, then stay the course. But, while this is going on you may want to consider what resources you have available if it turns he (your dog, not your vet) needs surgery. The vet can probably give you a ballpark figure for you to work with.

Good luck! I hope it comes out alright in the end!",1451606756

"TalesFromThePizzaGuy","t5_2uh13","Oh my god, I'm sorry /u/bluemannequin but you might be THAT guy. 

We HATE that guy. 

We LOSE money by wasting time on a order, we want out of their ASAP. If we're not coming to your door there is a reason:

1. We cannot due to city ordnance (hotels, usually)

2. Where you're asking us to deliver makes us feel unsafe. (Very dark/sketchy/""bad feeling"")

3. We do not have enough information to find where you're at. 

If this is happening repeatedly and with different drivers, you're likely the problem! Ask them whats going on. Do you have apartment numbers on your door? Is it confusing to find your room? 

Also, the fact that you order pizza, give us a contact number and refuse to pick up when we need to contact you....UGH!

I don't know where you live, but if its not a very nice area my money is on #2 and #3. If where you live already looks sketchy and the instructions are unclear and you refuse to answer your phone, i'm going back to the store. 

Seriously though, figure out whats going on next time. Talk to the drivers, talk to the manager. If it is multiple driver's fault, that can be fixed. If its something wrong on your end it can probably be easily fixed. (unless city ordanance) 

This can have a happily ever after for everyone.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; Do you not think that's a bit of an arrogant claim (not saying that in any way makes you as a person arrogant). To claim that anyone of the untold legion of thinking men, past and present, who have looked to the Bible and found something of moral worth 'just haven't thought about it very much' seems to imply that they all lack some sort of intellectual capacity.

That probably *would* be an arrogant claim. I'm not saying you can't find things of moral worth in the Bible. I'm saying that there is nothing noteworthy about the Bible in terms of moral sophistication, for its time or ours. The various component books seem to reflect the ethical mores we could expect your average person to have possessed around the time(s) of authorship.

The point I'm addressing by my ""thinking person"" comment is, specifically, the meme that the Bible is somehow uniquely, transcendently, or even surprisingly insightful with respect to ethics. This notion is confoundingly prevalent despite being simply unsupportable in evidentiary terms.

&gt; I can dance through Hosea and pick out the good bits, for example.

Sure, but the second you start doing that you can no longer claim to be deriving moral guidance from the book. What you're talking about is using your own pre-existing ethical intuitions and deciding which biblical passages conform to them. Given that you're using your ethics to inform your opinion of the Bible, instead of the other way around, you should probably be assigning the credit to whatever *actually* informs your ethics.

&gt; The Bible adds so much nuance

Adding nuance to an ethical insight doesn't make it more insightful. It's obfuscatory at worst, and unnecessary at best. Reduction and clarity are old friends.

I mean, which of the following is more likely to promote good behavior in adherents?

1. If you rape someone, you have to marry her and give her father money. Love your neighbor as yourself. Don't beat your slaves so hard that they die. Don't worship other gods.

2. Don't intentionally inflict suffering on beings capable of suffering.

I don't see this as a question reasonable people can disagree about, and I struggle to envision what someone might intelligently argue in opposition.

&gt; That's not clear. It almost certainly developed independently in other parts of the world, but it's not clear that the Jewish tradition copied the Golden Rule from outside to write Leviticus 19:18

This may be a fair statement, but I don't think it impacts the point I was making. The Golden Rule is not original to the Bible, and therefore my adopting of it does not mean that my view of ethics derives from biblical morality to any degree. That's all I was getting at. I was trying to pre-empt a potential response that *my* ethical position was somehow derivative of the Bible, when the reality is more akin to convergence on a point where the Bible happens to get something right.

&gt; Being principled is good in and of itself.

Why? I suspect you see what's happening here—non-utilitarian justifications tend to reduce to ""Because that's just what I think, dammit."" And even *that* doesn't stop the cycle.

&gt; Bleurghh. I understand the position, but I think it's terrifyingly... ugly. And my poet's heart will never let me agree with an ugly idea.

As Carl Sagan was fond of saying, it's better to face a harsh truth than to embrace a pleasant fiction. We've moved beyond debating questions that have objective answers, at this point, but I think it's very dangerous in epistemic terms to let your assessment of what *is* be impacted by your preferences.",1451606758

* Following the Rockets' pattern this season, they're going to rebound from an embarrassing loss to a mediocre team with a fun win over a good team. I'd expect a win tonight.

* The Warriors will be without Stephen Curry this evening. This is less than ideal, because I think every Rockets fan wants to get a W over a full strength Warriors team as a little payback. On the other hand, a win is a win and the Warriors are still plenty dangerous without their star player. Look for other Golden State players to step up their game in Curry's absence tonight. The Rockets will have their hands full.

* We get to see Klay Thompson embarrass himself again as a first scoring option that the defense is focusing on. He's the spoiled rich kid son of a wealthy NBA player, given every advantage in life in his prep school upbringing? Fine. He handles the rock like he's in slow motion and is stupidly unathletic for a 6'7"" guard? Fine. He looks like a creepy default create-a-player in NBA 2K14, has all the charisma of a warm fart, and is the most overrated player out there right now? Still fine. But then he's got to go and shit all over James Harden and the city of Houston's own Jimmy Butler by telling people he's the best shooting guard because his team has the best record? Nah. Fuck this guy. *Fuck him right in the ear.* I need to see this trashtalking also-ran humiliated tonight, which is exactly what will happen again when he's not being fed open looks by Steph Curry.

&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Here are some of the parts I found the most interesting and telling. There are probably a lot more that I missed, so be sure to give it a read and share what you find!
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;                    REY 
&gt;
&gt;&gt;               (quietly)
&gt;
&gt;&gt;          ... I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Han watches her -- sees a vulnerability that touches him.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So just based on the wording of the script, it doesn't seem like Han is *guilty* at Rey's remark, but just sympathetic. This tells me that, in contrast to a few theories I've been seeing, he probably does not know Rey and is probably not remorseful at leaving her on Jakku.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT NIGHT. We PAN to:
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE, whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;So this is a pretty significant find because we now know for sure that the flashback of Luke is occurring near a Jedi temple, likely during Ben's revolt. This goes against a theory I had that he was actually at the village on Jakku when he touched R2.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical. Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku, watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;It was already pretty heavily theorized, but we now know for certain that Rey was left in the custody of Unkar Plutt (the portions guy).
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I just thought it was an interesting little tidbit that her series of visions from touching the lightsaber is referred to as a ""forceback.""
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer, his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move, quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.
&gt;
&gt;This could be nothing, but I just found the wording in this moment to be very interesting, and possibly a hint that this isn't the first time they've met.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!
&gt;
&gt;Another interesting part of the same exchange. Perhaps this is where she learns a few Force movies?
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them, she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
&gt;
&gt;For anyone who was wondering: no, she doesn't cut off any of his limbs. She scars him across the face. It's possible she destroyed his lightsaber, but we don't know.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
&gt;But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;I thought this was an interesting little insight that she had a brief internal conflict with the dark side regarding whether to spare Kylo Ren or not.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted with countless GREEN TREES.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of the ISLANDS.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2, who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath and Rey continues her journey.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt;Not sure if this was already confirmed, but the planet Luke is on is called ""AHCH-TO"". Not exactly sure how to pronounce that.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His look says it all.
&gt;
&gt;Just an interesting characterization of Luke in that end scene.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's only hope.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;     HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise of an adventure, just beginning...
&gt;
&gt;The last lines of the screenplay. Really adds to the motivations of both characters in those last moments, and I also love the fact that the phrase ""Luke Skywalker's incredible face"" is actually used in the script.
&gt;
&gt;

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Hmm favorite thing of 2015... modern day toys of course hehe :)

One question that's been on my mind lately is: ""Is being single and childless a disadvantage in modern day life?""

For example let's say you work for a certain company and they need to fire a few people to save money. Do they consider the family status of an individual? Will you have more chance to get fired if you were single without children rather than someone who's married or at least has kids? I just imagine that in the thought process that preceeds the firing, they'd think ""Well that person is single, he/she can find another job, we'll keep the other one even if he/she's not that efficient because kids depend on him/her.""

I guess being single and childless might seem ""bad"" when you reach a certain age where almost everyone you meet has a kid or family. People can think ""Nah, he's expendable, we can't just make someone with kids and a family have to go through trouble, might as well just be the single person.""

Well that's just what I've been thinking of lately, how modern society perceives single people and how it can be beneficial or disadvantageous to them. :)",1451606762

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt; Again, care to support that with any evidence?

The very definition of those things is evidence. Women get in easier.

&gt; Your claim wasn't that there was discrimination, it was that it resulted in a tangible effect on men's income being less than womens. That requires a substantial amount of evidence. Again, I'm asking you to support your claim with some empirical proof or evidence which would show that this is the case.

Again, look at the definition of those things. If 50 women and 500 men apply to a job with 100 openings and a 50-50 quota then all the women will get hired but only a tenth of the men. 

&gt; Since it was being used as ""evidence"" of something which, in all honesty, you haven't even proven to be existent in the first place (That women make more than men), I don't rightly know what to say other than... you have to support your claims with some measure of evidence.

Again, the very definition of those things. A man and a woman apply to MIT for engineering. They have equal extracurriculars, equal SAT, and equal GPA. The woman is more likely to get in by the very definition of what AA is.",1451606762

Those of you that have been in the military know the drill sergeant, hated the drill sergeant, and loved the drill sergeant.  The sergeant had your back.  

&gt; You can basically choose one of two things, regret or discipline. Fuck motivation. It's not going to be the solution. You can't count on it to always have your back. Discipline though, he's a tough fucker who will put you in your place if you let it. Don't fight against discipline. It takes energy away from you doing what you know you should be doing. You know what discipline wants you to do, don't fight against it. Don't think about how you don't want to do it, just do the thing you know you need to do.

There he is again, 34 years after basic training -- Sergeant Discipline.  Tough guy, putting me in my place and looking out for me.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","Well, if you haven't noticed, the people immigrating to white countries tend to come from backwards ass, overpopulated, corrupt, hellholes.  That's why they want to go to Europe and the US, because they're the best places to live.  People bring their cultures with them, and most never fully assimilate, contrary to what most of the diversity rainbow crowd wants you to believe. They're home countries are shit holes because of their culture and their people, and they're going to bring their problems with them.  There's a reason white people aren't migrating enmasse to non-white countries, because they are almost exclusively shitty places to live. I don't blame people for wanting to escape south/central america, or the middle east, or Africa, etc, but you have to be incredibly naive to think there won't be repercussions.  Of course, the fact that you claim whites are the ones who exclusively hold power speaks volumes about your lack of understanding of the world.  Whites are a small minority in the world, other races vastly outnumber us, and the number of non-white countries dwarfs the number of white countries.  Non-whites hold near exclusive power in their own countries, but only white people are expected to surrender their culture, control and sovereignty.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","Same story here. In the early '00s I was all about 'the struggle for equality' and - though I had the benefit of outside influences keeping my bullshit somewhat in check - was pretty much willing to immerse myself in the kool-aid, believing that what I did, said, and supported was in the service of humanity as a whole. 'The Greater Good' so-to-speak.

It wasn't until I started questioning some of the targets we were going after (local teachers, businesses, or public figures who refused to donate 'to the cause') and aggressive, near-violent tactics we were not only using, but *gleefully bragging about* that I suddenly wasn't welcome into the discussion anymore. That very quickly evolved into me being an 'active sexist' who needed to be 'exposed for what they are' to the point where I lost one of my first jobs as my name became synonymous with 'sexist piece of shit' in a relatively small town. The owner and I happened to share mutual acquaintances within this group, and they had all fallen in line to keep me out of the only social circle I had ever known.

The entire experience shattered whatever tiny scrap of faith in my fellow human being I might have still had at that point, and I basically spent the rest of my teenage/early adult years burying myself in gaming/scifi/fantasy. It was one of the few places that kind of person wasn't something you had to deal with regularly, and you could really let go of yourself and relax.

I was more than content to allow them to shit up whatever subculture or hobby they wanted to, so long as they left me right the hell alone. Then, well... we know what happened to *that* particular situation, don't we?

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","For dungeon grouping--you really want to get a guild or circle of friends.  There is a queue, but it's not that great at lower levels. On PC it's fairly easy to find a good guild if you want to focus on dungeons and stuff, dunno about the PS4 community.

For your second question about builds...if you want to DPS, you basically want to choose between magicka and stamina.  Your BASE class abilities all use magicka, but some can be morphed into using (and scaling from) stamina.  Any staff weapon uses magicka, any non-staff weapon uses stam.  Your Ultimate will scale from whichever is higher so don't worry about that.

If you're heavy magicka, use light armor primarily, heavy stamina use medium.  Heavy armor can be either, and primarily if you want a more tanky build at the cost of lower dps/efficiency.  Points into health are the same--get the amount of health you need to survive decently, the rest into your primary stat.

If you want to tank your stat priorities and skills are more complicated, but you probably shouldn't tank until you've learned the game a bit.  If you want to heal, you need to go magicka, and level resto staff.

As a new player, basically start off this way:  Take one skill from each DK tree and have it on your bar.  You level the tree when you have at least one skill equipped when you turn in quests/kill enemies, or use the skill in combat.  Do the same with weapons.  The more skills in a tree you have equipped on your active bar, the faster you'll gain experience for that tree.  So for instance, if you have three bow skills equipped, your bow line will level up faster.

You want to level all three class trees, and the trees of your chosen weapons, so that you'll have access to all the skills and passives for those trees.  By the time you unlock those, you'll be a high enough level to know which ones suit you the best and use those.

Respeccing isn't all that expensive, so don't worry about spending points in the wrong thing, just try stuff out to see what you like.  Respeccing just morphs is really cheap, so you can experiment all over with those.  The cost goes up the more skills you have, so especially at low levels, mess around with different stuff if you don't like what you have so far.

By the time you hit 50 you'll have around 100 skill points, but there's between 300-400 total, which means you will be able to have multiple ""builds"" available without having to respec.

www.esohead.com has a skill calculator if you want to get a feel for how many points you'll need for certain things.  Good luck :)",1451606781

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","**How did 2015 pan out for you?**

Not well. Things took a bad turn at work, so I started applying for places in March. Found a job in a new city, so I moved for it. It turns out that they lied about the work, my supervisor, the average compensation (partial commission, and they said that plenty of people exceeded goal despite no one ever having reached it in reality), and there was literally no training. That, on top of being treated like shit openly, led to me quitting after two months. I knew on day two that I would be miserable, but having a job is *fairly* important. I've now been in the final interview stage for three different jobs and not gotten any of them, so that's a fun confidence boost. 

I did lose about twenty pounds, and then gained back ten healthy, muscley pounds. 

**Any plans to celebrate?**

I'm going to a NYE party for an hour or so. Ball will drop. People will sing. I will drive home. 

**What are your hopes for 2016?**

Get a job. Keep getting involved in the local arts community through performance and improv. Start dating someone again, though this is tricky in a new city and in an era where if the first date isn't skydiving into a field of sunflowers with line-dancing ponies, you're not going to get a text or a call back. 

**Do you have any resolutions?**

Blog about all 162 baseball games a particular team plays and finish the first draft of another novel. Not entirely sure that anything will come of them. ",1451606783

"WWEGames","t5_2t9bx","&gt; I set my own universe rules too. I have trade windows April / July.
&gt; Those are the only two months I'm allowed to add legends to rosters, trade roster spots etc. To freshen up the feuds and rosters.

This is huge. Maybe not this specifically, but changing things up every now and then so that you aren't seeing the same people every single time. I have two brands, so I have a lot of superstars at my disposal. Whenever a feud is over I determine whether I want them to stay on the active roster or not. 

&gt;I've also split my roster sort of. Raw for the maineventers / legends. Smackdown for the midcard / NXT guys. NXT in my universe I use for CAWs who might get a call up to either Raw or Smackdown one day.

This is where you and I are a little different (though neither of us are necessarily ""correct""). I treat my Universe A LOT like Lucha Underground. If you don't know - almost all of their roster is treated equally, with the exception of maybe Mil Muertes and the very few jobbers (who you still manage to care about and cheer for winning). So in my Universe, I have a MONSTER for each brand (Kane on Raw, Bray Wyatt [and his disciple Haku] on NXT). Very few jobbers. Also only 3 matches per card. ALSO both my brands are considered equal, and I have sort of a brand vs. brand feud that I'm enjoying.",1451606784

The world of Fallout is one that deserved what happened. Looking at the very last years in the lore, you can easily see that war could have been avoided. The US had started to phase out oil, fission reactors were replacing everyday energy needs, the global political landscape was probably at it's all time low but recovery was not out of reach.

She and her 8 year old sister were moved to her grandparents care while her younger year old sister and newborn sister were placed up for adoption. A few years ago the older one sent out for adoption made contact with her and it turns out she was adopted by a family in Denmark. She has no idea where the youngest sister went. At the time her mother had the breakdown none of her father's or mother's family was willing to take the two youngest children.

She lives with the stigma of having a mother in a mental institution. We actually ended up breaking up because she believed that my mother looked down on her because of her family pedigree.

Then just do buff and either wolves or chickens depending on what side you are. An important tip for conserving your life here is to kill the small chickens before the big ones, they deal more damage combined and are easier to kill. Then I like to take crab because sometimes I can catch the level 2 enemy jungler tryna do it, and otherwise it heals for A LOT with both the heal you get from hitting it w/ machette and the heal you get when it dies. Then just clear your top side, and try to get 5 stacks of ferocity off the remaining scuttle for a good gank top if it's in position, otherwise recall with enough gold for an upgraded smite and a longsword or boots and a pink.

- “You going to meet the princess?” Roach asked. Her voice was even quieter than usual. Charmer laughed. Brand shook her head. Gadren, however, gestured briskly for silence. “You mock,” he said, “but who here was not inspired by one of the great heroes of the Rebellion? Or if not of the Rebellion, heroes of times past?” Charmer bowed his head, smirking. “Wish I’d been—” He stammered out the words, but maintained the smile. “—good enough to blow a Death Star when I was young. But I’m—too old for idols.” “It was just a question,” Roach muttered. “I saw her on a pirated holovid once.” Namir’s forced smile was becoming a grimace. Brand glanced his way and offered what might have been a look of sympathy. “For my part,” Gadren said, his voice conciliatory, mediating, “I am merely glad the Alliance sees a future, even if I cannot. If Governor Chalis can provide a means to change the course of this war…”
- Namir felt the desperation under the questions. These were soldiers who’d just seen their friends die, who’d spent the last months losing every piece of territory they’d gained. Of course they wanted hope. Of course they saw Alliance Command as inspiration. Namir couldn’t share that hope, and he couldn’t bring himself to darken the mood of his comrades further—not when every other conversation in the room revolved around Fektrin or Ajax or Cappandar, people who’d sacrificed themselves to get Twilight to safety.
- “Spare me,” Namir said. “That’s my dying wish. Spare me the stories of the great Lord Vader’s terrifying triumphs over the Rebellion.

From Lost Stars

- Dak’s chatter broke his reverie. “I still can’t believe I got assigned as gunner to Luke Skywalker. The guy who singlehandedly destroyed the Death Star!” “Somebody’s going to be his gunner. Might as well be you.” Thane was mostly glad it wasn’t him. Yes, Skywalker had shown incredible courage and made a near-impossible shot—he deserved respect—but that particular act of heroism was one Thane preferred to admire from a distance. “And they say he hopes to become a Jedi Knight, just like in the olden days,” Dak continued, talking as dreamily as a schoolkid with a crush. “Do you know he has a real, true lightsaber? He even learned how to use the Force from the great General Kenobi, the last of the Jedi!” It was all Thane could do not to groan. Please, not more superstitious nonsense about the “Force.” In his opinion, the rebel troops needed to be motivated by the harsh truth about the Empire, not crazy religious beliefs.

- Thane whispered to Yendor, “Who the hell is General Solo?” “You know. Han Solo! Captain of the Millennium Falcon?

- Luke Skywalker, again. Thane managed to keep from rolling his eyes. But Princess Leia he admired. If he could trust anyone, he could trust her.

- And who is this General Calrissian? Thane decided not to ask that question out loud. If the Rebel Alliance was happy turning over its two most critical missions of all time to a bunch of brand-new generals, okay, fine—",1451606791

I think everyone should just be what they want to be, and fuck what is considered ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" by anyone else's standards except your own. It's really just immature to be concerned about whether or not others find you ""manly"" or ""womanly"" enough; people who you know and respect are the only people whose opinions matter. If you spend your life being concerned about what everyone around you thinks, you end up being a slave to an image, maintaining a facade, and you'll never really believe that anyone actually cares about you because you never let anyone know the real you.

With the advent of the locomotive, we began to see important deliveries via private protection (Pinkerton), which could resemble today's UPS, Fed Ex, or even Brinks.

I think the popularity of private deliveries happened when we tried (and succeeded) to privatize the USPS. More than likely package security became too expensive. To this day the USPS still operates in the red and only stays afloat by government subsidies.

Sorry for double posting, but I didn't want the edit to miss your attention. Here's the description of the blades from the Barrow Downs:

&gt;For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvelous workmanship, damasked with sperpent-forms in red and gold.. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of *some strange metal*, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell* that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.

On top of that, there are a lot of medications than can impact fertility, the course of a pregnancy, and the development of the fetus. And then you have to consider drug-drug interactions. Maybe you are taking something to help with pregnancy that could interact with a drug he wants to give (or perhaps you are taking a form of birth control that will interact with a drug he wants to use).

Even though your visit might not be directly related to your reproductive health, it is a necessary component of your health that your doctor needs. It gives not only a more complete picture of where you have been, but also about where you want to go. If you had said that you wanted kids in the future, that could limit some of the options he would consider because they may make becoming pregnant harder.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; so, to you the phrase ""the absence of evidence"" refers to complete ignorance.

Definition of evidence: ""The available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid""

Source: http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/evidence

The absence of evidence means there is no available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is true or valid. This would mean we have no information indicating that something is absent or not. Absence of evidence is indeed not evidence of absence by definition. An absence of evidence is NO evidence, hence it can't be evidence of anything. 

&gt; and negative evidence refers to a lack of expected evidence...

Negative evidence refers to an available body of facts or information indicating whether a belief or proposition is false or invalid. When I open the box and see there is no cat I have negative evidence of there being no cat in the box.

&gt; you are merely arguing semantics

semantics are important, its about what we mean when we say something. Something can look syntactically fine but broken down semantically that very something can be proven to be incoherent. A good example of this is found in the [Frege-Geach Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIzsMHApx8I).

But if you don't want to discuss it that's fine. But I'm offering proof that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence by definition.",1451606805

"food","t5_2qh55","That is American buttercream. Sometimes the water is replaced with milk...sometimes there is a mixture of shortening and butter, etc., but it's all variations of American buttercream. It is very sweet and can sometimes be grainy if you use grocery store shortening such as Crisco.

Other buttercream varieties (Swiss/Italian/French) are meringue based, so sugar and egg whites are heated to a safe temperature and then whipped up to a thick meringue, at which point a shitload of butter is added. You can also substitute the egg whites for meringue powder. These icings are smoother and less sweet than American buttercream, but they don't hold up as well in hot weather.

Then there are million variations to alllll of these that produce slightly different results. I'm still on the hunt for the perfect buttercream ratio. Right now I use 2/3 butter, 1/3 shortening and that seems to help it from becoming to grainy.

You probably don't care about any of this whatsoever but I have icing on my brain constantly so you're my next victim, sorry.

The other characters' emotions were basically Riley's emotions but dressed up to look like the characters whose heads they were inhabiting, so by default they have to be the same gender. I feel like it was just an easy way for Pixar to show which emotions belonged to which character, since they had already set up the archetypes with Riley. The exceptions to this are the cat and dog emotions, who all did look like their respective animals, but that just seems like an easy way for Pixar to say ""These are cat emotions"" or ""These are dog emotions"" since it'd be somewhat confusing if they used Riley's set.",1451606808

She drifted off, or maybe she’d never woken up.

Her skin was cold, and wet, and everything hurt, especially her arm. Her eyes still closed, she was drifting again when her memory came storming back. 

There had been bandits; Morton charged, and she was scared, and proud, and Eon followed. They’d been brave, and she’d only run. But she’d gone back, and again she was scared. A bandit found her, and she was scared until she put an arrow threw his eye, and then a second bandit, she’d killed that one, too, she hadn’t killed the third one, only hurt him, she killed him later, she knew, but what about the fourth one, the fourth bandit had Morton’s sword and charged her and she was scared and she was cold and wet and everything hurt andwherewassheandwhatwashappening –

She bolted up, her heart racing and pain blazing in her arm. She let out a little scream, and fell back to the ground. Pitifully, and through tears, she cried the only name she could think of.

It is more beneficial to focus on what YOU can do better because that's the one variable you can change.

It's difficult with one of my favorite heros like clockwerk because positioning and smart engages are crucial. I have found myself in games where I feel completely useless because I can only farm or try to salvage and avoid terrible engages. Even after casting cogs to split the enemy team and disengage while explicitly telling people it was a bad fight and we should retreat have had people go back in alone and die.

My problem is I don't want to build skills to carry bad players, or follow poor decisions like following your team into a throwshan or a terrible play just to be ""with the team"". So it's frustrating to hear people preach about only playing the game for yourself. I just want to play games where players are making mistakes on the same tier as mine. I feel cheated if I play games where I feel there is no possibility of a victory, not because the comeback is not possible but the comeback depends on people playing the game properly or smarter than they have been.",1451606810

"metalgearsolid","t5_2s4hr","See I disagree with you a bit here, you seem to imply it was a total bad game.

It wasn't, it had a decent story with amazing gameplay and good development.

The problem is, it didn't reach its full potential as a Metal Gear Solid game. Like your example, Liquid. What of Eva? Solid Snake? It had intense potential to be an amazing Metal Gear Solid that it unfortunately did not fulfill.

However, if you begin to look at it as a stand alone title, it's a very good game. Perhaps not GOTY, but nowhere near ""afraid of wasting my money"". Well worth $60 and more. What does that even mean? You don't decide how much value someone finds in something for anyone but yourself.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Negative and positive liberties are pretty much meaningless concepts without a baseline so your CMV makes little sense. The government actualizes rights, specifically property rights and liberties are conditional upon claim rights, which are conditional upon the property rights set by governments. 

When a government enacts a law such as ""Some subset of property owners may not allow smokers to smoke in their property"" they have changed the definition of property. Specifically the property owner used to have a liberty right to allow or disallow smoking while the smoker used to have a liberty right to smoke so long as the property owner did not use his claim rights to bar smoking. 

In this case there are two baselines present: The old property rights giving property owners a liberty right to set smoking allowance, and the new one without this. Relative to the old baseline we have infringed upon the negative liberties of the property owner and smokers. We have improved the positive liberties of all to breathe smoke-free air near or on this subset of property. However relative to the new baseline there is no change in liberties, because they are conditional upon the underlying property rights that are set by the government. 

Point is your post can be boiled down to the following: Relative to the baseline of anarchy, governments should maximize welfare based on an as yet unspecified welfare function and almost no one disagrees with this. You need to specify a welfare function and a baseline property rights system for anyone to criticize this post in any meaningful way.",1451606811

Out of those 3, my favorite is Dart, because there are optional types and good tooling. However, the experience is fairly similar if you use TypeScript (and compile it to JavaScript).

The most noteworthy advantages of Dart over TS in this context is that Dart supports operator overloading and SIMD.

In case you've never seen Dart code before, here is a fully typed example which gets all of its types via type inference (except for one ""as CanvasElement"" type cast):

If they do that Boston trade, EVEN if they get Ben Simmons they're still a losing team for the next 3-4+ years while waiting for him to develop into an elite player. Meanwhile all the momentum Vivek was trying to create with the new ownership and rebranding has long since dissipated.

"SSBPMCE","t5_3b4ys","The big problem I have with lift as his up B is that it's exclusively an extra jump. Even when grounded, if it just launches you into the air, what's the point? Giving him Retreat when grounded gives him some nice horizontal ground based movement which syncs nicely with his movese,t while still representing his status as a series protagonist well, while creating something with a hitbox under himself for the air born version means it can be used as both a recovery and an attack. Using Lift to just throw himself into the air serves no purpose other than a jump.

Project M has so SO many examples of how it strayed away from Smash's norms (Lucario being the biggest example), so I don't see why a character having a different Up B when grounded, and when air born would be a huge deal.

As for the animation on Retreat, yep. It's weird looking, but it doesn't have to be. The most important thing about the move is the colourful sparks and that it's a teleport. If the animation was just Isaac raising one hand (like doing half of the animation you made for Gaia) and then teleporting quickly, leaving the sparks behind, with another flash of them when/where he appears it would look all the part of Retreat, with none of the cheese from the original game. Din's Fire's animation from OoT would look SUPER weird on Zelda.

And onto UNOwen. I'm unfamiliar with anything he's done outside of that video, but it always struck me as very much a work in progress. I agree that right now it totally doesn't hold up in regards to how it's animated, but that's not why I linked that video. Animation problems aside, the B moveset is basically perfect. The only thing I would change about it is I'd switch Rockfall to Spire. It fit's his character perfectly, and there's a good balance of attacking Psyenergy from his base class (after switching rockfall to spire) and utility Psyenergy (which is an important part of his character to represent) For the rest of the moveset, I'd change his Forward Smash, up tilt (maybe back to how it was in the dev build, but that's a lot of Growth), and neutral air (it feels really out of place) so they fit in more with Isaac in his base class.",1451606822

The police aren't a civil abuse department for people you don't like. Our cops unnecessarily use deadly force because they're literally the example of poor law enforcement training. They're told, daily that they're in grave danger when the FBI crime statistics clearly show that this is the safest era in history to be a police officer. 

We actually terrify our Bakersfield cops. They're not all bad people (though we have some crooked cowboys). They're good, honest civil servants who are terrified on the job and have been told they need to be afraid of everyone and treat every situation like it's lethally dangerous.

This preposterous idea has created a major problem. Our cops regularly shoot unarmed people, and because they investigate themselves, they never (shock) find themselves as fault. 

You can be pro-cop while still criticizing them for unnecessary violence and corruption. We have a lot of that here and it doesn't make the streets safer; quite the opposite. It creates a sense of desperation for criminals and law abiding citizens alike. It's bad for a community to assume their law enforcement officers are potentially going to kill people because they're too tightly wound.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, the undertaker must remove all of the jewelry before cremating but, the family should have been given the jewelry. The statement the undertaker gave is utter bullshit. Placing/leaving jewelry ( not just gold) on the body that is about to be cremated is very dangerous because at the high temperatures that body is burned at they could explode, create toxic fumes, or damage the machine. I am kind of confused by what you meant here ""During the cremation memorial service his son noticed that his gold rings and gold chain were missing."" Was the body being viewed before it was cremated or was this after being cremated?
Just my little piece of advice: I would stop trying to fuss with local law enforcement and maybe try and see if any other families in the area have experienced this. If you get enough people together you can talk with the local newspaper and really get people talking about it. Funeral Directors and crematoriums depend on the towns they are placed in and try to give off the local business/family owned vibe. ( Most are actually owned by a company called SCI) This will bring a lot of attention to the issue like you want and hopefully find justice.

Every single girl that was 5'7 had absolutely no issue with my height, and I did very well. Considering the vast majority of women in the world are 5'7 and below, it's bullshit to tell me that at 5'10, you're receiving shit for it.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Tl;Dr: they wouldn't install the equipment unless I had a unique TV in each room. Their confirmation email didn't state anything about this. Their managers wouldn't override the policy and tell the tech to just install it and leave. 

Called a month ago to schedule an install for yesterday because we moved into the house today. I wanted everything installed and ready to go for  when we got settled in.

The tech called me and asked if he could come early, I said sure and had my wife meet him at the vacant house. I'm thinking to myself, not only are they on time, Google is early! They are way better then the other companies. 

Next thing you know the tech calls me and says he can't install anything unless the TVs are there. I said the confirmation email didn't state anything about having to have TVs in the house for the install. He said it was a new policy and he has to abide by it. Luckily my landlord is a bro and brings a TV over. OK, crisis averted right? Nope. 

While the landlord is running to get the TV, I call customer support to get some ralationale. First level guy has no explanation and goes on this rant about policies. As someone who works for a Fortune 500 company I definitely understand policies and also know many are dumb and should be overruled by a manager. The supervisor says it is indeed policy and can't be overridden. At this point I ask what the rationale of the policy is and he says 1) to make sure everything works for excellent customer service and 2) so they don't have to come back.

Epic fail on both of those reasons. Their email did not state anything about this, if it had, I would have been aware and planned accordingly. This policy was successful in pissing me off and they would have had to come back anyways because the install wouldn't have been completed except for the fact my landlord brought a TV over. 

Every room they are setting up has to have a unique TV in it which is dumb. Why can't I just bring the TV from room to room? My landlord had to bring two TVs over and my wife had to get one from her parents.

Answer: YES or NO? Pick one.

Think of any turn based JRPG on PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One. Unless that game is named Final fantasy XIII, it has not sold more than 5 million copies.

 Blue Dragon, Resonance of Fate, The Last Story, EVERY Disagea, Star Ocean, Every Legend of Heroes, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Fairy Fencer, last remnannt,  Last Rebellion, Trinity Universe etc etc.

Every single one of the turn based JRPGs besides XIII  I can think of right now has failed to get past that arbitrary 5 million mark. Ni no kuni made it to 1. FFXIII-2 made it 3 or 4. and FFXIII made it to 6.

From what I figured I need like 2 viridian , 1 cinderstone and 2-3 moonwater brilliant keys. 

we are getting 1 of each with the master pack and I will buy the others. I am not wasting NCoins on the costumes until they release better ones. ALSO hongoon coins are quite easy to earn and I will just use those to buy costumes. 

For the First play through, if we dont take breaks and play hardcore straight for 20 hours , we can definitely hit max rank even if we are stuck with level 36 or 42 level weapon. Keep in mind that once you get your level 42 hongmoon weapon , you ll need a shit ton more of the moonwater transformation stones and since it will be the first day of headstart there wont be any sold on the Auction house nor will any one have leveled their soul warden rank high enough , also they take a lot of hours &amp; mats to craft. 

All said and done.

 Use exp soups in grinding zones where mobs give a lot of exp which I have marked down. 

Use brilliant keys and skip all the rng bullsht with wheels of fortunes or dungeons

Rush end game dailies and dungeons and we should we 45 before the 1st day is over. 

2nd we can start working on crafting and evolving weapons. Maybe even work on  getting the faction soul shields.

* Body was found right outside Stevens house, burned in his own fire pit.

* Stevens blood was found in the RAV4. Granted that it may have been planted, but we can't *prove* that it was.

* Steven called and requested Teresa Halbach. He even *allegedly* hid his identity while calling. - calling her out to the property by name may not be that damning, but when combined with the fact that she was never heard from again after the appointment, it kinda is.

* The bullet in the garage had Teresa's DNA on it.

* Her key was in his bedroom.

Now, once you take into account the idea that the police planted evidence and provoked the case against Steven Avery, these things can be nullified for the most part.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","You can become a vampire however you like, and the ""IsUndead"" tag will be applied. It is a pretty good idea to join the Volkihar though, as the Vampire Lord form is exceptionally powerful in its own right, and there are a few other worthwhile rewards for joining. Specifically:

* Transforming to Vampire Lord form can be done an unlimited number of times each day, and each transformation resets your character's daily racial power. This is especially awesome for Orcs, Argonians, and High Elves. Also keep in mind that their powers will benefit from Necromage, so instead of the Argonian Histskin giving you +10.00 HealRate for 60 seconds (default HealRate is 0.70, so it's actually more than the 10x multiplier the in-game tooltip states), it will give your necromage vampire +12.50 HealRate for 90 seconds! And as many times per day as you want! Same principles for other powers, but again, Orc, Argonia, and Altmer are the best IMO.
* The Ring of the Erudite is only available if you join the Volkihar/Harkon. It is arguably the same most powerful item in the game — it adds +100 Magicka, which is awesome, but better yet, it's the only item that buffs MagickaRate (normal Fortify Magicka Regen items buff MagickaRateMult). The Ring of the Erudite adds +2.00 to MagickaRate both in and out of combat (default values are 3.00 out of combat, and 0.99 in combat). And again, Necromage will buff the ring's effects to +125 Magicka, and +2.50 MagickaRate.

FYI, MagickaRate is the percent of your max Magicka recovered per second. And it's ideal to combine the Ring of the Erudite with standard Fortify Magicka and Fortify Magicka Regen gear, because they all support each other with increasing returns. A well-built vampiric mage can be recording easily 75+ Magicka *per second* in the endgame. Make it a High Elf and use Highborn, and your Magicka bar will refill from 0 to max in about two seconds. (And, again, with Vampire Lord, you can get access to Highborn as many times per day as you like!)",1451606838

I am looking back on my own breastfeeding journey- my 19 month old is still nursing, and I am *so proud* of that part of my motherhood saga.  These days, nursing is easy- it's fun, it's silly, it's sweet, there are parts that are kind of hysterical.  But the first 4 months or so were literally horrible.  The only reason I didn't stop was that every time I didn't nurse or pump longer than 2-3 hours, I got horrific plugged ducts and wound up with mastitis from oversupply.  I had 600+ frozen ounces in my deep freezer (that I bought just for breast milk).  I attended breastfeeding support groups at 4 different hospitals hoping I would find a lactation consultant that would help me with oversupply issues before I found a random journal article on pubmed and tried a modified block feeding technique that evened out my supply.

But in all of that misery, I really missed out on precious moments of my daughter's life.  It was awful.  Breastfeeding was not worth missing that beauty, that growth.  That time.  What you describe sounds horrific.  It may have been worth it to you, but I would have totally (enthusiastically) supported someone experiencing your feelings switching to formula.

Poe has displayed no really good dogfighting skills. He dose not use altitude to his advantage and mostly shined due to the fact the Stormtroopers displayed worse piloting skills than they do aim.

Wile his aim is excellent, I would blame that on targeting computers and such rather than it being all him because everyone had amazing aim or horrible aim depending on the plot.

Now the force awakens x-wing is a horrible vehicle. It is slower than modern jets and turns slower than some of them as well.

The cockpit offers minimal viability and because of how far the guns are off the center, it would have big problems with inaccuracy due to convergence.

It's only advantage over a modern fighter in a dogfight are it probably has a much better TWR though this was not displayed in the atmospheric engagements,  it has much more firepower, it suffers no engine power loss due to altitude, and durability maybe.

You’ve never seen the fight between him and Tony Tucker, have you?  No.  I imagine you haven’t.  Doesn’t sound like you have anyway.

I know it might sound that way to you, and I imagine it might sound that way to me too if I didn’t know as much as I do about Tyson, boxing, what specifically he did and how he was doing it (during that time of his career), etc.

&gt; Tyson would absolutely have a punchers chance against most of them, but if any of them made it past round 5 Tyson is either gettng knocked out or losing on the cards.

Tyson was nowhere near just a “puncher”.  Again, there was a technique to what he did that none of the other fighters you mentioned had.  They weren’t even close to it actually.  When you’ve never boxed, or haven’t done it for a long time, however, it’s easy to miss what specifically he was doing and how effective it was.

They ignore chaff, so even with three A-rated boosters they will be through A-rated shields in about 15 seconds. There is no way to outfly the laser fire from 3 ships in a python and still attack one of them at the same time - that's what's completely impossible. If you think this IS possible, you haven't tried it.

Even with SCBs, you now need to blow a heatsink every time you use one. That means loading out all your internals with heatsinks, since they only come with 3 ammo, which means sacrificing shield boosters, which only makes the problem worse. It's completely borked. 

The only remotely effective strategy is to boost continually in reverse and wear down one vulture at a time. Takes about 20-25 minutes for the first vulture. Then you can attack the second, but by the the main python or conda target has jumped away.

A bit more of my experience - after the flatline (at about 30 days for me) I was super-horny, had trouble sleeping, had rock hard boners in the night, but when I tried sex, I still lost my erection during intercourse.

But if we're talking purely in terms of plot (i.e, if this were a book or a graphic novel) - I definitely think the Kenobi theory makes the most sense.

Anyway, the theory I posted above doesn't actually require that Rey is a Kenobi. It only requires that (at least) one of her parents was a student of Luke, and the other parent took the lightsaber and hid Rey on Jakku after fleeing -- only to be killed later on (and thus, not being able to come back for her).

There are weaknesses in this idea too, of course (another one I just thought of is --- why did her parent think she'd be safer alone than with him/her? why is Kylo more likely to find him/her but not Rey? these questions can actually be asked about any theory that involves Rey being hidden for her own protection by her parents...)

There are limited resources and Mother Nature (if you'll permit some anthropomorphising) has to make choices: sure, you can have an animal awake more hours of the day, but more energy (a limited resource) would need to be devoted to staying awake. Being awake at night also incurs challenges: seeing in low light requires specialised eyesight that also requires features that are ""expensive."" This is partly why you see organisms that have adapted to living in near or total darkness have *lost* their vision: there's nothing selecting for it, and the energy that could be used towards growing and maintaining working eyes could be re-allocated elsewhere.

So, if an organism can survive long enough to reproduce, and *doesn't* need to be awake 24/7 to do that, then what benefit is there?

&gt; Also, I need to ask: so the first two Madoka Magica movies are recaps, right? Are they worth watching or should I just go ahead and watch the third one, whenever I decide to watch these?

Yes, they're recaps. No need to watch them, just watch Rebellion. It's like 2.5 hours but it's great and really adds to the ending. Since you say you love Homura, as I do, you REALLY need to watch it.

BTW how do you feel about Kyubey now? He used to be your favorite, or at least the one you found most interesting.

&gt; What do I watch next
I'm thinking about watching Hanasaku Iroha or starting Raildex. 

Personally I recommend Raildex, but it depends on what you're in the mood for. If you want supernatural action with minor ecchi and harem elements, pick Raildex. If you want a slice of life with comedy and romance done on a decent but not good level but a cute and determined female lead, pick Hanasuka Iroha.

BTW if you follow my advice and pick Raildex, I recommend watching Index first since it's like the basis for Railgun.

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","So last night I was at this new years thing that ive been to for the past few years. It's a gathering of a bunch of my parents friends and ive always tagged along because bonfires and fireworks and bbq are good.

Well there was a couple interesting things that happened. Firstly after midnight we started letting off some fireworks. Its a relatively rural place so we are all intriqued when a car starts coming down the driveway. Turns out its this lady with horses in the area and the fireworks are scaring them. Now normally if you are going to a party and asking people to stop doing something you would think you would be polite right? Not this lady. She starts cussing everyone out like mad, yells at one guy who was doing the fireworks to stop before calling us all a bunch of fucking cunts and speeding off back down the driveway. It was hilarious. We did stop letting off fireworks though.

The second interesting thing had to do with the bus crash on the pass. Being on the west coast naturally the bus crash was a relatively big topic of conversation. Well one guy who was there is actually a doctor who was on call at the time and went and treated some of the nonserious injuries. Checked them over and the like.  
One of the people he checked over was the bus driver. Apparently according to the bus driver his brakes failed at the top of the viaduct. He went to slow down to shift down gear and found that he couldnt. Now this driver manages to drive down the viaduct, past the lookout, down the rockfall protection works and another sharp corner before finally coming to rest round the sharp corner where the crash happened. All with no brakes.

Thats a frigging nuts feat of driving if that turns out to be true. That drivers a hero that he managed to not go over the edge. Sounds like the car might have just had a bad case of poor timing as the bus driver would have been using the entire road.",1451606847

They can be just as elaborate as any stick built house.   Depending on options and quality of builder, it can cost about the same per sq foot.    It is the same as any other house.   It just came to the site in big pieces instead of a zillion 2x4s.  

Upside: it can be habitable in a month or two after prefab parts done &amp; site work ready.   If it rains when house is being completed, no damage should occur to the framing or other parts.  It should come from the plant with a roof.  A good contractor will get the roof seams shingled shut and watertight within days of delivery. 

Mobile homes are NOT built to the same codes.   They do not require foundation.    Theyre more like a car in that they have a useful life, then you tow them away to the scrapyard and get a new one.

Mobile homes are much cheaper per square foot, particularly because they dont need a foundation.    Up side is you can buy one off a dealers lot and have it habitable in a matter of weeks.

One big difference:  financing and depreciation are done differently between real houses on foundations versus mobile homes.   If this is a business decision, talk to your account and/or your finance company to see if you should even consider a mobile home.",1451606849

There are lots you can do with them. You will need to cook them, however. You can cut them into 2"" x 1/2"" pieces and roast them. Salt and pepper and olive oil is fine, adding some thyme and some balsamic vinegar is nice too. Roasting them together with carrots is good, there are lots of recipes around for that. You can peel them, chop them, and boil them with potatoes for making mashed potatoes, then make a root vegetable mash (I like to add buttermilk and sour cream along with butter to my root vegetable mash, but regular old milk and butter is fine too). You can also chop them and add them to a chicken soup along with your standard chicken soup vegetables (carrots and celery).

Episode 1:  Severely overhated.  A lot of it is actually really good, yes there are a lot of issues, but none of the issues present are also not present in the original trilogy.  It's a nostalgia thing, people overlooked these issues in the OT because they saw them when they were kids, but by the time the prequels came out they were too old get get nostalgia goggles for the movies.  That and the internet influencing most opinions.  When your told something's terrible or something's great long enough, you're more likely to start believing it.  It's why people think the game Shadows of the Empire is awesome, despite the controls being fuck awful.  

Episode 2:  Okay, even as someone who likes the prequels, this one is bad.  It's certainly not boring, it has the second most amount of action out of the entire saga, only being topped by episode 3.  But the writing and delivery, especially from Hayden Christenson.  I had a lot of nostalgia for this movie that was instantly destroyed when I watched it as an adult.  I will say, take out every single scene with Hayden, and the movie becomes astronomically better.

Episode 3:  This one I can actually kind of agree with you on.  Again, main problem is Hayden Christenson.",1451606856

However, you being a part of western society are directly as responsible for ISIS and destabilisation in the middle east as successful people are of making it difficult for the youth to get a foothold. In fact, we can take this further and say that every time you call a company that outsources its jobs from india, you are responsible for Americans being denied their jobs, whenever you  buy a product made in china, you are responsible for fewer american manufacturing jobs, every time you decide to go to Walmart instead of Costco or Mcdonalds instead of some other local diner that pays decent, you are facilitating the establishment that allows big business to maintain minimum wages.

The key point is that you achieve a lower rr when the tires are inflated to the same pressure. That is an inherently flawed comparison as you would not do that.When inflated to the proper pressure for its width the differences are negligible. However, you lose in aerodynamics which in a race situation is worth being aware of. It is not insignificant, November bicycles have made a good test where the ""time saved"" for a 40k TT would go from 22-ish down to 15-ish.For recreational riding wider tires are a good choice.

Helping kill Windu...while hypocritical since Mace was essentially making the same argument Anakin himself had believed when it came to Dooku...was actually the right thing to do according to the Jedi code.  Mace Windu had absolutely no right to execute an apparently defenseless and defeated enemy...much less when that amounted to assassinating the duly elected chancellor of the republic, who up to that point they didn't even have any real proof had committed a crime!

"nvidia","t5_2rlgy","Very little. Maxwell design was per shader performance over processor/computation density to give them performance and power efficiency in DX11 based games

AMD releasing Vulcan/DX12 has thrown a monkey wrench in that design path so now they have to go back to kepler and update it to match current AMD GCN architecture. Pascale is a stopgap measure against AMD until their release their brand new architecture called Volta.

With the new API's game devs can tailor the execution pipelines to the exact hardware you have so having as many shaders and raw compute packed into your silicon chip as possible is more important than shader size and even clock speeds.  The AMD Hawaii architecture (290X) has 2800 raw shaders the GTX 980ti has 2800 raw shaders.  On top of matching shader count even if the AMD shaders are weaker they also have ACE's that nvidia maxwel cards do not have. On a DX12 game called ashes of the singularity clocked a 290X at matching and even surpassing the gtx 980ti a card thats costs nearly three times as much. The equal ammount of shaders even if they are weaker combined with the massive efficiency boost of the 8x8 ACE's showed that AMD's GCN is vastly superier to maxwell architecture so long as you have an API with the ability to tailor the pipeline.  

So pascale and volta are steps backwards and sideways to catch up to AMD. I assume that the flagship card in pascale will through sheer brute force be faster than the AMD flagship but it will also be a hoursefire like the titanX was and it will suck much more power and cost an obscene ammount of money In price-to-performance AMD is guaranteed to be the better buy since all they have to do is refine their existing designs and cut manufacturing costs to bring prices down.

Fiji architecture with HBM2 and a process shrink to 14nm FinFET will be monstrously powerful especially for VR rigs and it will likely sell for 350 and 450$ for binned and unbinned versions.  If nvidia can build a pascale card to match that performance AND sell it that cheap I will be so amazed i will have the nvidia logo tattooed on my forhead.

The advantage for both these companies often swings back and forth every few years and for the next 2-3 years AMD has the high ground thats just the way it is.  Nvidia has to do a design overhaul and AMd doesnt ergo AMD saves tons on R&amp;D and testing which translates into lower prices",1451606864

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","The hand-wringing over authenticity, legacy, and whatever other record store philosopher bullshit around this announcement is one of those moments where you have to step back, take a breath, and remind yourself, *""Holy shit, it's just a band.""*

Sure, LCD really played up their farewell and that last show at Madison Square Ggarden, but, as it's been pointed out in this thread, bands do this all the damn time. I think Streetlight Manifesto vowed to play their last shows in 2012 or so, and were back on the road two years later. Bands don't have to have shit laid out in front of them.

James Murphy doesn't owe it to anyone but himself on if he wants to get LCD back on the road and into the studio. If you went to that last MSG show (or streamed it) and felt things, those things are just as valid now as they were then. They're not desecrating anything; it's not like Murphy died or some shit, and Nancy Whang and Pat Mahoney are reviving the band's name just to tout it out. If you feel like the band has slighted you by getting back together, I mean, I see that, but you're not in LCD Soundsystem. Probably.

It's also interesting to note that the rock-doc *Shut Up and Play The Hits*--which ping-pongs between footage from the last MSG show, an interview Murphy did with Chuck Klosterman, and Murphy going about the next day in NYC with the dazed stupor of a man who just got off a train in an unfamiliar city--implicitly calls the break as a bad idea. Most of the interview is Murphy justifying (more to himself than Klosterman) that the break-up is the right move, and the documentary's final/most emotional note is him alone in the storage space where all the LCD gear is put up. He takes in the dimly lit space, covered instruments and amplifiers, and essentially breaks down. It almost doesn't matter that a gorgeously shot, excellently performed, and perfectly cathartic version of ""New York, I Love You But You're Bringing Me Down"" finishes the documentary, it's already telegraphed the point: Murphy debated for a longass time if the decision to end LCD because he was afraid of screwing up was the right one, and too late he realizes *""No*.",1451606866

Furthermore, Ilum is a canon planet (as seen in The Clone Wars). One of the only canon planets not featured on this map.

In the novel Tarkin, we find out that they used giant Kyber crystals to create the superlaser on the Death Star. Kyber crystals are found in abundance on Ilum. If you were creating a planet-based Death Star it would make sense to use a planet that had lots of Kyber crystals. And as a bonus, it defiles a holy Jedi site.

"keto","t5_2rske","Been in keto for the majority of the past ~3 years.. My biggest tip for not falling off the bandwagon is to not make it a bandwagon. I have had intense struggles along the way with my personal discipline and motivation. 

I turned the corner when I started becoming obsessed with my athletic performance and health instead of with my scale weight and with how fast or how much I was losing. I would recommend taking up a sport or setting some athletic goals. For me  I found motivation and discipline in long distance running, jiu jitsu, kickboxing, and wrestling. We have long since lost touch with the natural form of what it is to be a human, and I think that getting in touch with your physicality in some way is a great motivator to stay on track. It is what worked best for me at least.

As others have said, motivation waxes and wanes. What made any of us fat is simply a lack of discipline. Getting back to where you want to be and staying there requires you to go from a lack of discipline all the way to exercising the most rigorous discipline possible. To me, the biggest and most important challenge in that is learning to pick right back up when your discipline falters.",1451606871

Reddit made a mistake when it allowed top level subreddit creators to engage in censorship. The network effect that happens in top level subs allows moderators there to abuse their power, and the result are communities that are typically worse off, not better. /r/Calgary is actually relatively good in this respect, I've observed some crazy shit in my 9-years on reddit. Power has corrupted many mods in many subs. 

The site would be much better if free speech was guaranteed in all top level subs. Reddit allocated power incorrectly in this instance and they should either take it back or institute a system for correcting censorship on said subreddits. Certainly making all top level subs fully transparent would be a big improvement. It would make the site much more relevant and interesting.  ",1451606873

Many of the ""suggested"" daily values are either woefully inadequate or so over blown it's not worth pursuing. Especially on keto, how they're provided and absorbed is largely different than it would be on a ""normal"" diet.

Unless you're actually deficient in anything it's not worth pursuing 100% daily values on your micros. A lot of it is akin to refilling a bucket instead of plugging a hole.

That aside, almost all the ""nutrients"" micros or macros you need you'll get easily on keto eating whole foods. 

Gonna steal this from an /u/anbeav comment:

&gt;Here's my comprehensive grocery list (items in bold be top choices for my first shopping trip):

* **Coconut oil**, **olive oil**, avocado oil, **butter**, ghee, duck fat, tallow, schmaltz, bacon grease  
* Vegetables: **broccoli**, **cauliflower**, artichokes, green beans, kale, **spinach**, swiss chard, eggplant, **lettuce**, zucchini, mushrooms, asparagus, cabbage, bok choy, spaghetti squash, fennel , brussels sprouts, collard greens
* **Various hard and soft cheeses, cream cheese**  
* Nuts and nut butter  
* Various salami and deli meat  
* Meat: chicken breast, **chicken thigh**, whole chicken, pork shoulder, pork loin, pork belly, **bacon**, goat, lamb, **steak** (sirloin, ribeye, flank, hanger, flat iron, chuck), **ground beef**  
* Fish: shrimp, crab, salmon, tuna, sardines, swordfish, mackerel, mahi mahi, cod, **canned fish**  
* **Bouillon cubes or bones for homemade stock**

The fact that wierlessness may decrease audio quality slightly is fine by me.

I also have looked on google and saw that I might be able to get away with a Battery powered Bluetooth dongle I could attach to my existing Sennheiser headphones and one to attach to my amplifier. If This would work I would not be apposed to just using the one set of phones and just bundling up the Senheiser cord to go into a shirt pocket or something.

In the post above someone from Saddleback specifically states that they changed some processes regarding their quality control so that they can use more of the hides with less waste. Which means more jacked up leather makes it into your bags.

Check out he github wiki for more explanation and an easy demo setup guide.

Sal is a reporting application that runs alongside Munki. It checks in as a post flight script when Munki finishes its stuff.

[Drive the boat to where the yellow dot is] (http://i.imgur.com/Bo8LeqI.png), and then [park the cargo plane something like this] (http://i.imgur.com/kLSsG8w.jpg?1). I recommend maxing out your plane gear to make this go faster if you mess up. Then just fly your plane out into the middle of the ocean where you have plenty of room to mess around, and try and shake it out of your plane. Be very careful using the grapple as it may make things kinda explodey. I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I crashed my plane into the water on accident and it actually worked out pretty well, the boat popped out (albeit upside down) and I was able to drive it to one of my ports (after flipping it).

One more thing DO NOT tilt your plane. only adjust the yaw. Once you are in the air just keep the plane level until you are over a nice large body of water, because it will fight you on this and I have had things go south real fast because of it. And the Plane Boost, while useful for take off, will tilt your nose up so lay off the throttle once you are level.

If your giving him the option, sure, but if your trying to make him animate a creature, that is neither medium or smaller nor humanoid, I don't think that's fair. Necro is already pretty subpar compared to Illusion, Divinity, and Abjuration.

Instead of 4 creatures that have multiattack and a combined health pool of 240+, you want to give them a single creature with 96hp, a single multi attack, and easier to hit? Nevermind the trade of two heads would be at the cost of wounded fury.

IMO, if having a necro with a small army was going to be an issue, you should have brought it up with the player beforehand.

Edit: seems as if I might be reading the animate spell incorrectly, but if RAI is that any humanoid is suddenly a wimp zombie, I am not a fan. Killing random farmers and killing a cackle of quaggoth should not give you equal-strength zombies.",1451606888

Didn't say it wasn't, and don't patronize me.

""different lenses"", warframe vs. weapon kills.

I didn't say that it wasn't possible to fully explain the situation, but it becomes much more cumbersome when you have to provide so much information just to qualify your statement. Kills per round never changes and doesn't require any extra data to convey your message.

I will agree that at the end of the day, I want to know how much Focus is achievable, but without the extra data to qualify that value, kills per round is an easier statistic to compare these farming methods.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Major League Gaming, once the largest esports company in North America, is going out of business. In a special meeting on Dec. 21, MLG’s Board of Directors approved an Asset Purchase Agreement granting Activision Blizzard a large majority of MLG’s assets in exchange for $46 million.

The next day, a letter went out to stockholders informing them of the sale. We have included an excerpt below:

http://i.imgur.com/2jKCADu.png (re-hosted)

In addition to these changes, CEO Sundance DiGiovanni has been removed from his role and replaced by Greg Chisholm, MLG’s former CFO.

The move was done as a “corporate action taken without a stockholders’ meeting by less than unanimous written consent of our stockholders,” allowed under Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

The Asset Purchase Agreement was also approved by the written consent of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Corporation’s Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series B-1 Preferred Stock, Series B-2 Preferred Stock and the Series A Common Stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted to Series A Common Stock basis.”

Stockholders in this category include Treehouse Capital LLC, Ritchie Opportunistic Trading Ltd., Oak Investment Partners, and Legion Capital Investments LLC—managed by Mike Sepso, co-founder of MLG and current senior vice president of esports at Activision Blizzard.

Stockholders not in these categories are largely meeting the decision in disbelief. Some speculate that the majority of the sale will go towards paying off MLG’s debts, leaving little to go around for the remaining stockholders. MLG has filed for multiple debt financing rounds this year alone, for a sum of over $6 million. “I got fucked on stock,” said an affected stockholder, who wanted to remain anonymous.

MLG steps down after leading the esports scene in North America for quite some time. For many years, the company successfully ran tournaments across the United States for StarCraft 2, Call of Duty, and other titles. MLG also announced that it was building an arena in China.

However, MLG has also taken on recent blows, such as when rival ESL was named as the tournament runner for the Call of Duty World League.

Only time will tell how this move affects other MLG ventures, such as the upcoming Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Major Championship in Columbus, OH. The only thing known for sure is that MLG, as we know it, is over.",1451606892

"bloodborne","t5_31k9i","That's exactly the case, people either like the fast moving spammy nature of Bloodborne or the slower dance like nature of DS. I enjoy DS2 PVP the most because of not only the seer amount of build options available but how the game handles movement and attck animations.

Everything seems more fluid in DS2 compared to DS1 and DeS which had more stiff movement and attack animations. When two people fight it ultimately looks like a dance, yes it's slow(compared to Bloodborne) but it's because of that lack of speed that every move you make counts as it can get you punished severely.

In Bloodborne however, everything revolves around speed. Your weapons, playstyle, etc comes down to who's mashing circle the fastest and has R1 taped down. You'll come across certain players(usually veterans of DS) who will play unlocked, actually go for set ups, use jump attacks, and walk around you in an attempt to feel you out before attacking. And being able to play this way is extremely gratifying.

However this is just for our own amusement as neutral dashing into your opponent and waiting for them to whiff the gunshot then mashing R1 is far more efficient in Bloodborne PVP. And you as a result have to also mash that dash button because if you stop moving for a second you're going to get three shotted.

And then of course there are weapons that are just objectively better than others and can be played with completely mindlessly with few counters against them, examples include Bloodletter, rakuyo, any saw weapon, Pizza cutter, cane, and the one handed Ludwigs. If you encounter any of these weapons with something that's not on that lost, you're going to have a bad time if they decide to play like an asshole.",1451606893

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt; It is referring to itself or to the conventions of its genre. The latter part of that definition very much applying correctly.

It's really not. The important part is that the term is an adjective to describe something that is self-referential, i.e. a movie about cinema is meta-linguistic because it discusses the conventions of movie making.  So calling something like a weapon **the meta** is not correct, because:

1. the term meta here is describing a quality of the weapon (like it's damage, or TTK ratio), not the weapon itself or the entire scope of weapon use in different situations (i.e. its conventions; instead it focus on a single ""best"" use case); 
2. it's grammatically incorrect, since an adjective cannot be ""the"" anything, so that movie or a weapon can _be meta_, but not _the meta_.
3. [EDIT] I should also point out that when a movie, or a painting, or a book, or anything else is described as meta it's because it shows an opinion or point of view regarding itself or its category of things. A weapon itself doesn't have a point of view about weapons; **you**, the player, have an opinion on what weapon is the best. Only if the weapon itself was created with the specific purpose to show how to be the best weapon (even without necessarily *being the best weapon*) it could be be meta, although again not *the meta*.

**TL;DR**: using meta as an synonym for ""best in kind"" does not make it a correct use of the word.",1451606894

You can actually *see* the energy dissipate up his leg and ripple across his calf. Damn.

This ""technique"" is actually fairly easy to learn if you play soccer somewhat regularly. You get a feel for the weight of the ball, and which parts of your body to tense and which to keep loose. The real talent he and other pros show is doing it on the fly, while running, or from a really high/far ball.

I mean, there is a regular bar night for guys with superhero fetishes, so you can surely find somebody who just wants to cuddle on the first date.  It's kind of a minority preference and you'll probably have to do a good bit of looking, but you've got a huge pool of guys.  Just be very clear about what you want.

And there is plenty of well-researched info about STDs out there, but you will be at extremely low risk as long as you don't have unprotected anal sex.  IIRC, the risk of contracting HIV through unprotected receptive anal with someone with a high viral load is &lt;2%, and it is essentially zero during oral.

And as somebody who's introverted and was not from a touchy-feely family, it was almost amazing how good the body contact during sex felt the first time I did it!  Simple stuff like holding hands is 1000 times better when you're doing it with a naked guy with a hardon!",1451606909

The problem I have is that I don't believe the front office has addressed the holes this team sorely lacks to get them to the next level (namely bullpen). It's unfair to expect Kazmir to fill Greinke's shoes but collectively and now with Maeda the team has the depth to sustain injuries necessary for a playoff run. Lets be honest, up until last season Kershaw has not performed in the post season to level that his cy young credentials suggest. Where does that leave the rest of the rotation if Kershaw continues to struggle? Kazmir? Ryu? Anderson? Who is going to get the wins in October? Where is that other dominant start going to come from?? It's not like this team has the offensive numbers or run producing stradegy to manufacture runs and make up for a poor outing or a shutdown bullpen to shorten the game. This team is still not built for October as far as I'm concerned. If the goal is to build a ""competitive"" then fine yay lets start popping some bottles for another NL West title and start the circle jerk now. If the goal is to get to the world series this team still has no clue how to get there from the front office moves down to the attitude of the players and management. I hope I'm wrong but I've been following this team closely for the better part of two decades now and I have yet to come into an offseason (with the exception of 2009) saying yes from top to bottom this looks like a balanced team.",1451606910

It hasn't had an ounce of development, and it probably never will.

This pairing has been an albatross around Serena's neck in terms of character development and has made their entire friendship feel as stilted and forced as the ship is, since it always seems to play a significant part in any major interaction they have together. They either need to have Ash start showing anything towards her (which they're not going to do) or drop the ship and Serena's emotional attachment to him entirely (which they're also not going to do until the XY series ends).

a) Reduced occurence of vanilla caves, making them the most common close to bedrock so they dont 'break' the surface too much. Added more lava close to bedrock

b) Added random air pockets (may even use some of the ones you made), some containing mob spawners, most of them wont breach the surface so you can use the 'dummy block method' when constructing them to get air pockets

c) A handful of biomes use custom height control to create a cave specific to the biome

d) Custom cave 'dungeons' similar in concept to the vanilla mineshafts, but made of branching bo3's. These will 'just' be cave systems to begin with, adding underground labyrinths and such later on down the line. The one I have working starts with a surface piece and branches in single chunk pieces to a 'treasure room'

f) Have some of the custom caves spawn from bo3 'mines' on the surface. Some have minecart rides down to the start of the cave system (only one of these working so far)",1451606911

In regards to your earlier edit: she did something wrong, that doesn't mean she's in *the* wrong, it's a pretty common idiom and I assumed you'd understand what I meant, but I'll simplify that particular point: she was harshly wronged, she lightly wronged someone else.

"sales","t5_2qib3","Get the idea of a script out of your head. You'll see scripts in some entry level call centers and shady telemarketing gigs, but it simply isn't going to work for real-world b2b prospecting. People hate when someone calls and just starts reading a scripted pitch, and its a great way to get told to 'fuck off'. Instead of a script, you need a general gameplan and set of goals for each call, and how you execute will depend on who picks up and what they say back. 

The big picture, general idea of a cold call is to identify needs and then explain how your product fills them. You achieve this by asking questions. So, think about the different potential needs that your product can fulfill, and then figure out what questions will get them talking about those needs. Like /u/ryanraad touched on, these should be open ended. Back to this in a minute

Before you even get to this point, you need to figure out who you're talking to. For simplicity's sake, think of whoever picks up as either a gatekeeper or decision maker. If it's the former, then you need to find a way to bypass him/her. Honestly this can be one of the most difficult parts of a cold call, because it's a gatekeeper's job to make sure that you don't bother the boss. Try your best to get him/her to transfer you to the DM, but keep in mind that many times you'll have to settle for just getting the DM's name and email. If this happens, send emails and keep following up with more phone calls until you get the DM on the phone.

Either way, once you manage to get the decision maker on the line, start by introducing yourself and building some rapport. There are a million ways to do this, but it always helps if you can name drop something specific to their business or that they can relate to. This should be easy in your case because it sounds like you're local and working in the same industry. Talk about that.

Next, start asking **open ended** questions. I.e. don't just ask, ""do you need another vendor for wedding cakes?""  Ask them about what cakes sell the most, how much markup they get, do their current folks deliver on time, what happens when things go wrong, do they get good customer reviews on cakes, etc. The idea is to get them to talk about their pain points and what makes them tick. People make buying decisions primarily based on emotion, so try to get them worked up. Then, and only then, do you start talking about these amazing animated cakes that are going to make customers hand over money like Dan Bilzerian at a Hooters. 

If you've done this properly, the sale/conversion is basically a natural conclusion of the call. I.e. ""if I understand you correctly, you're only making a tiny markup on cakes and customers never mention them in your Yelp reviews. If I can increase that percentage to XYZ% and guarantee that your customers rave about how Joe's Wedding Planning has the coolest cakes in town, would you give me a shot?"" Oh yea, one more thing, always get *some* sort of commitment at the end of the call. Ideally you want to get the business on the spot (before their excitement has cooled off). But even if they say no, ask to send them your video and stop by to discuss further, or find out what conditions would lead to a future sale (""I understand if you've already signed with a competitor, but what would it take to earn your business on the next opportunity""). Never leave a call empty handed. 

Of course, this is a very general gloss over cold calling. Sales is an art, and you need to practice/study to get good at things like rapport building, bypassing gatekeepers, generating leads, closing, etc. But, if you take anything away from this post, let it be that a) scripts are worthless b) you can only fulfill needs after you've uncovered them and c) never ever end a sales conversation without asking for their business. 

Also, remember that outbound telesales is a numbers game, and a low percentage one at that. You will get hung up on, lied to, and told to fuck off. A lot. But if you're persistent and keep following up, eventually people will buy. Just smile &amp; dial. 

Happy Hunting!

EDIT: Quick point about your process. Don't make the goal of the cold call to send an email and follow up later; that's setting yourself up for failure. Try to get commitment while you're on the phone because that's when emotions are high and you have the best chances to get a ""yes"". If you can't get commitment on the spot, *then* send your video and follow up as a second resort. Also, don't send a text. You have to appear credible and professional if you want someone to spend money on you. ",1451606919

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; but was there anything actually forbidden about doing it over and over on purpose?

Yes, but people would rarely actually be punished by GMs because they'd be gone before the GMs showed up. I used to be a Guide (volunteer wannabe GM basically, at the time) and once got to observe someone training in High Keep like a total dick. So I had my friend make a new level 1 character on that server and I teleported him to High Keep (if a GM were around I would have lost my Guide account pretty much instantly for that) and bound him there in case he died. Then he was shouting at the trainer, like some NPC calling upon someone in an event. He was trying to /duel the player which annoyed them a bit, but they never came up to where he was to investigate.

So I summoned the trainer to him (again, if a GM were present, I'd be done for that). This prints (at the time) a bright yellow ""You've been summoned!"" message for the player that was summoned. They logged right the fuck out at that point.

1. Why do I visit? Esports, actual game discussion. 
2. Why types of do I want to see? Better discussions of the game, tips on what to do in x situation, lane, etc. (Monday megathread and that beautiful riven combo guide are good examples).
3. What types of content make me want to jump off a cliff? Where do I begin. Riot pls posts are a good example because all they do is clog the subreddit and devolve into memes and shitposts. Another would definitely be balance discussions. Not that I have a problem with differing opinions about balance but rather how hypocritical the sub becomes when x champ is buffed or nerfed and then whining about it. Basically what im saying is: Whining and Riot pls posts are greatly unnecessary and just devolve into drama posts (Im looking at you EU compensation posters). 
4. What would I do if I was running it? Simple, I destroy it....okay being serious. Nothing really but I would say more moderation on what is essentially shit posts and memes for posts and in the comments. due to the fact they contribute nothing at all to the discussion at hand and just clog the subreddit because people want to farm karma.

"duelyst","t5_30w43","Not really, because you know in advance what your enemy will be and can change your deck to have an advantage. It's not as severe as having in-class heals, but you could for example cut big minions so that they can't use onyx bear seal on them and gain tempo, for an example vs songhai.

All factions are almost equally flexible.

Also, you missed the part about people not having all the necessary required cards to play all factions competitively.

Magmar and Vet used to see more play because they were strong, not flexible. Now, we'll have more abyssian, songhai and lyonar.

You argue for placing emphasis on the deckbuilding portion- drafting a deck for each matchup for your chosen faction that has you favored to win is much harder than looking up top tier decks for every faction and just using the three you like better. Bonus for teching cards mid-set to counter your opponent's strategy.

I don't get what you mean by linear strategies. If you mean factions that can be played only one way, then you're mistaken because Abyssian can either be extreme aggro, big aggro which includes the beefy legendaries and burn which includes shadow novas. 

Songhai can be either the one man army version, Spellhai whereby you burn your opponent with mainly spells, and Lantern where you rely on lantern foxes and backstab.

There's no ""linear"" faction or strategy. If you mean linear as in simple, a simple strategy is still a valid one, and discriminating against the lack of complexity is extremely pretentious and unjustified.

Looking at the people who signed up, there are actually not many Magmar players. Most play Vet (probably eager to show off what they're doing with the new 3rd wish), and there's a lot of abyssian and songhai.

Besides, each class here requires a different strategy and mentality. A lot of practice is required to be good with each of them, and most people would rather play the one they know best rather than try to make stuff work for other factions.

Personally, I prefer it this way because you actually get to consider what to put in a deck for a matchup. If we were allowed to bring multiple factions, we'd just copy top lists for each faction and play the one that countered my opponent the best, which does nothing to put more emphasis on counterbuilding. All it will do is add an annoying guessing game before each match whereby you try to predict what your opponent will play, an element of luck that can decide a game (though unfavored matchups are nowhere near 80%).

Also, I hadn't thought of this until this thread, but I think we should assume that Robb would've wanted his bannermen at the Twins to sign the will. At minimum, you have to think he would've wanted Roose to sign it, right? From Robb's perspective, it would be a pretty big insult to Roose to leave him in the dark about something like that.

Either they inspect 100% (in a fool proof way). Of they fool proof during assembly (jigs, etc) , of they confirm CpK&gt; 2.00.

It's a bit more in depth about it, but you're right in essence. If you CpK is high enough you should not need inspection. For safety critical dimensions I will always require a CpK 2.00 (short term 2 PPM/DPMO) For Critical to quality I may ask for 1.67 (short term 233 PPM/DPMO) for non-critical dimensions 1.33 may suffice.

I'm not saying his good actions excuse this mistake, but attacking a person because they've done something against someone else is not okay. 

If a zookeeper accidentally feeds an animal incorrectly but the animal is still okay, the patrons of the zoo don't get all up in arms about it. It's the same here, it's their shit that they work out themselves and in the long run it doesn't affect any of us.

Ever since 2012, there's been the VA directive that you treat trans people respectfully. And After the training following that directive, the treatment related to my trans issues has been great.

There's no need for a trans clinic. If you need therapy, you go to a therapist. If you need HRT (hormones) you go to the endocrinologist. If you want a support group, plenty of VA hospitals have the trans support group. If you want surgery, tough luck, the VA ain't going to pay for that.

The only reason I'd see the point for the trans clinic is if they did the specialty surgeries. But they don't and likely won't because it's not covered.

I don't see why anyone would have a problem going to the VA for trans treatment, especially now that the training for respectful trans treatment has been out for years.",1451606928

This got Ben some attention.  This got some other guys attention.  The guys attached themselves to Ben and convinced him to run for President.  

They raised a lot of money.  They spent a lot of money on raising money.  The top advisers owned outright or an interest in all of the companies used for the direct marketing, money was paid to many LLC's which shared the same address and were created at the same time for work in the campaign.  and LLC headed by Ben Carson and his wife received over 4,000 for ""administration"" and many private LLC's were created and got money.

what i'm saying is Ben Carson is a nice guy that got taken advantage of and was used as a fund raising bait and they siphoned off over 60% of that money and they're done now.    That's really what happened and I think it's sad that they'll probably get away with it.  ",1451606928

The general concept of the game is - and I'll explain this poorly, English is not my first language - that major assets, usually referred to as production nodes/stations/landing zones/bases, will not be player controlled. Not all of them, anyway. Systems will not be player controlled. They aren't planned to be, at least. 

A superweapon would be great to wall off a system by an org. But if that's not possible due to game design, what else is there? Big space battles, those are probably better when the odds are more in balance between the two (or more) sides.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","To make matters clear, the plant operates in a very tightly knit matter. People are allowed to go pray (not only Muslims but any religion across the board) as needed, if there are enough other employees doing the same job to pick up the slack for the time (articles say they're allowed 5 mins, but that's actually pretty laxed) that they are upstairs.(this rule is also applied with restroom breaks, but of course they cannot make you NOT go to the bathroom. Walk offs in those situations are common, and not punished whatsoever. The supervisor of that employee actually gets the punishment in this case.) Previous to this ordeal neither shift was 100% staffed. Albeit, 2nd shift was definitely already understaffed. 

The situation at hand arose because on the Friday before last (Dec 18th) amd continued into Monday  (Dec 21st) when, more employees asked to go pray at their time than was able to be covered by the remainder of the staff (that day they had a lot of call-ins for people being sick, holidays, etc unrelated.). By law, Cargill (any employer) is not obligated to accommodate to anyone's regious beliefs if it is going to affect their operation significantly. In order for all of these people to leave the production line at once would require the speed of processing down, therefore less is processed, and consequently less money to be produced. 

As far as I know, there has been absolutely no change in the accommodation policy, but there has been a decrease in amount of employees and subsequently a decrease for the amount of people who can pick up the slack. And for this quantity of employees to boycott a company based on that fact, and call foul play is completely immature and very ill-mannered. 

While I do agree that it was absolutely acceptable to terminate these employees for walk offs and no call no shows, I do not approve of the people whom are bashing these individuals based on their race and religions. If it were a white, spanish, or any ethnicity I would expect the same reprimand. So take your racist and hateful views and go fuck yourselves with them. 

Source: I am a current employee of Cargill Meat Solutions in the Fabrication area. 

Tl;dr - employees walked off without due cause and are crying foul play to cover their asses in hopes to get their way.

So it also pioneered fusion, fully three years before In a Silent Way came out. 

On the other side of the spectrum, they made country rock a thing, by bringing in Gram Parsons and later Clarence White. Some of this music was straight country. Some of it was [something entirely new](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZV2Cj0LaeY), albeit infused with White's pseudo-pedal steel Tele licks. Clarence invented this style, and he and Gene Parsons, the drummer, invented the Parsons-White string bender to facilitate the style. 

Before all this, they had electrified folk, with loud, insanely pretty versions of [Dylan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyOzGPbn2tg) and Pete Seeger songs. And it was because of their covers that Dylan first used electric instruments in the studio. ",1451606932
"philadelphia","t5_2qh24","You seem to have the impression people are doing this to hurt you... Don't take things so personally; it's not about you. As population consolidates downtown two things occur: 


1) the value of an economically productive enterprise goes up. This tends to reduce the opportunity cost of parking when compared to other potential enterprises pushing investment towards alternatives 

and 

2) Public services and investment trends towards the things being used by actual residents. Therefore higher population densities especially of individuals predisposed to walk or bike in place of driving incentivize the inclusion of bike lanes and the like to the detriment of parking (though much to the benefit of locals).


At the end of the day however, it takes a remarkable degree of narcissism to think your preferences should be privileged over the very people who actually live downtown. There are no shadowy forces trying to drive the bad people with cars away there are simply national demographic and economic trends towards reduced car usage. Unfortunately, this makes life slightly harder for you.

When Kylo and Finn were fighting Kylo had been shot with the bow caster, which we had already seen completely destroy other stuff. Finn was only saved by Rey anyway, it was pretty clear that Kylo was dominating in my opinion.

And with Han, he already knows his son and they never really got into a fight. Kylo used different tactics to beat Han. Or he was showing weakness because it was his Dad.

I see where you're coming from, but I really liked Kylo Ren as a character. He's really raw, unlike Vader who was calm as collected. I'm excited to see how he grows, and I'm glad he didn't end up being a cliché bad guy or another Vader.",1451606932

That is the will of the current Republican majority. They enforce it.

"ClassicalSinger","t5_2vxt3","Hello! First off, I would agree with your support assessment. It seems like the reason you don't have the ability to stay in a higher tessitura is simply support. I can hear a bit of help from the neck in order to reach some of these notes. The support thing will also help the low notes! You'll get a fair amount of power with a more efficient support system.

Really tho, I wouldn't worry about fach at this point. I would focus more your support system and making sure whatever you are singing is as free as and easy(on the throat!) as possible. Focusing so much on the sound is going to cause you to forget about the sensations of singing healthily. As a fellow 24-year-old singer our voices still have quite a few more years to develop and so singing what feels the best is much more beneficial atm. The sound will develop if you let it.

"MechanicalEngineer","t5_2u0xg","Hey, I am a somewhat recent ME.  Been out working for a few years and have already switched industries once.  My first position was working in the defense industry doing quality/reliability work.  It really wasn't my cup of tea so I switched to the automotive industry.  I now do manufacturing/industrial engineering, design work, and some reliability/maintainability work.

Switching industries isn't that hard.  You just have to sell yourself to the company that your skills and past experiences are what they need for that position.  While you can pigeon hole yourself into an industry, keep educating yourself on things and try to attend seminars if possible to keep your engineering skills sharp.  When I was with the defense company, I went to classes and seminars on design and chemical engineering.  The classes and seminars helped me to understand my job better, which in the end also heloped keep my skills up for my current job.  So overall switching isn't that hard.  Just different stress levels.

Now that being said, some are hard to get into.  Like going from my work into doing robotics would be tough since they would expect and engineer with my experience to have electrical and programming experience.  Which I have very little of.  So those are tougher.  But if you think you may go that way, then do some side projects in robotics/electronics.  And document your work or any projects you do as those can be shown in an interview.

As for switching industries and going back to entry level, if you are switching industries and you don't have much experience in the new industry, then you should expect to goto a more entry level position.  If you have some yard under your belt then you can expect to be on the higher end of the entry level salary range, but in the end you may be taking a pay cut.  But focus on what you want when or if you switch industries.  I took a small pay cut for mine (and moved to a different state) but in the end I am actually taking home more per paycheck and enjoying my work more.

Hope that helps.  If you have any questions then let me know and I can tell you what I know.",1451606946

From May to August I lost 18lbs and was sitting at 145. I managed to keep it off until the end of November, ): AKA finals week and thanksgiving week. In the past month I have gained 6lbs. 

This is my last semester before I have to apply for physical therapy school so I am a busy girl! I'm taking more classes than is normally allowed, volunteering with 3 different programs, and will continue to work a job. 

My goal is to not let the stress affect my health. This month I want to commit to eating 1300 calories per day and to work out at least 5 times a week. I know that this goal will be extremely challenging for me. But I am optimistic that I will find the self discipline to do what I need to do! Good luck to everyone with your goals!

"news","t5_2qh3l","I would say I have seen too much animal abuse and neglect by people who supposedly love their animals, to not give the authorities the benefit of the doubt in this instance. In fact, I think I'm quite safe to assume the animal was in dire straights and needed to be removed from a neglectful person. The animal protective services are typically overwhelmed trying to help too many neglected, abused, abandoned and homeless animals. They certainly do not with just randomly for no good reason, go to peoples residences to remove animals from good homes where they are well cared for. 

You may, however be placing too much trust in a man who violently attacked animal rescue workers, who were helping protect an animal from his neglect.  I don't care how traumatized this veteran is, he can't be allowed the privilege of having a service animal if he can't provide an acceptable standard of care for it.

This time, I decided to pave much of the place in foundation blocks to see what it would be like, but I had to leave a spot of ground clear in the middle near the water area because caravans and their pack brahmans wanted to spawn there for some reason, and would clip through the foundations and get stuck if I didn't leave the ground open. But not having to see the original ground in other areas lends a really nice, lore-unfriendly urban look to it (I use the Homemaker mod for the Institute parts as well).

Other than that, I learned on this round not to build my walls all the way up to the edge of the green border, but to leave a space around on most sides, especially to the north where the hill goes up and the large rocks are, because again caravan brahmans get stuck there of all places for some reason if they can't pass between the cliff and the concrete walls.

I'm working on finding the best way to avoid brahman acrobatics/parkour/indoor clipping etc. because I find it really immersion breaking, and hopefully I can post about it in the next couple of days. Caravan spawning and pathing follows it's own rules and you have to kind of build around it, at least until the CK comes out.",1451606951

&gt;One of your FWB starts disrespecting you. She cancels a date twice and is now sleeping with another man consistently. What emotions should run through your head and what do you do next?

* RP Option A) Plate, who cares.
* RP Option B) NEXT
* Me: Wouldn't have entered a FWB to start with.

&gt;During your required Gender Studies conference, the topic of White Male Privilege comes up and the question is asked: ""Does It Exist?"" What is your response?

* RP Option A) WTF are you doing there?
* RP Option B) No
* RP Option C) In some cases it exists, in other cases it does not exist
* Me: WTF am I doing here?

&gt;You have a friend that you have always had a crush on for years. You helped drive her to school for years before you found TRP but you still drop by and help her with handiwork, etc. You are her shoulder to cry on. Does this girl owe you anything? Should she give you the benefit of a date?

* RP Option A) NEXT
* RP Option B) Stop being emotional tampon, lift, distance for dread game/perceived value increase, and escalate
* Me: I have a friend, how nice.

&gt;A girl on Tinder that gave you her number cancels the day-of the coffee date. Her message: ""Hey sorry can't make it! Something came up."" What is your next move?

* RP Option A) NEXT, something something Chad Thundercock?
* RP Option B) Radio silence to dread/perceived value increase and make a new date after they text you first
* Me: ""Ok, let me know when you'd like to reschedule."" If they don't respond, w/e.

&gt;You are an average looking 18-yr old guy, working at an 9-5 average job, making slightly below average pay. You are looking to get a GF or FWB. What should you spend your weekends doing? Should you go out to bars/clubs/ common interest clubs during the weekend?

* RP Option A) Something something monk?
* RP Option B) LIFT AND EARN MORE $
* RP Option C) Yes, and lift.
* Me: Yeah sure why not, might make some friends at least.

&gt;You are at a club and a girl who is very drunk (to the point of almost slurring words), starts dancing with you and is obviously really into you. She asks ""what are you doing after?"" and ""do you live close by?"". What do you do?

* RP Option A) She's going to cry rape. Next
* RP Option B) She's going to steal your sperm, don't trust her! But have sex with her anyway.
* RP Option C) Plate
* Me: ""Hun, I think you're done. I'll call you a cab.""

Mary is the daughter of God, the Mother of Jesus, and the spouse of the Holy Ghost. In failing to recognize her as such, one loses a vital component of understanding who Jesus is. The path God took to reach man was through Mary: Unless you think there's a better way to do things, the best course of action would be to follow his lead back up. One need not be a Protestant and reject veneration of Mary. And yet, strangely, almost every single one of them do. Not even ""reject veneration""--it's worse. They think of her as full of sin and totally unimportant to God's plan. Montfort is saying that this angers God, as it should. 

&gt; Where is that line from the Sacred Scripture/Sacred Tradition? 

Is Jesus God? Yes. Is Mary his mother? Yes. Does the Holy Spirit overshadow her and give her the child Jesus? Yes. 

&gt; Can those who do not regard Mary as their Mother still not be saved?

Oh, sure, neither I nor St Louis would dare limit God's abilities to save. It's not a particularly good idea to reject Mary, though.",1451606961

And yes, food banks throw out expired food.  People seem to forget that the reason ""no one gets sick from eating expired food"" is because most people *throw away expired food*.

It is very reasonable to claim that Hillary has a commanding lead over Bernie in Texas. Remember that polls were easily able to predict the winner of almost every state in the last few presidential elections. 

I also disagree with your application of self-fulfilling prophesy to the democratic primary. While polls can certainly influence results thru perceptions of viability, they do so most when there are multiple significant candidates on the field. You can see this with the republicans where Trump is dominating his unconsolidated opponents but with the democrats there are only 2 candidates with significance and both are projected to do well vs any republicans in the general so there is never really a question of viability.

Everything else in your post is correct. Rule of thumb on whether testimony is hearsay or not: the witness has to directly observe it firsthand or was informed directly from a party involved.

The Russian leaders were opposing leftism, but also trying to hold the party together as well. Levi clearly had broken discipline. The Russian leaders tried to persuade him to fight for readmission, but he went off to build his own party. As I think Lenin put it, ""Levi lost his head, but at least he had a head to lose."" I think the writer is correct about some of the mistakes of the early Comintern under Zinoviev. However he is snarky and horribly condescending, for example his comments on Brandler that he was ""a total mediocrity whose only claim to fame was some trade-union experience and commanding an armed detachment of workers in Saxony during the fitful 1919 uprising."" Probably more of a claim to fame than Proyect will ever have. I think he is also very wrong about the 21 conditions, but that is a subject on its own.

I recommend Pierre Brou´e's, ""The German Revolution"" for details of the issues within the Communist Party and Richard Watt's, ""The Kings Depart"" for an overview of the German Revolution. They are of course not as concise, but they represent a lot more than just the writers opinions largely based on his bad experiences in the US Socialist Workers' Party.

Let's try again and pay attention this time:

It's not a random coincidence Christians developed what you now enjoy as The Scientific Method. 
In fact, to even *begin* supposing there would be any point of studying with some 'method' starts with some idea that an orderly God used some 'method' in Creation. A God who was 'The Word' and who communicated in languages.

You so missed that. So go back and start from the beginning and try and sort it out until you do 'get it'. 

&gt;There's more to accepting scientific fact than just ""being told."" 

You, yourself, only crow about knowing the Earth revolves around the Sun because Christians developed a scientific method and tested and subjected themselves to peer reviews and all these things you inherited from them.

&gt;of why I consider theists to be generally willfully ignorant

If it comes from you and what *you think* then I'd bet on the opposite (or somthing else) being the better explanation. You suck at thinking and for emotional reasons shit-back what you thought sounded like cool 'anti-god' posts you've seen and circlejerked to before.

 **Author**:  _back_of_the_envelope_ 
 
  **Content**:  
 
  &gt;I've been really perplexed by the Bitcoin Core developers' positions lately, specifically wrt to a fork (or hard-fork as they call it.) They seem in stark contrast to my understanding of the system. Today I think I finally understand the issue and would like to point it out in the hopes of alleviating the confusion of others.

&gt;Apparently, the Core developers are operating under a not-often-spoken assumption that Satoshi was in fact wrong (about several things but specifically) about the issue of whether or not CPU power was meant to govern the Bitcoin system.

&gt;I take quotes from the white paper to illustrate why I think that was his intention:


&gt;The proof-of-work also solves the problem of determining representation in majority 
decision making. If the majority were based on one-IP-address-one-vote, it could be 
subverted by anyone able to allocate many IPs. Proof-of-work is essentially one-CPU-
one-vote. The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the 
greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it. 


&gt;and:


&gt;Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as 
proof of what happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, 
expressing their acceptance of valid blocks by working on extending them and 
rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives 
can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.


&gt;This makes sense to me. The point of the system is to eliminate the need for trust. The only trust required is that ""honest nodes collectively control more CPU power than any
cooperating group of attacker nodes."" At least, that's always been my interpretation which I'm willing to concede is flawed if I can be convinced.

&gt;Now how I discovered the aforementioned assumption. These are IRC logs from #bitcoin-wizards today:


&gt;adlai Guest2324: so, consensus in that quote refers to consensus over state, within a 
set of rules. the rules don't change, because you wouldn't know who to trust about 
which changes are good or bad.

&gt;adam3us Guest1234: it is a subtle point but actually it is the economically dependent 
full nodes that enforce consensus rules not miners; miners follow.

&gt;kanzure he was wrong. it turns out it's not about CPU power at all.

&gt;maaku Guest2324: satoshi was clueless about tons of shit


&gt;The above parties (with the possible exception of ""adlai"") were signers of the capacity roadmap  [letter](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/capacity-increases) . Now it makes perfect sense to me. They think Satoshi was wrong about the system so we have a fundamental disagreement. That's why it looks as if I will never be able to reconcile our mutually exclusive positions on the matter.

&gt;Hope this helps others.",1451606971
"islam","t5_2qhbp","The word ""student"" has to be qualified. In the Islamic scholastic tradition, people had teachers and then they had *teachers*. You learn one hadith from someone and they are your teacher. One fiqh scenario and they are your teacher. However, that's different from *teachers*, those whom you sat and studied with for years on end and from whom you had your understanding of religion shaped. Obviously, this is going to be a much smaller number than the teachers you heard one or two hadith from.

Neither Imam Abu Hanifa nor Imam Malik were long term students of Imam Muahmmad al-Baqir or Imam Ja'far as-Sadiq. Imam Abu Hanifa's primary teacher was Hammad ibn Abi Sulaiman. Imam Malik's primary teacher was Nafi mawla ibn 'Umar (among other jurists of Madinah).

Imam Abu Hanifa was a contemporary of Imam Ja'far as Sadiq and narrates hadith from him (although more often from Muhammad ibn Baqir). This was not abnormal, to narrate from peers, or even a teacher narrating a hadith on the authority of his student. Same with Imam Malik, narrating a hadith is not the same as being a true *student* of a scholar.

I'm not aware of Abu Yusuf al-Qadhi and Muhammad ibn Hasan ash-Shaybani, the two prime students of Imam Abu Hanifa, being close with Imam Musa al-Kadhim, but that's hardly an indication of anything. The early Shi'a ""imams"" were not Ithna Ashari in theology (an impossibility considering the doctrine of 12 imams had not yet emerged). As far as cursing the sahabah, subhan'Allah, these imams vehemently condemned such practices. In a mutawaatir narration quoted by Imam Dhahabi in Siyar 'Alam an-Nubala, 

&gt;Amr ibn Qays said: ""I heard Jafar ibn Muhammad saying: Allah disassociate himself from those who disassociate themselves from Abu Bakr and Umar.""

and also

&gt;From Salim ibn Abu Hafs: “I asked Abu Jafar and Jafar about Abu Bakr and Umar (may Allah be pleased with them). And they say: “O Salim, befriend to them, and dissolve from their enemies, indeed they were imams of guidance” And Jafar said to me: “O Salim, Abu Bakr is my grandfather, can a man abuse his own grandfather? And may the intercession of Mohammad not reach me on the day of judgement, if I wouldn’t befriend with them, and wouldn’t dissolve from their enemies”

Vader is pretty well above Padawan Obi Wan,  and arguably above even ROTS  Obi Wan. (George Lucas puts suited Vader at 80% of the Emperor's  power so it depends on how you rank Obi Wan compared to that)

Even in real life this is true, I had some feminist tell me 1 in 4 women are raped, I pointed out why that number was false and provided sources backing my argument, she then screamed rapist at me.

Pull it refers to the operation of trying to save the building being ceased when it got real bad. ""Pull the plug"", it's a very common idiom. Pull the men out. Jesus Christ it's actually making me angry because if you had an actual ounce of real intent to know the truth of this event you would have found this within moments. 

Here's another good article https://sites.google.com/site/wtc7lies/larrysilverstein's%22pullit%22quote

&gt; The setting: Larry Silverstein is being interviewed by a documentary crew from PBS. He calmly, clearly describes what happened. CTs would have us believe that Silverstein accidentally let it slip – twice, for a national TV audience – that he ordered his building to be demolished! Does that make any sense whatsoever? Can the CTs give an example of a similar “accidental confession” of a monumental crime in the history of the world? Keep in mind that if Silverstein thought he had said something wrong, he could simply have asked the crew to shoot that part again. Silverstein is a very smart guy who is in full possession of his mental faculties. He didn’t “slip up.”

. . .

&gt;&gt; ""And they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse.""

&gt; Who made the decision to pull? ""They."" The fire department. Not “Me,” not “We.” They. This is ridiculously obvious to anyone but a CT. Does the FDNY demolish buildings with explosives? No, they pull their people away from buildings that are too dangerous to be near. The “we” in “we watched the building collapse” is Silverstein and his wife. Silverstein was not at the WTC site.

For fucks sake it's simple logic here. Either the entire FDNY, Larry Silverstein, and tens of thousands of government workers were ""in"" on this massive conspiracy to crash planes into a building and then fake their collapse with intricately placed explosives that literally zero people noticed...or the planes crashed and simple explainable physics happened.

I'm done entertaining your delusions though because at this point it only gives them credibility to keep responding. You respond to physics and math and science and observable fact is posting quotes and then taking extreme interpretations of vague statements. You're not fighting for logic or truth, you are doing the exact opposite by ignoring all of established physics in the face of ""analysis"" of vague statements on 14 year old interviews.  

The math is there. WTC7 collapsed under completely understood and reasonable conditions. It's either hundreds of pounds of hidden explosives and a major conspiracy involving thousands of people...or the physics we know actually exist and it just happened as it would under those conditions. I'll side with Newton.

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","Personally think her criticism is overblown. She's no Gil but in the right setup, she's worth her value. With Keripo's NP table out, you can clearly see she does the most damage of all Archers (even without the anti-male multiplier) so to make use of that, she'd be best in an Arts team (plus she can Arts Brave Chain).

I've used mine with Tamamo's Fox Wedding and wreaked havoc on enemies, male or female. Her Quick cards have better NP gain than her Arts (just like Okita and many other Servants) so in an Arts team, she should be fine. Or just slap Hollow Magic/Kaleidoscope on her. Relatively high crit weight as an Archer so with an Assassin, she can crit for days (overcoming Archer multiplier and also improving NP gain).

Her first skill is great and doesn't get enough credit. The 2nd is situational but it seems like more and more males are being released. And the 3rd is the exact same Skill that Okita has but nobody's complaining over there.

I wish the circlejerk around hating her would just end already.

Nobu has a more situational 2nd Skill (pretty sure there are more males than Divine enemies) but the first addresses her relatively meh NP gain. The 3rd is great in a crit team. Plus she most likely has NP5. If you're running a crit team or farming, Nobu is better. But in an Arts team or boss battle, Orion is the choice.",1451606976

It must be excruciating for parents to see their young sons become so evil. 

I know that Star Wars (thankfully) exists at a remove from current events and goes for a more timeless feel to its myth-making, but I do see a way that Ren's character is a kind of comment on the particular kind of evil that is the most feared in today's world. ",1451606977
"politics","t5_2cneq","Call me crazy, because it's just an idea in my head based on assumptions I see in the world not trying to be an authority figure on the subject matter, but I think Americans wouldn't hesitate to elect a socialist president if they stood up for them (my city council has a socialist member who ran on a hard socialist party platform). That being said, Bernie isn't even a socialist, he's advocating for democracy, and of course some people aren't going to care about the difference, but I think those are the kinds of voters he wouldn't have gotten if he ran around trying to call himself Donald Trump Jr. It's a longer shot than most people are willing to take, but I think the election in Canada sent a strong message to candidates about what people should expect to get elected on, while I understand America /= Canada our politics share more in common than differences.

&gt;The best VP candidates are ones that balance out the flaws at the top of the ticket

Historically, at least in the most recent, the VP position has been used to attempt to get states the president would have a harder time getting without them. Obama and Biden I think represent that almost perfectly.

&gt;Plus, effectively speaking, Sanders will be as fully throated as anyone in endorsing a Clinton candidacy, and doesn't bring much added value beyond that as the VP anyway.

This is legit. In terms of states both senators are heavy east coast, which leaves out much of middle America. I still think the ticket would be a strong one though. Clinton's name recognition, Sander's supporters enthusiasm, that's the kind of winning combination I see. However looking at it more closely you have a good point, I think at the very least you've convinced me it wouldn't be the super slam dunk I thought when writing that first comment, still possible, especially depending on who the GOP would nominate.",1451606977

The problem is that when you drink, inhibitions and logic go out the window. A person may be fully aware of the punishments, the legality, the morality of it, but their brain says ""nah bro, you got this. Just take it slow and everything will be alright"". This is why the briefings don't work, they're not saying anything new, and everything gets ignored after a few shots. It honestly needs to be a cultural change. The airmen out drinking together need to be the ones to tell the other airman he's not going anywhere. At my first duty station, I think we had 2 DUI's in 3.5 years, and they were a big deal. We were maintainers, we all drank, and we all drank underage. But we took care of each other, and we were proud of our collective responsibility. I participated in a street brawl to stop a drunk and belligerent coworker from driving home. Another coworkers finger got broken on the drunk coworkers chin with a mighty right hook. I ended up driving the drunk coworker home, and that was the end of it. On Monday we were all still friends, nobody got in trouble, and nobody had to get arrested.

While the title of that article makes the bold claim that the 2012 GAAP deficit was $6.6 trillion it falls apart once you read the article.


In the second paragraph the author outlines the truth...


1. The 2012 deficit using cash accounting was $1.1 trillion.
2. The 2012 deficit using GAAP accounting was $1.3 trillion.
3. The net present value of future Social Security, Medicare, etc. liabilities is $5.3 trillion.


The NPV of future liabilities for social programs is not part of the current deficit. And the author knows this because the table later in the article changes the heading to ""GAAP With SS, Etc."" to denote the fact that a future liability that is not part of current expenses was added into the actual GAAP deficit value.

Luckily, Richie is already 6 pounds (bigger than his mommy - I was 5lb, 14oz), so he isn't small, just not growing as quickly as they'd like. Everything is fine - I think that they just don't want to wait at that point if he isn't growing right anymore.

I've had two cases of BH although I think it was from dehydration, but have had no other signs. No plug loss, etc.

All DDR3 will run at 1333mhz by default as a precaution, even if you buy higher speed RAM like 1866 etc. To fix this, go in to your BIOS and find your memory settings and enable ""XMP"", this will enable your RAM to run at the advertised speeds by default",1451606987

The atmosphere and world is pitch perfect.

The trial and error of using different strategies on an area or boss is fantastic. I remember trying so many ways of fighting Gascoigne. I tried my using the tombstones to slow him down which failed when he became the beast. I had to perfect parrying and dodging to win. I learned his movements and timing. I figured out when I could heal and when I should risk it. When I killed him. Perfect.

However, slogging through the same fucking enemies to get to him was boring. I mastered my path to Gascoigne way before I mastered him. There was no new enemies. Nothing new to learn. Just monotonous fucking repetition. The very heart of what makes the game exciting stripped away as it became a chore to get back to my fight with this fantastic boss.

I realize that many feel that this is ""punishment,"" but it isnt. It betrays the very greatness of what this game offers.

or stick 150 on cad n fling the 80 off randomly n keep atlas on 20 lol n just go a wall on same progressive build I'm on?

Must be enrolled full time for the duration of the semester to receive full bah. Ex. My school is 12 hours full time, 16 week semester. Must be in 12 hours the full 16 weeks. If a class doesn't run the full time and you drop below full time, you'll get partial bah. All online classes give you half the nation wide bah average, $768 or so.

Book payment is $1000 for the YEAR. $41.67/ credit hour enrolled. So 12 hours is $500 for the one semester. Your other semester will max out at $500 to hit that $1000 cap.",1451606994

Switch to map view when you start your burn so you can see when you've managed to get an encounter and stop firing the engine.

As far as returning, it's a little difficult to explain without visual aids.. but..

You want to be orbiting the moon on roughly the same plane as it orbits kerbin. You want to fire your engines prograde when your ship is in between the earth an the Mun, while you are travelling opposite the direction the Mun orbits Kerbin. It's a little confusing but what you are doing is firing prograde relative to your Mun orbit, but at the same time you are firing retrograde relative to your orbit around Kerbin. It's the most fuel efficient way to return from Mun orbit.

&amp;nbsp;

Kirito excels at figuring out of things work in a mechanical/technical sense, it's why he's so good with tech and games in general; he understands how all the underlying mechanics and such function. 

This is is top level function, if you will, and it is an introverted one. This is a trait (and overall type) commonly seen in Mechanics and Engineers, people who create, disassemble, and improve physical, technical items and devices.

&amp;nbsp;

He's also a very sensory, physical-driven person, acting through and relying on his five senses as his primary way of interacting with the outside world (extroverted trait). His combat skills are a direct product of his innate understanding of *how* to do stuff (first function) combined with his physical ability to excel at it.

This is also the reason he loves adventures and quests, as well as simple, sensory pleasures like good food and a nap in the sun, and is why he learns best by doing, first hand. This is the same sort of function that most sports-y types use very heavily.

&amp;nbsp;

His lower trait is one that focuses on other people. Being a lower function he's not as good with it and it's often something he feels very uncomfortable using and dealing with, making him actively reject being around other people. This is also the trait that makes people strongly emotionally attached to others, usually in a very deep, fundamental way; one could often call it love, even if it's not romantic.

Most people are bad/negatively involved with these lowest functions until they get a little older than he is, or something important/traumatic happens (good or bad trauma, if that makes sense). For Kirito, he was only his old self, actively pushing people away and refusing to get attached to anyone, for all of two episodes (with Klein and Asuna). He finally found it in him to give in and truly care about someone, maybe he couldn't help it, maybe it was partly due to really needing people and being lonely at this point.

We know how that turned out. Despite causing a complete reversal of his progress here for six months or so, Sachi's message ultimately let him forgive himself and was a sort of ""positive trauma"", pushing him back into being able to use it again, and that's exactly what we see multiple times in Silica's episode, and from there all the way through the rest of the series.

That said, he's still not great at *using* it, even it he's in a positive place, thus the subtle awkwardness and some less-than-social tendencies. He cares more than he's able to properly articulate, aside from through his actions, actions being something he's very good at.

&amp;nbsp;

Sorry, this sort of went of a bit of a tangent, but I just can't stop when I get started on these sorts of posts. xD

Here's [another (and shorter) Kirito-specific analysis](http://funkymbtifiction.tumblr.com/post/99495634070/sword-art-online-kirigaya-kazuto-kirito-istp), and here's a [general one about the type](http://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality).

Of note, Sinon is very likely also this type, and Yuuki is the extroverted version of the same.",1451607000

"anime","t5_2qh22","Gundam SEED Destiny. It has a score of 7.39 in MAL and I give it a 3.    
Gundam SEED Destiny is probably the worst Gundam anime so far, it has a lot of potential to be on par with UC timeline that is sadly wasted all thanks to Mitsuo Fukuda and his wife, they damaged the reputation of Gundam franchise that the Tomino has gained over the past two decades.    
Good things of Gundam SEED Destiny:    
1. Amazing Soundtrack. They TM Revolution, High and Mighty Colors and numerous others to perform the soundtrack.    
Bad things of Gundam SEED Destiny:     
1. Plotholes eveywhere. How did Mu La Flaga survived at the end of SEED? Mitsuo Fukuda never explains. o.0    
2. [Kira Yamato cheating death the third time](/s ""sitting on top of Nuclear Explosion and coming out alive"")    
3. Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne being Gary-Stu/Mary-Sue to the point when people call them Kira ""Jesus"" Yamato and Virgin Mary 2.0.    
4. Bad mobile suit designs. Completely no originality and nonsensical technology. Freedom is obviously referenced from Double X, regarding wings. Strike Freedom referenced from Hi-Nu, self explanatory, and referenced from Victory2, beam shield. Akatsuki referenced from Hyaku Shiki, for the Destiny gundam, a gundam fan, who also mentioned the nonsensical technology, did a full rant on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lD5OJd6i1uM    
5. Too many flashbacks and recycled animations. These killed it pacing, they even tried to insult our intelligence by using scenes from SEED. I have already lost count the number of times the scene Shinn Asuka's sister's death.    
6. Breaks the rules of Story-Telling when they change the protagonist in episode 39.     
In overall, Gundam SEED Destiny is a Gundam series with a lot of potential sadly wasted due to its poor production staff. Looking at Gundam SEED Stargazer, this is the type of people who knew all Cosmic Era has a lot of potential and makes full use of it.",1451607002

"flying","t5_2qm1t","OP, it is super natural to get discouraged. I'm going to share my experience of flying today, and maybe it will give you some perspective. So, I'm going through one of the career programs that takes you all the way from PPL to CFII. I want to fly for a living. I want an ATP, and flying is still fun.

Today, however, it wasn't. Today I did my first day of intensive landing trainings. My landings have never been very good, but my pattern work and my general proficiency still made me feel like I was heading in the right direction. I had done 50 or so landings before today, and I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to flare the damn plane. Well, today- just today, I did 38 landings across two separate flights. And it was one of the hardest, most discouraging things I think I have ever gone through. 

Every time I would nail one aspect of flying down, another part would come unglued. Once I got my approach pattern laid out, my Mike-model Cessna would balloon halfway down the goddamn runway. If I had a good flare, it meant that I had just been 'talked to' for a sloppy, wide, right base turn. Once I fixed my approaches again, and I thought I had the flare, I ballooned it and let out too much elevator back-pressure and landed hard enough that my teeth felt it. So then he showed me a great technique to help me figure out the backpressure I would need to let the plane settle correctly. But once I did that, I started coming in to fast, and having to spill speed off before I could land.

It was a bad day. But you know what? I had to go through it. When I was done, I didn't even want to look my instructor in the eye. I was ashamed. I've been putting everything into this program, and I felt like I had failed him. I wanted to punch something, I wanted to unleash a feral roar, just something to vent all the frustrations I felt at my own shortcomings as a developing pilot. So when we were done, my instructor looks at me and asks, ""How do you feel about the flight?""

""Discouraged."" I said, ""I just can't put it all together.""

He kinda looked at me sideways and goes, ""Jaegerbombed, you're doing fine. I couldn't put it all together right away, either. It comes at different speeds for different people. You're better than I was when I was at 20 hours. Just keep working hard, it will come""

Like other people have said, don't be too hard on yourself. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm putting a lot of pressure on myself, because I want to succeed so badly. I need to remind myself that sometimes, that pressure is too much, and just to learn from every mistake that I make. I would echo everyone else here and take a flight for fun. 

Remind yourself of this- If hundreds of thousands of pilots fly every day, why can't I do it? I promise you, OP, you can. Remember why you wanted to learn how to fly. Think about the positives of a solo flight! Do you like Roadtrips? Think about a road trip at 5,000 feet! But now, there are no speed limit signs (kinda)! All I'm saying, OP, in this long and rambling note, is don't give up on yourself. Flying is great, and I think you may be too focused on the 'what if' nightmares, and not thinking enough about the great things you still may get to experience. Either way, I want you to know, you're not the only student on here that had a bad day, and that you're not alone, Flight-bro.

NVE was a point guard with MAD HANDLES who initiated offense and ball hogged quite a bit. He would get run at the 2 off the bench to provide instaoffense, similar in nature if not style to Jamal Crawford. He would launch a shot from anywhere. Pretty short dude, but he had some nice hops. Nick the Quick relied on his terrific ability to change direction on a dime (as you saw in all those inventive spin moves); Bill Simmons likes to say that Allen Iverson would've been the greatest tennis player ever, and Nick had the same crazy ligaments and tendons in his knees that would have made him a demon on the clay. He was a lazy defender, staying high on the key so he could run the fast break. And he would launch a shot from *anywhere.* 

Lance is a two way G/F athalete who butters his bread as a defender. He likes to gamble for strips or get in passing lanes to initiate fast breaks, where he is a clever and inventive passer. This is the similarity people are finding between the two players, because highlights do tend to rely heavily on fast break dunks and passes.

**EDIT** That guy who said he reminds him of Isaiah Thomas was probably the most accurate of the comparisons I read in this thread, but Van Exel was *way* more fun to watch. So if you're trying to picture Van Exel, think of Isaiah if he had a Top Ten moment at least a few times a week.",1451607004

The Epilogue adds a decent amount to the story and the extra dungeon has pretty unique conditions: you lose all your items and have to use the ones you find, and after every battle your sp is cut in half. It also has one of my favorite [Dungeon themes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-Zv1qS7UhU) (my other favoite being [Nanako](/spoiler)'s [Dungeon theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-7vsdh6dUk)). Golden's [Intro song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7H5pYCw4ET4) is pretty good too.

If you want more Persona P3:FES is on PSN right now. I only have a few complaints about P3:

1. You can't control party members unless you get P3P (the PSP version)

2. Most of the non-party Social Links aren't as strong

Other than that I honestly think 3 has a better story (though the characters in 4 are better). The [P3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzHpCOPsVbo):[FES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Htk5_0pgFo) [Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiP9Bhha0-4) is really good aswell.

TFA is the *seventh* installment in a huge series that everyone's familiar with. ANH created an entire universe, which is much more difficult than simply pleasing fans who just want something better than the prequels.

In addition to that, I feel like ANH has more weight to it and is much better paced than TFA. TFA is like a sprint, whereas ANH is a wonderful ride that only feels slow when C3-PO and R2-D2 land in the desert and encounter the Jawas.

The dialogue of ANH just feels more epic space-opera-y to me, in addition, while TFA feels more like a wise-cracking Marvel movie. Lines like *""I felt a great disturbance in the Force. Like millions of voices cried out in terror and were silenced.""*; *""Look at the size of that thing.""*; *""If you strike me down, I shall become more powerful than you could ever imagine.""*; etc. simply feel more iconic and powerful than TFA's lines, which were mostly just fun.",1451607008

"TalesFromThePizzaGuy","t5_2uh13","We don't ever go up into locked, secured buildings where I work. There are several reasons for this:
1. Leaving car running downstairs on the street is dangerous.
2. It takes at least four or five minutes each time, which means each other order in my car is cooling so you dont have to put pants on. Often several consecutive orders are to this type of building, leading to a serious delay. Time is money.
3. We have had people get into shady, robbery type situations by going up in these buildings, and also just severely intoxicated customers.
4. This isnt an official reason, but the people who are too stubborn or lazy to come to their own building entrance are usually lousy customers anyway.

If your building isnt locked or secured, we will come up. Please ALWAYS pick up your phone when you have a pending delivery. A lot of little things can go wrong on our end. Communication is good.

It's my face in particular that causes dysphoria, the body hair and the penis.  Sometimes I regret my butt and hips being so small . I think in public I regret not being treated feminin enough.  I wouldn't want to be treated completely as a female but in the middle of the spectrum.  

As far as breast I would be comfortable with A's or AA's.

The dysphoria causes anxiety and plays a big role in my life.  

I am comfortable expressing my identity by wearing unisex clothing , make up , heels ,... but I will not stay young forever . Eventually testosterone will overpower everything . That's the main source of my anxiety . 

In my behaviour I'm sometimes girly girl and butch on other days . Not totally male ever. 

The dysphoria is the biggest obstruction in building up romantic relationships . 

If not having a female butt  and hips counts as secondary characteristics then I experience 6 out of 6 of the mentioned criteria.

I have an appointment with a therapist in 3 days but I don't know if I should tell them that I'm genderqueer or pretend to be male2female.  I don't know how I would  react if they reject me for medical treatment.  ",1451607015

I actually bought the EGT mod from them for a similar reason too.  Since the viper is hardly available, it was nice that they had it included.

The only thing about the mod is that it doesnt use the real name of the car.  This is to prevent URD from being sued since they cant sell a ""dodge viper"" or ""chevrolet corvette"" since those names are trademarked.

There are however, some real world liveries at [race dept.](http://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/categories/ac-skins.7/) that you can search for, so you will have a more 'real' experience.  As well as that, I know there is a mod out there that also replaces all of the fake names and brand logos with their real life counterparts.  So instead of having a ""Darche"" or ""Venom"" in AC, it will properly show up as Porsche or Viper.  I dont recall if that can be found at RD or if that is found on the AC forums...  if I recall, Ill link it too.

To ELI5:

The battle happened relatively early in WWII.


Germany was winning and starting to invade France. The British had sent some of their troops to help, but the German military just blitzkrieged though the Netherlands and into France.

Many allied troops were cut of from the rest of France and ended up retreating to Dunkirk. 

They ended up with their back to ocean and surrounded on all other sides by the Germans.

Before they could all be killed or taken prisoner though, the British organized an evacuation over the channel.

They had to leave behind their equipment but many soldiers ended up being saved by a large number of ships both military and private that ferried them across the channel to safety.

It was by all accounts a defeat for the allies, but a was also turned into a huge propaganda victory. The participation of so many small private ships that helped during the evacuation was played up in the papers and used to motivated the people at home.",1451607018

"politics","t5_2cneq","Unfortunately, the simple reality is that we're well past the point when embracing renewable energy---even sweeping, overwhelming, global change---would have enough impact on the climate catastrophe to justify the attention and effort such reforms would require. 

As much as I love Sanders, and as much as I appreciate political realities he faces, ""doubling the number of clean energy jobs by 2030""...is utterly meaningless.  It's even worse than meaningless, because it spends resources and political capital to suggest that these kinds of measures are actually going to help, soothing concerns that more drastic measures aren't necessary---when, in fact, they very, very much *are*. 

Because the climate catastrophe we face *really is that bad.*  I'm comfortable coming across as Chicken Little when the whole scientific community is yelling ""the sky is falling"" right along with me.  Sea levels are already projected to increase by ten feet---TEN feet.  And that's *locked in*.  So what's the projection going to be by 2030, when we're supposed to be excited about doubling the number of people working on solar panels and wind farms? Everything from Paris to this is like bailing water out of the Titanic with a soup ladle... after pausing to make some soup first... *after* making sure no one dislikes lentils, of course, because to do otherwise would be undiplomatic.  But hey, this ship is unsinkable, right?

Renewable energy will not make an appreciable dent in the climate crisis.  Period.  It's just to late for that.  Until we stop pretending these glacially slow, economically- and politically-gentle half-measures are ""bold steps"", we're deluding ourselves out of our garden planet---and we'll deserve every bit of the contempt our future selves will have for our shortsighted apathy, willful blindness, and criminal inaction.

True. And it is completely semantics. I'm saying the wording is not helpful to the dialogue. It should suffice for both sides to agree that there was a break, and one side is correct, one is not.

Upon looking into it, I would say we were both off, actually. It seems he's talking about the East-West traditions. He was emphasizing the need in the West to cherish Eastern thought and spirituality, which is certainly distinct from the thought and spirituality of the West. He wasn't calling the Eastern Orthodox Church a lung. I sincerely would want to be corrected if I am wrong, but I couldn't find anything to suggest PJII meant it in that way.",1451607023

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","I can't speak to the first thing you mentioned, but I can say that buildings built in the usa are built to some version of iecc, and are required to meet or exceed an energy efficiency benchmark. Codes can be slow to catch up to current technology, but that is because new technologies need to be proven before they can be safely codified. Furthermore, most codes are based on standards from independent professional organizations like the aia, ashrae, etc, so they are written by experts in the field, not bureaucrats. Regarding privatization of building inspections, I think it's a terrible idea. There was a great scene in the big short that frames the conflict of interest perfectly. Basically the ratings agencies had an incentive to give good ratings to prevent clients from going to their competition. While I appreciate a lot of libertarian arguments, it is not an answer for all situations and certainly not this one. If 3rd party inspectors charged fees and were competitive, then they would have the same incentive as the rating agencies on wall st, with much higher stakes including loss of human life. Imagine a cheap developer who has no vested interest in the building being built safely or efficiently shopping around for the most lax inspector he can find. This has to be a government thing in the same way police do. ",1451607024
"reddevils","t5_2rxse","Yes. If he had retired in 2014, he would've been called one of the best ever. But with him coming to united(who are hated by almost 90% of football fans) and not doing really well, that will be the thing which will make him get less praise. Let's get real, he won a cl and league without losing a single game with a squad whose average age was 24, and came the closest to defending the cl. He has not restructured shit at barca, but with that shambolic board and the cancerous players they had, he was an important step in the right direction. Then in the early-mid 2000's he sucked, but again he was quite successful at Bayern for clearing out the deadwood and the senior players who were trying to undermine him. But football caught up to him and he changed in the 2014 World Cup to a 3-5-2 which he used brilliantly to take that squad to third place. Yes you could say robben was in incredible form, but so are Ronaldo and messi and muller. You can't undermine his achievements to fit your own personal agenda.

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","That's exactly what happened. TNN was like $45+ due to Legacy demand and it was near impossible to find Mind Seize. LGSs were selling Mind Seize for $60 and the others for MSRP or a little less just so they could try moving them at the same rate. They were only able to order the C13 decks as sets of all 5 decks. So, what usually happened was Mind Seize sold for more than MSRP and the other 4 sat on the shelf and no store wanted to order 5 more decks just to add 4 to the shelf. Walmart/Target could usually had their shelves full of the other 4, but you could find a Mind Seize if you were lucky and got there while they were restocking.

It wasn't really resolved until the 2nd round of printing when WOTC allowed stores to buy them in sets of 5 with 2 Mind Seize and 3 of the other 4 decks, which they could do because they printed extra Mind Seize.

That situation is why you'll never see high value reprints in Commander decks. The most you'll see is what happened this year, with each deck more or less having a reprint of a roughly $10 card.

The same thing would happen if they printed &lt;insert T1 Modern deck here&gt;'s new favorite card in one commander deck.",1451607027

Honestly if you believe the Quran was altered there is no reason to be Muslim, because Islam just become another distorted religion like the rest.  I would leave Islam if I was born Shia just because of this!  Shia scholars use hadith that are complete forgeries, and this is regarded as fact by secular scholars of Islamic history, so Imam Ash-Shafi'i's claim is correct.

For the two hours between 10:00 and 11:59 (UTC) each day, in summer three different days are observed at the same time in different places. For example, at UTC time Thursday 10:15, it is Wednesday 23:15 in American Samoa, (UTC-11), and Friday 00:15 in Kiritimati (UTC+14). For the first hour (UTC 10:00–10:59), this is true for both inhabited and uninhabited territories, but during the second hour (UTC 11:00–11:59) it is only true in an uninhabited maritime time zone twelve hours behind UTC (UTC-12).

"svenskpolitik","t5_2twun","Rant inlägg gott nytt år och skål..

ETC som vanligt subpar nivå när det gäller journalistiken, inte undra på att dem lagt så mycket krut på att verkligen maximera presstödet ifrån staten. Ren stöld ifrån folket om man frågar mig.

Löfven släppte solidariteten långt innan det, då snackar vi om den egna befolkningsgruppen som lever i Sverige vare sig den är vit eller brun. Det är tragiskt jag måste använda yttre irrelevanta attributer i detta stycke, men folk är tyvärr dumma i huvudet och tror att hudfärg och det man har innan för huvudet är relevant. (LO, SVT mfl JA jag menar er)

Men man valde att köra på med Reinfeldts internationella solidaritet istället, där vi ska vara någon sorts världsföredöme när det kommer till humanitära flyktingmottaganden i siffror. 
Rödgröna fattar inte att alliansen brydde sig mindre om att hjälpa dem som har det svårt, utan snarare mer intresserade att skapa flyktingtryck mot redan svaga EU-gränser. 
Nu har människor med löften om guld och gröna skogar slängt sina besparingar i sjön, sålt sina marker för betala giriga flyktingsmugglare som ser tillfälle att fylla båtar som är direkt livsfarliga för snabba cash.
Nu har vi  hundratusentals flyktingar och immigranter i EU som behöver arbete, då hamnar man i en situation man får antingen använda skattemedel eller lönedumpningar för att sätta dessa i arbete. 
Vilka vinner på det? Företagen och kapitalister så klart. Men det kommer ta tid så klart.. Vem gynnar det? Så klart kapitalisterna som blir överösta med skattepengar för ta hand om flyktingarna och migranterna.

Vilka blir drabbade?
När dem rika slinker undan så beskattar man pöbeln eller lånar (återigen gynnar kapitalisterna).. för de med pengar vet och har insikt hur man skatteplanerar... sen kan man alltid låtsas vara solidarisk men ändå skatteplanera... påkommen?? äsch bara skylla på sin revisor.. svenska journalistkåren höjjer inte ens ögonbrynet..

Dra in biståndet till de fattiga i närområderna som har det jävligt dåligt idag.. alla dessa vi tyvärr omöjligt kan ta hand om i Sverige, om man inte lever i någon ideologisk fantasivärld där vi kan ta hand om alla miljarder som har det sämre än i vårt långa land..

Varför inte bidra till att bygga en bättre värld ute i världen istället för att föra en politik som gör det sämre för det som redan har det dåligt och bara gynna dem som har råd med frikostiga lösningar som hjälper få medans det överöser andra med rikedomar.

Jag snacka om precis detta scenario över ett år sen på både fackmöten samt internt och må våran arbetarrörelse gå under p g a egen inkompetens och arrogans. Istället för tänka själva kör man på moderpartiets association politik. åh SD tycker SD säger SD gör SD kan inte tycka som SD rasister SD.. jävla besatthet.

De agerar på alla vis som gynnar kapitalisterna och lukrativa företag. Tro sig kunna få någon sorts humanist titel i samma veva..

Men lova en jävla massa till folk i nöd, helt verklighetsfrånvarande och slösa på folkets pengar på detta vis.

Vänsterrörelsen+arbetarrörelsen hur fan kan ni inte tänka längre??

The vast majority of people I know who could benefit from your project, (in the brain injury, Ataxia and mental health communities,) are living off disability  or pension and would never be able to consider a trip like this.

"summonerswar","t5_324pd","First of all, I appreciate your time and effort for creating a guide. I don't quite agree with some of the points you made, and this is a good opportunity for discussion. I feel like you have some good observations but came to the wrong conclusion; or rather, your conclusion is framed incorrectly. Let me explain.

I been running R5 consistently with some of globals best raiders. We have around 90-95% success rate depending on some RNG. I've raided with the leader of shadovar, leader of Kindred Saints, Berk, scatfetis, and many others. I mention them so the readers are aware of the calibre of allies I raid with and hopefully add some credentials to what I'm saying.


1. The key to beating R5 is not to avoid ATB boosters, but rather, to ensure you have all of the key elements for success. And it is true that some ATB boosters, such as Verde, is not the optimal choice. But this is not because he is an ATB booster, it is because he simply lack the other success factors.
The optimal team requires all your units to contribute to the raid in some way: tanking, damage mitigation, debuffs, heals, and dps. 
Each unit in your group must provide some combination of these success factors. Any unit that does not provide them is a poor choice. In that sense, Verde is not great, but Orion, Bella and Bernard are perfectly viable as they each provide multiple success factors.
So, in my opinion, this is the correct conclusion: **any turn taken that accomplishes none of the success factors I listed above is a wasted turn, but any turn taken that accomplishes those things is good**. This is why Bella's ATB boost is fine, because it acts as a heal. This is also why Bernard's ATB is good, because it also provides speed buff. And Orion's ATB boost is great because it applies 2 important debuffs. 

2. The argument that taking extra turns is bad (hence ATB boosting is bad) falls short when you suggest that speed leaders are good. My conclusion though, supports why speed leaders are good. As long as your teams are build properly, every extra turn taken accomplishes something important, and will improve your success rate.

3. In my opinion, there are two primary reasons for wipe in R5. 
One is having all your healers stunned right before/after the 25% boss jump. Second is failing to land atk/heal debuffs on the boss after the 25% jump. Both of these risks are mitigated by having a very fast team on violent (and yes that includes having ATBs). I think avoiding the use of ATB boosters is not the right solution. 
So once again, taking fewer turns is not the right approach. The correct approach is to take fewer ""wasted turns"". In that sense you are right, that debuff application is wasted if there is already one on the boss. But I think that is a risk I am willing to take if it means higher chance to apply that debuff right after the 25% jump. 


Anyway, I am not here to criticize you. I appreciate your post as it helps facilitate discussion. Many of your points are totally valid, I just would personally frame them in a different way. Thanks for reading and I am open to your feedback!

Happy new years :)

"news","t5_2qh3l","Well the FFL isn't going to/can't file a NICS check unless they are actually processing a transaction, either between themselves and a customer or between 2 parties who are in person with the firearm to transfer in states where this is required by law. If you actually wanted to use an FFL's NICS check in this way you would first have to go to a state that has outlawed private transfers, then find an FFL actually willing to perform said transfer. 

So while technically you could do this it's much too expensive to be cost effective in my opinion, though I'm not an employer or landlord. In California my LGS has a minimum fee of $55 for these transactions, California DOJ Charges $25 for DROS fees, the NICS check costs $25, and both indivuiduals now have to have a California Firearms Safety Certificate (FSC) which costs another $25 for both parties (good for 3 years IIRC). My local FFL also charges a storage fee of $20 while your firearm sits in limbo during these transfers between individuals.

 Some FFLs charge less for their fees, some charge more but the state and federal fees are fixed, and some won't facilitate the transaction at all. And you can't force FFLs to perform these transactions either, as the FFLs hold complete authority over who they do business with, something I think is a good idea but often in states with authoritarian feel good laws it places massive burdens on the individuals, which if you ask me is the whole point.


So giving everyone access to the NICS system would creating a new privacy problem in my opinion.",1451607046

Responsibility is owing up to your decisions good or bad. Young people are going to make mistakes more than adults due to lack of experience depending on how well they adapt but that doesn't mean that they're any less capable of making decisions for themselves and sticking to them or for that matter as worse at making decisions as some adults might be as that is a factor that often depends on the individual rather than age.

Also, insulting people has nothing to do with responsibility whatsoever. I think you need to go and get a dictionary, I'll also insult anyone I damn well please, especially if they're being blatantly stupid.

As for removing agency, the reason I think that you were trying to claim that is because you were assuming as most adults do that age/maturity means that 'maturity' ( which, you seem to be using the word wrongly again as with responsibility ) wise they are not going to be good enough at making decisions as somebody in their 40's even though there are plenty of adults out there that make worse decisions than teenagers or even children out there ever will which indicates you seem to think people under 18 are incapable of making decisions for themselves.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt;Data is needed to make the claim that there are things that must exist. Is it true that the universe has to exist at all? 

I fear you're getting confused about my argument- no doubt it's my own fault.

The argument runs that the Universe is contingent. That is, it is possible for it to not-exist. A contingent phenomenon needs a cause/grounding.

As such, even an infinite causal chain of contingent phenomena needs a grounding that cannot itself be contingent- otherwise it would simply be part of the contingent chain. 

If said grounding is not contingent, it must be Necessary- it's non-existence is logically impossible. the name we give that Necessary Ground of All Being is God.

That's how the argument runs. It is one that doesn't require evidence (beyond the self-evidence that the Universe exists).

It is, I would acknowledge, a rather abstract affair.

&gt;I don't think it's cheeky, at all. I think it's a part of logic you're unfamiliar with.

Well, it's true that it's been a while since I've encountered the terms *validity* and *soundness* used quite as you use them. It suggests to me that you're approaching the subject from an education in mathematics- or some similar subject- which naturally slants your approach to logic.

I come at philosophy from the background of a theologian- which also slants my approach to logic.

Instead he created a cinematic theme park complete with unnecessary extras and merchandising.

But that's weird tho, at level 25 you should have killed the Warden already.


- If you feel like it is too easy, you could try going for the Veteran mod, which brings more challenge to your adventure (depending on how good your build is).

- Concerning the ""social"" part, sadly no. You'll have to visit either the official forum (which is really active !) or the reddit or your steam interface to socialize with people.

- You should quickly feel the need to increase the number of skills you use, as the difficulty level will raise (always played Veteran, so i can't say for normal), once you feel that, you should get hyped into progressing, getting new skills, new gears etc..

So, here's the deal. You don't feel, as a wife, that you are being given enough time. That sucks, and I'm sorry - as a wife, I understand that. As an academic advisor for med students, I also understand that your husband is expected to learn massive amounts of info. What I would suggest is that he makes a solid schedule, and look at it (perhaps with his own advisor) to see if he is studying effectively, and where he might build in a break each week, or every other week, where he can devote one solid night to just you. 

But you must understand - he probably doesn't like being unable to be with you anymore than you do, and you have to remember that he is in a high-pressure, high-stakes program where grades and scores are insanely important. 

Marriage is give and take. At this time, he might not be able to give as much as you can, and that's why I wonder if you understood what, exactly, you two were getting into when he signed up for med school. Is he still showing his appreciation for what you do as a wife and partner? If not, that's a whole separate problem. ",1451607061

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","I have yet to see someone provide an explanation for why Celestia's entire demeanor towards Discord changed without any explanation between ROH and KCAFO. Why she went from despising him for having tortured her subjects for ages to perfectly happy to drop him off with Twilight and co. and risk the destruction of her entire kingdom.

Or explain why Fluttershy is suddenly perfectly happy and unbothered to have a dangerous chaos demon in her home (not to mention wrecking her stuff lol). Who cares about having an accurate representation of someone with social/other anxiety when you can have fanservice!

Or why Fluttershy is suddenly jumping up to defend Discord's mistreatment of her friends (and herself), and ignoring all her friend's pleas to look at all the evidence that he's up to no good. (and I dare someone to explain to me how the rest of the Mane 6's advice wasn't completely reasonable when Discord is EXTREMELY dangerous and WAS up to no good, trying to manipulate her so she would side with him.)

Or how Discord's sudden ""reformation"" in the end is realistic for his character AT ALL, when, by manipulating Fluttershy into taking off her element, he's back in control of the world again *which is what he's wanted for centuries*.

Or explain how it narratively makes sense to have the character who is the literal personification of *the exact opposite of what the show considers to be the greatest good: harmony*, on their side.

In fact, I would argue the message of the episode was effectively the exact *opposite* of ""sometimes you can't be too trusting and you have to put someone on a short leash"". It might *seem* like that at first glance, but consider what actually happened:

The ONLY boundary she ever set was that she wouldn't call him her friend if he decided to plunge the world into chaos again. Remember how she promised to never use her element of harmony on him if he put things back to the way they were? The first thing Discord does when she foolishly tosses aside her element is break his promise, declaring he has no intentions of complying with her request. Here's the thing: SHE STILL REFUSES TO USE HER ELEMENT AGAINST HIM EVEN WHEN HE LITERALLY JUST BROKE HIS END OF THE BARGAIN! HOW IS THAT THE CORRECT CHOICE OF ACTION WHEN DISCORD IS SET TO DESTROY THEIR ENTIRE WORLD? How is she not misguided in feeling obligated to keep her end of the bargain to someone who lied to her? And how is any of this even remotely in character for Fluttershy?

The only reason things don't end VERY badly is because of Discord's sudden and absurd change of heart at the end. Being nice and indulging a bully's behavior in the real world isn't going to magically make them good, especially not a serious villain like Discord. Which not only makes the episode completely unbelievable, but means the episode's message that Fluttershy's approach was the correct one, and that her friends were wrong for being more cautious, is a terrible message for kids.

So in other words it's an episode teaching girls exactly what not to do in an abusive relationship. Especially when you look at Discord's behavior and how he was trying to cut her off from the rest of her friends and get her to ignore their concerns for her safety. That's like textbook abusive behavior lmfao.

This episode is just one disaster on top of another. And because Discord is now a recurring character, it can't just be forgotten like it never happened.

None of this would have happened if the writers weren't trying to pander to the adult fanbase. And this is just one example; there are plenty of others in later seasons. So I think I'm pretty justified in being upset at the fanservice.",1451607063

An evil team (Team Frost) is trying to decrease the region's temperature. You join another team that is trying to stop this team (Team Carbon). Around the 4th gym you learn about the 5 legendary Pokemon that represent aspects of the region.

- Deremas, the Fire-Rock turtle. It represents the desert.
- Cratren, the Ice-Fairy albatross. It represents the ice.
- Xeredal, the Grass-Bug tarantula. It represents the jungle.
- Aldereeno, the Water-Poison kangaroo. It represents the swamp
- Munomel, the Flying-Dark pegasus. It represents the sky.


After the 6th gym, the evil team invades the city you are in. You fight the boss and escape.
The team you are on ends up awakening Deremas and plunging the world into a massive heat wave. Houses are burning, Pokemon are dying and you have to team up with the other team in order to capture the other 4 to bring balance back.

And I can totally see this working, especially for things like Cinema apps. Technically, I don't see why it wouldn't work, aside from possible limitations in the current SDK.

Keep in mind you need a very beasty machine though. You need to render 4 different 3D 2160×1200 scenes at 90hz for the CV1. For each headset you render two different scenes (although much of this is optimized since it's really just the same view shifted around). The CV1 also uses two separate monitors for the headset to give a better experience, this won't be a problem for a single headset, but I think it may be a problem for multiple displays. 

Regardless, it's some next-gen GPU type thing. SLI is great, but it's [built for throughput rather than latency](https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/515536323885936640).

He's also breastfed to sleep—though, when I'm not there, hubs has put him down without me.  Part of it is that I don't trust their extremely not-baby-safe house and that leads to me knowing I wouldn't be capable of forgiving them or myself if anything happened.

I heard they had a magazine and so searched for the Dabiq magazine out of curiosity I wanted to see what the would include in it. The first thing you notice is how well put together it is visually and content wise.

If you search Dabiq you can find there magazines off a quick google search very easily.

Nowhere in the magazine does it mentioned what they do in reality, its not representative of their actions at all, rather it is solely for propaganda purposes, so as far as quality goes, its all visually pretty, but content wise its lacking in substance and facts, ofcourse apart from the Quran and Hadiths that is.",1451607075

As mentioned previously, the way that Adnan describes Hae having to pick up her cousins is what made me think he's only been given talking points, and weak ones at that. 

It takes two seconds to figure out that Hae had an hour to run an errand that would take less than 8-10 minutes tops, that 7-11 is across the street, and McDonald's is something like 3 minutes away. 

It just sounded like he assumed that everyone would think Hae had to be quite far away by 2:30. 

On one hand, I can see why they may not want to go over every single thing with him. On the other hand, maybe he likes knowing he's gotten a bit famous? His mail must be out of control, and that must be a nice diversion. 

Once again, I'll mention for anyone new, I think Adnan should be out. And support sentence limits for minors. But yeah, I think he plotted to kill Hae, and carried it out. Sorry for all the repetition. I'm grateful for your view. ",1451607075

It's ""battery"" or ""in bloom"". 


There was *one* memorable session I recall where all four players (I was bass) played on expert, and everybody was at or near perfect for 7 or 8 classic rock songs in a row. It was probably the best I'd ever played, I didn't want to let the others down. The music was great, everybody had the same DLC it seemed, and we just rocked the fuck out. 

Then after ""won't get fooled again"" we called it done, everybody quit pretty much at the same time. It was amazing. 

But one experience like that, vs probably 50-60 of beastie boys or something I found shitty, and 100 or so ""meh"" where someone is clearly trying to show off by going a difficulty or two ahead of themselves and screwing it up. That's online. 

Local is great, have drinks &amp; snacks and rock the fuck out and laugh when someone tries to be goofy and falls over. ",1451607079

A few days later she was shopping for wedding rings and moving in with her new handfast husband (she hadn't divorced Mark yet).

I am maligning her when I say she didn't mention her kids again, because she did post a couple brief comments about missing them in lovey-dovey posts about the new guy, but that was it.

Because you will kill something 6 times (probably more) faster.   So that makes perfect sense they have different values.  They are still 100% swappable my friend I assure you.    

&gt; One thing you forgot to mention. The rarity of railway spikes are relatively high. Last time i was in a shop i saw less of those than gamma rounds. Care to explain?

Actually I did, you must not have been paying attention.  Railway has no auto option, gamma does.   That is the reason.   Railway is also a unique weapon so poor pick to compare unless to Cryolater or Broadsider.

Employee compensation is a hugely contentious and nuanced thing and probably not the sorta thing we can hashout here on Reddit.

That said, some of the biggest proponents of ""gameified"" workplaces are gaming companies, as they struggle to motivate employees to meet the demands of management, shareholders and (now) crowdfunding backers. It's a weird time.

Still, gamification isn't inherently a bad thing. I've seen companies build games to help employees lose weight, participate in social media and press, and all sorts of things that aren't just sales. But like anything, gamification can be used for bad purposes.",1451607084

The random conditions don't really help either, most of the time they do little to nothing to effect the way the mission will go and in the rare cases that they do it tends to be in a way that's annoying not challenging.

It also doesn't help that the rewards themselves are very poor as incentive.

The whole map ordeal reeked of “Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has. How embarrassing…” and Kamino being ""erased"" from the archives. 

Essentially: The map is two parts, not a brain teaser by any means. If the map was going to be something worthwhile, the movie should've been about how Rey, the chosen one, had to find 5 to 6 pieces in order to build the map.

I walked in on him molesting my cousin and didn't say anything because he promised he would stop but he didn't. Two more of my cousins and who knows how many others were molested before he finally got in trouble. As someone who has been molested and who has also been in your position I beg you to encourage your sister to come forward. I doubt that it is just her. Him paying his dues is irrelevant, but making sure that he doesn't cause serious emotional damage to anyone else is a priority. I regret every day the fact that I could have stopped things for my cousin and I didn't. I know how much damage sexual abuse does to a person and it is scary. When he made the choice to molest someone he made the decision to ruin his own life. In every situation, my parents excused my brother's behavior because he has disabilities and I can't tell you how damaging that was to my psyche. No circumstance.

Both the boot knife and bottle opener were tied for a 2015 winter knot gift exchange on the Knot Everything forums.

"vinyl","t5_2qh7i","I'll give you constructive criticism, the LP60 is plastic crap. It's landfill.

Back in the early days, companies were always trying to sell cheaper and cheaper turntables and they wound up flooding the market. I lived through it. Everyone I knew, every stereo I ever saw, had a shitty turntable (with few exceptions). I think they were a significant reason for the rapid decline of the vinyl format.

So many people had these shitty decks and were thinking, ""this sounds terrible! My CD discman sounds better than this!"" And they were right.

It's cheaper to make digital (cds/mp3/flac etc...) sound better with less investment.

If you think $100 is going to yield a positive vinyl listening experience, you're gonna have a bad time.

I just spent $150 on just a motor for one of my turntables. If you're lucky enough to have a friend with a nice setup, bring a record or two over and give it a listen.

Then again, if you're just playing records in the background as you play COD4, then nevermind, get a Crosley. 

In the end, I think I share a lot of the frustration of many /r/vinyl users who have lived through the vinyl era, beginning in the 1960s, when the ultra high fidelity and ultra stereo and all that other nonsense took hold.

I started buying vinyl in the 1980s, and as a DJ, accumulated thousands of records. Over the years, I've inherited many others' collections as they wound up losing interest in the format (or their cheap turntable broke). I have never stopped buying vinyl, so over time, these 30 and 40-year-old records become precious. Some of these records require the utmost care in handling because of what they're worth to me.

I don't understand why someone who is fascinated by the physical medium of a record and holding it in their hand, would think that it's OK to play this record on a shitty $100 player. It boggles the mind. I don't like static, clicks, pops, or surface noise. It's not cool. It's not *retro*. It sucks.

People of this subreddit have created all these great how-tos located on the right side. I think people don't read it or they don't care. And then they post on /r/vinyl with a picture of their Jensen/Crosley/Teac and say ""hey guys, I'm part of the club!"" without thinking about what role those shitty players had in the demise of the vinyl format.

"MakingaMurderer","t5_3b2cn","&gt;* The fact that Avery requested her personally and that she was never seen after arriving at the Avery property

It is very common for someone to request someone they worked with already. They are familiar with the person and liked their work. 

&gt;* Too much physical evidence on or very near the Avery property.  Cops can't have planted it all.

From what I remember, I could be wrong I watched it a few days ago, none of the evidence placed her in his house or trailer. 

The only evidence that was damning was the bullet they found, which the blood sample they got was contaminated and should have been labeled as ""inconclusive"". It was the only time the lady at the lab had ever contaminated a sample and the only time in her entire career she broke protocol and didn't label the sample as inconclusive even though it was contaminated. This is because they told her to find her blood and to make sure she could place her in his house. 

Also, the key they found was only found on their 7th, I believe, time after looking and it was clearly in the corner in plain view. 

&gt;* Avery clearly had a thing for her; she complained to her boss about him.

No mention that he ""had a thing for her"", only that she thought he was a little creepy. A normal response for someone that had been wrongfully convicted of a crime. 

&gt;* The timeline gives him plenty of opportunity -- he was alone with her from her arrival at 3ish until around 7:00.

Didn't someone see her leave? I can't remember. 

&gt;* His DNA on the latch in TH's car hood

Possibly planted. Still in dispute. 

&gt;* Ballistic match between bullet with TH DNA and Avery's gun.

Everyone knew he had a gun and he was the primary person of interest already and would have been easy to have set up.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Well beauty and attractiveness aren't the same thing to most people, so I would say it's very possible to be beautiful and obese, but it's hard to be healthy and obese. 

However the bigger issue is that you have no fucking clue about how they got that big. Why do you assume it's laziness? Just because YOU would have to be lazy to get fat? I've met plenty of obese people and most of the time it's a mental illness or poor resource management thing. Food is a a legal drug. You consume it and get dopamine and reward sensations, you get withdrawals if you don't eat, and unfortunately food is almost endless in America. So there's one reason, unless you think all addicts are just weak or lazy as well, but to that I would say what have you accomplish or gone through that was so hard? And did you not turn to something to flee the pain? Just be thankful your vice is more socially acceptable. 

Now I'm not obese or unattractive and I work a labor job and take care of my body, but there have been times where I couldn't make anything more than simple things like ramen and mac and cheese. Not because I was lazy, but because next to all the other shit in my life food prep was the last thing I could exert energy on.

He didn't create the Federation because he was a great negotiator. He didn't create it because he's so much smarter than everyone else. He didn't do it because he was the best tactician in the galaxy.

He did it because he was a stubborn ass. Because he didn't trust the Vulcans. Because he didn't really trust anyone in the wild west of the galaxy. Because he knew that he had only himself and his crew to count on and, in the end, he had to make the decisions that were best for them. And in the process, he impressed people with his stubborn determination. He impressed people with his willingness to fight for the truth over politics. He impressed people with his loyalty when he found real allies. And when push came to shove, he pushed right the hell back to do what was right until it was done. The insertion of this man, so stubborn in his ethics but disconnected from the politics of the galaxy, changed everything.

And while the chances of you coming across a manual car is not as large as an automatic in America, if you are ever in a bind and need to drive a car that is stick (let's say someone drank too much and you need to drive them home) it is important to know it. Manual is also a lot more prevalent in rural to suburban areas. This is mostly because manual in a city is impractical and a hell and any other super populated area with a lot of traffic. However, areas with less people and obviously less traffic means a higher abundance of manuals particularly when around farm land. 

The process of learning stick is so simple and easy that it's a skill that shouldn't be passed up on due to its high utility in situations that you might find yourself in dire need of it. It's like learning how navigate without a GPS. Not really too applicable when people have GPS on their phone and dedicated car GPS. But if you find yourself in that situation it is a valuable skill that is easy to learn and might be of extreme usefulness in your life. 

Also, you get more gas mileage with a manual and in my opinion from driving both automatics and manuals, it is a lot more fun. 

But that's just my thoughts on it. It's understandable if you don't think it a worthy expense of your time to learn it.  ",1451607097

- {Mawaru Penguindrum} - in your PTW; this show is quite deep psychologically, but not necessarily in the ""scary"" way. Depending on your specific tastes, you may get bored of this if you don't keep an open mind for at least 2 episodes. The start of the anime seems cutesy and light, but *it gets dark*. Still one of the best anime I've ever seen! :)

- {Code Geass: Hangyaku no Lelouch} - in your PTW, watch 3 episodes and you'll be hooked, trust me!

- {Mirai Nikki} - intense psychological shite and somewhat more like a horror.

- {Tokyo Ghoul} - like Mirai Nikki, but more horror and action

- {Steins;Gate} - in your PTW; this show is generally loved by everyone, and for great reason! Based on your love

- {Durarara!!} - in your PTW, and incredible. Not as dark as the others, but just as good!

- {Bakemonogatari} - (and the rest of the Monogatari Series); *WHY ISN'T THIS EVEN ON YOUR LIST?*

- {Akame Ga Kill}

And here are **MUCH** lighter shows that you'll probably really enjoy:

- {Plastic Memories} - adorable and will absolutely make you cry. But it has lots of happy parts!

- {Chobits} - also adorable as fuck, but not as sad as PlasMemo. Much more lightheartedly happy.

- {Angel Beats!} - genre is more like Chobits, but funnier and slightly darker

- {Chuunibyou Demo Koi Ga Shitai!} - adorable once again, but this time it's focused around a beautiful message about being/accepting who you are. Just ask /u/BanjoTheBear about it! ;)

- {Kill la Kill} - *proper AMAZING show*, loads of action and good comedy, but lots of ecchi (which is meant to parody other ecchi-action shows, but isn't taken as that by many people). The show doubles in interest value halfway through, even though it's extremely great in the first half! /u/The-Sublimer-One could probably tell you how great this show is better than I can!

Professor Gordon T. Stewart, Emeritus Professor of Public Health, Glasgow University, explains exactly the dangers of the Whopping Cough vaccine
http://www.vaccinationinformationnetwork.com/the-dangers-of-whooping-cough-vaccination-prof-gordon-stewart/

""the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.""

Under Freedom of Information we see that CDC experts privately admit the dangers of vaccines, they admit that vaccines are causing neurological problems, speech delays and they warn the information must be embargoed.

Key quotes below:
Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: ""The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”
Dr. Weil, pg. 24: ""There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem."" .... ""the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: ""we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.""
Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: ""Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”
Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: ""So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.""
Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: ""This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... ""I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.""
Dr. Weil, pg. 207: ""The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.
Dr. Brent, pg. 229 ""we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits""
Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: ""that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed""
Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: ""just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information""

i know cardio doesn't kill gains ffs , i play Rugby Union which requires about 70 minutes of non stop running and tackling - but i do know that during the season i cant lift as much weight as i'd like to doing power and strength because of recovery times and turn around due to all the running.

Type in marathon runner vs sprinter in google and look at the images - the evidence is right there, but thats not saying all marathon runners are like that, just majority of the good ones.

OP asked if running before strength training would be counter productive, fucking oath it will be - run after or 6 hours before - why would u kill energy stores for running? when your goal is Strength and muscle?

Here are the three things that have made the biggest difference for my hard-tails. 1) Fork. I ride mainly single track so switching from my heavy spring fork to a lighter air fork made a world of difference. The difference in handling and smoothness overall made it feel like a new bike all together.  2) wheels. If you can go lighter you'll be amazed at the difference in handling. Though, admittedly, $350 won't go much lighter than stock for you. At least not brand new.. 2) drive train. I upgraded from my stock low end shimano to a middle of the road sram set up. Lost the big and small rings on my crankset and stuck with the middle ring. I rode that middle ring most of the time anyway and the low and mid range sram components are the way to go over shimano. High end shimano and sram are a matter of preference as they both perform similarly, but low and mid range, sram wins hands down. I bought a talon 4 27.5 brand new for around 1000 out the door with soon accessories and these changes have made the most difference for me. Tires are a good way to alter handling for not a whole lot of money also... Keep it on two wheels! ",1451607100

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Briefly: they did know, most everybody knew. It was talked about very openly in newspapers as ""allegedly"" happening. The (Soviet-controlled) Afghan delegation to the UN denounced US interference at the United Nations. It was ""hidden in plain sight"" in many ways, especially by the mid-1980s. The mujahideen weren't finding Stinger missiles under rocks.

As for reactions, aside from a few denunciations, the most that the Soviet Union did (to my knowledge) was to occasionally attack sites just inside Pakistan on the Pakistani-Afghan border that were harboring mujahideen, and they did, in 1982, apparently hold out hopes of capturing an American advisor (see [document 16 here](http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB57/soviet.html)) that presumably they could hold out in front of the world in a Gary Powers sort of ""smoking gun"" fashion. (They didn't pull that off.)

Beyond that... what could they do? They couldn't engage the US in direct war, they didn't want the war to spill beyond Afghanistan (they were worried about Iran potentially getting involved), they couldn't do anything of substance in the UN (because the US is on the Security Council), and they lacked much moral high ground from the perspective of much of the world (who were denouncing the Soviet war altogether).

"AsianParentStories","t5_2u8j6","When the powers of the world (Great Britain, United States, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, etc.) were colonizing in the 19th and 20th centuries, they weren't focused on settling, but rather on gaining a monopoly on land/resources. There weren't many British people that moved to Hong Kong. Those who did held administrative and/or military positions. And although some officials brought Indian retainers if they were previously stationed in India, they didn't bring any migrant labor en masse, unlike in Singapore. 

As Hong Kong became a major port from its entrepot status (merchandise is imported to be exported again) as per the treaty terms, it attracted a lot of immigration from mainland China, which caused the population to rise steadily. Europeans immigrated to Hong Kong too, but in less quantity. Not to mention, the city was racially segregated. Nevertheless, various other events, such as the fall of the Qing Dynasty and the Communist victory sparked even more Chinese immigration to Hong Kong. So there was never any need to import Indian labour.",1451607103

His wife, a nurse, had noticed that he was drunk at very odd intervals and tracked his BAC; about 24 hours after eating carb-heavy meals or even something like a piece of gum, the brewer's yeast in his gut would ferment the food and leave the poor guy drunk out of his mind. The interesting part was that a 3-week simple fungal drug treatment and bacterial pills to re-colonize his gut successfully cured him (for better or worse).

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I believe both that you are abusive to your girlfriend, and that you honestly and earnestly desire not to be.

You may have Asperger's Syndrome. Check out r/aspiepartners, Google 'Asperger's relationships', and when you look for a therapist, ask for one that is qualified to give you an evaluation for Autism Spectrum Disorder (the field changed its labels recently, and AS comes under the ASD heading now). 

Last time I was on r/aspiepartners, I saw someone using the term ""accidentally abusive."" It's apt, because Aspies are usually well-intentioned people, but their neurological differences can really screw up how they express those good intentions socially. 

Another clue, for me, that you may have AS/ASD is your girlfriend's comment about you being distant. Aspies often have trouble with subtle communication things. It's social wiring again: neurotypical people are using microexpressions to give each other nonverbal information about their emotions all the time, and it's harder for Aspies to read that. Also much harder to learn how to display that info themselves. This leaves intimate partners feeling like there's less emotional intimacy than there should be.

I see some hope for you. If you see any more than 30% probability that AS/ASD describes you, please say to your gf, ""I might have Asperger's Syndrome, and if I do we will both need support to make our relationship enjoyable long term.""

"ModelWHPress","t5_38erm","Yep, the ‘coup’ (storming of Parliament) was a fantasy post. It did not change anything in-canon. Nevertheless, Aus Parliament is having some renovations done during January and is effectively in recess anyway. So that is a coincidence.

On 30 December 2015 before the ‘coup’, a general election was called for Australia in /r/ModelParliament. As per normal under its Constitution, the Parliament was prorogued, the House of Representatives was dissolved, and the Executive Government has entered caretaker mode. Upon hearing this announcement, the Fascists pretended to storm the parliament as a joke. But it was basically just laser-tag on muck-up day at Greendale Community College [TV ref].

For meta reasons, the party leaders are using the parliamentary holiday to set up a new sub for Australia in /r/ModelAustralia (better name, right). Assuming this goes to plan and gets going (aiming Feb 2016) it will be the rebooted home of model Aus with a new Constitution (TBC). General_Rommel is de facto managing the move.

In other words, /r/ModelParliament remains unchanged, but its legislature is in indefinite recess. In Jan, work is in progress for players to re-open as /r/ModelAustralia.

The part that sucks is that the hold is not explained, it is not notified in a timely manner, and devalues the entire point of trading.

I honestly believe it is on purpose to disincentivize trading over using the market so that there's money made off of the cards, instead of allowing them to be passed between people.

11 year account vs 11 year account, friends for multiple years... yeah, now the two factor auth is a problem.

Then, when the date happens, the person has the gall to be offended that the other party does not find their current physical condition/mental attitude conducive to a repeat date. 

I'm sorry, I don't care which side of the fence you prefer, or which gender you are, doing this is wrong. Primarily, in my mind, you misrepresent yourself, which is attempting to start off a new relationship by lying. This is a bad beginning to any relationship, be it just friends, or something more.

You have every right to feel like you were misled, lied to, catfished, or anything else you want to call it. For some reason, when it's a severely overweight person who is rejected by someone who is of more normal size, heck let's even say the other person could stand to lose even 30-40 pounds themselves, (to a morbidly obese person someone like this is still skinny) then *you're* somehow the bad person because you're not attracted to *that*. But, let's not look in the mirror and acknowledge the lying that went on... nope.

"tabletennis","t5_2rmfh","I actually think you're doing a few things pretty well. From the looks of your stroke, you've read a few articles on the FH loop already. I would first start out with this video that I linked in another post:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfcvlKtNMnc

Get yourself a swivel chair. Sit in it, and start moving yourself left and right. That's how your torso should rotate. Also, try and get yourself a tennis ball and put it between your elbow and the side of your body. Personally, I put it between the fleshy part between my elbow/armpit and pin it against the side of my body. I can literally loop while holding this ball. That way, you are hitting the ball by rotating your torso + elbow snap.

I don't recommend the ITTF videos since they're short, but go ahead and sign up for http://www.ttedge.com/ and check out their free videos. There's also a huge resource in http://mytabletennis.net/forum/ with a lot of passionate people that can help you out, but don't forget to check out existing threads first and pick up what you can.

Basically, keep your arm static and get your base a bit lower. Also, try to always have your follow-through end in the same spot without it going across your body. Like the other response here, I would say that the balls you're being fed are technically ones that should be smashed, but there's nothing wrong with working your way up since everyone has their own pace.

As you get better, you'll find your rallies becoming slightly faster, and the ball getting lower/spinnier. That's a great sign of progress. Have fun!",1451607116

The worst diseases in human history were deadly because they transferred to us from animals in which they could co-habitate with their host over a period of time.

For example, the Bubonic plague survives long-term in animal hosts such as fleas without killing them, but in humans was quite deadly until our relatively recent antibiotic treatments were available.

Check the prices of any pulls you think might net you more than 1k on the AH.

I basically checked every card I didn't intend on keeping or using until I learned which ones were valuable and which ones were in sets, etc. Build up your coin stock so you have enough for the good snipes when they show up. Nothing worse than seeing a card go up that you can make 50k profit on but can't buy it out because you just bought an upgrade for your hb and are low on coins. 

As far as getting through the gauntlet grind, run punt block man on D, and inside zone/quick toss with chew clock on for every play. Should take you around 10 minutes for each game.

It gives a quicker health regen and then once you hit level 3, it increases it even more, but also gives you a small heal with each kill.

Honestly, I got it assuming it'd be a nice brawler sort of pick up, last longer in fights, or even get back in quickly, but honestly I do find myself sitting out of fights sometimes just waiting on it to regen a good 5-10 seconds and ask myself wtf I got this trait for. It's ok man.. its not really anything to brag about, it's prolly saved me a few times where more than a few rounded the corner, but never 3+.

I've not read the full terms and conditions, so apart from the human iCentipad, if I remember rightly there is a clause of supporting software for 2 years. I think this is from sale, but could be wrong.

The 4S was discontinued in 2014. In the UK there is a law to do with sales of goods that states anything sold must last for a reasonable amount of time, with mobile devices I would class 2 years (average contract still in the UK.)

Based on this if the update does affect the handset enough to make it unusable on an ""average day usage."" Then the suit should win.

I think the big argument will be what constitutes as decent average day usage. If it was a generic handset, of calls and texts were too slow, I can see it. But with a smartphone, should this include more than calls and texts, if so, how far? Checking email (I agree) or does it include checking Facebook.

I think this will be interesting to see and if someone wants to clarify me. Please do, like I said I haven't fully read the T&amp;C's all I can expect is the iCentiPad ",1451607126

It's not perfect but it's perfectly good enough for us to do almost anything we want. 

And for everything it can't do physically, our equally flawed brain makes up for.

I've been forced to take Rhino just in case I need to survive being ambushed while I hack the objective.

Spy missions are not my favorite. I don't agree with them having respawns at all - in my opinion being able to either be sneaky and go past everyone, or silently assassinate them and walk in to do the job should be both an option.  I actually failed a mission a few days ago because I ran out of primary ammo killing all the nonstop patrols and had no way to fight an eximus.

Before you do a campus visit, see if the rowing coach or someone can also meet to discuss expectations and answer questions. They should not have any problems answer questions through email either!",1451607140

@thepirho  Yes, the cradlepoint can pass traffic through its connection. 

Again to nativevlan's point the routing table shows a 10.5.x.x address for ATT. The Cloud manager of course has the public 166.x.x.x address. I'm fuzzy on VPN's like this but that seems like an issue. I'm guessing NAT traversal is not possibly doing its job on the SonicWall ?",1451607143

You don't have the chance to not make use of the states facility from the very point of being born seeing as most hospitals take government money, so your attempt at equivalency is false. Even if you were off the grid somehow, the governments reach is unavoidable. It frankly doesn't matter, because theoretically you could not use any services in the system and still be kidnapped and thieved. You don't have to look any further than the United States governments treatment of the Native Americans to see that.

&gt;And comparing all this to mafia and servitude is a waste of time and beating around the bush.

Well that certainly seals it! The metaphor was wrong. Except it wasn't. Can you tell me how it was exactly other than ""wasting time"", which makes absolutely no sense since you're on fucking Reddit. Seriously. I know you can't respond on the difference between the Mafia and the government...because there isn't one.

&gt;Taxation is the price of living within a society.
If you do not want to be a part of society, then you can bugger off to some shitty little island country and stop paying taxes. I know you wouldn't like to do that. But you can, really.

Taxes are not the price of living within a society. That's simply not true. Taxes inhibit living within a proper society. Taxation funded the destruction of Iraq and Afghanistan. Did that improve society or detract from it?

Finally, not once have you been able to differentiate theft from taxes. You have finally rested on the absurd argument that it somehow is a symptom of a good society and stopped differentiating the two. Theft is a symptom of a sick society. The repeated mugging of citizens is the ideology of sociopaths. 

Finally, you seem like the type of person who would find it perfectly fine to tell an African-American that if they didn't like Jim Crow / segregation / etc, that they could move back to Africa. ",1451607146

"Steam","t5_2qwis","It's built into the game. In game it's menu -&gt; options -&gt; controls -&gt; customize. It needs to be a directinput controller (which the 360 controller is compatible with, even if rumble and everything requires Xinput), and you need to go into the Windows controller settings before booting the game and make sure the controller you want to use is set as the primary controller. The buttons will be arbitrarily assigned to PS1 buttons based on the number of the button Windows reports (e.g., button 1, wherever it physically is on your controller might be treated by the game as if it's the X button, which the game on both PC and PS1 calls ""cancel"" rather than ""X""), and you'll have to look up what buttons line up with what name to get everything assigned correctly.

It sounds more complicated than it is. The main thing is that the game's built in controller support has one physical button assigned to one PS1 button, and whatever button that is does all the same things the PS1 button does on the PS1 version. You just normally have to remap the buttons because the game tends to assign them to the wrong physical button out of the box.

Edit: and I just remembered, you can't hold down both triggers on the 360 controller at the same time and have them register in Windows. This is never done in game except in the chocobo races (at least if you mapped them to I and r 2 and the bumpers to I and r 1), and it's Microsoft's fault for treating those buttons as a single joystick axis in the drivers, not squeenix's fault.",1451607146

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly, the biggest reason I haven't watched it is because of what I've heard of the source material. Apparently, there are more than a few instances of describing, in detail, sex between the MCs. Also rape.

Now, don't get me wrong (as weird as this is going to sound) - *both* sex and rape have their places in entertainment in general. I mean, porn, duh. Also in popular shows/movies/books/games - Game of Thrones comes to mind. 

But I just can't get past the fact that he began the story in his early teens, wrote *details* of teen sex, and called it a day. It just bothers me on some deeper level. A story about a VR game does not need to include detailed sex - sure, implications and hints, fine - but details? 

And before anyone asks/assumes, no, I'm not against ""raunchy"" things. I enjoy porn. All kinds of it. Big surprise, I know. What a confession! 

But that show is not the place for it. As much as we know in that particular situation, ya know, being stuck in a VR game with attractive people with no end in sight, people would lose their inhibitions (it's just a game, bro!) this type of story just shouldn't include it.

I probably would enjoy the story, at least a little bit. I'm not exactly known for [being harsh with my ratings.](http://myanimelist.net/animelist/moonhowler22?&amp;order=4) I just can't get past it. Leave that stuff to the more mature shows where the characters aren't 14.",1451607153

"Musicthemetime","t5_2y5dx","""New Rose"" was the first single by British punk rock group The Damned, released on 22 October 1976. It was the first single by a British punk group,[1] and was released in the Netherlands, Germany, and France in 1977.
 
Written by guitarist Brian James, ""New Rose"" was issued on the Stiff Records label. The B-side was a cover of The Beatles' hit ""Help!"", performed about twice as fast as the original. Both songs have since become staples of The Damned's live shows, and appear on various compilations, and ""New Rose"" was included on the group's full-length debut Damned Damned Damned. The deadpan intro by Vanian of ""Is she really going out with him?"" on ""New Rose"" pays homage to the 1964 Shangri-Las song ""Leader of the Pack"".
 
The single was reissued in Stiff's mail order Damned 4 Pack mail-order set. Original copies have a pressout centre, while re-issues have a solid centre. Copies from the fourpack have matrix details: ""Bilbo tape"" handwritten and ""AY 50332"" printed.

-She was put on the corporate board of WalMart because Sam Walton wanted a token woman, and thought it'd be good PR to put the First Lady of Arkansas on the board.

-Much of her activism comes on the heels of being First Lady, from which she would otherwise have no credibility.

-She rode into New York on promises of helping Wall Street and name recognition.

-Her SecState post was a healing session between bourgeois feminists and Obama supporters.

I am not sure what her actual accomplishments are. Her time as SecState was a disaster. She was not that effective in the Senate, except where it came to protecting her donor's interests. The best to credit her with is her time on the WalMart board, where she actually convinced them to hire more female officers, but that was weighted out by the fact that she said exactly jack shit about WalMart busting unions, which would have helped women who were working at WalMart.

We're not disqualifying her ""accomplishments"" because of her husband. But she is the very definition of standing on the shoulders of others, both men and women, to get where she's at. It's not because of her gender, but simply because she's a conniving person, like her husband is. That aside, I'm hard-pressed to find any of her actual accomplishment; meaning, something substantial she did that doesn't just amount to successive PR campaigns for the Clinton family.",1451607155

Basically it takes time for celestial bodies to stop tumbling and actually rotate about their principal axis.  The more massive the body, the faster it achieves that.

Sure enough the ones that are calculated to have achieved this before 4 billion years have.  Those that shouldn't have achieved it until 5 billion years haven't.  In the middle it's half and half.

It's pure physics and I've never seen rebuttal.

I'm also an evolutionary biologist by study, so feel free to bring some of his arguments here.

Also check out the GULO gene.  Humans have a gene that should make Vitamin C, but it's broken on Exon 10 base pair 97.  That BP is missing.  It's also missing on all old world primates studies so far.  7 last count.  The chances of that being coincidental are astronomical, but it makes perfect sense under evolution.

"StarWarsLeaks","t5_2vflj","So it's not all of the average joes in the rebel alliance, but some of the more battle hardened troopers tend to focus on the here-and-now and not pay attention to the super-stars up top.

A little background:

- Namir, from Twilight Company, grew up on a world that had very little technology, in fact blasters were rare, that was constantly in war with different warlords. Ever since he was a child, he went from warlord to warlord. He started off believing in what he was fighting for, that he was the good guy. As each warlord failed and he moved on to the next, he became more and more disillusioned. When the rebel alliance came, he was actually fighting for the Empire but quickly learned he and his comrades were just used as cannon fodder on the front lines. He signed up for the Rebel Alliance because he saw it as a way out of his horrible, poverty stricken life on his home planet.

- Thane also grew up on a backwater planet, but was from a richer, second wave of settlers. He and his best friend both qualified for the Imperial Academy on Coruscant and he was actually apart of the Empire for a while. He was actually stationed on the first Death Star and was out on patrol when the Rebels destroyed it. He began to become wary of the Empire and it's tactics when the Death Star destroyed Alderaan and seeing the Empire capture people to be slaves was the last straw and he escaped and eventually joined the Rebel Alliance. He had many friends on the Death Star so he never really warmed up to the ""Hero"" that destroyed it",1451607159

I had the same behavior happen with an Atlas U-25B I equipped last month; turned out that a motor-mount ring hadn't seated properly between the frame halves when I reassembled it. Once corrected, the engine ran perfectly. 

As /u/butterkitty suggests, there may be a board-to-motor-contact issue. As it turns out, I installed a DN163K0A in a Kato PA-1 this week, and it took a little fidgeting to ensure that the motor contacts were properly engaged.

If you've ever taken LSD with a friend you'll know what I mean when I say LSD makes you very intuitive. When my friend &amp; I have taken LSD, we were able to communicate without speaking, using only eye contact. The main story I want to share is about a solo trip.

One day I decided to take a hit of some really good lsd. A few hours into the trip, everytime I blinked I would start to see and feel demons creeping towards me, closer and closer each blink. This terrifying negative energy caused me to go lay down in the dark with shplongle &amp; meditate. At first it was hard to get comfortable but my breathing synced up to the beat and I lost sense of my body &amp; time as my mind explored the galaxy. The visuals consisted of precious metal like colors (e.g. gold, platinum, shining silvers) bouncing around to the music. At one point during the peak I had a visual or near-death experience that makes me question reincarnation or the ability to tell time. It was me, or maybe not me, sure didn't look like me. It felt like I was in a desert, I could feel the sun beaming down on my dying body, but I was indoors tripping. I heard flies buzzing around me &amp; what I can only describe as the sound of death, similar to that ringing sound of nothing except louder &amp; more capturing.

Things he eats: most types of chips, bread, and cereal. Chicken, and beef but it has to be ground. Drinks sugary juice and soda. Sometimes water. Milk. Lots of candy. Mexican food with only the aforementioned meat types. Chili beans. Ramen.

Things he doesn't eat: vegetables, fruit, steak, turkey, fish, burgers, anything with a bone in it, potatoes, basically almost everything from keto diet. 

I can't force him not to eat what he wants; I can only control myself. My plan is to try my best to have a substitute that's better than his food. Good, high quality meats and vegetables as well as low-carb alternatives to things like chips that you can have occasionally. There's a subreddit just for recipes called /r/ketorecipes.

The Colts are the only team in the AFC South that has maintained success long term. The Jags, Titans, and Texans have all been teams that will be good for a couple years once or twice a decade and then fade back into being bad. They are not well run franchises compared to many others. I hope with new ownership the Jags can change that reputation but I'm not going to get excited about a team that might win 6 games.

Reddit has [guidelines as to what constitutes spam](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F). To summarize:

* It's not strictly forbidden to submit links to videos of yours, but please only do so in a moderate amount.

* If you spend more time submitting to reddit than reading it, you're almost certainly a spammer. As a rule of thumb, for every post promoting your own video(s), you should have made 10 other submissions or comments on other posts. (Bear in mind that pointless comments like ""nice"" and ""lol"" do not count as actual contribution.)

* If your contribution to reddit consists mostly of your own videos, and additionally if you do not participate in this community in other ways, for example by submitting other content or joining the discussion on other posts, you are a spammer.

* If people historically downvote your links or ones similar to yours, and you feel the need to keep submitting them anyway, they're probably spam.

For right now, this is just a friendly message, but here in /r/Minecraft, we take action against anyone that fits the above definition.",1451607171

I could also see just making the switch from 3 NAPD to 3 Oaktown instead of just dropping 1 like I said above, but I really think that the NAPD tax is very important for this deck, and I want to keep as many as possible.  If I had another good piece of ICE instead of Tollbooth, I'd consider -1 Tollbooth -1 Pop-up and just keep the NAPDs, but there isn't a piece of ICE even close to Tollbooth in terms of tax for its size, so I'd prefer to keep it in if at all possible.",1451607175

Thats not even considering the fact your point doesnt even make sense. Those 21m results could as well say that both are identical as much as they arent. It means absolutely nothing if you dont bother to check them up.

 Directly from the Quebec French wiki page :
&gt; As mentioned above, Quebec French is not standardised and as such is considered standard French. One of the reasons for this is to keep it in line with and mutually intelligible with Metropolitan French: there is a continuum of mutual intelligibility throughout France and Québec even if some minor differences in phonology and vocabulary exist.[9][10] If a comparison can be made, the differences between both varieties are comparable to those between standard American and standard British English even if differences in phonology and prosody for the latter are probably greater than between Quebec and Metropolitan French,[10] though American forms will be widely understood to larger exposure of American English in English-speaking countries, notably due to the widespread diffusion of US films and series. Francophone Canadians abroad may have to modify their accent somewhat in order to be more easily understood, but most are able to communicate readily with European francophones nonetheless.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","It *is* sexism when that's the only reason they're in the movie.

I can't think how much more simply I can explain this, such that you will actually understand.

In 2015, a major movie studio considered it appropriate to create a movie in which the major female roles were sex slaves, and in which minor female roles were farm animals used for food production. By contrast, the major male roles were the leaders of the entire culture, and the minor male roles were the henchmen of said leaders. And Mad Max. 

That is sexist.

Get it?

It doesn't matter *why* the females were sex slaves and milk machines, or how that affected what they did as a consequence in the execution of the plot. 

It matters THAT they were sex slaves and milk machines. It matters THAT they were in that position to begin with. Out of all the possible roles that the screenwriters could have conjured up for women to play in this movie, they came up with 1) sex slaves and 2) milk machines. And the sex slaves were portrayed by the most beautiful women the studio could hire, because of course a prized sex slave *must* be beautiful or nobody would want to have sex with them, and they spent the entire movie wearing very little clothing, whereas the milk machines were portrayed by obese women who were dehumanized to such a degree that you didn't even see their entire bodies, just the breasts, and the fact that they were naked and attached to machines harvesting their breast milk. Meanwhile, the men were all clothed, they were not sexualized at all, and their roles were specifically to function as enforcers of the power structure and contributors to the survival of the whole community, who was entirely dependent on them.

And before you bring up the Vuvalini as a counter-example, remember how they baited their trap. 

That is sexist.

Get it?

If you simply just can't grok that, then please go back to Tumblr and enjoy your shallow and non-intellectual understanding of what feminism is.",1451607179

To answer your questions:

1. The power supply is good enough. It's a great choice, in fact.
2. That motherboard is good. There may be a better alternative for your money, possibly, but I'm not sure about the availability of things in New Zealand.
3. The 390 will easily fit in that case, BUT; you are overpaying for an expensive, full tower case, with tons of room that you literally have no use for. Save your money, get something like an N300, K280, or (getting away from cooler master) NZXT source 210 elite. There are lots of less expensive, solid quality cases that will appropriately fit and cool your parts. Very few people need an expensive full tower.
4. No. Forget water cooling. You can't even overclock, and you wouldn't need watercooling even if you could. You should probably get a 212 EVO. ",1451607180

It is a scientifically established fact in literally hundreds of studies that the preservatives and chemical additives in vaccines damage cells. Neurotoxicity, immune suppression, immune-mediated chronic inflammation and carcinogenic proliferation are just a few of several effects that have been observed on the human body. See a list of chemicals in vaccines.

Fortunately, the drug companies still tell us the damage vaccines have on the human body. People just don’t read them. All you have to do is look at the insert for any vaccine, and it will detail the exact ingredients, alerts and potentially lethal effects.

Any medical professional who believes that it is justified to inject any type of neurotoxin into any person to prevent any disease is completely misguided, misinformed, deluded and ignorant of any logic regarding human health.

An Example:

Arepanrix H1N1 Vaccine Arepanrix™ H1N1 (AS03-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine) is a two-component vaccine consisting of an H1N1 antigen (as a suspension), and an AS03 adjuvant (as an oil-in-water emulsion).

The virus is inactivated followed by formaldehyde treatment and disrupted with sodium deoxycholate.

Preservative content: 5µg (micrograms) Thimerosal USP per 0.5mL dose or 2.5 micrograms organic mercury (Hg) per 0.5mL dose

Adjuvant: The AS03 adjuvant system is composed of DL-α-tocopherol, squalene and polysorbate 80 in a 3mL vial: DL-α-tocopherol: 11.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose Squalene: 10.69 milligrams/0.5mL dose, Polysorbate 80: 4.86 milligrams/0.5mL dose

Analysis of Ingredients Formaldehyde According to the Australian National Research Council, fewer than 20% but perhaps more than 10% of the general population may be susceptible to formaldehyde and may react acutely at any exposure level.

More hazardous than most chemicals in 5 out of 12 ranking systems, on at least 8 federal regulatory lists, it is ranked as one of the most hazardous compounds (worst 10%) to ecosystems and human health (Environmental Defense Fund).

Formalyn a 37 percent solution of gaseous formaldehyde which includes methano (used in vaccines as a tissue fixative) is considered a hazardous compound, and its vapor is toxic.

In the body, formaldehyde can cause proteins to irreversibly bind to DNA. Laboratory animals exposed to doses of inhaled formaldehyde over their lifetimes have developed more cancers of the nose and throat than are usual, as have workers in particle-board sawmills… Formaldehyde is classifed as a probable human carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as a known human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer.

Sodium Deoxycholate

Sodium Deoxycholate is a water soluble ionic detergent/bile salt which causes cell death and symptoms such as burning, redness, and swelling. It has been shown to weaken the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and subsequently activate seizures. It has demonstrated synergistic toxicity with antifungal drugs. Detergents and emulsifiers promote tumors and cause cells to leak or explode by weakening their walls, with no mechanism for regulating destructive activity. These chemicals are not completely purified out of the final vaccine product, so they enter the body at the time of injection.

Detergents are used extensively in cell research precisely because of their ability to break cells open for further analysis. This catastrophically mimics the membrane attack complex (MAC). Detergents hit cells at random and continue destroying cells regardless of which call off the attack.

Sodium Deoxycholate is completely foreign to the relationships that define and make up the delicate balance of the immune system. It systematically disrupts these relationships to negate the optimal function and design of immune responses. Thimerosal Note: 10 Times More Thimerosal in the Canadian Non-Adjuvanted H1N1 Vaccine recommended for Pregnant Women

Thimerosal has powerful and damaging effects on cells of the nervous and immune systems in mammals including humans. Its effect may vary depending on the dose, the genetics of the individual, and the timing of exposure. The mercury dose from thimerosal produces acute and often deadly ethylmercury blood levels.

Organic forms of mercury are well-known neurotoxic agents and far more dangerous than inorganic mercury sources. Exposure to organic mercury produces predominantly central nervous system (CNS) effects that are commonly severe and can induce prolonged unconsciousness, coma and death. (See: Acta Chim. Slov. 2004, 51, 361-372)

-After only 2 hour exposures, thimerosal at micromolar concentrations causes neuronal membrane damage and alterations leading to cell death in immune T-cells.

-Thimerosal alters the functioning of critical neurotransmitters necessary for proper brain functioning.

-Thimerosal causes DNA fragmentation of neuronal cells and disrupts neuronal growth factor signaling at micromolar and even nanomolar concentrations. It also causes DNA methylation and attentional pathways at nanomolar concentrations, leading to alterations in brain function.

Under microscopic magnification the following video presentation by the University of Calgary demonstrates the immediate damage mercury does to the structure of brain cells.

Squalene Too dangerous for human use, Squalene is not officially licensed for use in the United States or Canada. Oil adjuvants like squalene have been ordinarily used to inflict diseases in animals – for experimentation and study. According to anthrax vaccine expert Gary Matsumoto and other reliable sources, the US military used an unlicensed, experimental anthrax vaccination laced with squalene, with disastrous consequences, including Gulf War Sydrome.

""There are now data in more than two dozen peer-reviewed scientific papers, from ten different laboratories in the US, Europe, Asia and Australia, documenting that squalene-based adjuvants can induce autoimmune diseases in animals, observed in mice, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits. Sweden's Karolinska Institute has demonstrated that squalene alone can induce the animal version of rheumatoid arthritis. The Polish Academy of Sciences has shown that in animals, squalene alone can produce catastrophic injury to the nervous system and the brain. The University of Florida Medical School has shown that in animals, squalene alone can induce production of antibodies specifically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus"" writes Matsumoto.

Oil-based vaccination adjuvants like squalene have been proved to generate concentrated, unremitting immune responses over long periods of time according to a 2000 article in The American Journal of Pathology. The study demonstrated that a single injection of the adjuvant squalene into rats triggered a chronic, immune-mediated joint-specific inflammation, also known as rheumatoid arthritis. The researchers concluded the study raised questions about the role of adjuvants in chronic inflammatory diseases.

Polysorbate 80 Polysorbate 80 is similar to Sodium Deoxycholate in its ability to increase cell permeability, damage, and bursting. After injection it can rapidly metabolize into sorbitol and ethylene oxide which is much more toxic than the original chemical. When Polysorbate 80 breaks down there are 20 moles of ethylene oxide for every mole of sorbitol. These polysorbates have been shown to cause dangerous, sometimes fatal effects, when given through a needle. Changes in heart function can occur immediately. The blood-brain-barrier (BBB) can be weakened and penetrated, followed by seizures and even death. Polysorbates demonstrate synergistic toxicity with a wide range of chemicals.

under ""about the gallery"", ""artists and investors"" is misspelled. 

There's a lot of issues with the writing of the blog posts. Pictures of the paintings are sometimes pretty low-res. Also I agree with the poster who said that their should be artists names with the pictures. Options are odd - by medium? Is that standard. Maybe by theme or by artist?

Conversamos um tempo, ele me mostrou o livro que estava lendo e disse que estava voltando para o Rio de Janeiro, onde ia recomeçar uma vida direito. Até aí tudo bem, o cara pareceu arrependido mesmo e desejoso de um recomeço.

Adquiri confiança e ele me mostrou o papel da soltura, só aí eu percebi que era visita periódica... Tentei explicar isso pra ele, mas percebi que seria até perigoso continuar. O fato é que o cara achou que era saída definitiva da cadeia e era temporária. Ele tinha certeza disso, e não era mau caratismo, era falha cognitiva mesmo (provavelmente nem ler o cara sabia).

De onde eu me pergunto, desses presos que saem no indulto/visitação temporária, quantos sabem que terão que voltar? Daqui a uns dias vai sair a notícia de que a maioria não voltou... Mas eu duvido que a administração penitenciária faça questão de avisar os caras. Pra eles é até melhor que o sujeito não volte, depois se estrepa com a polícia em uma geral na rua.

Tudo isso pra dizer que esse mecanismo do indulto está completamente corrompido e precisa ser urgentemente repensado.

Oh don't worry, it's all in there anyways haha. I definitely see where you are coming from. 

With regards to his friend... yes, you are certainly correct about that. I don't dislike his friend, I think he can be a lot of fun, and he's loyal to Silas... but I don't think he's the best influence. Not to say that Silas isn't an adult and isn't responsible for his own behaviour, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if he was just saying those things so that Nick would think he's cool. Like a 14 year old. I also think it was meant with a tinge of humour. Silas is a very nerdy dude. I happen to think he's very attractive and cool, but he is not a bro at all, so I think he gets a kick out of acting out of character, if that makes sense? Like ""haha I'm a white guy rapping.

As far as the idea that a healthy Robben or CR7 wouldn't have scored 10 goals for Chelsea this year, then I think you're being absolutely delusional. Wijnaldum has 7 for Newcastle. They are not playing better than Chelsea and have played 6 less games in the CL. Andre Ayew has 6 for Swansea, who are also not better than Chelsea and have also played 6 less. Pelle has 6 for Southampton who are only 4 points better than Chelsea. Jordan Ayew has 5 for Aston Villa for god sake. Willian has 7 for Chelsea this year, you don't think that Robben or Ronaldo have the potential to score 3 more than Willian? Do you honestly believe that Cristiano Ronaldo, who has scored over a goal a game for the last 4 years and has 84 Premier League goals to his name would not have gotten at least 10 goals in this Chelsea team?

"news","t5_2qh3l","Its a private sale between two individuals.  Your still liable for criminal charges if you knowingly sell a gun to someone who cannot pass a background check. Its illegal.  The stupid part is that the dems in congress do not want to open NICS to the public so that a private seller can access it and do their homework on the buyer when conducting a private sale.  

The only recourse they have is to take the gun to an FFL and ask them to do a background check on the person, which an FFL often doesnt want to do because he isnt the one making money off the sale.  The only other recourse out there that private sellers attempt to take is to only sell to people with CCW permits (as the person has to pass a background check to maintain a current CCW).  You see it a lot on sights like gun broker or arms list.  And on top of that you have the fact that the government uses the background checks as defacto registration maintaining a record of every firearm purchase done through an FFL.  Oddly enough a lot of Americans dont like being on a list just to exercise a constitutional right. 

Bottom line, its illegal to sell a gun to someone who cannot pass a background check, but a private seller has no way of knowing if he is selling to a forbidden person in most cases because of this stupidity.    ",1451607200

"surfing","t5_2qmde","It's a really fun board. It does really well in anything from 1 to 6 feet. Easy to paddle, maintains speed, the wide tail adds float and almost seems like it helps you get into waves easier. Also it's almost bullet proof. Honestly I would like to see a lot more boards made of this material. I started on an Epoxy board then moved to a PU which I've been riding for some time and prefer. I noticed very little difference between the PU and the Lib Tech material. Now when I ride an epoxy board it almost kinda feels to ping-pong ball-ish.

There are a couple of things I noticed and not necessarily bad. There's the above comment and wax adheres kinda funny to the board. The way I wax is the same if it's my PU or the Lib Tech but where the PU gets nice bumps, the wax on the Lib Tech lays more flat (if that makes sense). Although I really don't notice a difference under my feet.

I've been using three different fin set-ups. 1) Thruster 2) Thruster with smaller center fin 3) Quad

I purchased the Lib Tech fins, which include 2 side fins, 1 standard center fin and 2 trailing fins if you want to run a quad. Not sure what these fins are made of but they are quite stiff.

1) The thruster setup was with the Lib Tech fins. I didn't like this very much and only using it once. It felt way too stiff for a groveler.

2) For the thruster with a smaller center fin I used FCS M.R-TFX and the board felt more lively but the side fins are huge. I ended up putting the Lib Tech side fins on and keeping the smaller FCS M.R-TFX center fin on. I like this setup and has been my preferred set-up when I need a little bit more stability over a quad or really I tend to just use this setup more. I would like to get some regular FCS side fins that have a bit more flex and see how I like that.

3) This board does very well as a quad, especially in small surf. It is really fun and fast. I've been using the Lib Tech fins for the quad set-up. I would probably recommend getting an FCS quad set that you're familiar with. I still have to get a good FCS quad set but I bet I would use this board more as a quad with the right fins. Like I said above, the Lib Tech fins are stiff and the 2 trailing fins that come with the Lib Tech fin package have a 50/50 foil. I would much rather have a flat foil on the inside.

Anyway, that's all I can think of right now. I'll post more if I think of anything.",1451607203

My only reservation about upping the AcO for that trip was that the last time I did AcO it was a little rough anxiety-wise, which has only ever been a problem for me with AcO and only very rarely, but I wanted to ease back into it.  

I ended up taking 15mg/15mg.  I wouldn't say I tripped very hard, but the euphoria from the moxy put me in a great mood and kept the trip extremely positive.   More euphoria than I've had the few times I've tried moxy on its own.  Almost like MDMA.  And I got some nice (but mild) visuals from the AcO.

"StackAdvice","t5_2ttk1","I can't speak to which nootropics might help, but I can make a few suggestions that will make things easier for you. It seems like, if you are sitting there not saying anything, you may be having trouble with coming up with things to say while experiencing the pressure and nervousness that comes with meeting new people. This is a common issue, and the key to overcoming it is preparing ahead of time. After all, there's no reason you can't come up with things to say while you are comfortable sitting at home instead of waiting until you are on the spot.

Come up with 3-5 general topics to talk about so that you never have to worry about running out of things to say. They should be things that pretty much everybody will walk about, such as current events, food, travel, and other similar things. You might want to be a little more specific, such as picking the 2016 presidential race or some nice restaurant you ate at last week. The idea is to keep the topics accessible with lots of opportunity for both of you to contribute.

Get used to talking about your 3-5 subjects so that you don't have to think much about what you're saying. The people talking to you are going to have the same anxiety about not having a lot to say, so if you pick a comfortable topic, they will be happy to grab onto it. No, they won't be the most interesting conversations, or really allow either of you to open up, but we're talking about first impressions, not deepening real relationships with your friends. 

You may never need to bring up your 3-5 general subjects when meeting a person, and that's totally fine. Maybe the conversation just doesn't go that way. If you find yourself with nothing to talk about, though, you'll be glad you prepared. Your conversation topics are your safeguard against running out of things to say, which is the most common problem and sounds like what you're describing.",1451607206

On Another note, to be honest, you do not have to believe in evolution to become a skilled doctor. You do not have to be good at anything other than medicine to be skilled in a certain profession such as neurosurgery. You just have to know how to get by and know the right people like in a lot of  businesses. Once you're out of medical school and into residency, all you really have to do is focus on your specialty and you can be completely inept in any other subject and still be successful in medicine.. especially neurosurgery due to the amount of time you have to devote to the specialty.

George noticed that the next generation of kids were being introdu ed to the OT by their fathers, uncles, older brothers, etc. He thought he could popularize this even more by returning the OTs to theatre and releasing updated VHSs targetted towards us.

It got us hooked on the OTs and we probably got to experience them for the first time in theatre.

That kept us content for a while and then just at the right time they come out with the prequels which was targetted at us as well.

After we grew a little older we seen the flaws in the prequels and yerned for something more like the OTs. And guess what heres TFA just in time

Their record is also exactly what their advanced stats have their expected win-loss at, so it's not a matter of being unlucky.

This team is legitimately as bad as their record indicates. No idea why people here insist otherwise.

**Bernie Sanders - On Policy**

How does Bernie plan to raise the **minimum wage** from $7.25 to $15 an hour?

&gt; Bernie Sanders wants $15 / hr by 2020, so 5 years from now, which equates to ~$12 / hr today. Likewise, Youth minimum wage would increase from $4.25 to $12 ($3 below minimum), and restaurant and tipped workers would go up from $2.13 (set in 1991) to $3.15 immediately, and increased $1.50 per year until $15 is reached.

How does Bernie plan to pay for a **single payer healthcare system**?

&gt; The US already spends more per capita than Britain or France, because of poor negotiations, while consumer out of pocket costs are 5 times more. We’re already paying for a single payer system, it’s just the consumers aren’t getting their cut.

How does Bernie pay for **12 weeks paid family medical leave**?

&gt; By imposing a new 0.2% payroll tax, which would allow workers to get up to 66% of their salaries as paid family leave for up to 12 weeks.

How does Bernie pay for **infrastructure spending**?

&gt; By closing what he has called loopholes that allow U.S. companies to stash profits overseas.

How does Bernie plan to give everybody **tuition free college**?

&gt; By imposing a tax on Wall Street trades, of 0.5% or less.

**Outreach - MLK Event**

Mary Wilson of the District 1 Democrats: KCDP and District One are participating in Martin Luther King JR Week Celebration of Events, including the Annual MLK Parade. You can have one vehicle and up to 10 walkers to hand out campaign items to parade watchers along the sides of the street. The Parade will start at 10:00, but line up begins around 8:30 near Tabernacle Baptist Church on MLK Avenue. It concludes around 11:00 a.m. at Greater Warner Tabernacle AME Zion Church with a celebration service there at around 11:30 a.m. and ALL are invited to attend.

January 18, 2015, Monday  10:00 AM - Come Join the Parade!!! - Also, Democratic Debate January 17th!!

“Let’s put a STOP to mass immigration until we got it figured out, morons.”

“I’m the best, better, greatest, bestest.” - chant “Jeb is Dead, Jeb is Dead”

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","Obviously, Benny most deserves a call-up as the best American attacking midfielder playing right now and Besler is a regular.

I don't think Zusi should be called up anymore, as he does not provide enough pace on the wings, one-on-one dribbling ability, or the set-piece ability he has in the past, although he was called in for the CONCACAF playoff.

If Jurgen wants keepers in their prime, then Melia could be an option, although I don't think he is a top-3 MNT eligible keeper in MLS, and Gonzalez would be a more valuable call-up.

Kempin was called in last January camp as part of the Olympic-age group of players, and could be called in for this one following a decent year as understudy to Melia. Similarly, Palmer-Brown played for the U20s at the World Cup, but he is not at a national team level yet.

Finally, Mapp has been a top winger in MLS the past couple of years, but Jurgen hasn't called him in and there are younger, more promising wingers that are available. 

Sinovic got called in for a past Camp Cupcake and Ellis had a decent year filling for Opara.

Finally, Dwyer is not eligible, but Jurgen has called in guys who haven't declared for the US yet (Akindele last year) and if Jurgen thinks he can be a difference-maker in the future

As for EoC, one of the discussion it started with was Weapon Balancing and making stuff like Warhammers more relevant. Either way, I wouldn't expect a massive overhaul.

And yes, I can read. If you read my entire post you would see I commented on that part. When discussing things like this it is important to talk about the big picture and not just single ideas, so knowing why higher tier player made weapons can be an issue is important in finding ways around that. I also pointed out that players would likely prefer to mine the ore than have it come from PvM or such.

I think it is better if new players see those chests and are told they can do something with it, just not as F2P, rather than nothing at all. Convenience and balance can be related at times. Not being able to do everything in a single location is part of the areas design to get you to go elsewhere. It is similar to adding GE access to all banks with the Trading Post; it is a convenience thing, but it has deeper impacts on the game than just a QoL change. Stuff like Firemaking X and Drop X would also be great conveniences, but probably not very balanced. If there was a furnace in the Dwarven Mines, it would be much quicker to mine, smelt, and smith items there was would make it far better than the other mines, which is a balance thing.",1451607217

""Implicitly, however, Wolin's book also raises a very troubling question. The eminent philosophers that Heidegger's children became consciously attempted to reject Heidegger's philosophy but failed.""

I'd probably disagree with this characterization in the case of Levinas, especially in light of this book on the subject:  Between Levinas and Heidegger  https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/55699-between-levinas-and-heidegger/  

I've always understood Levinas as replying to Heidegger, accepting some of his framework but questioning some of his conclusions.

Polysorbate 80 has been found to negatively affect the immune system and cause severe anaphylactic shock which can kill. According to Annals of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Volume 95, Number 6, December 2005 , pp. 593-599(7), ""it is of current relevance as a 'hidden' inductor of anaphylactoid reactions"", and ""Polysorbate 80 was identified as the causative agent for the anaphylactoid reaction of nonimmunologic origin in the patient. The study included a pregnant woman who suffered anaphylactic shock after being given a IV drip of multi-vitamins containing polysorbate 80. In addition to this, there have been studies in Food and Chemical Toxicology which showed that Polysorbate 80 causes infertility. Baby female rats were injected with polysorbate 80 at days 4-7 after birth. It accelerated the maturing of the rats and caused changes to the vagina and womb lining, hormonal changes, ovary deformities and degenerative follicles. According to the World Intellectual Property Organization, which is part of the United Nations, scientists from the organization are developing vaccines specifically to damage fertility as a method of contraception. A suggested ingredient for the vaccine is Polysorbate 80 (also known as tween 80). As it is a preferred ingredient, scientists are obviously aware of its ability to cause infertility.

The bottom line is that nobody actually knows what causes Autism yet, and if they did, we'd know they did, know what caused it, and know who's working toward a cure or preventative.

We do! There is already a good understanding of what autism is and how to treat it. Autism is heavy metal and chemical poisoning of the brain. I'll let the MIT scientist explain:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3P6wVUH0pc[1]  

Chelation therapy is an effective treatment/cure of autism and has been reversing the symptoms of autism for thousands of kids all over America. Proof:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx_ZCNpu_z4[2]   Wonder why we haven't heard much about Chelation out of the mainstream media huh?

Ever heard of Dr. Bradstreet? He was all for vaccines until his son got autism from one. Instead of going on TV, he doubled down on his research and came up with an effective Chelation therapy that he had begun giving to hundreds of autistic kids. He reversed many of his sons symptoms and his practice was just beginning to take off in a big way.

several weeks ago he was found dead in a river with a gunshot wound to his chest. Of course he committed suicide though right? (right as he had made the biggest breakthrough in his life's work). His family says he would never have committed suicide. Funny how that works isn't it?

&gt;Yes, abortion providers were upset at the idea that they should be made to provide certificates related to abortions that document the death of an unborn human following an abortion but is this extreme? To recognize that a death did take place? There was no obligation placed on the mother, only on the physician in charge. But instead, women are denied opportunity for a certificate that recognizes the death of their unborn child.

This is completely wrong. Just dead wrong. Cook added miscarriage reporting to the legislation; which had a requirement that miscarriages had to be reported by a doctor. This is abnormal, and was in line with what Phill Kline did a few years ago when he tried to go through records to prosecute clinics.. and got his law license revoked. Remember that? http://www.counterpunch.org/2014/05/02/supreme-court-upholds-disbarment-of-anti-abortion-kansas-ex-ag-phill-kline/  He wanted to use records to backtrace events. Now, you have a senator who has openly said this can help slow abortion and she wants mandatory reporting of miscarriages. Many women go through miscarriages, having a public record required to be taken for a miscarriage is just nonsense.

The case against Osawatomie is related to rape. Rape. Or, maybe I guess it could be linked to the case where Brandon Brown was released early and went out and beat Jerry Martinez to death. Google that one. Osawatomie's entire case is what the hell the state - which runs the hospital - was going to do about cleaning up the facility which has been cited several times for failure of compiance with safety and security protocols, and it certainly -does- fall to that body, as Pilcher Cook herself noted they would bring the issue up later. If she doesn't have any authority to oversee it as a chair of the health committee, then why is Jim Denning, her co chair (another Republican) urging significant changes to come FROM her committee?  Are we living in Bizzaro world or did Bruffet just go address them for no good reason at all.

It's funny that we think of things as ""belligerent"" or ""not belligerent"".. I remember Mary getting so belligerent with MCO providers during the budget conference that she stormed out of a sub-committee meeting after yelling at them.. and in that case, she most definitely did yell.

Or, when she tried to ban surrogate pregnancies and got up to bash advocacy groups who brought grandparents and straight couples to testify.

She's certainly a peach. If she's your cup of tea, go campaign for her.
