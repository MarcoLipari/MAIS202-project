"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Regarding quantum mechanics... everyday life operates as a continuum. Take driving for example. As you drive out of your driveway, beginning at 0 mph, you accelerate to 1 mph, 1.5 mph, up to the speed limit, let's say 35 mph. Inevitably, you reach all speeds in between zero thirty-five, even if it's just for a moment in time. You can apply this to position, where if you move from your front door to the driveway, you essentially occupy every bit of space in between the two locations. Hopefully you see how the continuum applies to our everyday lives, in the sense that there is a continuos ability for different quantities and values to exist.

Now, as physicists began to study our everyday life very closely, at the atomic and sub-atomic levels (electrons, photons, and other tiny particles), they began to unveal quantum mechanics, or a complete divergence from this ""continuum."" For example, if you study the energy of an electron, it can only posses VERY PARTICULAR, quantized values. I am not knowledgeable on values and scales, but let's say an electron has 6 units of energy and it gets excited to the next energy level, which just happen to be 10, it CANNOT occupy or possess 7, 8, or 9.5 units of energy. It can only possess the quantized values, decided by nature/physics!","1396310400"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","You are indeed correct, the speed gained and lost in the maneuver is indeed equal however only in the frame of reference of the planet the maneuver is around.

From the frame of reference of the planet, the object/spacecraft approaches your planet, swings around it, the flies off at the same speed. 

From the frame of reference of say the sun or some other ""Stationary"" observer, we see the planet has a velocity of its own! The spacecraft approaches the planet, swings around, then is flung off in the direction of the planets motion ( or thereabouts ) with the same speed Relative to the planet it had originally. In doing this it has actually ""Siphoned"" off some of the planets momentum ( Though like most things we do to planets it's completely unnoticeable from the planets point of view ). 

This can of course work both ways, and a gravity boost or ""assist"" can also be used to slow a spacecraft if we come at it from a different trajectory, a process used in probe missions to the inner solar system. In these cases probe is thrown ""Behind"" the direction of the planets motion, and loses some of it's speed relative to the sun.

Gender issues has literally nothing to do with skepticism and shouldn't have anything to do with it either. It's a misplaced and misguided movement. And if you can't take people being mean to you on the internet, there's a simple solution: get off it. Acting like you're the only person who receives threats or has people writing profanity to them is ridiculous; every major youtuber experiences it, and it isn't a gendered issue. Trying to turn it into a space where people can only say things that you want them to is a doomed effort.

The thing is, I really don't like Rebecca Watson at all. She isn't a very good skeptic and uses her status to basically try to make as much money off of people as she can, like she did with that ""kit people can use to test for genetic disease"".

I think that if you don't want to have a child, you shouldn't.  I would force myself to go through the pain of placing the child up for adoption rather than raise a child for 18 years.  When you say you can't justify a termination in your heart  you need to consider if its because you believe the embryo doesn't deserve to be aborted or if its because you don't deserve the abortion.  Its foolish to go through a pregnancy because you think you don't deserve an abortion because your situation isn't compelling enough.  If you genuinely believe that an fetus is a human life, that is one thing (and it is a position I can respect), but right now its an embryo. 

Maybe the question to ask yourself is how would you feel if you had a miscarriage...

Edit: and I'm sorry in advance if I offended you or didn't seem supportive enough, but honestly my first reaction is that you can do so much more if you're not a teen Mom.  Please don't keep a pregnancy just because.","1396310405"

Saying things like ""the gay community is only for those with sexual value"", ""gay death is 25"", ""gays are having sex at 15, used up and worthless by 30"", and so on shows you have no idea what you are even talking about. Playing off of stereotypical fallacies does not make you sound logical. It makes you sound ridiculous.

And what's up with the whole ""child"", ""kid"" and ""kiddo"" thing? You sound not only incredibly patronizing but also majorly creepy. Do you really think this sub is a bunch of 18 year olds?

You aren't alone because you're ugly, out of shape, whatever it is you always complain about. There is no ""normals vs others"". There are plenty of ugly and/or fat dudes getting laid regularly or in happy relationships, even in the gay community. Your accusations of shallow-mindedness just show how horribly shallow you are yourself.

You are alone because you're pathetic and insecure, patronizing and arrogant. Your physical characteristics are far less unattractive than your personality seems to be, I don't care if you are maimed, burned and disfigured.

This is **exactly what would happen in a completely free-market utopia the ""libertarians"" espouse so much.** The biggest and least ethical overpower all. Koch mantra, and their the biggest wealthy scumbags, barring Murdoch and his ilk.

[What is currently in New London?](http://www.ij.org/kelo-v-new-london) How did the government protect the people from the corporations that abused them? But the problem isn't the government, it's that money/power/influence from corporations have infiltrated the government. Government is supposed to make it a level playing field, to oppose corporate power, allow capitalism and cometition to flourish, *but not dominate with monopolies.* Not turn into a crony capitalistic nightmare like it has for the last 30-40 years [as the average wages have stagnated.](http://www.american.edu/cas/economics/pdf/upload/2012-1.pdf) Eminent Domain used to be used for *public* projects, roads, libraries, schools; now its used to increase the tax base for a community, by giving property to rich interests against the current population.

This is the only official way the plane tells people where it is.  This did not go off anymore about an hour into the flight.  So that means that all the evidence they have is from things that were not designed to tell us where that plane was going.  

So they figured out it could have gone only two ways, north or south, and it probably didn't go north because it would have been caught on *somebody's* radar.  So they figured it went south and is therefore near Australia.

If it *is* in that area, the reason they haven't found it is because

1. It's really far out in the middle of nowhere, which means it takes forever to get there to search, and there aren't that many fishermen in that area to help out.

2. It's a REALLY big area

3. It's also a really stormy area, so that means that the debris likely is all over the place.

Also, when they released GoldSrc, the showed it off with Half Life, when they released Source, they showed it off with Half Life 2, so it only makes sense that they're going to release Half Life 3 along with source 2.

They can't just release HL3 without source, so once we see the release of Source 2 coming, I'm sure Half Life 3 will be right along with it.","1396310411"

As for secondary suites, I don't think there's a uniform objective acceptance on that issue yet. Property taxes are increasing, but ""sky high"" is a subjective term particularly for people who move here from certain cities where taxes are higher and don't get you nearly as much. The blue ring... I don't like it either, but we know who to blame for that one, right? Which is to say the people responsible for allocating the budget and selecting the artwork. But... whatevs.

As for nobody outside Calgary giving... well... I'm not saying he's universally beloved, but there are two mayors that Canadians from coast to coast are familiar with and Nenshi is one of them. In that side-by-side comparison, he's often thought of as the one you'd want to have as mayor.

I get it. I get what you're saying and I like it when people express their opinions. But can you explain your claims? The ones about his ""lying ass,"" and him being a ""fake and a fraud"" so that I can get more into this discussion?

1. Healing is much more engaging than in previous mmo's
2. Not sure i understand the question. The game doesnt reward tanks or healers more than dps. But id assume queue times are faster.
3. Dont know if its boring, but id doubt it. They have more vital roles, so yes there is more pressure.
4. If someone leaves in the middle of a run, you requeue, just like wow. Takes longer to replace tanks and healers.

Telegraphing.

1. Yes
2. allies 1 color, enemies another
3. yes
4. Im looking at the floor, and my abilities bar, and the bosses hp bar. All three will be in a more convenient location when the new ui is released this month. Ive gotten used to it already, its not annoying.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","**How do I feel?** A lot better if they make the playoffs, but in general I really like the fight I'm seeing in this club of late and it seems they are finally buying in to Mike Brown's system. To even be in contention for a playoff spot with as bad as they played to start the year is amazing.

**Like to see?** The Cavs figure out what they want to do in the front court. Small forward needs to be addressed through trades/free agency/draft, but power forward is an enigma. Thompson has proven to be a double-double guy, but only by default of eating minutes - and that is roughly 30 min a night to get 11 and 10. Brown has horribly misused Bennett up to this point (been injured for quite some time now) and needs to see the floor so we can see what he is capable of. That will give him some consistency and if he can start knocking down jumpers the floor spacing will be that much better. That leads me to center. Cleveland needs to sign Spencer Hawes long-term immediately. The guy is a defensive liability, but he can shoot/score and his ability to space the floor has opened up the offense dramatically.

**What didn't I like?** In a nutshell: Andrew Bynum, players not buying in to Brown's system, Waiters NOT STARTING FOR GOD KNOWS WHAT REASON, media making drama about 'locker room' stuff that doesn't exist and Kyrie being uphappy, ill-timed injuries, and the fact our front office is letting LeBron's impending decision effect our future.

""he said this route of exposure could make it harder to contain and to track the outbreak, because it was not concentrated in any one social or cultural circle, as contagious diseases often are.""

This is in the link to the article about the New York City outbreak. Seems the evil vaccine dodgers were not to blame in this case. It may have been other non vaccines people. Or perhaps the high numbers of immigrants had something to do with it. However the entire article leads you to believe that the schools with people that are not vaccinated are the cause of the outbreak. It appears this is not the case. So basically it is a fear mongering piece to demonize those that refuse vaccines. While I personally am vaccinated, and will choose to vaccinate my own children I also respect the fact that some do not want to, and it is not my right to force them to do so. I know it is dangerous, and risks the health of a the sickest in our population, but its a dangerous world. They are all still at a far higher risk of getting sick, or being killed by thousands of other things. Don't get me wrong it is something we need to educate people about, but we cannot force them to do it either way. 

 What I don't like is that the lobby for vaccine manufacturers and those that stand to make a lot of cash are out there pushing stories like this that seek to make my mind up for me, and make me believe that we should mandate vaccines. Of course I am not that gullible, but the point is we have a government that spies on our every action, thought, and written word. A congress that does nothing but serve its rich masters. A media that seeks to forward that agenda, all the while trying to influence the way we think about issue. Particularly ones that make the machine a lot of money. I am not ok with all of that. I am not doing anything wrong so I do mind you looking. I am a living breathing person, a corporation is not. This government derives its just power from the consent of the governed. Not the crown, and certainly not the corporation. I am an adult, I can think for myself, make my own decisions and weigh my own risks. I do not need the government or the corporate machine to do my thinking for me or to influence my decisions. ","1396310415"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Here are teams that could use an upgrade at starting point guard:

Indiana Pacers - Cap space will be used on Lance Stephenson

Miami Heat - No cap space if the big 3 come back, Mario Chalmers will 
be a free agent

New York Knicks - No cap ever

Dallas Mavericks - Just signed Jose Calderon for 4 years, have 1st rounder Shane Larkin as backup

Sacramento Kings - Isaiah Thomas is a free agent, probably won't have cap space unless Rudy Gay opts out (lol)

LA Lakers - Have a hurting Nash, only have about 25 million to spend on everyone but Kobe, Nash, and Sacre

Milwaukee Bucks - Have Brandon Knight (8th overall pick from a couple years ago) + many much bigger issues to fill.

Orlando Magic - Jameer Nelson will (most likely) be a free agent, and will have lots of cap space. If they don't see Oladipo as their long-term option at PG, they look like the only real threat to sign Lowry.

TLDR - If Lowry wants to get paid and start, his only real options are Toronto and Orlando (Or a sign and trade of course)","1396310416"

Which part of the map is useless (Beach on South Coast)? Why is it useless? Where can you get firing lanes? Which spots are safe against different arty (Low arc vs high arcs). Making it a habit to sidescrape when turning a corner instead of just poking out. Learning not to side scrape when you have weak side armor, like the 50100's side gets overmatched by 120mm guns. Like Kraft said on another reply, you have to keep questioning yourself. Why are you doing this? Why aren't you? Is this the right decision? Keep doing it in the game and you'll start to understand more. Contrary to popular belief, unicums don't always rage. We just rage when pubbies refuse to learn.

If I'm a big ticket player looking to make a long-term investment, and I put in an order for 1M shares of company X, how does it benefit me for a HFT to see my order and immediately ""jump in front"" of it to jack up the price by half a point, anticipating my large future purchase?

If I'm a retail investor, and I'm paying a flat mark-up on all my market orders, how does that benefit me?

In Sweden, I spent 9 hours waiting in the ER with a fractured nose and jawbone. The insane pain was increased by the TV in the waiting room running a 9-hour Ellen DeGeneres marathon.

During this time, I counted 22 children who had stuck things up their nose with freaked out parents getting treated. I got to the ER at 10 am on a weekday, they could've just gone to a walk-in clinic (vårdcentral) OR a walk-in emergency clinic (närakut).

Then again, swedish healthcare might be tax-funded, but unless you are very severely injured, it's quality is appalling. There's two cases of misdiagnosed TBE, one case of borrelia in my social circle, thankfully these people left the country and went to Germany to get a second opinion before it was too late for them (one of them was close to death at that point).

That's the thing. You can't know if a person's guilty. It is impossible to know if a person is guilty before all the evidence is presented at trial (and even then, its still skeptical). Having presumptions of a person's guilt before a trial, and influencing your legal decisions of whether or not to protect them is unethical in my opinion. ","1396310433"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Again, it's difficult, since these situations often happen in places where the government is either very weak or, worse, supports the calls for violence.  In some instances, it's rather clear: a radio station urging for the deaths of Tutsi while a genocide against them is being carried out (or while they are being heavily persecuted) is crossing the line. This should be pretty evident to any impartial observer, but enforcement is likely to be the responsibility of the outside world.

Here's my greater view:

- Weak Government
  - No ability to prevent violence
  - Can call for international help (peacekeepers, election monitors) to enforce its rules.
  - **National *elected* governments can determine what the threats are, but these limits should be in line with international opinion**: it makes sense for Afghanistan to curb Taliban propaganda since a clear and present danger exists to national security, but neither Russia nor the US could legitimately curb communist, fascist, green, or libertarian ideologies, since public security is not threatened by them *at this time*. The only exception would be documents that directly call for violence: a neo-Nazi group does not have the right to publish a hitlist of enemies slated for execution, nor can it call for the deaths of specific people or groups of people.

- ""Bad"" Government
  - No willingness to prevent violence
  - International community needs to intervene in a *legitimate* way if it thinks the *costs are worthwhile*
  - What is the value of a human life, as measured in dollars, in U.S./NATO/Russian/AU/UN troops, or in the chance for improved regional peace?
  - **International community makes the call--this is not always effective, but don't underestimate the power of world opinion and the 'CNN effect'.  Also, this doesn't have to be the UN (SC or GA), Russia, or the US, but it will often be.**

- ""Normal"" Government
  - Willing to prevent violence
  - Able to prevent violence
  - NGOs, Foreign Govs, internal interest groups can urge the government to monitor the situation, but no action is needed.
  - **The national government gets to make the call, but it doesn't have a justification to ban materials since security isn't threatened**

I know I run the risk of being too pro-government and pro-international, something that isn't seen in a positive light here on Reddit, but so be it.

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","This seems a little harsh.

First, maybe what the poster meant isn't exactly the view you've described as ""all a matter of opinion"".  Often non-experts (and I assume the original poster isn't an expert) don't quite know exactly what they're trying to say when they ask these sorts of questions.  Maybe on reflection the poster would gravitate towards non-cognitivism or cultural relativism or Gauthier-style contractarianism or something like that, an anti-realist view that has garnered more professional support.

But, second, I'm a philosopher, and I take seriously the thesis that ethics is all a matter of opinion, even given your construal of that thesis (as saying that ethical claims can be true for some people but not for others).  Probably people who believe this view accept the consequence that most of ethical discourse is futile.  Trying to convince someone not to abort, on this view, is no more productive than trying to convince someone that chocolate is the best ice cream flavor.  That seems like a reasonable view, worth taking seriously.","1396310434"

I ended up getting the 6th overall pick in the draft.  The fucking Miami Heat somehow traded for somebody's lotto pick during the year, and they were slotted initially at 11th. 

During the actual lottery, however, instead of hitting the most likely outcome of 11th pick overall, they get 3rd overall. This is after an NBA title where the Heat beat the Rockets 4-3, and where LBJ, D Wade, and Bosh all signed back with the Heat.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I understand your point from a perspective of impact to the environment.  However, there are two aspects of whaling that I believe make it far different than other types of meat production:

* ecology goes far beyond type of whale selected.  For the health of any herd, care should be taken to choose what members of the herd are harvested.  Whaling simply culls all animals the whalers can reach.  Because whales will not leave other family members which are harpooned, entire family lines are eliminated, which is a problem for the genetic diversity (and thus longevity) of the herd.
* whaling is incredibly cruel in how the animals are harvested.  Imagine a cow being chased down by a jeep until it is exhausted, then shot with an arrow tethered to a cable.  Then imagine the jeep pulling the cow onto its side and dragging it by the arrow around the yard for 25 minutes, shooting it with a gun several times, before the cow finally drowns in its own blood.  All this after watching its calf die in the exact same manner beforehand.  I have seen firsthand, many forms of hunting and farming.  While there are many other issues in ""factory"" meat production, I have never ever seen anything which approaches this amount of animal cruelty.  I am especially concerned that we allow this to occur to a species as sentient as whales, one of the most sentient species on the planet, following humans.

An example from which I drew my analogy: (warning graphic - but shortened from it's original 25 minute length) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27nX3Dsv9Xk

Many other examples there, if you have the stomach for it.

Once you take into account the poor ecology of any whaling, the sentience of the species, and the way in which they are cruely harvested, it becomes clear that whaling is not simply the equivalent of any other meat production.  Whaling simply must be eliminated.","1396310440"

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Unfortunately a bunch of your issues are general problems with many consulting shops and with government work, and around DC that's almost all the available work.  A lot of consulting is not about successful projects in the end, it's about billing the client.  Amazing success now may actually get in the way of billing them next year - if you keep a man from learning to fish, you can sell him fish forever.  I suspect that most customizable software is deliberately bad in raw form specifically to sell customization too, so you get to work with absolutely horrible products.  

And of course selling to the government is selling to a customer who doesn't want to spend more than they are authorized and wants to get exactly what is in the spec document... and that is more important than success or usability because if they deviate or spend more the press and the public will eviscerate them, whereas if they fail according to plan that's too boring for anyone to notice.

There is a lot of better software development out there, but it is in companies where the software is the product, not the ongoing ability to bill more hours.

Going independent would be very, very hard without a set of contacts to get you started.  Do you have that set of contacts?  It is likely that you can't take any clients from your current company without someone getting sued.

Just because the key is now consumed, the lobby/session should not be dissolved. Instead drop everyone into a generic session where they can still chat, change loadouts etc. In fact, when doing stuff on the starmap, you can already have such lobbies. You pick what to do by clicking on something on the starmap. So put the void/derelict missions on the starmap as well! 

Whoever clicks first get a popup saying 'This will use up a &lt;mission&gt; key' (Yes/No). The lobby then changes background to the mission type, and the button at the top changes to ""Play Now"".

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The thing is,  the zany prompts are important.  Not just for a sense of levity, but as a challenge for writers.  This challenge lies in filling in the holes left behind by a simple ""what if,"" as you put it.  The ""what if"" question is akin to describing a new law of physics -you assume it just is.  But, this doesn't answer all of our questions as a reader. What does this law mean? How does it define the world around you? What limitations exist on this law?  

Consider the novel Warm Bodies.  Its plot boils down to ""zombie falls in love with a human,"" which is about on par with the writing prompts OP listed as being zany.  But the author doesn't just stop at that!  He takes care to define these zombies, gives them (ironically) life and culture. By the time we are introduced to the humans, we know how the zombies work, eat, hunt, live, we know almost everything about their existence.  He explores every nook and cranny of the implications of the existence of zombies, and we haven't even gotten to the meat of the prompt yet.  What follows from the world that the author built is a touching and deep story of love and the human spirit, and a cleverly hidden Aesop, if you interpret the zombies as an analogue of depression, or something similar.  All from a prompt that is, as OP put it, ""to silly to help us improve.""

So, basically, I'd like to play the Devil's advocate here, and say it is not the prompt, but the writer himself who presents himself the challenge.  It is not the integrity of the prompt, but the creativity of the writer that is being tested.  

It is not the prompt, but the writer who becomes a legend.  If you cannot spin a crazy ""what if"" into a plausible story, admit it to yourself, and TRY ANYWAY.  You might surprise yourself.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It surely couldn't be the fact that evangelicals have tried everything in their power over the past 40 years to crush out any and all they didn't like. The fact that people are starting to side with the oppressed instead of the oppressors doesn't mean they are being persecuted. Which leads me back to my original point. Fighting back and saying enough is not opressing christians. 

Edit: I want to add, just because people like gays more than christians, just shows that people are becoming more tolerant of those different from them. The reason christian popularity is going down, is because they insist on ruling everybody else's lives bacause they don't agree with it. I see laws against my marriage in state constitutions based on nothing more than 'jesus thinks it's icky'. More and more, states are trying to codify bulling of gays (or other minorities) based on nothing but 'jesus thinks it's icky'. Christians love to come out with 'divine punishment' speeches when a bird farts the wrong way. When there is a hint of a fraction of this sort of hate becoming law against christians, then they can cry persecution. People leaving the religion and supporting equal rights is nowhere near the definition of persecution, and crying that it does shows everyone how childish and hateful people of the faith can be.

That was the only time you could perform stuff as epic was what the LA did in the trailer...
Now you can't...

Reason number 3? Strategy? MY Petunia's!!! They've been promoting Zerging ever since the lattice system was implemented... Zero strategy is necessarily required, the largest outfits just throw corpses into the meat grinder until it finally jams or runs outta fuel.  

Number 4
Technically you can, but many who choose not to and only play infantry are for some reason consistently given more and more ways to easily kill the people who choose to fly or drive...
And never take into account the balancing that is RESOURCE COSTS and timers....


Night fights aren't rave parties...
This article highlights nothing that is actually good about the game...

There are a few things left good about the game. But it seems the devs plan to grind that out too....

Maybe My faith will be restored if they undo the damage they've done to the airgame. and Fix the harasser.   

Supposedly they are going to fix the harasser. Probably in the worst way possible...

Jenn Fang decided to analyze the tweet out of context, breaking down the history of the phrases ""Orientals"" and ""Ching Chong"", and then deemed the tweet racist. She says ""the tweet appears in the absence of the satirical context"", but 1) it's from the Colbert Report, so it should automatically be assumed to be a joke, and 2) can't put full context in 140 characters.

Britney Cooper also did the same, saying ""Colbert’s bit communicated absurdity but also seemed to suggest that all Asians really do speak this way."" Well, if she watched the entire segment, she'd know the line does *not* suggest all Asians speak that way. Her article also smacks of racism, saying that due to Colbert's whiteness, his statements should attract greater scrutiny. She also wonders why black people defend Colbert, as if all black people should think the same, even though she goes on to say ""we never get to tell the harmed group what the proper response to racial injury should be"".

She does mention that if Colbert used the N word instead, the outrage would be greater, and that's probably true. But, of course, there are folks in high places (Sharpton, Jackson, et al.) and large foundations (NAACP) whose support relies on the eradication of the use of the N-word, regardless of context, especially when used by non-black people.

------------------------

Really, you can strip Colbert's entire segment down to just ""The term 'Redskins' is just as offensive as 'Ching Chong', and here's how"". Colbert just used an example employing comedy, and Suey Park and everyone just went nuts.","1396310453"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Different frequencies and modulation schemes.  Lower frequencies travel farther and take more interference to disrupt.     
     
AM (amplitude modulation) radio operates at 535-1605 kilohertz, and though it's modulation is fairly simple, it's a bit prone to random noise interference.     

FM (frequency modulation) radio operates at 87.5-108 megahertz.  Higher frequency means shorter wavelength, which will ultimately mean less distance.  It also doesn't pass through barriers as well as AM, if I remember right.
     
Cellular probably uses QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation) which is really complex, is easy to disrupt with interference, but has throughput far beyond AM and FM.  Also, cellular companies operate between 800 megahertz and 2.5 gigaherts, which is going to have a much shorter wavelength than the other two, which will keep it from traveling as far.","1396310454"

The estimate suggests an average fulltime wage earner, who by then will be earning $112,000, will have to pay 28 per cent in tax, up from 23 per cent now. 

The calculation, released by Treasurer Joe Hockey on Sunday, assumes the government would do nothing about so-called fiscal drag, in which more taxpayers are bumped into higher tax brackets due to inflation or wage gains. Mr Hockey warned that without dramatic policy changes to the budget, spending will outpace government tax receipts every year over the next decade, leaving the budget in deficit for a record 16 straight years.""

"Feminism","t5_2qr7i","I think that calling this conversation a deterrent is just as big of a problem as the original issue itself. Is it SO hard to write female characters that aren't either damsels, hypersexualized, or both? I would argue no, since it has been done successfully before, just not that often. Maybe the marketing teams are to blame, but that's not an excuse to defend the status quo. If writing female characters with agency, actual personalities, who are more important than just being eye-candy is SO hard for some of these developers and writers, then that is a huge problem.

The fact that the bald white straight male is considered a ""blank slate"" is a HUGE issue too. That's part of the entire problem -- straight white dudes are considered the default human being and everyone else is lumped into the ""other"" category. That in itself is sexism (and racism), whether it's intentional or not! And on that note, sexism is not always intentional. There are plenty of racist, sexist, homophobic, etc. people who don't realize that they are racist or sexist or whatever. On top of that, there are plenty of people who are generally not sexist but still are capable of sexist actions. I'm not arguing that most game developers are intentionally and/or maliciously sexist or racist. I've never spoken to any of them and I can't know their intentions. But what I can speak for are the results I see, and believe me, it gets really tiring when almost every game I pick up has at least one female character who is a useless damsel or is gratuitously scantily clad.

A lot of people use war games as their go-to defense for the White Bald Straight Marine character trope. Because in war games, that archetype makes most sense. But other types of games, not so much.","1396310460"

If you are consuming a deficit of calories, your body will extract the calories from your body (e.g. fat and muscles) in a hierarchal fashion. If you consume excess calories (regardless of the macro nutrient they come from) your body will store them as fat. Protein is popular because of the generally accepted importance it has in muscle building. When you work out, you do tear your muscles. Your body needs energy to rebuild them. Protein plays an important part in this rebuilding process; however, carbohydrates play an important role as well. It is very important to eat following a workout, so your body obtains adequate macro nutrients to begin the rebuilding process.","1396310462"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I completely agree with you, but from a mid lane Nidalee point of view. From what you said, there is no advantage picking her over other supports and over mid lane. If you want to debuff the tanks, get Sona (her passive has a percentage damage reduction and if you need to melt tanks you probable have an ADC that can do that with the right peel which Nidalee can't provide). If you need heals for days, you get Soraka. If you want the atk speed steroid, you get Nunu (which can also slow the bruiser and give movement speed). The only thing she does that other supports don't is the poke, but as a support you probably won't have much AP and your spears won't do any significant damage, as the ADC can just lifesteal your damage. If you really need poke comp, by all means go ahead and pick Nidalee, but take her to the mid lane. If you have a poke comp, you probably also have a Caitlyn on your team, which needs the peel from her support as her mobility is really limited to her 90 Caliber Net, so Lulu, Janna or Nami would be a much better support pick, as they have outstanding disengage, peel and sustain, which is everything a poke comp needs.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Well.. sorry to bust your bubble but typical alignments, in any system, are based on intent, not actions. If you do something on accident, but your intent was good... you aren't an evil person for it.  Doesn't really help you, but just saying.  If I was told that some liquid would save someones life, did it, and the person instead turned into some kind of demon. And then the GM ""punished"" (how I'd see it) me with an ""alignment shift"" or something like that, I'd get really pissed.  I would have atoned for the mistake anyway.  Mistake does not equal evil.

Typically what you're looking at is the concept of ""putting up with evil for the greater good."" Paladins sort of have this ""clause"" built in so they can keep their alignments while doing ""mean"" things or ""working with evil"", as to not completely exclude them from that.

I'd try using some kind of demon pact(s) in order for them to accomplish some goal.  Or working with underground guilds to ""root out"" evil but end up creating space for a greater evil to take a stronger foothold.  

Like a guy that was in the underground, but opposing some external takeover of the underground. Like a chaotic neutral guild in a good city, but an evil guild from an evil country is trying to expand it's territory, like slave trade, into this city.  But the current underground leader is preventing it. The PCs are influenced to take out the current bad guy (not knowing of the second) because of his thieving or something.  Then finds out that they simply put a greater evil in power (who they were working for). But again, this is all deception. Not really what you want.


I would say your BEST bet... is to do exactly like walter white did. Pick something that's small, that gives HUGE benefit. Something they can't ignore. Then have that thing threatened, so they are forced to do crazy things to protect it.  It has to build up slowly, then something large and crazy has to happen. ","1396310464"

They must have done that since MoP came out. I know they cut the leveling significantly, but Northrend was still exponentially slower than Outlands. 

&gt;Its a total cakewalk. another 8 hours and you can hit 60 without breaking a sweat.

Aaaaaaand there it is. People who will exaggerate and brag about how fast they can level like it's some sort of competition. Ah, the good old days. ","1396310466"

&gt; At the Belgrade army hospital, casualties of Bosnian civil war are treated. In the hospital they remember their youth and the war. Two young boys, Halil, a Muslim, and Milan, a Serb, have grown up together near a deserted tunnel linking the Yugoslav cities of Belgrade and Zagreb. They never dare go inside, as they believe an ogre resides there. Twelve years later, during the Bosnian civil war, Milan, who is trapped in the tunnel with his troop, and Halil, find themselves on opposing sides, fatefully heading toward confrontation.

---

**Critical reception:**

&gt; The film won accolades for direction, acting and brutally realistic portrayal of the war in former Yugoslavia. It was also the first Serbian film to show the Serbian side of the conflict involved in atrocities and ethnic cleansing – the title of the film is an ironic comment on the protagonists' activities in a Bosnian village. (*Wikipedia*)

Hazard-Oscar-Willian

----Luiz--Ramires--

This is probably going to be the lineup because Eto doesn't play away from home, and he's injured. Willian on the right would be great for shutting down Lavezzi and his pace would help against their left back.  I would rather have someone else than luiz in the CDM spot because i'm afraid of his runs. Either Luiz he has a really good game, or a bad game. The backline is the same as always. Hopefully Hazard is going to have a good game, and can score a goal or at least set up a play.

My prediction Chelsea 1-2 PSG.

PSG on their good day can very easily score 2 goals. Hopefully we can come back on our homeleg and score a couple goals to proceed to the semi's","1396310469"

"LANL_German","t5_2rd5y","As others have said, *nach* comes before proper names while *zu* comes before other nouns.

*nach Europa* is fine.

I think of *nach* as meaning *after* or *toward*.

---

Another use of *nach* that kind of reveals its nature is this one:

*Sie ruft nach dir.* = She calls out to you.

---

*Nach* also means *according to*, for example when you are telling someone how a list is ordered.

*Diese Liste ist nach Datum sortiert.* = This list is sorted by date.

---

It's also pretty common in ""according to [person]"" phrases, such as:

*nach seiner Meinung / seiner Meinung nach* = according to him / his opinion

---

It's also a pretty common separable prefix that implies mimicry or after-the-fact action, like in these constructions:

*jemanden nachmachen* = to copy/imitate someone

*über etwas nachdenken* = to reflect on something, to think back on something, to contemplate something

---

It is also the preposition used in *nach etwas suchen*, meaning ""to look for something"".

---

Also, you can use it for ""like"" in statements like *Mein Wohnzimmer riecht nach Hunden* = My living room smells like dogs.

You have to learn to use your resources to maximum effect so that you dont die out of nowhere to a random threat you didnt expect, and so that you minimize the chance of being put in an awkward position by your opponent. Knowing what to play around in all of the popular decks is essential. Doing things like saving supreme verdict for their stormbreath dragon even though they have a strong board presence, or not playing Jace to keep up a counter for a certain sideboard card you know you cant beat can oftentimes change the outcome of the game.","1396310474"

If we lived in a world where we would need to be mindful of every little thing we say because it might offend somebody, there'd be a lot of problems, because a lot of things can be taken offensively, pretty much all over the place - in casual conversation, in advertising, whatever.

He's not saying ""we don't act like faggots"" or anything obscene like that, he's simply summarizing the way he acts in the best way he knows how. Reinforces stereotypes? You're gonna hate me for this, but those aren't going away anytime soon. Probably not even in our lifetime. Leave the man alone and let him describe his life in any way he likes. Just because you get offended doesn't mean fuck-all other than you should stop reading so deeply into trivial things and TRYING to be offended.

Seriously, what he said is so innocent that someone would have to deliberately try and read it as an offense in order to take it offensively, as it is not explicitly nor implicitly implied in any shape, form, or way. That's just being dramatic. Making a scene. Making the situation *about you*.

But really, Clannad isn't a sad anime. Yes, it definitely has sad moments, and I definitely did end up crying out of sheer depression of how fucking terrible some of the things that happened to Tomoya and co were. But it's not a tragedy, sadness is a part of all of our lives. 

And the flower field scene, while probably the most notorious for being the breaking point for most people to release the flood gates, is undeniably the happiest and most fulfilling moment of the whole show, among many other happy moments that made me teary eyed such as Kotomi's suitcase.

By adding mechanics to boss encounters that require support and roles other than full damage, you increase the occurrence of said builds without having any impact on other game modes, which with the current incoming nerf, WvW is getting hit in the back of the head with a metal bat. I don't see how adding mechanics would create more problems tenfold, except for the people that speedrun everything.

As for the current format for the season, there is absolutely no possible way that it is good for WvW, at least compared to last season. The format is made to completely ruin any server that is ranked 2nd or 3rd in their respective league. Last season's structure placed servers where they deserved to be, albeit with very little variance. ANet can come up with much better ways to make it possible for weaker servers to win.

That being said, every class would have to look at this if they were trying to dual spec.

You're right.  I was out of line and I apologize.

Thank you for overlooking it and responding to my main point.

I can say right off the bat that I wholeheartedly agree with you on points 1-6.

Point 7: It depends on what you mean.  I don't think that blanketly legalizing all drugs is a good solution.  It is only a matter of time until marijuana is legalized, so that issue has an expiration date on it, IMHO.

8 and 9 are decent ideas that are worthy of discussion.  Ten is an interesting idea, but it conflicts with number five, doesn't it?

In large, those are great ideas that would improve the system.  I would back political initiatives to implement many of those.  So how can we work toward getting these ideas put into place or brought out for more public discussion and debate?

And I can talk political theory for a very long time with someone who has interesting ideas and is also interested in civil debate and discussion.  You're going to have to type a WHOLE lot more before I give up and quit reading... ;-)","1396310482"

First off the ej205s (what is in the wrx) did not suffer from the headgasket issues the ej25d's and the ej251's suffered from.


You are considering a car which, historically speaking, will have been run hard. 

Before even trying to talk the owner down take it for an inspection. Get a compression and leakdown test so that you know the engine is solid.

If all of that comes back good and you feel comfortable with how everything drives I would pull the trigger. I don't know the area you are in but 5k seems like a reasonable offer (and most people post their ads on CL with the price they hope to get; they know odds are they will get less).

Now reasons you shouldn't get the WRX:

* You have a solid car and you have replaced everything on it. It should be good till 250,000 easily (providing you do the timing belt).

* The WRX is going to be much more expensive. Depending on how much you drive I would guess the timing belt will be due within a year. Quite possibly the suspension may be due for a complete renewal too.

* The WRX will average the same as your current car (if you're easy on the gas) but it uses premium (so take that into account). Oh but you will not be easy on the gas, believe me.

* You didn't mention if the WRX is modded or not but odds are it is; be careful poorly done mods will cost a fortune to fix.

* **YOU WILL GET THE MODDING BUG** There is no avoiding it; you will start to mod stuff slowly and it is like an infectious disease. 

* Your insurance will take a hike.


Don't get me wrong; WRXs are great cars, mine has been nothing but reliable, but there is the potential for it to be expensive.

Also if you're having to sell your Outback to get it I would recommend you save up a bit more.

Despite what some people have said ('you're a retard') for me saying this I still think it is good advice. 

* Be willing/able to spend half of the value of the car you are buying in the first year in maintenance. I am not saying you should be expecting to but if the need arises you should have options. It would suck to buy this only to have the transmission go and you no longer have a method of transportation and now you're stuck parting out the car so you can downgrade to a geo metro.","1396310487"

"army","t5_2qtr8","1-OCS is very hard.  It is literally physically hard and additionally, much of your ""warm up"" will be hard.  You go to standard basic first, and every drill who ever had a hard time with his CoC will know you are an OCS'er and ""take unique care"" of you.  Let it make you better. 
 
2-the army needs a few types of officer- if you have any language or med background there's still a home for you

3-idk

4-AFQT SCORES ARE VITAL.  Repeat: VITAL.  One more time: VITAL
the way the Big Army (NG is different) picks it's officers is like this: there is xyz slots available every year.  First pick goes to USMA grads.  Once they are ALL selected, ROTC grads pick.  Once THEY are all selected, OCS grads get to pick.  Which means BEST CASE you are picking what's ""left"" after the ""usual suspects"" have their picks.  Often, entire mos fields are gone.  (USMA is, at it's core, an engineering school.  They usually take all the engineering slots.  Also, INF is ""sexy"", so don't expect too many of those, either).
The actual classroom material of OCS isn't (or shouldn't be) super challenging for the top, say, 25% of any class.  Also, OCS is very physically tough, so by the end almost everyone is fightin' fit.  So really the ONLY shot you have at distinguishing yourself is the initial OCS fitness test.  OCS is long, but you barring a total eff-up, you are basically looking at the end results when you are looking at the beginning results.  I cannot stress this enough.
After, at the end, they create an ""order of merit list"", or OML.  Your PT scores and your academic scores are added up.  #1 gets first pick, #2 gets second pick etc.  Again, your BEST of often ONLY shot at getting an assured high spot on the OML is your initial PT score.
Additionally, once you get to your unit there is the expectation that you lead.  Effectively, this means there is an informal expectationt hat you will be 280+, irrespective of your MOS field.  It is very important to your career as an officer that you take fitness seriously.
Also, for many fields a 2LT basically gets no love without some go-fast.  If you are an 11,12, 13 or 19, expect a trip to ranger school (although anyone might get the nod).  Fitness will be the single best thing you can do to prepare.  Washing out will be an informal bad mark.
As for branch recommendations, I sincerely am not lying to you when I say as an OCS'er your goal should be to become an officer.  No one knows what there is for your class.  Some have all xyz, others have no xyz at all.  There is a huge element of luck.  OCS grads have little direct control over their field.  You can *influence* it, but if you are 100% set on a certain field or fields, you are in for disappointment.

I got a really nice mirrorball with cooldown reduction so i switched from a build using spectral blades and meteor shower to the one linked above. Right now my sheet dps is right under 700k but I have %fire damage on 4 pieces of gear, well bonuses to magic missile, meteor, and black hole, 36% elite damage, and 35% cooldown reduction to make up for it. Black hole is great for grouping up mobs and dropping a big meteor on them, and it's great when everything crits. I know I could switch to sparkflint and glass cannon over teleport and illusionist, but I like the mobility and the calamity stun helps control mobs and works great on bosses too.","1396310492"

 [**Practical joke**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practical%20joke): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __practical joke__  (also known as a __prank__, __gag__, __jape__ or __shenanigan__) is a mischievous trick or joke played on someone, typically causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort. Practical jokes differ from [confidence tricks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_trick) or [hoaxes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoax) in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being fooled into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes or pranks are generally lighthearted, reversible and non-permanent, and aim to make the victim feel foolish or victimised to a degree, but may also involve [cruelty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruelty) verging on [bullying](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullying) if performed without appropriate finesse.

"NewSkaters","t5_2tqri","I wouldn't call it ""talent"" but people have do very different physical reactions to fear and danger. Animals too of course, since we're big beer drinking animals after all. There's a thing they measure with animals called flight distance. Say you're walking slowly towards a bird or squirrel... how close will it let you get before it's survival instincts drive it to bail out of there? It's a slightly different distance for every individual. One squirrel is not born the same as another and their experiences further shape that. 

In skateboarding we face that same fight or flight moment every time we do something that could injure us, and each person experiences it differently. I do believe the guys who've gotten far in skateboarding are what you'd call ""outliers"" in this respect. If you could some how plot on a chart the intensity of each person's stress and fear when doing risky things they would be at the far end of the chart. The ability to remain clear and in control through moments that would stimulate a flight response in others may not be a ""talent"" but it's certainly important if you want to be a pilot, police officer, air traffic controller, or skateboarder.

People also have very different reactions to being injured. Some find it more upsetting than others and their confidence takes longer to heal than their injury. Others are able to lie to themselves more successfully and bounce back immediately. ","1396310494"

That's an odd preference, as serif fonts are known to be the [more legible](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/typographic-readability-and-legibility--webdesign-12211) and therefore appropriate for body copy (except when the fonts are scaled down, which does not apply to my site). 

Perhaps I will experiment with sans-serif, but then I'd have to change the title fonts to match, and the entire feel of the page is certain to change. Appreciate the feedback though.","1396310505"

"wicked_edge","t5_2s46m","Seems pricey to pay US$20 more just for a skull &amp; crossbones etching. Also, you want to be careful with the smooth-handled EJ (or rebranded) razors as they can be very slippery to handle while shaving. Most Muhle razors are also rebranded EJ razors. There are a couple of other brands (Baxter's comes to mind) that are also slightly modified EJ razors. They all have the same heads and all shave the same way. I would go with the cheapest Edwin Jagger that I liked the handle style of.

The heads of these razors are made from a zinc alloy, and zinc is a somewhat brittle metal. If you drop one of these razors they stand a good chance of breaking. This is true with many different brands of modern razors including Merkur, Pearl/RazoRock and others. That doesn't mean these aren't *good* razors, however like most things they just aren't made to be dropped.

If you are really worried about breaking your razor, you could get one made from better materials. [Weber razors](http://www.weberrazor.com/products) are highly regarded and made completely of stainless steel. [Ikon razors](http://www.maggardrazors.com/product-category/safety-razors/ikon-safety-razors/) are likewise made of stainless steel. [Feather](http://www.amazon.com/Feather-Stainless-Steel-Double-Shaving/dp/B004E5GV82) also makes a good stainless steel razor. Of course, you have to pay more to get such high quality razors. Compared to most razors these ones are 2-4 times as expensive.

You could also check out [Fatip razors](http://www.italianbarber.com/safety-razors?sort&amp;filter_id=202) which are more reasonably priced and made of plated brass so they should be very sturdy.

While there is absolutely nothing wrong with Edwin Jagger/Bluebeard/Muhle or Merkur razors, there are a lot of different options out there. You might want to see what is available before making a purchase.

BTW. Can you post photos of your dad's old razor?","1396310505"

The core of any good training routine is progressive overload - if you're not upping the amount you lift week to week you will stop gaining muscle in very short order, at which point you're just doing some incredibly inefficient cardio.

Also, that is a ridiculous number of exercises. There's no good reason to be doing that many different things, and the exercise machines are of questionable value anyway.

Realistically, yeah, Leona's burst is pretty good. Lissandra's is still better without ANY AP and it doesn't depend on help from her ADC (like Leona's passive). Yes, Leona is tankier but the point was that Lissandra has more damage. This also ignores the fact that Lissandra's Q can more than likely be thrown twice in an engage AND she has ranged AAs so she will probably get more AA damage/Q damage in as they run away. 

Also, everything Leona has is dependent on landing that E. If she doesn't land it, everything goes on CD and Leona has to wander around for 13 seconds. 

They're two different champions. I don't like Leona's all or nothing approach and I much prefer poking.

They were offering a way to put their games on Xbox One for exposure on a ""Big Three"" console. Offering it to people who got on the show because they are already in a position to get such a thing if they feel like it, because they are experienced enough with that kind of paperwork and networking and because Xbox One's program isn't even that restricted to begin with.

The only way I can explain this is that the people behind choosing the participant devs/youtubers and the people behind the rewards were two different parties that didn't communicate.

My goal is to not do it anymore, but my hard rule if I decide ""no no no I really want a pill this weekend"" is to think ""how long since my last one?"" and if it's been under 2 months, I don't let myself. I think I'll do better with abstaining now - My last time was the first time on lithium and I hardly felt it. I felt warm and fuzzy and had stronger than usual hallucinations but I didn't really ping hard. Then I spent the next week agitated, frustrated, crying and wondering why I was even bothering with life...

The place has 2 internal dns servers (one for each building, which are located across town from eachother).

I was poking around and noticed that internal DNS seems to resolve just fine, but external lookups have major issues. I looked around and found that each DNS server has only one forwarder set up, which happen to be eachother (DNS Server A has Server B set up as a forwarder and vice versa).

No. Rice and beans are still cheap and nutritious. Always have been. But when you give people free money to buy food they generally grab what they *want* instead of what they *need*.

"rawdenim","t5_2scl9","Soupy is a solid dude. In 2011, they were recording Suburbia in Orange County and they needed an electric they could borrow to toss around to record a song. He tweeted about it and being in the area, I offered up mine that I won on a Twitter contest the year before and never used (because I still don't know how to play.) He got back to me and let me know what the deal was. They were recording a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DBCgm5dNfA) and wanted it to sound like super pissed, as if they just threw all their equipment on the floor as the song finished. 

So I went up to the house they were staying at, dropped off my guitar, met a few of the guys and Charlie Saxton, and Soupy gave me some merch they had lying around in their van. The initial deal was 20 bucks to ""rent"" the guitar and they'd get it back to me before they flew out for tour a few days later. 

I ended up picking up my guitar from the No Sleep offices because the band had an early flight, and never got my money, haha. I didn't really care though, they signed the guitar along with Saxton and Steve Evetts, who produced the record and it now sits in my bedroom. Fast-forward to Warped that summer and Soupy and the guys were doing a signing. He saw me and remembered about the guitar and asked if I ever got the $20. I said no and he had me go to the dude who was selling merch for them and ask for $20. That got awkward but I got my money, haha.

Haven't met him since then, but I've seen The Wonder Years play probably around 10 times (since 2010) and they put on such an incredible show. The set they've been playing on this tour is so good, but nothing will top the shows they did for this album's release on that 4 shows in 24 tour thing, haha. I haven't listened to them a whole lot lately, but The Upsides will always be a special album for me. Regret selling my first press of The Upsides for like 10 bucks haha. ","1396310518"

*(Plus the designated bases from things like ""reinforcements needed"" and instant action.)*

That way you'd need to use vehicles to move platoons around the continent from the major bases, but you wouldn't find yourself in a situation where you can't get to the nearby hexes that need your help. It would be nice to see major bases with more importance since they would more often act as staging grounds for your assaults and defenses.

Series 5 was at the tail end of the circular arc since those cracks let the Time Lords through and Series 7 was the beginning since the Time Lords cajole the Silence to go back and explode the Tardis. Also, I think River Song was planned from the beginning since apparently Alex Kingston was told early on. 

There are a lot of things that were clearly improvised for the show like Amy and Rory's exit or even the way Clara's arc is planned since the real end result was just a lead into the 50th. However, the core of the arc over Moffat's run was definitely prepared for.","1396310521"

Use this to pin down a neighborhood and price that you can live with, keeping in mind commute, cost, safety, amenities, and so on. DC is very much a block-by-block type of city, and it changes fast, so advice from people who have not lived in DC in a few years is probably out of date.

What you should do from inside DC: Look at actual apartments, talk to roommates, etc.

At a minimum, I'd suggest doing your research, contacting a broker, and flying into DC for one weekend to look at a whole bunch of apartments. The brokered apartments will probably be a little pricier, but that's the cost of having limited time to find a place.

Another option would be to get an AirBnB for a week or two and use that time to search on your own. I can't really recommend apartment hunting without personally visiting the apartments and neighborhoods, however.","1396310522"

Okay well I tried very hard to be normal for a very long time so even now I'm mostly ""boy mode"". Not all trans people decide to get all Cinderella-ed up the moment they realize they are transgendered. 

For me until very recently I never wore any girl clothing...and I met my wife in high school when I thought trans people were just REALLY gross gay men that were so gay that they needed to wear tu-tus. So due to that stereotype whenever I had those ""I think I might hate being a guy"" thoughts I would try to kill them as much as possible.

TLDR : I looked and acted like a dude when I met her. Though since all my other girlfriends turned out to be lesbians I guess I didn't do a very good job of it.","1396310523"

The problem here is that we, as humans, will have an immune response to the horse immunoglobulin and upon any second encounter will probably have serum sickness. Meaning we can only use this drug once per patient and only as long as the immunoglobulin is reactive to the predominant C. prefringens strain. This is a great approach and we one like it in the US to target tetanus toxin... unfortunately it does have serious draw backs and is of very limited use if you have subsequent infection.

&gt; Is Broadwell going to see significant performance increase or will it just be lower power consumption/heat?

Intel follows a [tick tock cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_Tick-Tock) where the ""tick"" is big performance gains and ""tock"" is optimization.  Haswell was the tock to Sandy Bridge where we saw big optimization in power consumption with a slight performance increase.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; Down 60% from ATH, harsh IRS tax guidelines, pending China ban, 9-week decline

&gt; Sounds like stability and endurance to me!

Nobody can stop it - it is the same as BitTorrent. And - look at the bigger picture - 1, 2, 3 years.

&gt; How can you type that out as a genuine argument when people have lost millions in BTC already

This is because of two things. First, some people do not mind risking &amp; losing thousands of bitcoins. Second, Bitcoin is so new that people do not know how to handle it - partly because the bad false security habits they have from the current system. It is the same think like if you give a knife to the child for the first time...

&gt; My money hasn't lost 50% because it's been in interest-earning bonds and savings accounts. Sorry that you are keeping yours under your mattress or something.

So you do not have money, you have something else. ...and the money you had was losing value in the hands of some other poor guy somewhere (who probably took a loan to survive). Your bonds and savings accounts are not declining because their price is fueled by the cheap printed money. Banks do not put the money where it can help (like investing into infrastructure, R&amp;D, small companies etc.) - they buy stocks with it. Inflation that should help people is in fact fueling the stock bubble that will burn many people again.

&gt; Funny enough, if this was a month ago you'd probably be talking up Neo &amp; Bee and how great that'll be.

I put 20 BTCs into NeoBee shares and I am glad that there was somebody who was bold enough to try new things, someone who was committed to educating people about current financial system and the new options we have thanks to technology. Are those bitcoins lost? I think not.","1396310532"

I don't think our fullbacks are up for it, our wingers are alright (but IMO not good enough for 4-3-3), and we don't have enough central midfielders for a 4-3-3.  You'd need 2 DM's, and 4 CM's, which we just don't have.  Mind you I'm going by the whole ""2 players per position"" rule here, but that's generally a good rule to follow if you want your squad to last a full season.

Plus we've sort of set up everything so that Defoe and Gilberto could play up front together.  Gilberto is a DP striker, we wouldn't want him to be playing as a winger or sitting on the bench.

4-4-2 is not a child's formation or whatever, it can be very effective.  And this is only my opinion, but I think it works best against the sorts of teams we'll be facing in the MLS.  We've also sort of set ourselves up for 4-4-2 - we basically have 2 players per position.","1396310540"
"orangered","t5_2qltw","Cons: paying. It's not fair to you to have to pay for it. I know you've said  you're willing to, but it still isn't fair to put that on you. Besides, what if you happen upon hard times and can't pay anymore? We have to switch to someone else who might not be as willing to pay. I'm just not comfortable with the idea.

paying: you also need to be a premium member to adjust the settings for the game (including choosing the map, adding a game password, etc.). We would need more than one premium member to be able to set up a game for each sector.

randoms: I don't know how, but we've had private games with random people in it. I don't get it, but it has happened.

chance: there is an element of chance in atWar games that some people may not like. It's not immediately obvious when playing, but there is a ""crit. hit"" stat. It's really uncommon, but it's still there.

map designing: Revan has already designed a chroma map. No offense to him, but it's not amazing (not bad at all, rev, I do really enjoy playing on it when I get the chance. It's just not amazing), and it still seemed like it took him a while to make it. Now, you're  talking several sectors per territory. We've got what, 30 territories? A conservative estimate puts that at 150 *unique* maps that need to be made. *By the premium member(s) only!*

Ranks: atWar uses a ranking system. only levels 1-5 are allowed to play on 'beginner' games. I've been playing for a bit, and am level 3. Someone who hasn't played before is going to start at lvl 1. What happens when I get to 6? Do I not get to play? Do I not get to use the account with my name on it? If enough people get to 6 and we decide to all switch to the 'normal' server, how do new players join? Work for a month before *finally* getting to join? Nobody's going to do that and atWar isn't popular enough for us to be finding people who are already level 6 that want to join our game.

I like the ideas. I really do. But they still need to be refined.

My advice is to network. I promise you that there is someone outside of your current social group that is delightful and would love to be an actual friend to you. I drifted away from that first group once I realized how ridiculous it was for me to subject myself to that crap, tried spending time with others. Most of them didn't work out either. My Junior year, my best friends were actually seniors and sophomores. I avoided trying to join cliques from my own grade level, because every year I had classes with those people, and none of them ever made an effort to be friendly to me. I made some great friends when I got my first job too. 

So TL;DR, find new friends. In my experience, the easiest way was to befriend people from other grade levels or through work. ","1396310541"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I live in the largest city in my state and Sprint gets horrible service here. I used to have a no-contract Verizon phone which was fine before internet but now due to my job I need a smartphone and I chose AT&amp;T. 

I paid $200 for the smartphone that I wanted right when it came out 2 years ago.  My best friend and I are on the same phone plan to save money, and we constantly switch plans based on our needs. We pay $80/month each and are on a 2 year contract.  If I were paying for my phone monthly, I would be paying $8.30/month. 


If we were to switch to T-Mobile (I WILL NOT switch to Sprint obviously) we would pay $70 each without a contract for the same plan. However, in order to have the same phone, they want me to pay $27.50/ month for it. So I would be paying $98/month.

I save $10/month by signing a 2 year contract and being able to put down $200 for a phone right away instead of paying for it over time. In 2 years I save $240, am on a network with great LTE service, and have the phone that I want.","1396310544"

Of course, I wouldn't mind if they went completely fantastical, to the same extent, or greater, than the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but if they go historical, the Barbary Coast is the ticket. However, if they decide to use the spinoff series to focus on naval combat in general, rather than just piracy, there's an even greater pool of potential historical candidates to use.","1396310547"

There was an article in Toronto Life last year (or maybe the year before) called Fortress York and it talked about how the school appears to be a breeding ground for sexual assaults. York responded not by doing anything to combat the violence but by trying to sue the magazine for libel (I'm pretty sure it was thrown out).

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Atleast where I come from, when licensing your music you end up with a certain share of the total income, depending on what you have actually done in the process. For example, our singer writes all the lyrics, and sometimes comes with ideas for arrangement;

 According to the recommendations from the Swedish organization ""STIM"" who are in charge of this, that would grant her 50% just for writing the lyrics, and the other 50% is split between the 6 of us (note that our singer will get a share of this 50% aswell), and that leaves her with 58,3% of the income and the rest of us with 8,3% each. 

Your argument seem to be more of you feeling like you should get more because you do more in the band? I get that, but I really think that you should take that separately if possible, because the licensing of songs should never be affected by anything else than the process during wich the songs where made.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Yes, and it's a good example of the mechanics. A trait that is favored grows in a population through a combination of death of the unfavored and more trait-having members living to mate. Once the  pressures are removed, the percentage of trait-havers will neither grow nor shrink. If the trait becomes a liability, the trait-havers will die off quickly or slowly, depending on how severe the trait is. Take for example the bubonic plague. During the plague, some people were genetically immune, the plague simply didn't work with their bodies. IIRC, the combination of deaths and immunity led to some 20-30% of Europe's population being immune. Once the plague ran its course, the pressure was gone, the immunity was neither favored or unfavored. The human population exploded in the eras after, immune and not, and now only a few percent of the population of northern Europe (and sparsely amongst the colonized parts of the world) have these genes, all direct descendants of the immune. They neither became the majority because the pressure killed everyone else, nor were they weeded out because the immunity was a liability with no pros to overcome the cons. If, like sickle cell anemia (which makes you immune to malaria), it came with complications and side effects that were detrimental or deadly, they would've been slowly been eradicated over the course of a few generations.

I don't know how many of the essential amino acids are found in plants, but meat is a good way to get enough quickly and easily.

&gt; our brains take up a LOT of the calories we eat

Yes. Like &gt;25%, I think. It's interesting because I lead a fairly sedentary lifestyle, and I lose weight if I don't consumer &gt;3500 kcal/day. Which makes some of my friends angry with me, but I can't help it! :-)

Vegans definitely need to supplement their diets with ... well, supplements. Pure vegan with no supplements is not only hard, it can be fatal.

I agree that many people eat too much. And I have learned to go for stretches without it -- having lived in Japan for almost a decade helped. But, I really don't feel very good unless I have some almost every day.

I find it hard to believe the claims of vegans that they feel better that way. I understand their moral/PETA qualms, but that doesn't mean that their bodies feel good. Or maybe they are just wired differently.

I understand how people could be against industrial agricultural practice, but having come from that background (family ranch, actually) ... I can tell you that having traveled widely across 5/6 states ag areas when I was growing up ... I never saw anything like what is broadcast on the Internet or by PETA as common practice. 

Which isn't to say that it doesn't happen, but sick/terrified/unhappy animals don't gain weight and they don't taste good. Happy healthy cows have more, healthier calves, have more, healthier milk and have more, healthier meat.

Besides, during their lives, they are our friends and children. They rely on us. Terrorizing them is not only counterproductive and unprofitable; it makes them harder to handle/manage/herd/milk/calve/feed. It would be a stupid practice.

1. Bravo's innovative, unorthodox techniques.
2. Gracie's determination and athleticism.

Personally, I'm a fan of Bravo's style and really enjoy what he brings to the system. It's exciting to see him personally execute some of his signature moves against such an accomplished grappler and athlete.

Unfortunately, I feel the general Gracie marketing bravado and attitude takes away from Royler's performance, which was actually really impressive. Gracie was on the attack the entire time, constantly aggressive, with continuous pressure throughout. At no point did Gracie look tired, nor did he stall...he just continually fought and fought until he got caught in the leg lock. Lesser men would have gassed or tapped...and I'm genuinely concerned about the health of his leg. 

It would have been great if they could have shook hands, hugged, and had a beer after with cheers from both respective camps. Alas, such is the Gracie way, and no one should be surprised. It's what they do, and does not detract from how they have contributed to the sport.","1396310557"

Syracuse wasn't a blue blood program before Jim Boeheim, but they are now because of Jim Boeheim. It's one thing to get a job at an established powerhouse like Kansas or Kentucky, but it's a whole other ballgame to create a powerhouse program by yourself. (This is also one of the reasons why I think Donovan is the best coach right now, he's created a basketball powerhouse in Florida, which is a football school.)

&gt;The product placement and forcing of the brand onto us was over the top. I understand who was sponsoring it and where the money to produce this event was coming from, but when I am no longer allowed to have easy access to water in order to hydrate myself after sweating under bright lights for hours because it wasn’t Mountain Dew, then we have a problem.
It was the enforcement of shilling out our image to constantly and overtly push this beverage that made me uncomfortable.

&gt;Here I was selling out my integrity to participate in an event where I had to pretend to love Mountain Dew more than any other beverage in the world (I don’t even drink soda, FYI). I was pretending to laugh at gamer jokes. I was clapping at prizes I couldn’t have cared less about. And most of all, I was just not representing myself as me.

So Polaris essentially rented its channel and staff out to Mountain Dew? WHY?  Why wouldn't the host and staff just refuse to work in that?  Matti sounds awful, but there's a lot of blame to go around.  Polaris shouldn't have put the devs in a position where they had to quit.  The people from Polaris who paricipated should have stopped the production when it became a commercial instead a show, at least for the audiences sake.  Mattie is probably a piece of shit, but it sounds like what he ended, was actually not worth doing in the first place.  Honestly, If Mattie wasn't sexist, and this crap went out, it might have been even worse for Polaris.  They may even be lucky he ended it.  At least the devs have kept their integrity.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;You cannot go to court without passing the bar in your state. This is obvious. Nice try at obfuscation though.

You might want to check your math, since the ""actually going to court"" was the 10% left over.  Seriously, ask any lawyer (since apparently you won't believe just one) to compare the billable hours they spend in court versus document review, legal research, or writing (none of which requires a law degree).  And before you say ""but to submit pleadings you have to be licensed"", which is true, but it's a bit like saying that because you have to be a doctor to prescribe medication, nurses must not exist.

&gt;http://makai.ischool.uw.edu/wiki/Operating_cost

I look, and I look, and nowhere in there does it say ""operating costs also includes whatever society writ large decides the wages of employees should be.""

Again, the equivocation of ""we decided employees should have more money than the value of their labor"" for ""a cost of business that the employer isn't paying"" is simply incorrect.

&gt;They put people on WIC and SNAP, hand out the forms. The McDonalds budget is their own proof of their own problem.

Well, first, you may not know this but Walmart actually does not have the authority to ""put people"" on any form of public assistance.

But that's the point.  Walmart is paying the fair market value for labor, and we (you know, the rest of us) have decided to take it upon ourselves to give more money to those workers.

That doesn't, and shouldn't, become a cost the employer must bear to pay for our largess.

&gt;You mean hiring people who work well together as a team?

Hm...  So, when you're hiring people you look to whether they can fit into the role you would like to hire them for?  And presumably in IT you are also paying for their prerequisite knowledge of computers.  In other words: their ability to work in a team is *part of* their value as an employee, not independent of it and invalidating of it.

What's funny to me is that your argument in attempting to invalidate value-as-what-someone-will-pay boils down to ""different organizations might have different criteria for judging who they hire and what they pay.""  But that's the point, there doesn't have to be an objective assessment of value, just the assessment at the point of sale.

&gt;In other words, yes you have to take teamwork into account as well as the person themselves. If you have people who can't work together, its harder to get things done properly.

And ability to work in a team is part of the wage that someone can demand, and thus their value to an employer.

&gt;Can you please use an argument that does not rely on the chicken/egg problem?

1.  Still not a chicken/egg problem.  Value, worth, and price are all the same thing.

2.  The chicken/egg problem *itself* has already been solved, it was the egg.","1396310565"

It's not an everyday thing, if it happens for a few days I lay off for a couple days and try again.

There's a lack of communication that needs to be addressed and I'm more than willing to fix that, if he is however, is different and that's what I need from him. I don't expect two hours of passionate love making, If he said yes to me once in a while and took 20 minutes out of his day to have sex with me, I'd be ecstatic. I just don't feel happy anymore and I don't want to leave him until I know for sure that nothing will ever change, (from where we stand at the moment).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; Can't wait for the pharma shills to come whining about patent laws, trying to convince people that making drugs cheap and available to the poor kills innovation

The complaints about pharmaceuticals is they charge too much for their drugs. The counter-point is the cost of development, which is literally billions of dollars. So, of course it's only fair that they would try to recoup their investment of both time and money.

I don't think anyone actually has complaints about cheap drugs. If the government is paying for research, and everyone is paying their taxes, then it is only fair that the drugs are not-for-profit.

I actually think it would be a good idea if all the countries got together to develop drugs. They pool their money, research is done, and they make cheap drugs. Long-term it would lower health costs for everyone. In my head it would be like the world bank.","1396310567"
"taiwan","t5_2qhrg","Basically, there's unlikely to be a ""tub"" or a ""shower room"" that is separated from the toilet area in your bathroom. Instead, the toilet and the shower faucet are on the same level, so the water from your showers can flow to everywhere in the bathroom, and drains out via a central drain in the bathroom. You should wear plastic slippers (with good traction) in the bathroom because the floor will be wet in there most of the time.

If Blizz investigated your account, it would become instantly apparent. All they would have to do is see which of your 10 buddies gave you the gold.

Gold shouldn't be tradeable anyway though. So long as you can trade gems to people, and items, they have no need for the gold and will earn more than enough on their own to cover everything.

Course, there's more logistics to sort out. Do you allow for 6 degrees of _____ trading, or do you limit it strictly to me -&gt; you -&gt; me? Probably would lean towards the latter option, otherwise you could trade me something, which I trade to someone else on my list, which they trade to someone else, etc...effectively removing the intended limitations of My 10.

There's always going to be someone willing to spend $500 on the world's best 1H weapon, and willing to wait an entire month before getting it. I think the fun for the rest of us to trade with our buddies outweighs any benefits of stopping Mr $500 axe.","1396310568"

I can do T1 but there are some mobs that still suck. But pretty much I use (sorry at work) bash and the rune to help gain fury. WW with i belive the run that heals on crits maybe. I use ancient spear with the rune that turns it into a boulder. I then use the shout that increases my damage with the crit increase rune. I also use leap with iron skin rune. Last but not least I use beserk with crit rune on it as well i believe. So my fights look something like this on a elite

shout
leap into fight
drop boulder
hit beserk (all fury is gone)
bash and ww (ww will use fury but its a must sometimes)
full furry again drop boulder (it is based on how much furry u got)

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","To be honest this routine looks ok at the moment... but for someone with more strength - I do a push/pull/legs currently, however - accross the big three lifts im hitting between 140-220kg for sets of 5. With this kind of strength base a routine like you posted would work well for me to gain muscle, but with your strength base it will be nowhere near as effective.

Typically you will progress best through progressive overload and linear progression to begin with. For example doing 3-5 sets of 5 on all the big compound movements like squat, deadlift, bench press, overhead press, barbell rows. You increase the weight on these exercises every workout even if only by 1.25kg at a time. If you want to gain muscle then a decent trength base is going to give you the ability to do that much more effectively anyway.","1396310575"

DAVID USBORNE-Monday 31 March 2014
	
Captured by a video camera on one of the officer’s helmets, the slaying by Albuquerque police of a homeless camper in the foothills outside the city two weeks ago apparently leaves room for interpretation. The city says it was justifiable self-defence. To others it looked like extra-judicial execution.

The grisly clip, which is still viewable for anyone with a strong stomach, has an awful power all of its own. But it has also become the tragic totem of a wave of civic anger directed at the city’s heavily militarised police department that on Sunday erupted into hours of unrest across the downtown area, leading to serial arrests and a plea for calm from the city’s mayor who said his streets had turned to “mayhem”.

For James Boyd, the fury comes too late. With a long history of mental problems and episodes of violence, he was challenged by three officers on 16 March for camping in an unauthorised area near the city limits. They woke him from sleeping. A three-hour stand-off ensued until, at dusk, he is heard telling the officers he is done arguing and was “going to walk” with them. That is where the episode might have ended.
 
Instead, as Mr Boyd gathers up his things, one of the officers shouts “Do it”. A flash-bang device is fired at his feet.  A startled Mr Boyd drops his bags and seems to take out a knife. He turns away from the officers, two of whom shoot multiple live rounds into his back. Mr Boyd falls, a dog is loosed to check he has been immobilised, the officers approach and cuff his wrists.

He was pronounced dead later in a city hospital.

The killing of Mr Boyd, who was 38, prompted more than the usual handwringing because it seemed less an isolated incident than a confirmation of a pattern.

Since 2010, the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) has been involved in 37 shootings, 23 of them fatal. According to the group Progress Now, its officers shot more people than the NYPD over the same period did in New York – a city 16 times larger.

While Police Chief Gorden Eden said in a later press conference that the actions of the three officers had been justified because Mr Boyd had represented a “direct threat” to their safety, the killing is now being officially investigated by the FBI.

Even before the slaying, the US Justice Department had, for over a year, been investigating wider claims of human rights and other abuses by the APD. Neither probe is yet complete.

The Boyd slaying appears simply to have been one too many.

Or maybe it has had such an impact because it can so easily be viewed. But the city might have guessed at the trouble that was coming when a YouTube video emerged vowing retaliation for the homeless man’s death. Taking credit for the threat was Anonymous, the underground collective that hacks into and debilitates the web sites of those it opposes.

Sure enough, the APD confirmed early Sunday that its website had been broken into and crippled for hours.  At about the same time, the protesters, several hundred of them, were gathering in the centre of Albuquerque, New Mexico’s largest city. Through the daylight hours they repeatedly marched through downtown, blocking traffic, chanting and brandishing banners demanding that the APD be cleaned out and Chief Eden be forced to resign. For the most part, the marches were peaceful if disruptive.

But by Sunday evening, the mood had changed.

Witnesses reported hours of clashes between the protesters and police in riot gear, some on horseback. News video shows tear gas canisters being repeatedly released into the crowds. In one of the more serious encounters, protesters trapped a squad car and tried to smash its windows with bricks and rocks.

“It has reached a boiling point, and people just can’t take it any more,” said Alexander Siderits, 23, who was among those marching on Sunday, adding that many of the city’s residents were just “fed up” with the police and their record of fatal shootings.

Justin Elder, who followed the march in the safety of his car, held a sign reading, “APD: Dressed To Kill”. He explained: “That’s what this police force is about.”

While the city was reported to be calm yesterday, on Sunday Mayor Richard Berry said its downtown area had been reduced to “mayhem”, blaming outside elements for exploiting the situation. 

“We respected their rights to protest obviously,” he said, “but what it appears we have at this time is individuals who weren’t connected necessarily with the original protest. They’ve taken it far beyond a normal protest.”

Still unanswered is why two of the officers used lethal firearms to take Mr Boyd down instead of stunning him with the taser guns they were also reportedly carrying. They have been placed on paid administrative leave.

The broader debate is about the APD navigating the thin line between reasonable and unreasonable force to  maintain order, and the  apparent unwillingness of the city’s leaders to make sure it isn’t crossed.

“I was a police officer for a decade,” says Patrick Davis, executive director of ProgressNow New Mexico. “The over-militarized approach to law enforcement is having a very real effect on people’s lives here in New Mexico and our leaders who should be taking real action seem to be taking it all in stride.”

&gt; In this context, portable means that an application is developed in one environment – typically a desktop environment – but runs correctly in any environment.

Environment == VR environment, not operating system environment. Unlike VR hardware, operating systems can easily be changed by installing a new one. Say, Linux for example.

&gt; This means competitiveness in terms of ease of development

That, again, doesn't say anything about operating systems. Installing Linux is very easy, after all.

No offense taken/meant, I'm just playing along with the joke. I know that a Windows port of Vrui would help out a lot of people. There are certain practical obstacles, like there only being one person who knows Vrui inside out, and that person being a severely overworked non-Windows developer.","1396310581"

&gt;It is important to consider the time period as well. The government had muskets, and the people had muskets. There was equal playing ground.

The government also had cannons and explosives and warships, and citizens were allowed to own these as well.

&gt;Nowadays, a war with the government would be extremely lopsided because of drones, tanks, planes, and automatic rifles.

It wouldn't be as lopsided if citizens were allowed to have these things as well, not to mention the cheaper countermeasures against them (like anti-tank RPGs and anti-aircraft Stinger missiles). Also, asymmetrical warfare (guerrilla warfare) can definitely be effective, and it is specifically named so because of the ""lopsided"" nature of it.

&gt;I'm sure they couldn't have imagined the types of technology that we would possess today.

You don't give them enough credit. They said ""arms"" and not ""muskets"" because they *did* intend it to apply to future weapons. They were not at all unfamiliar with the concept that weapons technology advances over time.

&gt;Would the founders believe we should be able to own weaponized poison gas? Civilians owning nukes? Bazookas? I doubt it.

Bazookas, with a certainty. The fact that you would group a bazooka with nuclear and chemical weapons suggests to me that you don't have a functional understanding of what one actually is. It's not something that can blow up a building; it's designed to punch a whole through a metal plate.

I think it would be fair to draw the line at ""WMDs"" like chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, because of the specialized training required to handle them *at all* and the sheer magnitude of collateral damage potential from *mishandling* rather than deliberate use.","1396310583"

Uhh, just FYI, all someone has to do is google image search the phrase ""chart of average global temperatures since 1900"" to see that ""U.S. Corn-Belt Temperatures"" is an *obviously* cherry-picked data-set to use for comparison.

Specifically, it shows a trend line that swings ~0.1C from 1900-2010, when the swing for actual global averages over the same time period is much closer to 0.8C for pretty much every single image that search pulls up. No searching for just the right set, no being tricky with scales or units, just a really glaringly obvious trend that your graphic *just happens* to not capture.","1396310583"

They kept saying how thin she was and how she needed to gain weight while others told her how much they wanted her body and it eventually got to her. She struggled with keeping her weight above 100 lbs because she only thought people liked her because she was skinny. She was never the popular girl but she craved the comments people said about how she was so skinny or how people wanted her flat tummy or thigh gap. It took her much longer than it should have to gain back the weight she lost after her surgery because she would say wasn't hungry even though she hadn't eaten all day. She eventually told me that she loved people making comments like that and she avoided eating to stay skinnier. After her mom took her to the doctor, her weight and overall appearance improved because she realized the serious nature of what she was doing. Her weight is much healthier now.

---

&gt;

&gt;__Francis Marion__ (c. 1732 – February 27, 1795 ) was a military officer who served in the [American Revolutionary War](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War). Acting with [Continental Army](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army) and [South Carolina](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina) militia commissions, he was a persistent adversary of the British in their occupation of South Carolina in 1780 and 1781, even after the Continental Army was driven out of the state in the [Battle of Camden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Camden).

&gt;Due to his irregular methods of warfare, he is considered one of the fathers of modern [guerrilla warfare](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guerrilla_warfare), and is credited in the lineage of the [United States Army Rangers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers). He is known as the __Swamp Fox__.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; It is theft because it uses threats of violence and/or violence itself in order to extract value.

So does private property. You lock up an area and threaten others with violence in order to maintain a monopoly on extracting value. Who gave you the rights to that area, and why should they be respected?

&gt; Locking a geographic area for exclusive personal use isn't something unique to humans - look at the animal kingdom for references. 

The animal kingdom doesn't respect property 'rights.' This is ludicrous. They respect might. If we want to take our moral cues from animals (equally ludicrous) I would be justified simply walking onto your property with a gang of thugs and murdering you for it.

&gt;It also doesn't extract value from anyone, it simply bars non-members from entry/use.

I'm sorry, but it does extract value. If I can't survive without tithing you simply because you control the productive commons, all you are doing is being a nonproductive rent-seeker. That's about as far from 'anarchism' as you can get.

You're not going to get sent back in training or kicked out over a stupid cold. It's only if you are chronically going to medical or have more serious issues that something like that will happen. But a bug? No. 

You can also tough it out, but keep in mind, unless you're washing your hands literally every 5 minutes, your constant coughing/sneezing/nose pissing is going to get someone sick. That's why I personally think it's better to go and get some meds. If you're sneezing/coughing less, you're spreading fewer germs. Fewer germs = fewer sick shipmates. 

They'll pretty much give you whatever OTC meds you think you need. I personally recommend asking for motrin/aspirin on your first visit during P-days even if there's nothing wrong with you, because that shit is a Godsend if you get a headache or soreness.

That being said both *Angles* and *Comedown Machine* are both a deviation from the overall style of the first three cumulatively.

They have carbon fibre, and monocoque frames and things like that- have we already moved past what hemp can do for us in a lot of ways maybe?

Also think of how utterly fucked you'd be when all of the sudden you have a drought. Now you're not just short on food, you're short on fuel *and raw materials*. It gets worse: now you've converted arable land we use for food to fuel and raw material production. Soon, you'll have to start engineering drought and pest resistant hemp, and boom, suddenly we're talking about how we have high fructose hemp syrup in all our cereal, and how we don't have any domestic food production because we said ""screw ductile metals, hemp it is"". 

I know a lot of the time hemp is talked about like it would have been a good alternative to forestry, but thank god it wasn't. I imagine at some point we'd have to decide between maintaining and renewing forest and planting huge hemp plantations. As a hiker who frequents logging territory, I'd much rather hike through some lumber cuts than I would through a hemp field. I bet that would suck. 

If you think about it, Hemp's diversity makes it the worst possible crop we could grow. We'd reduce our diversity, and make ourselves extremely vulnerable to nature, disease and a whole bunch of things. We'd have to heavily modify hemp to make it productive, too.

I still do enjoy the color scheme that I have most of these shades in this particular Inglot palette.

I recall that the NYX palette had both a cooler and warmer beige-toned gold (shades 1 &amp; 4), and a medium-toned brown that swatched as a deeper gold (shade 7).  It didn't contain a taupe, but I thought that it would be a nice addition to the palette.  Some swatch pics showed shimmer in shade 2.  However, mine was matte from what I remember.

I understand that this palette is discontinued but still sold on Ebay.  So yes, the NYX is going to be a LOT cheaper.  This is mainly for inspirational purposes for those who are thinking of customizing their own Inglot palette.  Oh, and I feel like I'm better at duping neutrals.  Heh.  I had a few other palettes in this collection.  Let me know if you would like for me to dupe them as well.

**tl;dr** I had a little free time from school and wanted to post a palette that I can duplicate fairly easily.  NYX's is pretty, but Inglot's formula is better IMO.

Shades:

* Shine 11
* Matte 358
* Matte 337
* Shine 08
* Pearl 402
* Matte 313
* Shine 154

"GameofThronesRP","t5_2zkud","Wrapped in a cloak of pale blue silk with a merman emblazoned on the back in a deep gold strand on the front steps of Highgarden stood Robert Manderly, the up-jumped cut throat who had not been seen by any man for the better part of a year by any man other than the few that had been working on repairing the burned shell of Highgarden.  But today, he stood to greet his new wife to be, Meredyth Tyrell, escorted to Highgarden by the Tarly's, although the Lord of Horn Hill was strangely absent today, for reasons Robert did not know.  

The initial excitement of becoming a High Lord had drained out of him immediately, he had learned that leading civilians turned out to be much harder than leading soldiers, and repairing this damn castle had almost made him, one of the wealthiest men in Westero's, broke and helpless.  He had begun to question what Gylen was thinking by giving him this castle, how was he supposed to be a lord of one of the largest castles in Westeros when all he knew was murder, bloodshed, and strategy.  Robert was trying his hardest at being a good lord, one the people would look up to, but he was finding it much harder than he expected and be began cutting corners, making this job easier on himself as to not go completely mad.  

And now there was this business with the new Tyrell girl.  Now his friend, Gylen Hightower, thought it would be best for him to marry Meredyth instead of Mellara because she would have been next in line for the seat anyway.  So in his months of avoiding one marriage, he was stuck with another one.  

As the older Tyrell girl approached him, he tried a false smile to make the girl feel more welcome in her own home.  And once she was less than a meter away he bowed and said, ""Lady Tyrell, welcome home,"" he cleared his throat after, realizing how raspy his voice was from under use, and continued ""I am Robert Manderly of White Harbor, and you must be Meredyth."" Rob tried to smile as wide as he could to look friendly, but must have looked like a complete lun doing so. ""Your sister has told me so much about you.  Please, come in, I'm sure your starved from the journey.""","1396310597"

I'm assuming you're eating a ton of calories, as is typical when you bulk. Where are those calories coming from? If you're eating crap, you're going to look like crap. The best advice I've seen is getting your protein sources from lean meats (chicken breast, for example) and finishing the surplus in calories with fruits and vegetables.

Also look into high intensity interval training, such as Tabata. Stuff is unparalleled in taking off the fat. It's just a four minute exercise where you work out at max intensity for 20 seconds, followed by a 10 second break. Do that for 8 cycles.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The English won the Hundred Years War.  They got what they wanted, the King of England getting rightful recognition as the King of France.

Then they went and lost it all.

Leaving out the whole front end of the Hundred Years War, in the Treaty of Troyes in 1420, the English recognized Charles VI as King of France and the French recognized King Henry V of England as his heir (cutting Charles VI's son, the Dauphin, out of the succession). This treaty was rather forced on the French by Henry Vs military victories.

In 1422, both Henry V and Charles VI died. At this point, Henry VI, the infant son of Henry V and Charles VI's daughter (the marriage had been another outcome of the Peace at Troyes) became King of England and France - The only English King to actually rule France (not personally, of course, he was an infant).

The Dauphin was upset by this course of events. With the help of Joan of Arc, he rebelled against the Treaty of Troyes and had himself crowned King Charles VII of France in 1429. By 1436 he had re-taken Paris. By 1453, he had driven the English out of all of France except Calais and the Channel Islands (which Islands are today the only French possessions remaining to the English Crown).

If King Henry V had not died of dysentery at the young age of 35, things might have turned out differently.

Still, even with the English handicapped by having an infant King, the Dauphin was doing a terrible job of reclaiming the Throne of France until Joan of Arc came along.

Whatever she did, it might as well have been the divine intervention that she claimed.  Her arrival galvanized the French into action, and turned a losing situation into ultimate victory.

She was more than just a symbol or a figure head or a morale booster.

Against the wishes of the strategic leader of the army (Jean d'Orleans) she led soldiers and towns people in four assaults on the ring of bastions and fortresses which the English had erected around Orleans during the siege.

In each of these assaults (during the third of which she had to persuade the mayor of Orleans to open a city gate to let her forces attack after Jean d' Orleans had ordered all the gates locked to prevent further attacks led by Joan) she captured an English bastion.

In the fourth attack, despite being wounded by an arrow in the neck, she succeeded in capturing ""Les Tourelles"" which was the main English fortification in the siege lines, thus ending the siege of Orleans.

Thereafter, she had the support of the army command and the army advanced towards Reims at her insistence, winning the battle of Patay along the way and capturing many towns.

When the French reached Reims, they crowned the Dauphin King of France, and he went on to reclaim the kingdom.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Sevens is an easier sport to understand at its basic level, and thus more appealing to a global audience. It would also not really be feasible to hold a full rugby tournament over the course of an Olympics. Rugby union is an intensely attritional game and professional players need a weeks rest in between games. For example, the last Rugby World Cup took place over the course of 7 weeks (9 September - 23 October 2011). A rugby sevens tournament, however, can be played over a weekend in the Olympics and will give a global audience an initial taste of rugby.
Games are very high scoring due to the amount of space on the pitch.I'm sure its this, coupled with the high level of physical fitness required, and the fact they play a tournament over a weekend, which are factors in the 14 minute games. Teams will generally play 3 games on a Saturday, deciding seeding's for knock out rugby on Sunday. Tournaments are held in one Stadium over the course of the weekend, with as many as 20 matches being played on the one day. So you really get your money's worth, and see a load of great games as a spectator. ","1396310599"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt; Any mechanical shutter above it's flash sync speed will produce a similar effect.

Kinda-sorta.  With a focal plane shutter, the first and second curtains move simultaneously and the gap between them is what exposed at the same time, scanning the image from top to bottom or from whichever edge to whichever edge the entire sensor is exposed.  

This leaves room for rolling shutter, but an object will be have to be absolutely rocketing across the frame at a diagonal for it to come up.  Chances are you won't encounter it.  

The sync speed has to do with the electronics and the shutter literally syncing with each other and isn't something inherent in the shutter's mechanical (magnetic) firing.  

&gt; The rest of the frame will be still and the train will be morphed similarly to your example. It will be more blurry because the mechanical shutter's moving opening will be much larger than a single pixel.

I feel that in a sense our society is already a meritocracy, on the basis of human nature alone. People can say they don't judge others all day long, they still do. If it's 2 AM, and you see a tall and heavily built black guy with a large wrench walking in your direction, will you be tempted to cross the street?

However, I decided to discard my draft as I felt there were no official and credible sources yet. 

Then I got caught up in the local elections frenzy, until I saw the Google blog post about this subject just a few minutes ago. 

I realize I'm quite late in catching up, but as I said, I was preoccupied with other matters. Also, I didn't want to cross the line that separates the breaking news from misinformation.

I believe things are going quite unpleasant ways in my country, now that the local elections are won by Erdogan's ruling party. And that is a whole another topic of discussion so I'll leave it at that.

It's entirely possible that there isn't, I just need to do more research into this ""TV Guide"" that the guy in that thread refers to.

&gt; When I say there are compatibility issues with DLNA, what I'm referring to is that it's a pretty expansive protocol and different vendors implement it differently. I ran it a couple years ago because it performed better over my flaky WIFI than Windows/SMB did. I ran Tversity into XBMC. Things like subtitles didn't work. Sometimes something wouldn't transcode right and the sound would be out of sync. Some files simple refused to transcode. All those problems went away when I just fixed my WIFI and let XBMC talk directly to the NAS.

Interesting.  I'm not sure if it's just due to the fact that the players I've had work very well or what but I've had no problems with DLNA.  YMMV I suppose.

&gt; You mentioned Tvheadend/QNAP. I have a Synology NAS which is considered a pretty high end NAS and it has a feature called Video Station which is supposed to read/stream/record LiveTV. Even though it talks to the HDHomeRun and does a channel scan, it does not work. So definitely try before you buy.

QNAP has this as well, and the one I have is fairly high end too, so I'm sure that it could handle it if I had one of the three supported tuners DVB tuners, lol.  I need a tuner that can tune encrypted content, which is why I was looking at the HDHomeRun Prime.  I need to do more research to see if the QNAP package supports the Prime &amp; encrypted channels.

&gt; As far as copy-once goes, I have no idea. I run an HDHR Dual (ClearQAM) and no CableCard.

Ah, sorry about that.  I get the feeling that whatever I end up choosing will be a gamble.","1396310610"

"dota2loungebets","t5_2xomz","**[Titan] vs Cis** Titan is a clear favorite but Cis has their own issue, Black doesn't seems to fit in the team yet, probably never will as far as communications go.

**[Titan] vs Orenda** Sure Orenda did pretty well in their previous games but their teamfight performance is just not there from what I see in game, they may get away with some other tier 2 teams but probably not against an experienced team like Titan. Titan is not performing that well after losing Mushi but they're all experienced player and at worst they're still a Tier 1.5 team, definitely favoring Titan here.

**[Navi] vs Fnatic** Navi got this, this would be yet another 2nd place for Fnatic, nothing new.

**VP vs [Rox.Kis]** Rox.Kis played pretty well yesterday, they could win this if they continue like that.

**Rox.Kis vs (Fnatic?)** Fnatic wasn't doing that good yesterday after the BO5 and I could imagine it would be the same today, I'm favoring Fnatic now because odds are pretty good on them, but depending on the outcome of XMG, if it was a full 5 games (or even 3~4 extremely long games) series I'm going to bet on Rox.

**[C9] vs Liquid** Can't trust liquid yet, and I don't know who would be their stand-in, but I have no faith in liquid for now.

**[MYM] vs liquid** MYM is a pretty shit team, and liquid is not a whole lot better, this is a BO1,  I'm betting small on MYM and see if that works out.

**TR vs [VP]** VP won against Alliance yesterday while TR lose to several teams we thought to be the worst in SL, pretty clear who should I bet on. My trust on TR is as much as the trust I have on PGG's landing an epic blackhole.","1396310613"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Blood is not like cattle or rabbits, it is a renewable resources from individual animals that typically, with the exception of diseases, don't die from the blood sucking.   If there was going to be another animal to ""step up to the plate"" if the mosquito were to suddenly disappear, it would have already done so, and likewise, there are already tones of parasites that live along side mosquitoes, even different types of mosquitoes.  In reality if the mosquito were to disappear another ""worse"" animal would not fill its place, common sense alone should demonstrate that (but we also have facts, like the [mosquito control used in the Cayman islands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito_control)).  If another animal were to take it's place it would take millions of years, not decades or hundreds. 

Also insects do not ""evolve faster than humans"" insects make use of large populations and quick reproductive cycles (but even then do not change into radically different animals), but then again so do rodents and even dogs compared to humans.  The DNA of insects is no more prone to mutations than Human DNA, what makes Bacteria and Humans different is RNA bacteria and plasmids (which are bits of DNA bacteria can share with each other) and very rapid reproduction/life cycles (on a scale thousands of times, if not millions of times faster than even insects). 

&gt;Whereas it only takes maybe a year (if that) for some other bloodsucking insect to respond to the sudden ready availability of food by stepping up its breeding.

It would not take a year for bloodsucking insects to fill in this supposed ""niche"" that opened up for them in the ***small flying water bound blood sucking insect category*** (fairly specific, and pretty much mosquito is the only insect to satisfy this category in *most* places).  Do you know how long it took the mosquito to evolve?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosquito#Evolution

&gt;The oldest known mosquito with an anatomy similar to modern species was found in 79-million-year-old Canadian amber from the Cretaceous.[76] An older sister species with more primitive features was found in amber that is 90 to 100 million years old.[77] Two mosquito fossils have been found that show very little morphological change in modern mosquitoes against their counterpart from 46 million years ago.[78]

&gt;Genetic analyses indicate the Culicinae and Anophelinae clades may have diverged about 150 million years ago.[79] The Old and New World Anopheles species are believed to have subsequently diverged about 95 million years ago.[79]
The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is currently undergoing speciation into the M(opti) and S(avanah) molecular forms. Consequently, some pesticides that work on the M form no longer work on the S form.[80]

I'll re iterate this again, blood is not live stock, the host does not die from simply sucking blood, and it is in a mosquito populations best interest to not kill *any* of the animals it sucks blood from.  The death of mosquitoes wouldn't mean more ticks or fleas, because there is too much blood for either animal to have reached their max population even when both are in the same environment sucking blood from the same animals, and both evolved from different vantage points of being parasitic.   

Now, while I have said that the death of mosquitoes will not cause another parasite to take its place (at least in any where close to our life time, or the entirety of human existence so far) that does not mean that I think mosquitoes being removed will result in there being no impact on the environment, though many articles will say ""well there are plenty of insects that will fill the food niche for other animals once the mosquito is gone""  However, for the same ""blood is not livestock"" reasoning, mosquitoes also introduce food to different parts of the environment (air and water as larva for smaller organisms) that would not be there other wise.  Blood and protein in another animal would not enter the water normally as a food source for a lot of organisms, that, while do not prey exclusively on mosquitoes, would still be losing out on introduced energy in an environment.

And, like most say, people who steal or download a pirated copy of a book aren't going to buy it anyway. But, maybe, they'll tell their friends who *will* actually buy it.

For goodness sake! We went to war with the Nazis because they invaded your nation, as we were bound to. We fought that war for 5 long years. It's absurd to claim that just because we didn't send every man we had to certain death in Poland that we somehow didn't ""join the war"".","1396310618"

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","ah ok that makes sense. This part of the book, a little before, was confusing but now I think I understand:  
    In a first step, two elements (represented by their polynomials) of a finite field  
    GF(2m ) are multiplied using the standard polynomial multiplication rule:  
    A(x) · B(x) = (am−1 x^m−1 + · · · + a0 ) · (bm−1 x^m−1 + · · · + b0 )  
    C (x) = c2m−2 x^2m−2 + · · · + c0 ,  
where:
    c0 = a0 b0 mod 2  
    c1 = a0 b1 + a1 b0 mod 2  
.
.
.
    c2m−2 = am−1 bm−1 mod 2.  

Is that basically explaining what you were saying? you multiply out (FOIL) the A(x) and B(x) and then mod 2 the coefficients?

"GrandTheftAutoV","t5_2t0xk","First off, I would like to apologize on behalf of the PS3 GTA:O community. we are not all like this! I have a few steps that can ensure you will have better sessions next time you play!

1. When loaded into online, change spawn point setting first! Set to garage if you have one!

2. press down on the d-pad as soon as you join a game. If you see levels 200 or higher, i would normally suggest finding a new session. Most of the time this means this player is there either a.modding b.griefing

3. Learn the Select menu like your best friend! (menu that opens when select is held)This menu can do a lot for you! If you start to use it more
you can use it while doing other things, same with the phone.

4. ADD ME! I'm always a friendly player and play pretty often. I can definitely show you some other pointers as well

5. dont trust passive mode. People can still kill you, they just cant SHOOT you.

6. Get a car and insure it so you always have a vehicle to call for! This will lessen the amount of time running around.

These are all really basic tips so im sorry if you knew them. If the online players are too much, i suggest an invite only room or a solo session to start. once you are all set with a car and everything, venture to asshole world again.

I also suggest before you play online, hop over to see if /r/GTAVadventures has anyone hosting rooms. these are exclusively friendly rooms with a lot of fun happening(like you saw in that fly through the Vinewood sign video)

But seriously add me! we shall by pass the A-holes together!

Please come back to Los Santos!

The kind of social gossip that really has no effect on governance but plays well to audiences who don't actually care about the day to day operations of the government anyway.

He also would have much difficulty bridging the wings of the party.  He has pushed a couple of times for economic issues to be the priority of the GOP over the social issues and been pilloried by the social conservative wing of the GOP which now largely resides within the Tea Party.  I think he'd have great appeal to moderates, but while Boehner has made big strides in bringing the Tea Party types back towards the fold since the government shutdown I don't think Mitch could excite them enough to make his election a strong possibility instead of a modest one.

I liked Noragami from last season, and Log Horizon, but generally you're right. I've long outgrown the appeal of the genre, and I'm now keenly aware of its fundamental flaw. The problem is that teen power fantasy is predicated on people attaching to the *concept of the story*, and not the story itself. The entire genre is a wasteland of lazy, pandering, and uninspired writing. Since as long as you have a fancy hook, you don't need things like character-writing or internal consistency. And that's fine, it's entertainment. But that's all it is, easily digestible escapism, not high literature. ","1396310626"

I want to make a couple things perfectly clear, in case anyone was wondering.

I only do silly projects like these on occasion for fun, and ultimately just end up giving them away.  I'm not running any kind of business or doing this professionally.  I rarely take myself or my own projects seriously.  Why an SNES in a cheap-ass walmart table?  Why an NES in a toaster?  ...Why not?  (I do half of these in the garage at 4am, completely sloshed.  It's just for shits n' giggles most of the time).

I think the only reason these projects keep getting any attention is BECAUSE they're stupid and/or absurd.  If you want to see some REAL craftsmanship and modders more deserving of your time and praise, please go browse around the Ben Heckendorn forums.  You'll find some truly amazing stuff there!

Don't have much else so say other than this really doesn't deserve to be here.  Just... maybe have a giggle and move on?

"bjj","t5_2qn02","It's fairly obvious that a hemp blend isn't going to burn like hemp. I fail to understand how the fact it ""burns funny"" proves that it contains absolutely no hemp and he goes on to make quite a few absurd claims based on very little (if any) real, factual evidence.

I do agree on some of his points. Submission's marketing team did what any marketing team does - they went overboard but that's sort of their job, to try to make their product sound like the best. I do agree that they did a lot of awkward wording (like ""First Hemp Gi made with style!"") in the effort of making it sound better than it is but it's marketing, I agree that it's rather dodgy of them but that's just how capitalism works. He claims that he (and ""others"") have attempted to make contact and been ignored or had their claims denied (make up my mind - are they ignoring you or denying your claims?) but there are two sides to every story and sending a competitor a message stating their product is not what they purport it to be would most likely be ignored by just about any other company in the world as well. I'm not saying that it's right, just that it only makes sense.

His claims are no better than Submission's. He has very little evidence to back him other than the fact it burns like a blended fabric, everything else is merely assumptions and conjecture from what I heard. He actually says things like ""I assume"" or ""most likely"" or ""probably"" before or after quite a few of his points which detracts some of his credibility (to me) - if he can't positively state something he shouldn't state it at all, I want to hear ""I know"" not ""I think"".

As far as his ""conclusive"" burn test is concerned, I agree that neither hemp nor cotton burn with black smoke but another common fabric - polyester - does and even with a limited amount of polyester it would still burn with black smoke. I agree that the fibers used are obviously not purely organic/purely hemp but he keeps saying ""not real hemp"" completely discrediting the use of hemp entirely but he can't prove there is no hemp content. He can prove there is other fabric present but he absolutely can not prove that hemp isn't.

I'm neither for or against Submission and their hemp sensation gi. I agree that their marketing is dodgy at best. I agree that they make some claims that are pretty far out there. I agree that I would like to see REAL evidence of the material content of the gi but his ""evidence"" of ""not real hemp"" is no better than Submission's word that it contains hemp as far as I'm concerned.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I grew up with two older brothers, one several years older and the other closer to my age.

Best about the oldest: He has kids now, and so it's pretty awesome to see how cool he is with his kids (also to be able to have little nephews and nieces who I can spoil). 

Most frustrating about the oldest: He's tall and skinny, which makes my other brother and me look bad. Also, he's pretty vanilla. Stable career, requisite 2.5 kids, involved in his church, fiscally responsible... This also creates an unfavorable comparison to my other brother and me. In general, we do not really click for the most part, which I think has to do with our ages and his general...reservedness. Plus, I don't give a hoot about pro sports, which seems to be the safest bet to get him chatting. And finally, he makes fun of me...still.

Best about other brother: Our close ages often pitted us against each other growing up, but when we got to high school, and especially college, that began to change to more of a friendship. It helps that his lady and I get along like bffs. The absolute best thing is that I feel like we are the same person in some respects. We have the same coloring, hair, and body issues. We understand each other pretty well and have the same sardonic humor much of the time (admittedly, a bit of a family trait). 

Most frustrating about other brother: He kind of feels like the family golden boy. Everyone loves him, and it's always been that way (his lady even complains about this). He's super smart, and everyone knows it. I, on the other hand, feel like the family weirdo. Also, he's a bit of a flake and doesn't make it to family events very often, which I know makes my parents sad.","1396310632"

Newfoundland, PEI and New Brunswick are ahead. Which makes sense, as most of the demographics in Nova Scotia are similar with the other Atlantic provinces when it comes to aging and unhealthy population.

The addition of 800 nurses that the nursing union is asking for would still keep Nova Scotia in fourth place, but that 975 per 100,000 would raise to be about 1055 per 100,000. Much closer to the other Atlantic provinces.","1396310634"

And in the ancient world only very wealthy men could possibly afford to support more than one wife and her children. But it was certainly condoned, and effectively mandatory for high ranking wealthy men.

And there is absolutely nothing clear about the supposed universal condemnation of same-gender relationships. Most of the commonly cited passages supposedly condemning m/m relationships are very dubious translations of words that referred to temple prostitution, or which literally meant ""soft"" - a euphemism for everything from physical weakness to cowardice in battle.

The few remaining references to m/m sex come from a context of rape and sexual slavery. Keeping boys and castrated men as pregnancy-free sex slaves was common across the Mediterranean, a practice that bears more resemblance to modern prison rape than anything else. None of these conditions are directly applicable to male same gender relationships as we know them.

And the infamous story of Sodom is completely irrelevant here. It has absolutely nothing to do with anything even remotely resembling same-gender relationships as we know them. It was a classic ancient hospitality fable - divine beings disguised as poor travelers appear, and reward or punish based on how they're treated. Ezekiel even helpfully spells out what he considered to be their damning sins; Ezekiel 16:49, *""Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy.""*","1396310635"

Pretty much to a T, it's frightening, really.  She's the tragic heroine in the novel of her life, and you're the villain who's come to make her life miserable for no reason.  Everything bad is everyone else's fault, except when she thinks admitting fault will get her sympathy.

In update #2 you were talking about your kids having adjustment issues; specifically your daughter wanting you to drop the charges to make everything ""normal.""  That breaks my heart.  How is she doing now?  I hope she eventually comes to realize that as painful and scary as it may seem now, it will ultimately be best for her.  Keep on being a good dad.

As far as her suicide threats go....I say ignore them.  Don't even let them show up on your radar.  They are just words to her with no meaning behind them, so don't them them be anything more than words to you either.

if you really think this guy will self-evaluate &amp; realize he should back down from everyone. But, you said a lot of people *like* working out with him. So he might view this as conflicting information.  Plus, since people like working out with him &amp; he's arrogant or oblivious enough to think he always knows best then he's going to ignore them or want to know who is uncomfortable with him. If your friends give you as an example then you have awkwardness anyway. Worse, he may already perceive you as one of these people who enjoys his act &amp; so won't think it applies to you.

Or, it might work. There's no way to know until you try. And unless your friends finger you as the complainer then it certainly doesn't hurt to try an oblique approach. I just think oblique approaches don't usually work too well with people like this - if they understood subtle then you wouldn't have experienced this to begin with.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","We talked about that but didn't want to go that route because how players use waypoints is highly variable and we didn't want to add additional meaning to existing waypoints so we didn't disrupt the way players lead or manage their navigation.

Instead it will be a squad mission, which will interact very similarly but still allow players to set waypoints separately from their mission.

Think of the squad mission as being a special waypoint that dictates the squad objective, while the squad waypoint is a flexible marker that the SL can use for general communication of locations.

This is my fear.  Currently an engineer.  The road life - being a climber, leaving behind worries and obligations, unmitigated contact with the outdoors - its such a romantic notion and one that I'm inclined to try.  However, will I regret it?  In the big scheme of things, I have it really good compared to most people.  Will I be throwing away a good thing?  Will my love for climbing grow or wane once it becomes ""my life"".  Thanks for doing this AMA, it offers some good insight.","1396310649"

"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Good advice. After the trip, I usually like to just lay still and meditate. Sometimes, I trip right before I fall asleep. My reasoning: DMT takes you to a timeless non-space, where you experience all of everything and also nothing. After coming back from something like that, your mind will want to make sense of it. You'll have the urge to figure out how to incorporate the experience into your philosophy, personality, lifestyle, etc. However, all that is essentially an attempt to compartmentalize and more easily understand an infinite experience. 

That's not a bad thing. I do the same, because DMT is medicine, and we should have an understanding of how medicine affects and helps us. But sometimes, we can better understand medicine by just letting it do what it does and being more aware of how we have changed as a result of taking it. Awareness (at least eventually) is a state of being, as opposed to observation and contemplation, which is doing. Some of the most important things we learn happen when we're not even trying to do so.

Let the experience flow through you (even after the chemical effects wear off), and don't be too concerned about making sense of it, at least the first time. Be at peace as you begin you journey. It's more important than worrying about all our other advice, and whether you're doing it right/perfectly. Bon voyage!","1396310651"

As far as I'm generally aware, due to several social factors, gay or lesbian people would statistically be less likely to be religious, or even more averse to religion than the average sampled population. In that light, wouldn't it be an extremely niche thing to set up a community for religious gay girls? And would the acrimony over it cause more frustration and flame battles than you'd like?

the rule is very confusing to me. i mean, of course people in this sub who support a CAFE event are going to be insulted when you say ""CAFE are a hate group"" but for some reason that doesnt count as an insult because it was only directed at people who you identify as sharing your views and not directly at you.

That's why I don't want an elected Senate. What I suggest is that we switch from having the PM appoint senators to senators being (s)elected by a supermajority in the legislature of the province/territory they're supposed to represent. It'll provide enough democratic legitimacy to override the House once in a while but not enough legitimacy to make a habit of it. And it will remove from the PM's hands [the option] of simply waiting until (s)he has appointed a majority to introduce a controversal bill.

"futuristparty","t5_2v3ca","Well yeah and if you read the Wikipedia article on ""abortion debate"" you also read that:

&gt;Critics of this argument generally argue that there are morally relevant disanalogies between abortion and the kidney failure scenario. For example, it is argued that the fetus is the woman's child as opposed to a mere stranger;[70] that abortion kills the fetus rather than merely letting it die;[71] and that in the case of pregnancy arising from voluntary intercourse, the woman has either tacitly consented to the fetus using her body,[72] or has a duty to allow it to use her body since she herself is responsible for its need to use her body.[73] Some writers defend the analogy against these objections, arguing that the disanalogies are morally irrelevant or do not apply to abortion in the way critics have claimed.[74]

Furthermore, I'd generally be cautious when using analogies. You'll may be able to use it to win a political debate, but I think the FuturistParty is supposed to be rational and an analogy can be used for just about anything (creationists surely like analogies).

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;Well, you were the one who proposed it, so either you think it is a worthwhile replacement for the legal and law enforcement system or you're just wasting everyone's time

I was not the one who proposed anarchy.  There were a couple comments before mine discussing it and I just chimed in to counter a point that was assumed to be true that I didn't think could be so easily assumed.

&gt;And you spent half of the post supporting the efficacy of mob justice, so if you're not invested in it then I don't know what you're doing.

This seems to be a indirect attempt at a personal attack.  If I spend half a post speaking about something, I must support it?

&gt;You'd be surprised at how many insular, child abusing cults and other groups have existed. They formed their own enclaves, safe from the public eye, until law enforcement stepped in. How would leaving justice to the hands of a mob make this any better?

The public didn't step it because they had not the power to do so and would have faced greater legal reactions.  The police tend to move slower than a mob because they have to gather evidence enough to intervene, which if the group is operating carefully enough, can be hard to do.  But the original topic was not about super secrete child abuse rings... those exist already and many still are not even noticed by the governments that be.  The original topic was on general open child abuse.  Unless you think that within a lawless state all pedophiles will band together and build a super strong child abusing coalition.

&gt;Often when child molesters or sexual predators are found out, plenty of people will rush to their defense, claiming how they know that person, they would never do anything like that. Now imagine these people as the most influential voices in the mob.

Of course popular individuals would be able to get away with their crimes.  That happens to a great extent already.  But once again, that a few popular voices in the mob would be able to get away with abuse wasn't the original argument being made.

&gt;I guess you and I have different opinions on the justice system, then. I see a large part of it not as punitive, but rehabilitative.

Maybe in some perfect world justice system, but in our current one, it is primarily about retribution and vengeance, especially for crimes against children.

Also to note, a fully rehabilitative system does not seek to punish at all.  It seeks to help.  In effect, if you want a justice system fully focused on rehabilitation, then you have to say that you do not way to punish child molesters but instead want to help them to stop.  I don't think I've ever seen that argument made.","1396310663"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; A corporation has a wide array of legal rights and obligations that are completely distinct from its owners.

All of these are things that the owner must do (or make sure they are done) or else the corporation is devalued (through fines) or eliminated...both of which primarily hurt the owner.  Which means it's still the owners committing these unethical actions.  If you remove the owners from the situation and don't replace them with another owner, the corporation effectively doesn't exist except as a fictional thing on paper.  It's a legal fiction.  It's legally distinct, but in actuality there is nothing distinct about it.

&gt; What religion is GM?

GM is a corporation that has millions of shareholders, which means that religion will never be something that the people running it focus on due to the fact that no religion represents all owners.  Comparing GM to Hobby Lobby in this way is useless.  This question doesn't serve any purpose though, as there is no way to put ethics or religion on millions of people that share nothing in common other than ownership of a *car* company.  Meanwhile, a company which has very few owners or owners that are primarily from a certain class could very well be religious.

If you really want to take this line of thinking though, the Salvation Army is a corporation, and they are openly Christian.  Most non-profit organizations are corporations and many of them are religious.  This isn't a great line of thinking because I can likely start listing off many corporations that are clearly a certain religion.  In addition, there are irreligious human beings just like there are irreligious organizations, and that doesn't mean that other people aren't religious.  Simply pointing to an irreligious entity and saying that all of that type of entity is similarly irreligious is fallacious and ridiculous (this applies to any characteristic).","1396310664"

1. It can only do 30Hz @ 4k
2. The stock FW only does 60Hz @ 1080p
4. This TV has about a ~280MHz pixel clock cap until it starts randomly blanking out and resetting. (this is why it can only do 4K @ 30Hz) 
3. The signal will be upscaled if its used as an HDTV or with HDTV timings on a PC

Tweaks for this TV:

* Flash the 50"" version (SE50UY04) of this tv's FW. To do this, 

1. Download this: http://www.seiki.com/Firmwares/SE50UY04_20130528.zip 
2. Put it on a usb stick, plug it into to the tv.
3. Put the TV into service mode by pressing MENU then 0, 0, 0, 0
4. Select SOFTWARE UPGRADE.

* If you're using the TV as a monitor then you'll want to do this to drop the HDTV scaling crap.

1. Download Custom Resolution Tool; http://www.monitortests.com/cru-1.1.1.zip
2. Remove all the odd resolutions that you don't want/need. 
3. Uncheck the **Include Extension Block**
4. Add a new Custom Timing for the monitor:

1920x1080 @ 120hz (no resets)

&gt;This would be consistent with the Bible, since Revelation is largely symbolic itself. I'm starting to believe that since evolution appears to be true, then it must have been influenced by God.

&gt;Since the Bible says that when God speaks, His voice is ""like thunder"", then I wonder how much more powerful it would have been when creating the universe, which is how I reconcile the Big Bang. 

&gt;I don't mind if this all sounds silly to others, but it's how I connect the dots between the Bible and scientific teachings.

I am right there with you. I used to do the same thing. (""Let there be light"" is just a metaphor for the big bang) The more I learned though, the more I didn't need to connect the dots. It might sound trite, but you have taken the first step into a much larger world.

You can not like my leading questions but neither should you assume because I pointed out the NRA offers some value that I support the NRA or don't have problems with their official agenda. 

But you're going to have a hard time making the argument that they're having a 'net negative impact' on gun safety when gun violence is in fact on the decline.  

Perhaps no thanks to the lobbying branch of the NRA but these things get real subjective real quick when everyone starts making bold statements about the effect a single organization (even a highly influential one) really has on a big, complicated social issue like the right to own guns or gun violence in the US.

The the reason for recent need of light ""GROUND"" attack aircraft in afghan and/or Yemen and different regions is because you are fighting a very low tech enemy.

If you think an Air Force is going to replace a f-22 or in the world's case an f-35, f-16,f-18 or f-15 with Cessnas you are crazy and no idea what you talking about.

Also R-73 is a SHORT RANGE AA missile an F-22 would shot down the Cessna wayyyyyyy before the Cessna would see an F-22 on radar also Cessna can't possible carry a military radar, fire control, and the missile way too much payload.

What you're talking about is pointless, because what you're describing can't save any money. Everything you're describing has been tried again and again and they never last, because they don't save any money. They don't reduce costs or complexity. What you're describing is basically guaranteed to fail because of something called ""adverse selection"" followed by a ""death spiral"".  If you think about what you said you contradicted yourself because you descibed things that do not fudamantally change anything. Additionally, what you're describing would be banned by GATS.  You can't have for profit and public in the same market.  Also, it cannot do any of a long list of things which save money which the Obama Administration pledged they would not do. Everything that would save a lot of money depends on something happening that the US opposes.

Anyway, yeah, they're definitely my favorite - they're soft, it takes a while for them to pill, they've got a slimmer cut but they're definitely comfy and roomy, and the white is opaque. Arizona's are nice too, pretty decent quality.

The only ones I'd say to avoid are the ones from places like Forever 21 and Wet Seal - the stitching comes undone after a few washes, and even though they're cheap they're still not worth your $7.","1396310671"

The 70-200 is too tight for most stuff on the t2i, and it's quite reasonable on the 6D (though I don't use it much and have the cheap 70-200 f/4.5-5.6).

If you are serious about wedding photography, keep the t2i around as a 2nd camera. You can mount a cheap long focal length lens on it and use the crop factor to your advantage.

Off-camera flash really helps alot with noise on the t2i. Try to bounce or have an flash shoe cord and a rig to move the flash off-camera.","1396310671"

This kind of infinite multiverse hypothesis is obviously controversial.

Ah, this may be the disconnect; I've grown up always thinking that the many-universes theory was currently accepted in one of its forms as a basic assumption, meaning there were an infinite number of universes (or holes) with different cosmological constants off the bat. This would make sense with the analogy, because it would again come down to ""you're here in this form because that's the way this particular universe shook out, the universe isn't this way in order for you to be the result.""

An example [MSDS] (http://www.fishersci.com/ecomm/servlet/msdsproxy?productName=A508P500&amp;productDescription=HYDROCHLOR+ACID+TRCE+MTL+500ML&amp;catNo=A508-P500&amp;vendorId=VN00033897&amp;storeId=10652) from Fisher Scientific (a large supplier of chemicals) shows that HCl can burn your skin and that if you get it on you, you should wash the affected area immediately with water.

Just because you flip burgers for 20 years doesn't mean your work is of the same importance of the person *running the company*. 

It's a difficult thing for people to understand, apparently, that corporations are *not* the government and do not *and should not* have to pay everyone equally if they're doing different jobs. Certain jobs pay more, that's the point of a competitive market; that's a capitalist society. Certain things are worth more than others. If workers all get paid the same, how is that any different from saying *this* product should cost the same as *this one*.

I'm sorry but this is America and whether you disagree with capitalism or not, there will *always* be rich people and there will *always* be lower class people. And America (*at least should*) always be a capitalist society. 

As a US citizen, I thrive for a comfortable life. I'm taking the initiative and I'm gaining a college education so I can better myself and raise a family without hopefully having to worry about money. And I chose a career path that will help me do that. Everything here is *your* choice; and I'm not saying people aren't equal.

One last question: I know that I need to reject H0 if 1.6069 is greater than or equal to t with 50 DoF and at alpha = 0.05. I know it's very similar to what you just said, but how do I approximate the value of a t distribution at alpha = 0.05? 50 is high enough to be able to approximate it with the normal like you just did, but the logistics are confusing me. So you know that we need a value, lets call it m, such that P(t &gt;= m) = 0.05. And therefore, P(t &lt;= m) = 0.95. So approximating with normal, we need an m such that P(N(0,1) &lt;= m) = 0.95. Is this the right approach? So I'm getting a number around 1.645 using my standard normal table. So, since 1.6069 is not greater than or equal to 1.645, I do not reject the null.","1396310675"

What is the basis of this claim exactly? Did you work with this person? Were you familiar with the work they were currently performing in some specific way? 

Edit: I just don't understand what you're trying to say. Are you disagreeing with her mother who is quoted saying she (the daughter) found failure rates difficult to deal with, and if so what exactly is your basis for this? 

I agree that the title of this post and the article itself seem to attempt lead to a conclusion that isn't supported by what they provided.  

For example, they state that she 'reacted badly when laboratory experiments failed and realised she was unsuited to her new job.', but I'm not sure how they support anything specifically regarding any failed experiments.  

They site a successful presentation in Ireland, and the coroner almost contradicts this, ""From the evidence I have heard, even though it may have been different in her mind she appears to have been working very well and was successful within the research team... I accept that she was uncertain about her future in chemistry and she was a little disillusioned with regard to her chosen discipline and also the fact of her involvement with a research team within that discipline."" They mention she 'got offered work outside the lab' and was going to become involved in a  project management role, but don't discuss this further.

It feels like you went from being under one type of social pressure and attempted to relieve it by putting yourself under a different social pressure.

Take Chinese Sleep Chant for example, really one of their best. (they gotta do more shoegaze)

Although I-5 ain't exactly scenic. If you had the time I'd spend a night in Portland doing *something*. Bars, eclectic movie theaters, I dunno. Then take highway 26 (Mount Hood Highway)till it merges with 97, take 97 down to Bend. You could then take it down to Klamath Falls, hook a right onto highway 66, stop in Ashland before heading north and appreciating what a boring highway I-5 is. 



But it'd also take you to most of the highly rated trails and outdoors content in the Valley and the mountain range. Bachelor, Mt Hood Wilderness area, Crater Lake, 3 Sisters, Black Butte. 



The sentiments about taking the oceanfront highway (101) ain't bad either.

yes

Odd analogy, but it feels similar; you are by definition forcing your beliefs on the other person. This works about as well as you'd expect it to... Offering a feminist ""men's space"" would be a hollow gesture, something that can be used to claim you tried without offering any applicable aid.

IMO if you really want to engage with the MRA group, initiate conversation. Don't raise your voice, don't become emotional, and especially don't try to ""stop propaganda"" by censoring them. Everyone has a right to share their beliefs, and you can't force them to stop their own thoughts and listen to yours just as they can't force you.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","TBH, I really love how Riot have been handling nerfs/buffs recently. They're pretty much throwing away big nerfs and only ever balancing champions, recognising that normally the reasons they are strong is because they have a massive power spike at a certain level.

Take the Shyvana/Gragas nerfs. Both are still hugely popular post nerf but they competitively sit in the ""very strong"" bracket, neither really being banworthy. Even the kassadin nerf was pretty good IMO, even though it was pretty much a reverse of what I said earlier (made power spikes and weak areas even greater to compensate)


This being said, I do think they need to be a tad more aggressive with some champions. Leblanc is probably due for a balance (I don't think zed really needs it, he's sort of nichey due to being AD and is in no way as OP as he was S3) and Leona will probs need a balance some time in the future on account of being such a low elo stomp champion.","1396310685"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Second link:

&gt;If anyone believes that SIS persuaded each of these 19 hard-bitten Nazi spies to fall in with Operation Fortitude by merely offering them tea, biscuits, and lectures in democracy, they’re being profoundly naïve. An SIS secret house located in Ham Common near Richmond on the outskirts of London was the location where the will of those agents was broken, using advanced interrogation techniques that reportedly started with sleep deprivation but went on to gross mental and physical abuse.

Or, the ""If you don't believe what I'm implying, you're stupid"" approach.

I've also found what seems to be a [more scholarly article,](http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-78.html#S3) which talks about the British torture of Germans:

&gt; MI5 records reveal that 'Tin Eye' Stephens - so called because of his thick monocle - used every kind of what he termed 'mental pressure' to 'break' prisoners at the camp. Such methods included tricking prisoners with fake newspapers, typically stating that the U-Boat or airplane they had arrived on had been destroyed; stool pigeons or agents planted in prisoners' cells to get them talking; bugging equipment (usually located in hollowed-out bed posts); terrifying prisoners; sleep deprivation; and disorientation. 

...

&gt;Contrary to what we might assume, Stephens governed Camp 020 according to a strict rule of non-physical violence. 'Violence is taboo', wrote Stephens in his in-house history of Camp 020, which has recently been declassified, 'for not only does it produce answers to please, but it lowers the standard of information'.

It's one thing to believe we should diversify, the whole other can of worms is *how*.

Our market will adjust. We've adjusted away from agriculture, could be now doing the same in some forms of manufacturing while making boosts in tech (see KW and Ottawa for example). We'll always be innovating and finding new ways for us to prosper.

Innovation also often happens in stages. We'll find a somewhat expensive car that runs on alternate fuel or electricity (volt?) and then somebody will perfect it, and then it will gain in popularity.

"environmental_science","t5_2s90l","Responsible consumption? Well how do we want to define responsible? It has the same ~~flawed~~ 'iffy' connotation as ""sustainable"" in that it is a relative description of utility. We can be responsible in that we keep our dumpsites at a minimal level so that more land does not need to be reallocated for that purpose, but then we would have to define the minimal. Same thing goes for sustainability: do we only use refined oil for transportation, synthetics (plastics), or both and for how long do we want the resource to last into the future for it is a finite resource? To me, our culture is far from being a responsible consumer based society, because there doesn't seem to be an end to the increasing level of consumption. Every organisms consumes and their populations fluctuate up and down according to resources available, but our culture (economically) makes no such plans as to stoping it's growth, but in accordance to the second law of thermodynamics, that cannot continue.

Hopefully what I said came out somewhat coherent.

If not or actually, regardless, you (or anyone who reads this) should check out the book *Ishmael* by Daniel Quinn. It was an amazing book, and though many of the ideas were not new, it has caused me to look at our culture in a totally different way: somewhat more forgiving, yet unfortunately no less frustrated.

The only long-term solution I see without imposing values on other people would be to refine our education system and/or try to emphasize the importance of this issue in a almost mandatory way like english, because it is essential to our species just like our ability to communicate (obviously not used in the same way).","1396310689"

It's possible he only wants a chance to hook up with you again (I'm not sure how old you two are).  But everything you've written here makes it sound like things are on a good track - if he's calling and texting every day even though he doesn't have a shot at hooking up with you again for a while, that's a sign that he's interested.

Nine Justices of the Supreme Court and three oral advocates held over 100 spectators at bay for just over an hour as they debated—of all things—patents.  Today’s case, Alice Corp. vs. CLS Bank, was not a first.  Four times in the past five years the nation’s highest Court has tried to answer what seems an easy question:  What is patentable subject matter?  Today, the focus turned to software.

The entire room craved certainty, but Justices across the bench expressed skepticism over a rigid test that would allow or deny software patents as a matter of law.  The Court seemed inclined to uphold the flexible approach that it adopted four years ago in Bilski v. Kappos.  In that case, the Court held that abstract ideas are not patentable.  Unless the Justices overturn Bilski (which they seemed reluctant to do), the patentability of Alice’s claims—covering a system, method, and computer medium for reducing settlement risk in financial transactions—will come down to whether those claims are too abstract for patent protection.  Although this flexible approach would leave intact the current Patent Office guidelines for software-type patent claims, it will do little to ease the uncertainty regarding the difference between an abstract idea and a patentable software invention.

Perhaps recognizing the Court’s reluctance to abandon its precedent, Alice’s counsel argued that the claims at issue were not as abstract as the claims in Bilski.  Unfortunately, determining what is an abstract idea is a tall order.  The first question of the morning, by Justice Ginsburg, asked Alice’s counsel to explain how the intermediate settlement of financial transactions is less abstract than the financial method at issue in Bilski.  Alice’s answer seemed unconvincing (Ginsburg raised the issue again as her last question).

From there, the Justices volleyed questions exploring whether the addition of a computer transforms abstract ideas into patentable inventions.  In one lengthy exchange, Justice Breyer characterized Alice’s invention as a method of using a computer to control solvency by monitoring and stopping the flow of funds.  He then compared it to King Tut’s method of using an “Abacus Guy” to monitor and stop the flow of gold, and his mom’s method of monitoring and stopping the flow of funds out the Justice’s checkbook.  He asked:  What is the difference between “Abacus Guy” saying “STOP!”, mom saying “STOP!”, and a computer saying “STOP!”?  What of these is patentable?

In answering the question, Alice advocated for a narrow subject-matter bar (limited to fundamental truths, mathematical formulas, and laws of nature) and argued that other patent criteria—novelty and non-obviousness—should be the gate keepers.  The Solicitor General argued on behalf of the United States for a broad subject-matter bar that would prohibit business-method and software patents unless the software itself is an improvement to technology (including computing technology) or science.  CLS’s counsel took the safe approach and urged the Court to just apply Bilski to Alice’s claims.

In two sides warring for and against software patents, CLS seems caught in the cross hairs and has taken a backseat to a fight it started in 2007.  Perhaps that is a good thing for CLS.  By not advocating the Court to revisit its jurisprudence, CLS has provided the Court a narrow way out.  Indeed, today’s arguments ended like they began—with questions seeking to determine what constitutes an abstract idea.  A decision is expected by the end of June 2014.","1396310694"

If a parent kisses their children - of any age - on the lips, is that beyond normal? If a parent walks around naked in front of their children, is that beyond normal?

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","Hey no problem, I appreciate you doing the same. I think we can agree that there are rational people on both sides of the debate, even if there are crazies that make us all look bad. 

It is definitely an unhealthy way to look at relationships if you believe in conventional ideas of romantic love. I think we are on the same page except the point you haven't grasped yet is that 

Imagine for a second that ""true love"" does not exist. That you are born alone and you die alone. That ""romantic love"" between two people is not unconditional in the way a mother loves her child. 

Imagine instead that love is governed by a set of principles. Principles in nature have conditions. These conditions are called sexual strategy. Strategies are used, both consciously and unconsciously, by agents who participate in society to find companionship that is mutually beneficial to both parties involved. This is the sexual marketplace.

This is exactly why I believe TRP promotes mindfulness to me: like you said, ""seeing the world as it is, not as you want it to be""

People come to TRP because they discover the world is not what they thought it was. There is no unconditional love between agents in the sexual marketplace. If you lose your job and your house, your wife may stick around. If you become a drug addict and put on 200 pounds, then your wife may pack her bags and leave. We try to explain this using the framework of SMV, or sexual market value. What has happened in this scenario is that your SMV has dropped so far in relation to your wife's that your wife no longer wants to be in a pair bond with you. 

We differ on what we think is healthy. I actually think it's healthy to see view relationships and people in this context because it helps me understand the behaviors of the people in my life. I reject a romantic, unconditional view of love because I think it is unhealthy: I think it paints an idealized, unrealistic view of the world. You on the other hand think it's healthy for your own reasons. I'm not judging you for that. I just see the world differently from how you do.

Unfortunately, I must commit to some level of discourse. I do agree that Napoleon was quite not a tyrant, in fact he did do Western Civilization some good. He's likely a central reason behind public schooling becoming a common thing world wide.

Stalin on the other hand...

First we'll have to establish what a 'tyrant' is; Simplest definitions seems to say a ""cruel and oppressive ruler"". Whereas Napoleon was a patron of the arts and institutions of learning, Uncle Joseph quite often stifled artistic creativity and intellectual process that didn't serve the state.

Yeah we all die a lot but considering the run gives 120K gold a pop and it only cost 40-50K to repair armor, still not losing money but making tonnes instead.

With the money I made doing these runs I was able to make a few Royal diamonds for my armor with little to no effort.

If you really think it doesn't work I can record a bit of doing the runs, it's so easy and takes so little gear a monkey could do it. I have a lot of people say I'm trolling on the chats when I ask for people but I simply offer them to come try it for themselves.

It only takes 1 run for them to realize how serious I am and how easy this exp is.

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","Not sure where it says that ""everyone is capable of haki"".  All I can find is Rayleigh saying ""Haki is a power that exists within every single human being."", which doesn't mean the same thing.

You completely ignored what I said about the Ocean and Seastone - they don't just ""deactive the DF"".  It also severely weakens the user - hence, training in other ways really wouldn't make a difference.

And you're really stuck on the fact that ""just by knowing about it, you can train it.""  Not once has it been mentioned what is required to awaken the ability to utilize Haki.  Moreover, just by ""knowing"" what Haki is, doesn't let you train it at all.  Hardly anyone knows about Haki - and even fewer know how to train others in its use.  Your example with Smoker doesn't work.  Sure, he can train to dodge things by opening a hole where an attack is going.  But that does NOT mean he can train the predictive power of Observation Haki in the way that Boa Mari (sister of Hancock) does with her eyes closed.

Lastly, 

&gt; Countering a haki punch is the same as just countering a punch without using your logia.

That is just plain false. Armament Haki is useful against more than just Logia, and it is useful against more than just DF users.  When Rayleigh first demonstrates Armament Haki, he uses it to easily deflect a blow of a gigantic elephant, and moment later uses it to flick Luffy without Luffy absorbing the blow as Rubber.

This simply isn't true.

Some stats from [this source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_system) (there are other good ones, but I won't dive into them unless I need to) comparing Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US:

We have the worst life expectancy;

We have the highest rate of infant mortality;

We have the highest rate of preventable deaths;

After Canada and Japan, we have the fewest number of physicians;

We spend the most on healthcare *through the government* -- not counting insurance or private expenditure at all -- and we are the only country to not have universal coverage;

So take a country like Japan. We die 4 years younger (on average), our infants are almost 3 times as likely to die, we are more than 1.3 times as likely to die from preventable causes, we spend about 3 times as many tax dollars on healthcare, *and* we have the costs of insurance, deductibles, and copays on top of that.","1396310707"

It would have cost a lot of money , to keep it going and keep up with the demand. That's the bottom line, especially if sony ever feels to need to make their VR for the pc market and then OC would be in BIG trouble. Given they would have the production, tech, storage, market share and games and studios. Not much you can dude to combat that kind of pull. So they at the end of the day, would have done this sooner or later.

But i will say, there could have been a few other options other then Facebook. That's what people were caught off guard by. Given Mark's attitude behind the scenes. As a douche.  

Plus it's not like they can, do ANOTHER OC kick starter. That would be asking for more money once again and it might be seen as negative.

I think some of the redundancy is probably because there are multiple departments at OSU that are involved with this event, so multiple people have sent out emails about it.  We're also having a difficult time getting students to register, so we've promoted this on multiple channels with the hopes that students just missed previous promotions.  I posted this again as I suspected it may have gotten lost with the weekend since I posted it on Friday last time.

Again, I'm sorry for filling your inbox (and this subreddit).  I'll try to avoid such redundancy next time.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","There was a fundamental shift in Japan's behavior in between the wars. They went from trying to be seen as a western style great power, to an east Asian power that would liberate all the oppressed east Asian nations. Also, the late 20's witnessed the end of a period of Japanese history called ""Taisho democracy"", after this period military leaders became more influential and Japan became very militarized and authoritarian. This shift towards a fascist dictatorship was led by Sadao Araki. This new Japan focused on expansion and ""liberation"" of the oppressed Asian nations. The Japanese instituted a racial superiority doctrine. The role of the Japanese as the greatest and purist race was emphasized, other races were deemed inferior. The Chinese specifically were seen as little better than pests or vermin and this was a major reason for the Japanese treatment of the Chinese.

*Autism means you can't pick up on social interaction well

*Autism means you need everything spelled out for you exactly like it is, without any of the nuances of everyday social interaction

*The same is true for toddlers, who have yet not learned the plays of social interaction

*In other words, autistic people share the level of social interaction capabilities with toddlers

*People tend to be exaggeratedly clear in their communication with toddlers and people with autism, because otherwise they would not be able to understand the communication (Much like what is happening right now)

*Therefore they tend to communicate with autistic people the same way they communicate with toddlers -- because it's the only kind of communication that is clear enough and stripped of the intricate social play that happens in high functioning communication","1396310714"

- number of people in the USA: 311.591,917

- number of men: 155,795,959

- number of straight men: 150,343,100

- number of straight white men: 108,848,404

- number of straight white cisgendered men: 108,363,859

- number of straight white cisgendered men in the upper middle class or above: 17,363,497

- that number as a proportion of the US population: 5.573% (3dp)

So pretty close to your result - there's about a 0.1 variance.
 
Now, I might have fucked up the method, because when I apply it to the other measurement, I end up with the number of female non-white trans* gay/bi lower middle class people being... 0.00355 of a person. Same deal as if I multiply the factors and apply the result to the population total.

Like I said, the sex was horrible. He kept saying stuff like ""yes, taste my cock sauce"" ""you are the cutest child"" and other weird stuff. I gave him oral for a couple of minutes, but couldn't finish it, so I said that I had to do the laundry early the next day. 

Laid in my bed for a long while and contemplated my life choices, after he left. I haven't been able to have sex since, whenever I feel slightly horny I think of him, and feel disgusted and queasy. 

I try not to be a judge prick, but seriously, if someone is disabled they should mention it.

Assuming no significant injuries, there is an 80 percent chance you will never hear from them again.  If you do, then you will need an attorney.  Do not communicate with the attorney ever again after sending one single letter that says only you have no liability insurance.","1396310717"

WITH-THAT-SAID....yes Scorpio Milo, Gemini Saga, and Cancer Deathmask have some very odd looking clothes for one such reason or another. Milo's is the farthest thing because its like some rusted gold with a MK Scorpion mask and he looks scrawny. Definitely the worst. The gemini cloth seems TOO ornate and, while i love the idea, the split of gold and ""surplice"" color seem to add too much to his dual personality...each shoulder couldve just had a Good and Evil face like his helmet. Oh and here it comes...i hate everything about Cancer Deathmask's design BUT they also make his cloth really unique. Also when i said design i meant just have the cloth fight without him cause he looks like a thug.

And to everyone who was asking.... I can buy 1 Silver for even cheaper then 1.8 sometimes 1 AD can = up to 100 silver but in super rare cases.   But average is 1.8 - 2.0 Silver = 1 AD

Which means 1 gold = 50 - 55 AD 

I was trying to show someone how much AD they where losing using the gold system by say selling your key for 125 gold = 6875 AD  you are losing almost 33,000 AD profit!

"CannabisExtracts","t5_2r341","My typical shatterday consists of .05s in the morning ramping up to about .08 over 3 dabs.

 Ill sit a while do my morning routine, have something to eat and then dab a bit more doing .08s up to .2s and do maybe 4-5 dabs of various sizes. Chill for a bit and then go out maybe get more food (its like lunch time now 2-3pm) head back home around 5 or so. Relax find something to watch and pull out the dabs once again. Doing maybe 1-2 before I cook dinner. 

I love cooking while im only slightly medicated, I can practice a much more fine technique (I am also an educated chef) Eat my dinner maybe taking a .08 or so (maybe even some flower to stimulate my appetite) during that. 
maybe 8 pm now or so

Then I usually relax and watch tv/read/reddit/vidya/do errl prep work, pull runs from vac etc/ and then settle down and get out the globs to finish the night.

 I'll bust out the heavy indica and dab a .1 then a .3 and then I'm heavily medicated and enjoy a show or 2 while falling asleep for a solid 10 hours of uninterrupted beautiful sleep and wake up feeling refreshed and alert and always hungry after another dab or 2 as I repeat this cycle for sunday but with maybe half as many dabs throughout the day.

TL;DR So maybe in total 12-15 on a heavy usage day with maybe a total of 1.5-2g of errl and usually maybe 1g to 1.5 of bud (usually joints). And maybe 7-10 dabs (lol) on a normal day with about .7-1g of errl a day with .4 of that always being right before bed. And maybe a .5 or 1g of flower in joint form.

TL;DR #2 1.5g over 12-15 dabs on a heavy use day, .7-1g on a normal day over 7-10 dabs","1396310724"

With these things considered I would say ""Yes, it is her fault she was hit by another cart because she knew what she was doing was against the rules and that there was a person behind her that caught up to their group on multiple occasions."" 

Though in regards to the question ""Who is at fault for that woman's injuries?"" the answer is: that man. Though she is at fault for putting herself in that situation. 

Also

&gt;goes out of his way to hit her

They are on a track, he did not go out of his way to hit her, he just didn't brake to not hit her. 


Like you said, he's an asshole, but the lady in front of him is 100% at fault for understanding the rules and disregarding them. She had no concern for her or the other riders safety, and I think now has a better understanding why that place has policies against full stops and group rides.

Robert's death caused Joffrey to ascend to the throne and kickstarted the War of Five Kings. Additional damage would stack up as Cersei does what she does best as Queen Regent and fuck everything up for everybody.

No Daenerys means no Dragons. I don't know what purpose GRRM has in mind for the dragons eventually, but I'm GUESSING they have a very large role to play in uniting the Seven Kingdoms and possibly driving back the Others. Plus, Viserys will still be alive and plotting to take the throne back.

Bran will never get his psychic warg vibe going, and will be in no position to do... whatever it is exactly that he's doing. It seems important. I think these 3 gone would most effectively doom Westeros to an eternity of winter and spread war through the kingdoms beforehand?","1396310732"

So the spiritual energy of the juubi became the bodies of the nine tailed beasts. Hagoromo would then have to ""breath life"" into the bijuu with his own physical energy, meaning the spiritual energy of the tailed beasts is probably the physical energy of Hagoromo. When the bijuu are sealed into the juubi's body, it's not only the bijuu's physical energy, but also their spiritual energy, the Sage's physical energy. I think this is why when people seal the juubi in themselves they resemble the Sage, because they're gaining a very large amount of the Sage's physical energy.","1396310732"

I really believe this year was just bad luck. They're not the only team to be decimated this way. I'm not a fan of Torts (personality-wise or coaching-wise) but I don't think he caused the injury streak.

Henrik was due. I also believe he has back problems ever since the Boston series. I have no proof of that rather than the amount of stretching and wincing he does on the bench.

Kesler is Kesler. He plays balls-out and gets injured.

Tanev is small for a D-man. He gets hit hard A LOT and I am surprised he lasted as long as he did.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Ok this is going to be pretty long so please bear with me and ask questions if the following starts getting convoluted.

**TL;DR** It's pretty reliable as a tool to gauge how effective you're sunscreen is.

There are three ways to test how effective a sunscreen is: *in vivo*, *in vitro* and *in silico*.

*in vivo* is testing on live skin whether it be rats, bunnies, humans or any other live organism (I'm not sure what's the most popular animal used for sunscreen testing though). The advantage of in vivo is that you can see how a product affects living tissue.

*in vitro* is testing on simulated human skin. Cell cultures are isolated from a living organism and are studied in isolation. The advantage of this method is that you can study the effects of a certain product more thoroughly than in vivo. The downside is that it is hard to extrapolate results from in vitro studies and apply them to living organisms because in vitro cell cultures are very simplified versions of the organisms they came from.

*in silico* studies are studies done via computer simulations and often utilize algorithms (or at least I would imagine. How a sophisticated in silico program can go without is beyond me.). In silico studies are pretty recent (the first time the term was used was in 1989) but they are very powerful in that they can generate a huge amount of data with very high precision, better quality data and can support very research intensive products that would take years to compute results in real life. Of course there's the problem of how well you can extrapolate information and apply it to real life, but unlike in vitro, in silico studies can produce very sophisticated results if you put in the right amount of parameters which make extrapolation much easier.

The BASF sunscreen simulator is an in silico program that uses mathematical formulas traditionally used to calculate SPF and formulas used for in vivo and in vitro measured of PPD.

If you're really curious and have a good grasp of first year college mathematics you can read about their methods [here](http://www.personal-care.basf.com/docs/personal-care-pdf/description-of-methods.pdf).

Concerning how they measure SPF, here's how the BASF describes it:

*The BASF Sunscreen Simulator calculates two values for the SPF referring to different irradiance spectra of the UV source. The first value is calculated for clinical conditions as defined in the international test method [2], using a source where the visible light is filtered out, which leads to an irradiance spectrum with a much lower fraction of UVA compared to natural sunlight. The second SPF value is calculated for outdoor conditions using a solar light spectrum occurring midday in midsummer at 40°N [3]. The erythemal action spectrum in both cases was taken from ref. [4].*

I hope that didn't contain too much jargon for you, but to summarize they calculate two SPF values; a clinical value for when sunscreen is tasted in a lab based on an international test method. The clinical value tends to be higher than the real SPF value, because visible light is purposefully filtered out and so the sunscreen has less sunscreen exposure. The 'real' SPF value is also tested in a lab but factors in the solar spectrum  ""occurring midday in midsummer at 40°N"". 

Hopefully that satisfies some of your curiosity on how the program computes its SPF values.

I would also like to note that the sunscreen simulator is the brain spawn of a legitimate chemical company BASF. The first version came out in 2002 (I have no idea if this version, or which version became available for public use though) and was created for sunscreen formulators to theoretically test their products hence why the results page is so difficult to interpret and has a lot of scientific jargon.

BASF (based on quick scan of their company website) publishes research, hires scientists and engineers, and is involved in a lot of industries (personal care, aerospace, agriculture) so I would say that their sunscreen simulator is very trustworthy program. There's definitely going to be some error margin in some computations but I don't think any result you get (assuming you put in the right input, and you're interpreting the results correctly) will be terribly off.

"wildhockey","t5_2rp0l","Goaltending is more than meets the eye, it is every bit as much of a mental game as it is a physical game.   As a fan base we need to keep in mind that he is very young for a netminder and playing in the most elite level of hockey there is- to my knowledge, Braden Holtby is the only other goalie that is Keumper's age.  

Personally, I think (given what I've seen from the kid) that he is going to have a very bright future, but sometimes it takes time and adjusting to get there.

Take Pat Roy for instance, his rookie year consisted of an .875 save %, and a 3.35 GAA.  Hardly the statistics of an NHL great. Sometimes the only way to get better is to go out there and get beat- but the key is to learn from it. 

As impatient as we MN sports fans can be (and rightfully so) sometimes we need to just let the chips fall.   I feel that Keumper just needs time, and the rest of his game will come.  


Sidenote- in the event Keumper isn't the long term answer, Gustafson in the AHL is by many accounts one of the highest touted netminding prospect out there... So have faith, and enjoy watching some young athletes make names for themselves. ","1396310743"

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;As bad as it looks, that is proper procedure after shooting a ""threat"". I think I read they're not being charged but are on paid leave, I could be wrong. If it's true they were responding to previous assaults from this guy then it's just a harsh reality.

After watching the video, I agree that it's 'proper procedure' and I also think those procedures have been put in place in part to limit wrongful death lawsuits or criminal prosecution of officers for doing things like what we're discussing here, which is shooting a homeless man in the back. 

When these officers testify, they'll say they were following procedures of escalation/deescalation, and that shooting bean bags at and letting the dog bite the corpse is evidence that they were in fear for their lives.

Considering the conduct of the officers in this video, I'll take their claim that this guy previously assaulted people for what it's worth: pretty much nothing at this point. That's damage control.

It's obvious to anyone with two eyeballs and a brain that what they did was wrong, and if these people were actual men then they would admit as much.

Let me add that I actually DON'T LIKE homeless people, and I usually side with police on most matters. They are, after all, just doing a job like you and I do our jobs. But If I shot a rickety homeless guy in the back multiple times with a rifle, maybe I'd have the decency to not release a dog to bite him afterwards? Maybe I'd forego the knee to the back while yanking his lifeless arm into a handcuff. Maybe I'd even admit I was wrong to shoot him down.","1396310745"

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","That is one of the most annoying things I come across in online debates or discussion.

Verbal abuse =/= ad hominem

I mean, for fuck's sake, it's right there in the Wiki article on the subject.

I don't know how many times I've explained this to someone ony to get met with, ""Nuh uh! Ad hom!"" It's probably the most overused and least understood logical fallacy.

Just to add on to what you've already stated...

Situation 1:

You say, ""1 + 1 = 3"" and I respond ""That's wrong because your mother is a whore and you touch yourself at night."" That is an ad hom. I'm not attacking the logic behind your statement. I'm simply declaring you to be wrong based upon some irrelevant personal characteristics.

Situation 2:

You say, ""1 + 1 = 3"" and I respond, ""Holy fuck, you are an idiot."" Then I explain why 1 + 1 = 2 and not 3, followed by ""So go fuck off somewhere dummy."" That's not an ad hominem. I addressed your argument and I insulted you while doing it.

It's kind of hilarious, because if you were to declare me to be incorrect because I insulted you in situation 2 (""You used an ad hominem attack, which is a logical fallacy, so ur wrong bud!"") that would in fact be an actual ad hom.

This of course aside from the fact that using an ad hominem argument isn't always fallacious. ","1396310747"

"oklahoma","t5_2qtnt","&gt; Starting wage at a lot of jobs is low. Why does teaching have priority over other jobs?

You're kidding right? You're asking why those in charge of the *education* of young minds is important? If you had a kid, would you be so casual as to not give a shit who teaches you kid and what resources are available to them?


&gt; Why should they get paid for 12 months if they only work 8 months? No other job that I know of works that way, why is teaching any different?

I never said they should get paid for the summer months. What I am saying is the world does not stop spinning just because it is summer. They're still regular individuals with rent, bills, car payments etc. that do not magically stop just because they dont get paid over the summer. They must average out their entire salary for a full 12 months. Teachers *still* work plenty over the summer months. Just because they aren't in class, does not mean they sit on their asses. Lesson plans are made, the structure of the classes, and many other responsibilities are carried out while kids are away. 

&gt;Texas also has a higher cost of living.

Dallas has a higher cost of living. Houston has a higher cost of living. Austin has a higher cost of living. This is why I said region. Texas is a massive state. Cities like those throw the average way up in comparison to Oklahoma.

&gt; Texas teachers also do not have a pension and benefit program as good as the teachers in Oklahoma.
Yep, teachers don't have it all that bad. 

WOW, we managed to do one thing better. 

&gt;Here's what I suggest. Give them a $5K a year raise, but take away the pension program and replace it with a 401k that they have to fund themselves (like bordering states). Also cut down the benefit allowance and make teachers pay a higher portion of their share. Finally, only pay them for the 8 months a year they work, because why the hell should people get paid for 12 months when they only work 8?


Shit like this, is why we need better education in the State of Oklahoma. ","1396310749"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I'm a law school student. I'd argue that lawyer's aren't demonized... at least not many. Sure, there's a pop culture view that lawyers are dishonest and concerned only about money. You mention cop shows--and lawyers are a convenient way for writers to imply guilt. In those same shows, forensic scientists are wizards and cops can skirt whatever boundaries they want to get the perp. But realistically, most older people I know have a lawyer that they trust implicitly for stuff like wills &amp; trusts. I only know a couple of people that have sued or been sued, but they mostly speak very highly of their lawyers.

When I tell people I'm studying law, I have never received a ""lawyers suck"" response. Normally, I get mild interest about what kind of law I'm going into. I tell them I'm going into IP, and I've only run into one person so far that thought that patents, as a whole, are horrible (disregard software patents, they're mostly worthless). It was a fellow law student, ironically.

Of course, there are always going to be people that look down on any profession. Same thing as when I was studying chemistry (organic synthesis), and every now and then (twice) someone would say something along the lines of ""but pharma companies are bad, and their scientists are bad too"". Both times, I just nodded and changed the subject.

"oculus","t5_2uni5","There's no right answer to this, the market is unpredictable and movements might just amount to one large private or institutional investor (think Buffet level influence) backing out. My opinion though? Facebook is expected to leverage their investments but many feel they overpaid for Oculus. I would agree with this, they paid what the company *might* be worth in say 7 years. Facebook has been purchasing a lot of companies and has focused on diversifying its platform rather than monetizing Facebook (which arguably could provide much more revenue and is what the premium is mostly based on). Though Oculus might help them monetize in the long run, it's the latest of a long stream of expensive and seemingly impulsive purchases. The biggest reason why shares probably dropped is because Facebook issued new shares to purchase Oculus and this dilutes the current shareholders ownership of the company especially since the new shares have extra voting rights (I had this reversed earlier, though I'm not sure why he would issue Class B to Oculus rather than Class A; perhaps he is not allowed to issue more Class A). If the acquisition was of a more money making company shareholders wouldn't care as much because the extra value would offset their share dilution. In this case, Oculus hasn't even sold a product yet and they got almost $1.6 Billion in FB shares that each carry extra voting rights. This is why shareholders are not pleased.","1396310753"

If you imagine you're just sitting there, and whenever the thought of work or the like comes across your mind, your vision sort of zooms out from normal and everything becomes a mental fog. Sometimes it even feels like my vision is blurred, because it's just an all-encompassing haze that comes over me, blocking all sorts of mental function and just making my mind blank. It's horrible, but I've become depressed over the last year or so and my blanking mind has sort of been a coping mechanism for times when I've felt super shitty. Unfortunately, it became routine enough to creep into my daily activities, just annihilating any slightly unpleasant feelings at the expense of incompletion of any resultant tasks.

This mindset, though... This is good. I've always been masochistic if it will benefit me, and objectifying that haze as a ""pain"" to be conquered makes it at least able to be grasped and grappled with. Being that my self-esteem is at an all-time low right now, it definitely feels good to have a sort of atonement through dealing with this pain head on. It makes me feel better and I'm getting work done. It's kind of fucked up that I've got to think like this, but it's the only way I can think of to get on the right track, and it's working for me.

Hershel had a line about ""Feral pigs can be domesticated"". Obviously he was speaking at the time about their chances to raise livestock at the prison.

What's more feral than a walker?

What if the Termites have figured out how to ""domesticate"" walkers, ala Bub in DAY OF THE DEAD? Keep them fed, show them who's friend and who's a stranger. Much like you would a guard dog. Terminus has been there since the beginning and they would've had far more time to work on this than Milton did.

"2X_INTJ","t5_2sw4h","It's always easier to stay stubborn. I didn't say your argument based on economics is invalid, whatever that means. I didn't say meaningless sex is the only alternative.

I said it's imprudent to measure the quality of someone's company based on how likely they are to have sex with you. Sex is just a form of social interaction.

You are already making the assumption that girls wouldn't want to have sex with you just because they want to. They would only do so in exchange of something, as if it's some sort of social currency that they can choose to give away. 

Find someone you are compatible with and spend time with her. Maybe she's for you but you may not for her. Go look around more. As someone who's spent exorbitant amount of time just chasing after sex with implicit assumption that that'd ultimately make me feel better, that I wouldn't feel so alone and empty, I'm just trying to impart my thoughts.

If you weren't speaking from the heart (devil's advocate) then disregard everything I said. You'll be fine. If you were, don't say things like that. It's a cheap cop-out that everyone can see right through. No one will take you seriously and you don't even actually save your ego doing that.

Acela, on the other hand, is actively managed to ensure they remain on time, typically by passing a NE Regional.

Yes, Acela is more expensive by almost double (sometimes) but if you are travelling for business it is absolutely worth it.

For the first boss, the snipers that spawn target via line of sight, so we had whoever got targeted run behind the tank so the tank took the shots from them and the DDs could focus on the boss. After the first boss we would pull all 3 groups of goblins, tank would pop hallowed after getting them all and AOE like crazy. The BLMs would also pop manawall during this pull so the gliders don't damage us for a couple of their jumps to make the healer's life easier.

ANet needs to work on direction more than PvE difficulty. Ensure players are actually getting better so you can then introduce more standard difficulty.

So essentially what you're saying is, the current format is bad they need to change it, I don't know how but it needs to be changed. Great, that's fine but they have to experiment to reach a solution. They can test things all they want on paper but until it is on the live client, they won't know if it works for sure.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Imagine that you decided to move to, say, China to stay with some of your friends.

Your friends all speak English, but the culture and language of China is very different, and although you understand some, speaking English is just the way you talk. It's the way your thoughts are expressed naturally. It takes years to learn to fluently speak a language, and even if you do, you will probably still favor the language you grew up with, and the language that your friends and family speak.

In addition, their language is a strong cultural identifier, and if they wish to express their culture, speaking the language is one of the deepest, most meaningful ways to do that.

This is similar to telling people not to dress in their native clothes because they are bulky and inconvenient or telling them not to prepare their native food because few Americans enjoy it.

Some people getting angry for not knowing their language is silly, but you should understand that America should be a melting-pot of cultures, ideas, and languages. English borrows words and parts of phrases from many, many other languages. If we see a word we like, it becomes a part of the English language.","1396310776"

Please don't take this as a rejection, because there is nothing to reject. You need to start smaller and try to get to know people before you blindly offer yourself. Otherwise, someone will eventually say yes, but they will use and hurt you. You are worth more than that.

"GasBlowBack","t5_2wj1q","I don't own this gun, but I do own a few GBBRs.

first, follow this guy's video with how to disassemble the rifle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xUqoW4R1eM. Next, observe where the bolt rubs. This should be almost the entire upper receiver and the hammer (piece that swings forward when you pull the trigger). These are the main pieces you want to keep clean.

After each game, disassemble the gun. With a clean rag, wipe down each of these major contact points. Once you are sure you have removed as much grime as you can, relubricate the gun (specifically in the places you just cleaned). Lastly, decrease the hop up until you do not see the nub through the inner barrel. Cut a small piece of cloth (I use an old t-shirt for both my rag and my cleaning square). Spray a little lubricant on the square and insert it into your inner barrel. While using a twisting motion, run a cleaning/unjamming rod down the length of your inner barrel. Repeat as necessary.

If you follow those steps, you should be able to clean most of the build up. I do suggest taking apart the trigger grouping once every year or two (depending on how often you play). Also, you will probably want to clean your gun again at the start of the season -- you'd be surprised how dust can find its way into places. As you mentioned, if you don't use the gun all that often, you should clean it before games as well. The importance of cleaning after a game is because the gunk will be easier to clean out (dried on is more of a pain in the ass).

As far as which grease/oil to use, I never saw much of a change in performance with one over the other. I'll let others tackle that. More often than not, your points of failure will be in your magazines. Just make sure you keep a little gas in them (so the seals have some pressure against them) and always make sure your o-rings don't dry out.","1396310783"

When did you first notice that you may have a condition? Was it 
yourself or someone else?

I noticed the condition when I was in my early teens, I suppose.  However, I was 11 when it started.

What are the symptoms?

Deep black moods, poor decision making (I tend to quit perfectly good jobs), exhaustion.  

Would you change any of these if you were given the opportunity?

In a heartbeat.  I would love to feel joy, excitement or look to the future hopefully.

What has your illness taught you?

That rest (emotional and physical) is essential.  Talk to others before making a large decision.  I'm now in useful therapy (I'm 47) for the first time in my life, after 10 aborted attempts.

How do you feel during the worst times (spare nothing, I will not judge)?

Suicidal.  I have tried twice in my life but I learned to worry about others (something I had to learn, I lost the ability during the traumatic incident) and stay alive for them.

How do you feel during the good times?

Not as depressed.

What has your experience taught you?

If you're not enjoying life, at all, that's depression and therapy helps by helping you talk out what's happening to you.  Also, it may take a while to find the therapist that helps, not just one that is there.

What are your hopes and dreams for the future?

I don't have any. See my previous answer.  

And, ultimately, do you feel our society needs to improve in relation to the acceptance of mental illnesses?

Yes and no. An acceptance and some ability for people to get help when they need it without stigma but not so far that those who can't cope are babied.","1396310790"

This means that the girl cannot possibly persuade them by saying that ""Forcing me to shave my head is immoral.""

1. One thing I like about myself is that I am very driven and determined. If I set my eye on something, it will happen. Luckily I've also learned to accept defeat with grace.

2. I am currently enrolled at my local junior college, working towards transferring to UC Berkeley. From there, I plan on going to medical school. It took me forever to decided what I wanted to do with my life, but human biology is something that I'm really interested in, and I seem to be doing exceptionally well. Yay!

3. [This](http://imgur.com/JpdnrWM) is one of my favorite looks so far. It was still winter time but was 80 degrees outside and a threw on some orange eyeshadow and new peachy Mac blush and went to town! It was also the first time I attempted a double flick eyeliner. I just felt so good and confident that day.

4. Something that makes me unique is that both of my children were born under water in birthing tubs. The second one (10lbs!) was born in my living room. I took no medication, not even ibuprofin. I might be a little crazy, but like I said, if I wand something, it'll happen!

5. I joined RAOM because I love gifting subs! I started out on RAoA, moved to RAoP, and then onto ROAM. I came back because I was getting bored with my makeup and routine and wanted to broaden my techniques and products used while getting to know other people and spreading some cheer!

6. One thing I learned from RAOM was that Korean beauty products are amazing! I've only tried a few things from Etude House, but I can't wait to try more from them, as well as other brands.

Perhaps the orcs also worshiped this sunstone city, however the hubris of man cause corruption and greed to darken the stones. That when the last of that human bloodline is slain the stones shall shine again.

Problem is that the human family has come  into nobility, power and riches. Most likely due to exploiting this mineral. So it is only possible to try and extinguish them through massive invasion sized attacks to get to them. As is typically the  case, history is written by the victors. As far as the civilized races go the barbaric, traditionalist, ritualistic orcs were the cause of the sunstone disappearance. ","1396310792"

Prosch was not on my radar until I did deep research on the second day of the draft, mostly because of his official position label as a FB. This will most likely be true for NFL GMs as well, causing Jay to go much later than his ability deserves because very few teams justify using a roster spot on a true FB player anymore. In college this is exactly what he looked like, but recent scouting and the senior bowl show a versatile football player that can be used in a variety of ways.

A new term “offensive weapon” has been utilized to label versatile players who can thrive while lined up in multiple skill spots in various NFL formations. I would call Prosch a “blocking weapon,” because he looks and plays like a mobile offensive lineman, ramming into defenders all over the field. Tre Mason’s sensational year and rise to the top of this RB class owes a lot to Prosch, one of the best 1 on 1 lead blockers to come out of college in recent memory. This guy is built like a tanking juggernaut, a wrecking ball with outstanding blocking vision. He has no history of injuries and is the definition of a gritty, hard-nosed football player.

Many of us wanted a big, bruising 3rd down RB in the later rounds, but I think Prosch is an even better fit. While he didn’t receive a single RB touch and only caught 5 passes as a TE in 2013, his senior bowl and pro-day show a versatile back with surprising 4.7 40-yard dash speed. He displayed soft hands and an ability to create a surge up the middle in short yardage situations. 

With the Dolphins needing blocking help in the worst way imaginable, I think Prosch could be a match made in the heaven. Lead run blocking, TE and RB pass blocking, short yardage situations, and special teams are all ways that Prosch can contribute. He is criminally underrated and could become the Mike Alstott of the modern era.

Whew! Apologies for the long winded post. Overall, I think we did fairly well, and would give this draft about a B+. We made a great trade for extra ammo in later rounds, landed 2 of the top offensive linemen, grabbed a future star in Borland, and made off with two steals in the 4th. However, I did learn that this draft lacks depth in the FS position, and I regret not taking one earlier due to draft positioning. I would have also liked to take one more developmental O-lineman before the 6th, but the right prospect just wasn’t there.

Thanks for reading!","1396310795"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have long since made my peace with how things shook out. I was gunning for either teaching or foreign/government work, since in the early 90's the news was that lots of older teachers were going to be retiring. By the time I got out, they had- and school districts had not filled the positions, opting to hire untenured temps instead. And anyon I asked in a Canadian government job, said that degree did no good at all. So, I picked up what I could- in an early form of today's job market, I used my BA to get jobs managing arcades and Sub shops. Later, a friend of a friend mentioned a union job at a warehouse of a local grocery chain, and I applied. That turned into a stable job, which turned into a HO job... which I got dumped from 10 years later, after I had moved my family and started a business here. Luckily, a local store in the chain hired me and I worked my way up to top payrate (10 years in HO didn't count for calculating seniority.)

Most gaming time is not played locally with all your friends. It's single-player or played online. If you want the Wii U to be a console that is only useful when you have friends over, how can you expect large numbers of people to buy it?

I think relegating the Wii U to that position is a mistake. The NES and SNES consoles were not something you pulled out when friends came over - they were the main gaming console you owned.

D.O.A. guitarist Dave Gregg - Rest in Peace

It is with unbelievable sorrow that I have to talk about the passing of Dave Gregg. He died of a heart attack this past weekend. I can't even come close to being able to express strong enough condolences to his wife Cathy and the rest of Dave's family.

Dave was a member of D.O.A. from 1980-88 and played some screaming guitar licks on the following albums: Something Better Change, Hardcore 81, War on 45, Let's Wreck The Party, True North Strong and Free and finally on Murder. He was a great guitarist and an unbelievable showman.

But more importantly he was genuinely nice guy and a caring human being, who had one of the most wicked senses of humor I have ever come across.

On long D.O.A. tours Dave (usually the overnight driver) and I along with our comrades Chuck Biscuits, Randy Rampage, Ken Lester, Dimwit (R.I.P.), Brian ""Wimpy Roy"" Goble, Greg ""Peckerwood"" James and Jon Card would while away the hours with almost endless conversation. But it
usually came down to Dave and I still gabbing into the wee hours. We would scheme about how to change the world and possible wild scientific breakthroughs as we endlessly put up really shitty music on the radio (not much has changed). Dave and I also became very familiar with prices of every kind of crop grown across America and many a gospel preacher on that same radio in the Dodge van we called the Blue Bullet. At one point when D.O.A. had been playing close to 10 years, Dave and I calculated that we had spent four of those 10 years in vans, traveling to shows. As Dave drove he would furiously work his way through bag after bag of spits (sunflower seeds), he would deposit the shells in the door sill of the driver side door until the pile would reach a height of about 12 inches, that was a badge of honor. 

On our first tour with Dave he got really drunk at the second show and forgot about half the arrangements,
as he stood on the opposite side of the circular bar at the venue we had just played, he smirked at me with a particularly dazed look, I realized I had to get him to shape up, so I threw my 3/4 full can of beer across the bar and nailed him in the forehead. Dave rarely forgot an arrangement after that and went on to become a consummate musician and performer.

I could probably write a book about funny Dave Gregg stories and maybe even promote his one man organization: The New Spartans! LOL

I really wish I had one more chance to sit down with him and cover some of that ground again and explore new avenues of thought, but I can't and that sucks.

Dave, we will all miss you tremendously, but you will live on in our hearts.

Long live the spirit of Dave Gregg !!!

"india","t5_2qh1q","&gt; You emotionally invested in a party and you are just in denial unable to accept that you have been taken for a ride.

If there is one party that I was emotionally invested in, it was BJP. That's the only party I have ever voted for. I voted for them in Municipal elections, in State elections and in National elections. Had I been in Delhi in December, that would have been the first time not voting for BJP. But so far there is no party I have voted for other than the BJP. My dad has been a Sanghi, pretty much all his life, which means that I volunteered in all elections for the BJP as long as I can remember. I attended shakhas and truly believed in the BJP. But I have only been disappointed. I was excited about BJP getting the Municipal control in Delhi, but I can't say I am happy about the work they have done. 

I was too young to understand what happened in 92, so still cheered for BJP. But what saddened me the most was the celebrations of sanghis at the killing of Muslims in Gujarat post 2002 riots and how it helped BJP in the elections. The killing of Karsevaks in the Sabarmati express pissed me as much as any other person in the country, but I wasn't ready to hold completely unrelated people in another part of the state responsible for that. But even post 2002 riots, I voted for BJP, because Congress was even worse. But, BJP hasn't done anything better than the Congress. I experienced it long before Kejriwal even mentioned it.

So, the AAP may have disappointed me, but it is nothing compared to the disappointment I got from BJP.","1396310799"

Everyone is going to look different though.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; While we are on the subject of tiny fonts, I'd like to do what I can to squash a rumor that seem to be spreading. The myth I keep hearing is that you must go to larger fonts when scaling up to a 4K monitor. This is not exactly true. Do the math. If you double the screen resolution and at the same time you double the screen width, you have done absolutely nothing to the size of a pixel or the physical size of your fonts. So if you are happy with a particular font setting on your 1920 pixel wide monitor, then you will also be happy with exactly that same font on a 4K monitor with twice the width. In my case, I actually see fonts slightly larger physically on the 4K since I've more than doubled the screen width during this upgrade. So, if you have the eyes to see tiny fonts on your 1920 monitor like I do, then you will see them just as well on the Seiki, or if you prefer a larger font on your 1920 monitor, then that same font will feel right for you in the large screen 4K format.","1396310804"

Same against lights or assaults running, with all lasers. The reticle never turns red, or it turns but only during the last beam miliseconds before fading, so they deal insignificant amount of damage. And I LOVE lasers, I think they are my favourite weapons alongside the SRMs, and can't understand why the devs fucked up all the aforementioned weapons for me and so many others.

Janteyl may have been in the company of an adult male.

Her mother, Kima Johnson, says she was talking to her daughter by phone one hour and the next she had disappeared.
“I called her back the next hour, and she’s gone,” Johnson told NBC Philadelphia. “No clue as to where she is or what happened. It’s a nightmare.”

Police are also baffled by what happened to the teen; they interviewed friends, family, and Janteyl’s boyfriend all with no luck.
“Right now it doesn’t look good,” a spokesman from New Castle County Police said when the teen first disappeared. “Most times people will call someone and she hasn’t.”

Cpl. Jacob Andrews, a spokesman for New Castle County Police, told NewsOne that Janteyl’s case is still listed as an active missing persons case but there have been no new leads.

Police recently distributed fliers in the area where Janteyl went missing and received a few calls but, unfortunately, none of the leads panned out.

It is much rarer now, I'd say one episode every 6 months. 

It can really help to examine why you're cutting. This can be really hard at the time, but if you reexamine things and notice a pattern of triggers you can help reassess situations and identify better coping strategies (going for a walk, punching a punching bag, confronting the person you're actually mad at rather than harming yourself). 

I stopped cutting for 3plus years by drawing my arm in my sketch book and then ""cutting"" that arm with red pen every time I felt the urge. No, it wasn't the same, but it helped, and I was able to look down at an arm that I still associated with myself and see that I had damaged it. This provided temporary relief... And also left me with a lot less clean up. Also: red paint on real arm.

Yes most things the mother does effect their baby in some way, but.. a mother is exposed to SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS while pregnant its very hard, near impossible to pinpoint a cause effect relationship on one thing alone. 

""The effects of prenatal exposure to drugs on brain development are complex and are modulated by the timing, dose, and route of drug exposure. It is difficult to assess these effects in clinical cohorts, which are beset with multiple exposures and difficulties in documenting use patterns. This can lead to misinterpretation of research findings by the general public, the media and policy makers, who may mistakenly assume that the legal or illegal status of a drug correlates with its biological impact on fetal brain development and long-term clinical outcomes. It is important to close the gap between what science tells us about the impact of prenatal drug exposure on the fetus and the mother, and what we do programmatically with regard to at-risk populations.""","1396310808"

Similar thing with Cauldron.

I can't imagine how frustrating dealing with the phantom pains and always trying to figure out what is real and what isn't... which I can imagine is extremely stressful after everything you have been through. I have to think that maybe counseling would help, but I'm not 100% sure. Something worth looking into! I do wonder though if it is just one of those things that time will heal, for example, when you finally are 5 years out from your initial diagnosis and have been clear of cancer for a long time. However, maybe since you don't feel 100% comfortable putting your concerns on your loved ones (I totally understand this by the way), maybe having someone to even just vent to about how frustrating it is might be helpful in healing. 

My husband (30 yrs old) is finishing up 3xBEP chemo right now (tomorrow is his last Bleo!) and I have quickly realized that when treatment is over, even though he will be ""cancer free"", you deal with the effects of cancer for a long time after treatment ends. Just like you are saying, I think psychologically it has a pretty profound effect... You are obviously a very strong and smart person, and you are doing all the right things!

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Unfortunately, people in entertainment have a tendency to ""fail upwards"".

I live in Los Angeles.  I work in the video game industry, and just being in LA means that you inevitably meet a lot of people who work in TV and movies.  Between video games, movies, and TV, I've witnessed or heard of plenty of examples of people who are either horrible human beings or just incompetent who continually manage to find prestigious work.

Part of it is knowing the right people and being part of the right cliques. Another reason is that many of the huge companies that had been around for a while - like Pepsi, which this Matti guy apparently works for - often have douchebags in power positions.  These huge companies can afford to have less-than-stellar people in leadership positions, plus they're so big that they've got enough backups in place to handle all but the most monumental screw-ups.

In the case of this Game_Jam show, if Mattis worked for Polaris, then yes, I'd agree he'd be screwed.  But if I understood the story correctly, Mattis works for Pepsi, and was the liaison between Pepsi and Polaris. Instead of just being a liaison, he evidently powered his way into a creative director position.

Now that the Game_Jam is no more, he can unfortunately blame its failure on the temperment of the independent developers, as opposed to getting the blame for being a dick.  I hope he learns a lesson here, but I don't think it'll happen.","1396310813"
"CHIBears","t5_2s0u3","I think Bears fans have near universal respect for what Urlacher did on the football field and for the Bears organization. 

Does this somehow exempt him from scrutiny? I admire what he did for the bears, but I can still be critical of the way he has acted and his ""analysis"" post retirement. 

Many of the comments he's made about lack of loyalty from the Bears make him seem petty and childish.  Last I checked, the organization offered him a contract and there weren't other teams lining up for his services.  He could have played for the bears last season, but what he perceived his value to be did not mesh with his actual value.  Giving him additional money over what he was worth out of ""loyalty"" would have been to the Bears detriment and Emery made the right call.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah, it's pretty terrible. I even have a bachelor's degree, although I only have some experience in my field. I also haven't had a legit job in almost a year and a half at this point. And of my last two jobs, one I quit because it was terrible (I'll elaborate) after about two months, and the two before that (both of which I actually really, really enjoyed) I was fired for using drugs. I also am about to have a felony on my record - I was in a drug court program but I was unable to complete it, so now I am going to get the felony conviction.

The job that was terrible was working with adults with developmental disabilities. Don't get me wrong, the guys I worked with were awesome. But the job conditions were so shitty. It was minimum wage, which isn't a lot of money to make when the job is so difficult. Also, I would work with other people, and they'd sit on their phones all night and do homework and not help. I know I had one of our poor guys shit his pants pretty explosively one time and it somehow got everywhere - all over him, all over toilet, the floor, the walls - just EVERYWHERE. So I got him undressed and put him in the shower. I asked my coworker for help cleaning up, and she said I didn't need help, she yelled at me for even putting him in the shower, and then screamed at HIM for being so dirty and needing another shower. And he obviously just has no idea what the problem even is, just that this other girl was yelling at him. And my coworkers, that's pretty much what they did. They were a mix of about half lazy and half mean. I couldn't handle it for the pay, and then drug court said I had to go back to rehab anyway, so I just quit. It would have been overwhelming for the job conditions to be that bad just by itself, but with the way my coworkers were, it was especially terrible. There were just tons of incidents like that.

But I will say this: if you can handle that kind of work, and manage to find some coworkers that you like or you aren't bothered by that sort of thing, those jobs are SO easy to get. You only usually need a high school diploma, and if you have a clean background and can pass (or fake) a drug test, you're good to go. They need people so, so badly, all the time.

I am sorry, but there is no way to realize your dream of having a pet universe in your living room. The best you could get would be a [rough computer simulation](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/galform/virgo/millennium/) - which is still fairly impressive.

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","enrollment tracker Charles Gaba is projecting 6.78 million exchange enrollments, with a chance of topping 7 million. 

That figure covers enrollments in private healthcare plans via healthcare.gov and the individual websites offered by 14 states and the District of Columbia. As my colleague Noam Levey is reporting, the Rand Corp. estimates that another 4.5 million previously uninsured adults have signed up for Medicaid in states that expanded that program under the ACA. And about 3 million young adults have obtained coverage through an ACA provision allowing them to stay on their parents' employer plans until age 26.

For Obamacare critics, consequently, the enrollment numbers demand debunking. Here's a bestiary of their arguments for why the figures shouldn't be believed, and explanations of why they're off-base.

""How many have paid?"" (Also known as ""The statistics are full of deadbeats""): We examined this argument a few days ago. We observed that the concern is probably exaggerated and certainly premature, since many people who enrolled late in the cycle, including those in the March surge, may not have payments due for as much as six weeks after enrollment. Many haven't even received their first monthly premium bill yet. 

Figures from states that track this metric, including California and Vermont, show that 85% to 90% of enrollees have paid on time, which secures them the coverage they applied for.  

""Most of them were already insured"": The argument here is that if we've just moved people from one insurance plan to another, we've just been wasting Americans' time and subjecting them to an onerous bureaucratic procedure as well.

The claim is based primarily on a survey in January from McKinsey and Co., which concluded that only 11% of exchange enrollees had been previously uninsured. A McKinsey survey a month later raised that figure to 27% -- still low, compared to expectations.

The major problem with the McKinsey survey is that doesn't say what its hawkers claim. The survey combines on-exchange enrollments and off-exchange enrollments; the latter are likely to heavily skew figures toward the previously insured because those are people merely signing up again with their existing carriers. The goal of the exchange marketplaces, however, is to reach uninsured Americans, and the McKinsey surveys fail to do that.

The few states that do break out their own numbers, moreover, contradict McKinsey. Kentucky says that some 75% of its exchange enrollees were previously uninsured. New York says that about 60% of its exchange enrollees were previously uninsured. That number has been rising over time, raising the prospect that the March surge will include an even higher ratio of uninsured customers; Gaba, who has calculated a time series of New York enrollments based on the state's monthly news releases, calculates that of enrollees in mid-February, at least 92% had been uninsured.

""'Young invincibles' aren't signing up"": This is related to the oft-mentioned threat of a ""death spiral"" in the insurance market -- if the enrollees are predominantly older and sicker consumers, they'll drive up premiums, which will discourage younger and healthier people from enrolling, which drives up premiums, which discourages, the young, etc., etc. 

Federal officials have set an informal target of 40% of enrollments in the 18-34 age range. The latest figures from various states put the enrollment rate at the mid-20% level. But it was always expected that younger people would be among the last to enroll, and reports from the states suggest that's happening.

Even if the statistics remain fixed in the mid-20s, however, the death spiral won't be happening. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that even if the young enrolled at only 50% of expected levels, premiums for 2015 would have to be raised a couple of percentage points. That's nowhere near enough to set off a death spiral.

Moreover, as we explained way back in October, the ACA has a corrective to the death spiral written in. It's called risk adjustment, and it works by paying a subsidy to insurance companies that end up with older or sicker customer bases than they anticipated. The money comes from payments made by carriers that end up with favorable customer profiles. Republicans know this arrangement will keep Obamacare stable. How do we know? Because in a majestically cynical move spearheaded by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., they tried late last year to kill it, calling it an insurance ""bailout."" 

""More people got cancellations than signed up"": The numbers never supported this claim, and the latest estimates make it even more of a fantasy. It's based on the wave of reports late last year of insurance companies canceling old policies that didn't meet ACA standards, which led to hysterical claims that as many as 17 million Americans were being left uninsured.

Rand's figures support earlier estimates that fewer than 1 million people who had health plans in 2013 are now uninsured because of cancellations. Insurance companies that issued the cancellation notices say they've retained ""the vast majority"" of their old customers, mostly by moving them into new, compliant, plans.

""The White House is 'cooking the books'"": This is the last refuge of scoundrels like Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., who made the claim this weekend on Fox News Sunday while the slack-jawed host, Chris Wallace, sat silently by.

What makes this claim particularly fatuous is that the most encouraging figures don't come from the federal government at all, but from states with their own enrollment programs. The eight states with the best records of signing up their eligible citizens in exchange plans (actually seven states and D.C.), all have their own exchanges and websites. Vermont leads the parade at 83% enrolled. California, which leads all states in number of exchange enrollees at more than 1 million, ranks fourth with a 41% outreach rate. 

If the feds are cooking the books, they've cooked them to look worse, not better -- the 36 states that dumped their enrollment responsibilities on the federal government are clustered at the bottom of the list, most of them with enrollment rates of 20% or less of eligible citizens. Many of these are states that actively discouraged or interfered with enrollments of their citizens in health insurance plans -- behavior that should be grounds for impeachment or recall of their governors and legislators.

Of course, even the enrollment of 7 million Americans in ACA exchanges doesn't mean Obamacare is a certified success. There's a lot of work to be done to fix the inevitable flaws in any law as far-reaching as this one. As Noam Levey reported, it amounts to the largest expansion of health coverage for Americans since the enactment of Medicare half a century ago, but many more people need to be signed up in coming years. 

The apparent success of the first annual open enrollment period, however, should show Republican naysayers that this law is here to stay, with all its customer-protection provisions intact. It's time they recognized that the rhetoric about Obamacare's failure has gotten them nowhere. It's gotten the country nowhere. It's time for them to get behind the law, to help get their fellow citizens the coverage they need, and to help fix what needs to be fixed. ","1396310818"

It just surprises me that people place so much effort criticizing the entertainment industry, as if this is where the sea-change of egalitarianism will emanate from. Is the author naive or is she hopelessly idealistic?

Frozen has proven to be one of the most critically acclaimed films in recent years and its been held up as a hallmark film for female representation. Given that context and the sea of positive reviews, I fully understand why she felt that she had to write such a long review about how bad the movie was. She even says that this is the reason for her rant. If it weren't for the vast sea of praise given to Frozen, she wouldn't have written about it.

Personally, I found Frozen to be a seriously flawed film and it's also a film that I would not willfully show a child (though I wouldn't be upset if a child saw it.)

I disliked Frozen from the start (I saw it opening day), but my dislike for the film wouldn't be anywhere near as bad as it is if it weren't for how much praise it gets. The more people tell me that it's the best film ever, the more I feel like we need to talk about the film and why it isn't as good as everyone is making it out to be. This is a sentiment the author seems to share as it is her stated reason for writing her post.

Every point that the author touched on in the linked article was something that she read in a blog. 

I'd suggest you read her [response to the criticism she's received](https://medium.com/p/a620f32e2882) as I thought it was very well written and did a good job of explaining why she wrote the article in the first place. (The response is also a lot shorter than the original piece, so you don't have to read anywhere near as much info)","1396310822"
"fantasybaseball","t5_2quxe","I see what you're saying, but let me try and spin it.

If I'm a manager and my pitcher has given up 4 runs over 5 innings, he really isn't having a great outing.  So I'm not too inclined to let him go the distance unless we're dominating like 10-4.

However if at 6 innings my guy is sitting at 3 or less runs, I'd be more incline to put the ball back in his hands and (depending on score) let him go for the W or keep the score close.

I like the stat. For Felix Hernandez purposes if nothing else.","1396310822"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Nope. It's not google voice. For example, if you have AT&amp;T (or Verizon or whatever other carrier), and if someone calls you and you don't answer, they leave you a voice mail. Normally, on most normal (non-smartphone) phones you'll have to call the voicemail number, listen to each of your voicemails sequentially press numbers to delete, save or play the message. This is a pain to do and most people don't bother checking their voicemails frequently. 

With visual voicemail, iOS has a tab (just like dialer, contacts, favorites etc.) in the Phone app, there's a tab for voicemail. Each of your voicemails is listed there automatically and you can just tap on one of them for it to play. You can delete, replay, save them by just tapping there. Very intuitive. Android has this feature by default, but for some reason (due to carriers or OEMs or whatever nonsense) I don't see it on any phone. 

To get around this, people use Google Voice or [AT&amp;T voicemail app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.att.mobile.android.vvm) or [YouMail](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youmail.android.vvm) or something similar.

"auslaw","t5_2stjv","While I think that's a beautiful argument, I do have to say I think there's a sensible interepretation to that paragraph (though one that still includes a loophole).  The restriction on the rule's scope is that it only applies to *placement* of signs during an election period, not the display of signs during that period.  So you cannot *place* a sign during the period that will remain up outside the period.  Since that sign, on display outside the election period, will still have been placed within it, the rule still applies.

That said, if you place the sign before the election campaign period, it would seem that it can simply stay up indefinitely.","1396310824"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Some tips, in no particular order:

- If you activate the flashlight from the lock screen, you can quickly turn it off without bringing up control centre by tapping on the camera icon

- When you're viewing a list or a webpage, tap the top bar to jump to the top. If you're in an app like Photos where there's a tab bar at the bottom, tap the current tap to jump to the bottom.

- Go to Settings &gt; Usage &gt; Battery Percentage On. When you get your battery way down, this is useful for seeing exactly how much you have left.

- Keep Bluetooth off if you're not using it. It really sucks down the battery life.

- Also, go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh, and turn off a lot of trivial apps that don't need to be updated live like Shazam or other simple utilities that don't need to constantly connect to a network and fetch information while not in use. This is a big battery saver.

- Don't like getting notifications from an app? Settings &gt; Notification Centre lets you turn off notifications for apps you don't want notifications from.

- Install Find My iPhone from the App Store if you need to locate another Apple device that is lost or stolen. Make sure you have it turned on in Settings &gt; iCloud so your own phone can be located as well. You can do this from iCloud.com on a PC or a Mac. 

- Speaking of iCloud, make sure you have backup turned on under Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Storage &amp;amp; Backup.

- If you have a Gmail account in Mail, you have to delete an email by swiping to the left, tapping More, tapping Move Message... and then tapping trash. 

- I have my apps arranged with the first page filled with Apple apps sorted alphabetically and the useless ones in a folder; the rest of the pages are third party apps sorted alphabetically as well. It's useful for finding apps quickly, but it's not for everyone.","1396310825"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt; Bitcoin

The volatility of bitcoin is a market function. When the process rise and fall rapidly it is the market correcting for human influence. This  volatility is also due to the state interfering with the market through regulations and persecution.

&gt; and the far too little gold in existence? 

According to the ancap view the scarcity and divisibility of gold is what makes it valuable as a currency. Since gold is essentially infinitely divisible by measurement, and is also very desirable it both maintains its physical scarcity, and its utility as a wide spread currency.

&gt;They obviously believe that the wealthy deserve it (and I buy the argument in a place devoid of government corruption used to stifle opponents) so would not there be a huge accumulation of wealth by a few and then everyone else is left to be super poor?

In an ancap world wealth is diverse one can hold gold and deprive others of it, but the market will correct for that by driving the value of gold down in comparison to other currencies, silver may increase in utility and this value. So while I may hoard the majority of the gold, others can punish me by switching to a currency I don't hold, or by refusing to do business with me, or even by price gouging me specifically.

In ancapistan the market corrects all woes.

An hour from Toronto could be a city like Hamilton, Guelph or Barrie, where you can get by without a car but it's not great. Or it could be a small town, where your options are very limited. In either case though, you'll need to make friends with drivers to get anywhere interesting in a reasonable amount of time (other than buses into Toronto, and the train from there to Montreal for your obligatory weekend of debauchery). 

You could think about making a road trip of driving up here rather than flying if you have your own car. See some of your own country, and bring your own bit of freedom up here ;). Canadians drive down to Florida all the time; it's manageable if you take a couple days to do it.

Most loose-passive fish or aggro fish would try to slowplay the nuts because they don't want to ""scare you away"". A player shoving 200BB effective into a 16BB pot is not a smart player. Therefore, you have to assume a lot of villains in this spot are just stupid, and have a range wider than sets and JT. I see this all the time and it's usually an underpair from a villain who thinks you're bluffing. This play is so spazzy you can't just assume it's always a villain thinking ""OMG nuts lets shove and hope he has a hand"".

Edit: Also this is very read dependent. If you haven't had enough time to make a read, then there's a good chance villain is a drunk who just showed up at a table and wants to gamble. If the guy is playing 8/7 then it's clearly a villain who waits for the nuts then shoves.","1396310831"

We have Genna Lannister saying that only Tyrion is Tywin's son.

We have Jaime dreaming of his mother telling him that Tywin could not have children who become knight and queen (only crippples?)

We have Jaime and Cersei showing all kinds of Targaryen character traits ( one mad, one brilliant, wildfire lust, only attracted to each other (and other Targs), incest, prophetic dreams)

Connect the dots.



There are some other things in support of the theory.

First Jaime and Cersei not only practice incest, they are only attracted to each other. Jaime has never been with another woman and Cersei says herself that the only person besides Jaime that she ever was attracted to was Rhaegar (another Targ). Why does this matter? It is exactly like with the Targaryens, they married brother to sister not only for political reason but because they loved each other (in that way). Aemon the Dragonknight and Naerys, Aegon the Unworthy and Daena the Defiant, Baelor the Blessed even imprisoned his sisters because he was so tempted by them.

"highschool","t5_2r8t0","Do your best in every class you take, no matter how much you like it or not. Some will say take math/science classes, and there is some truth to that, but being a hard worker with a lot of persistence and grit is more important in my opinion. High school classes - especially the ones you don't like - are a good way to practice that.

Read. If you don't have time/patience for books, read articles everyday. Follow a few magazines you like on Facebook, and you'll see excellent article links everyday. Right now I'm focusing less on engineering and more on business, and I read Harvard Business Review and Inc. everyday. I wish I was doing this in high school! Podcasts are great too. Stanford Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders is a good one if you ever want to bring an engineering idea to life on your own. The purpose of this is not to learn more engineering, but to learn more about different opportunities and ways you can contribute.

(Side note about that: I wanted to be a professor all through undergrad and resented the idea of working for a company, because I thought better work was done and universities than companies. I wish I understood earlier that people do really excellent work at companies too! I encourage you to keep an open mind about your career path.)

Be social. Social skills are really important in life. Being smart will only get you so far. Successful people in any discipline are good at communicating, influencing, and making other people feel good.

Bounce back from failure. Treat failure as an exercise. It happens to engineers all the time because they are always trying new things. If you do badly on a test, try to focus on the here and now and what you can do going forward rather than regretting the past. Developing this habit early will position you well to stay positive and avoid getting discouraged. 

Write to people who interest you. Professors at universities you are considering, for example. They may not all write back, but developing relationships is really important. Getting to know a professor in high school could open the door to you doing university research while still in high school, or could help you get into a university that might otherwise be out of your reach.","1396310836"

Hi, I'm a bot. When I find links to chess games, I reply with PGN formatted for viewing with the [reddit PGN viewer](http://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/pgnviewer).

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Did I call anthropogenic global warming as a scientific theory? You did but not me. To me it is just a politically driven agenda and almost resembles a religion.

Explaining the effect of green-house gases and the warming up of earth due to green-house gases are sciences because they can be explained by equations and well tested laws and experiments. But attributing human activity to global warming is not a scientific process. It is just a process of correlating two trends with information collected on a massive scale. It is not science and pure hypothesis. It is not demonstrable since the hypotheses was originally constructed from the data that should've actually been used for the verification.

You might feel funny when talking about regulatory agenda (global warming science) and feel funny to dismiss a article just because it is from a libertarian oriented economics blog and feel more funny to link from SKS website that can censor content (means that is not a wikipedia) - because it is a joke for you to play with other people's lives with the threat of Government force - but for us simple people, the idea that Government wants to regulate our life is repugnant and is a good enough cause to oppose the agenda.

And since you don't read the actual paper's claim and just go by the global-warming circle-jerk, here's the actual conclusion from Cook et al - 
http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article
&gt;We find that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on AGW, 32.6% endorsed AGW, 0.7% rejected AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of global warming. Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming

Interesting your original sks link doesn't show a different picture either - 

&gt; Based on our abstract ratings, we found that just over 4,000 (out of 12000) papers expressed a position on the cause of global warming, 97.1% of which endorsed human-caused global warming. In the self-ratings, nearly 1,400 papers were rated as taking a position, 97.2% of which endorsed human-caused global warming.

&gt; Nope. There are no viable free-market solutions to climate change. As you can see, only government has reduced pollution and CO2 emissions, while the free-market oil companies are denying the problem exists. 
Government hasn't done anything to help improve the environmental situation. All it does is tax the use of oil rather than helping the fight against big oil corporations. You see to include big oil companies into the free market list whereas most libertarians see the crony corporations in bed with the state and that they both always collude to cheat the common-man
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_energy_suppression

&gt; This is why there are virtually 0.00 libertarian scientists: the mental makeup needed to be a libertarian is not conducive to what's needed to be a scientist. Science is based on testing and evaluation. Libertarianism is based on rationalism. They are completely contrary ideologies. The cognitive dissonance a libertarian scientist would need to have is astounding.. that's why so few exist.

Please don't make any blanket statements like that. The big money for research now is from Government funding and so all research needs to fit the Government agenda. Why don't we see more free-market Austrian economists in the academia and in the government policy advisory. Austrian economics is more tuned to mathematics and micro-economics and much more scientific than statistics based keynesianism etc.. You simply cannot expect funding for stuff that is completely antagonistic to Government stance. Every entrepreneur from MS to Apple to Amazon to Reddit to small players like Uber, Airbnb or bitcoin or paypal etc... are better scientists and inventors. The only reason they are termed greedy and ignored is that they are not on the government payroll.

Libertarians are more okay with 'corrupted' claims from privately funded projects. Alteast there is no monopoly on such projects and such claims and the truth will sort it out.","1396310838"

The horns are heavy (the contras weigh something like 15 pounds more than Yamaha) but the extra weight gives the hornline more projection and volume with less personnel. For that reason, we only need to field 10 contras to get a sound comparable to some Yamaha corps that field 12-16. I've never played a Yamaha so I can't pass judgement, but just about every tuba player I've talked to said they prefer Jupiter despite the extra weight.","1396310838"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay some back story. This happened around the beginning of November in 2013. I had scoliosis and just had surgery that fused almost all of my back; I had just been transferred from the PICU to the Pediatrics wing. I had much less supervision here (No heart monitor, 2 hour checkups went to 4 hour checkups).

I was on a shit ton of painkillers, but discomfort had me awake for a good portion of most nights.

Anyways, I had fallen asleep without the use of any pain killers. I awoke at some point in the night to a pitch black room. Instead of thinking ""Oh shit, now I need to back to bed!"" My brain thought ""Wow, look all my friends are here, lets have a halloween party."" I seriously don't know why, but i was hallucinating that about 5 of my friends were in my hospital room for a halloween party.

So, I turned to my side and sat up (which was not safe with a chest tube in, and i had only walked twice before this and never unsupervised) and began 'setting up the decorations'. In my delusional state I thought I had decorated the and gotten in my ghost costume. Now was time for the party games, I decided we would all play tag. At this point, I stood still waiting for someone to tag me, but obviously no one would since I was alone.

Angered by the lack of participation from my 'non-existent friends' I decided to rip off the ghost costume. However, It was not the ghost costume I ripped off, it was the Gauss all along my back. (Now, I don't know if you've had major surgery, but all your body wants to do is rest! I did not even know that I could reach my back after surgery.) So I ripped all the bandaging off, and turned to my chest tube. I had no idea what it was so the only intelligent thing to do was yank it.
After a few minutes of yanking the tube inside of my chest cavity, I decided to see where it ended, that's when my hands met the raw flesh that the tube was sewed to.

The pain took me into a half awake 'oh fuck what did I just do moment?' So I sat down back into my bed and called the nurses station saying ""I need my nurse, my friends ripped all my bandages off.""

Needless to say my nurse was very confused, and re-bandaged me. Surprisingly, they still let me go home the next day.

TL;DR I rippled bandages off my back and tried to pull a tube of fluid out of my chest cavity without drugs. Also, my mind is very scary.","1396310838"

These days guilds recruit anyone and everyone, regardless of skill, spec, level etc..  Its a symbiotic relationship, and in most cases its nothing more.  Low level characters get guild perks like faster leveling and vendor discounts and the guild bank automatically gets a portion of the gold you make while leveling (and from 1-90 that can be a lot of gold).

What happens is that rock breaks down and forms what is known as rock flour. It is fine enough to remain suspended in water, and this makes the water *blue*. You can even see some of the rock on the slope is slightly bluish. 

You can see a smaller pond in the upper right corner. It is green because it is shallow, warm and algae is growing in it. Neither lake has any fish in it as they are high on a mountain side. You can see a tiny outlet stream in the lower right.

If you look at this other photo I took of Spirit Island at [Maligne Lake](http://i.imgur.com/21PzFAN), you can see that it is also a sort of baby blue. It was raining lightly that day, the angle is different, and the water is a little more shallow, so the blue isn't intense, but it certainly is blue.

The gist is, that these things you enter into ""contracts"" with as you're thinking of them, are facilitated by a system in which all people in the community are agreeing to uphold. One in which money has meaning for example, exchange of market-determined values is the mode of operation. Your second paragraph shows clearly that I've been terribly misunderstood.

The support really should be reading the ADC.  It goes both ways, but it's more on the support to do the reading imo.  OTOH, a good ADC will be able to read when the support is ready to go in as well.

"flying","t5_2qm1t","Here are a couple of earlier threads on the subject:

* http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1v1rsn/what_is_supposed_to_be_in_a_students_flight_bag/
* http://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/1ukfzi/flight_bag_recommendation/

For the first 10 hours or so, I flew with an old laptop bag, and it worked great. I then bought an expensive ASA flight bag (as a treat to myself for really getting into flight training), but within six months, I decided it had been a waste of money. The purpose-made flight bag was ripping out in several places, whereas the laptop bag would have handled the abuse just fine.

A normal backpack or messenger bag will work quite well. If you want to get a purpose-made flight bag, consider trying to find a military surplus bag. For training, I recommend easy access to these items in exterior pockets:

* Checklist(s)
* Charts (storing these in a zipper pocket behind your checklists works well)
* Pens/pencils (preferably accessible without zippers/buttons/velcro flaps)
* Flashlight
* Multi-tool

Inside the bag, you'll want room to stash:

* Headset
* Your instruction syllabus
* Books (A/FD, other FAA publications, any additional books required by your school or instructor)
* Chart plotter and E-6B flight computer
* Kneeboard, if you use one
* Tablet computer, if you use one
* Headlamp
* Possibly a view-limiting device (hood-style or glasses like Foggles)
* Some ""emergency supplies"" (energy bars, a bottle of water, maybe some bandages and alcohol pads)
* Maybe a fuel tester cup, depending on whether your school keeps those with the plane or expects you to have your own

I never needed to carry a change of clothes for cross-country flights, but I can see the benefit to having some just in case.

My overall recommendation: If you don't care about feeling like a ""real pilot,"" just carry a backpack or a messenger bag and use the savings towards a better headset.

I'd be inclined to go for 1"" plywood single layer, and a double layer of polly underneath just in case the perforations in the concrete pierce a layer of polly you've got backup, easier to pull up later too, plus wont warp so easily, im assuming you don't want to fasten the plywood to the slats by drilling a million hole in them?

Been thinking about this for a few minutes now and i think that is your best bet, easy quick, no problems i can forsee, other than slightly warping plywood, the damp wont rot the plywood because of the polly. The drawbacks is it won't be heated and will certainly not help keep your new shop warm, the only way to fix that is next to impossible though, insulate the floor. Another thing, you're going to want to really seal the edges of the polly to the outside walls, otherwise your forever going to be fighting the flies that will surely propagate underneath.

I have considered Plex, but my QNAP doesn't seem to transcode super well.  It's either that or I need to mess with the transcode settings.

&gt; Use an antenna for live TV would be your cheap route and be very stable.

Unfortunately, the antenna reception sucks where I am, so a QAM tuner is out of the question.  Plus, we pay for cable (to get access to HBO Go amongst other things) so I figure we might as well use it.","1396310849"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Hello :)

I am a 6ft (183cm) 32 year old girl (woman/lady/female?? Obviously not wanting to grow up quite yet!) and currently weigh 116 kilos (256 pounds). Was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes 4 years ago and go through stages of wanting to be good and other times of just sticking my head in the sand. At my heaviest I was 124 kilos (273 pounds) but have been between around the 118-120 kilo mark for the last 5 years. I have back pain issues and knee issues. 

Over the last year I am wanting to be good more and more often but old habits die hard - such as energy drinks to keep me going, wanting to lie in bed instead of getting out and about and easy cheap takeaways for lunch and dinner. In the last few months I have started to more consistently go to the gym and making more of an effort in what I eat. 

This weekend just been it has been more and more on my mind. I now enjoy going to the gym (the times that I am going) and am craving healthier foods so have decided to make this the focus in my life and the top priority. Especially as I weighed myself for the first time and found I had lost 4 kilos (8.8 pounds) from the small changes I have made in the last month. Slow and steady wins the race, well for me anyway.  

Wanted to share my goals and use the loseit thread and the progress pics thread for support as opposed to the whole Facebook thing. First step is to go to the gym 3 times a week and introduce clean and lean eating for breakfast and dinner, with healthier work choices than McD's and pies for lunch and keep this up for the next 3 months (as I said I want to take this slowly as have tried to be perfect from day one too many times in the past to think I can succeed that way). I will be stoked to see myself under 110 kilos (242 pounds) as haven't been there in 10 years so that is my initial weight loss goal. 

My main goal is to know that my blood sugar levels are in control, strengthen my body so I can get out hiking and doing physical activities with my friends, and weight wise I am looking to get down to 85 kilos (187 pounds) which is middle of my healthy weight range going by my height and my doctor. But above all I want to be living a life where I am eating healthy, have energy and strength to do things and know that my diabetes is under control. What weight I end up when I am like this I will be happy with. 

Still quite new to Reddit and to this thread but wanted to stop just browsing and actually put this out there and make it real. Any feedback about using this thread or my journey will be welcomed and much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance guys!","1396310850"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","This tells me more about TSCC than it does about John. For those of us clearly on one side of the fence, this can come as a vindication against his attempt to sit on the fence. But really it is a loss for the people we care about still in. If he had been allowed to make fence sitting work as a very public figure, it would have helped a great many people. It is sort of tough to see how when you are in an us vs them battle, but once you take a few steps back, and start to see people who are nowhere near ready to step to other side of the fence but looking for alternatives, I started to appreciate a bit more what John was trying to do. And while ever since he announced his return I was sure the power hungry old guys would never let him be, it does make me sad that they are making the journey out more difficult. 

He offered them a life raft, but they are more comfortable at the helm of the sinking ship, and know it won't capsize until they are dead. ","1396310850"

"MuayThai","t5_2r60y","The only time I was ever able to lose weight was by calorie counting. Determine what is a neutral calorie amount per day, then work to be lower than that. You need to burn more calories than you take in. I've been trying to lose a few pounds again and couldn't do it with just exercise. I was doing Muay Thai 6 times a week and also going to the gym, but I still ate a pizza and a poutine for supper. Can't lose weight if you've eaten 500 more calories than you've burned for the day.

There are also a lot of apps that can help with this too. It sounds lame to look at your phone after every meal or activity, but it lets you plug in all the food you eat and exercise you do, then gives you what you have left to burn for the day. It also helps you eat healthier as you will naturally go for foods that you can have more of and feel full (a giant salad vs. a small order of fries). Previously I just kept track of food and exercise in my head, but the app on my phone works nicely. I've dropped about 15 lbs since the end of January when I added calorie counting back into my routine. And it's not that painful if you make smart decisions.

"halifax","t5_2r77k","I have 3 family members in New Brunswick who are nurses (although not all are LPN's) and have not had the same problems as NS nurses. Nova Scotia instituting a wide ranging home care inpatient program would help cut down on the need for beds as well as dealing with the geriatric population. The problem, as you said is money, allocating more money to health care could be a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul in a province with very limited growth at this time. 

McNeil's centralized health authority platform was later revealed to actually have the potentially to COST money (although I agree that it may have merits beyond economical). I don't think Nova Scotia cannot compete with nurses wages in other provinces. I don't think it'd be too much to ask to cut some of the unnecessary and seemingly frivolous development that's going up around the city in favor of an upgrade to a sector in need of improvement. Nurses are too important to be taken for granted.

Think about this, something my sister pointed out: If you live in a drastically foriegn country, like Iran, all you're going to know about a place like the US (without doing lots of investigating for yourself) is from pop culture. The stuff that makes the headlines. And what's that? Miley Cyrus and that Canadian guy taking over headlines, sex and booze kinda covers it. Since that's 99% of what gets out, you've got every right to believe the US is comprised entirely of those things, which any sane person would judge as kinda lame. So you start thinking of course, the US is a bunch of drunk horny idiots, bigots, and heathens. 

But we know that's not true, but only because we live here. We are pretty chill people more or less.

Likewise, all we get out of Iran, through pop culture and news, is so-and-so wants Americans dead and they beat women. So of course, we all think that's 100% of what goes on over their jut a hayday of wifebeaters and death threats. Scary shit.

"college","t5_2qh3z","First of all, a ""gap year"" is when someone is already accepted into a college and decides to delay their enrollment for a year. Your situation would not be considered a gap year.

Secondly, choosing to wait a year before applying to schools to do volunteer work etc. is NOT going to significantly strength your application. Unless you do something really significant with a big wow factor, your application is not going to be anymore impressive to the top schools.

I would recommend going to community college, getting a 3.8+ GPA, retake your SATs/ACTs for a higher score, and doing some community service in your free time, which would make you a more competitive applicant. You could apply to transfer out after your 1st or 2nd year (getting your associates really isn't that important), and make sure you focus on courses with transferable credits.

For financial aid, different schools have different policies regarding financial aid. Some provide just as much aid to transfers, and some unfortunately don't. You should inquire with each school.

Also keep in mind that super elite schools like the Ivies, Stanford, etc. are almost impossible to transfer into (unless Cornell offers you their guaranteed transfer plan). Top schools like Emory would certainly be doable though.","1396310856"

Nope, see the first point I made. ","1396310859"

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","&gt;I take seriously the thesis that ethics is all a matter of opinion, even given your construal of that thesis (as saying that ethical claims can be true for some people but not for others). Probably people who believe this view accept the consequence that most of ethical discourse is futile. Trying to convince someone not to abort, on this view, is no more productive than trying to convince someone that chocolate is the best ice cream flavor. That seems like a reasonable view, worth taking seriously.

I agree with this, except for the suggestion that discussions of matters of opinion are necessarily futile. People often argue about which opinions are best in practical matters (""Which house should we buy?"" ""Should we go here or there on vacation?"") or aesthetic matters (""Was Inception a better movie than The King's Speech?"" ""Which should have won the Oscar?""), and often convince each other. Isn't this an indication that there can be good and bad opinions and good and bad reasons for opinions? And doesn't it also indicate that opinions can be normative?","1396310860"

I am certainly from a generation where cars were a thing of incredible desire, and I won't pretend that I didn't get sucked into it- I had lots of German sports and luxury cars in the past. However, 3 years ago I had a change of heart and started cycling damn near everywhere. 2 years ago I sold my '09 BMW wagon to buy another bike and the beater Subi. I commute as much as possible now by bike, and I have noticed that sometimes I go a whole week without getting in the car for any reason. I know, ""holy cow, a whole week! How do you do it!?!?!"" s/, but it is pretty impressive to me.

"washingtondc","t5_2qi2g","Some businesses (such as the ones you mentioned) should have targeted tax abatements since they become important neighborhood amenities.

In 2012, I authored the “Temporary Small Business and Entrepreneurship Amendment Act“ which allows temporary certificates of occupancy and business licenses for social entrepreneurs. It also establishes a public database of government-owned property available for temporary commercial use—sort of like a match-making system. If approved by the Council, this bill would make it easier for start-ups to test ideas out in vacant storefronts, and streamline the process for pop-up retail and events in DC.

The question of how to best create a diverse makeup of businesses is one that I’ve faced in my ward—specifically on Barracks Row and on H Street, NE. It’s the age old question-- we’ve got great restaurants and bars, but how do we get more retail?

This is a complicated economic development issue because—from the size of a building’s footprint to the number and type of surrounding businesses—there are several variables at play in creating a healthy commercial mix. One thing we do know is that as an area becomes more successful, the property values rise and landlords are able to collect higher rents. Because a restaurant or bar is able to recoup costs more quickly, we need to even the playing field for retail businesses.

In Ward 6, I authored innovative legislation to provide grant funding to offset the capital costs for new retail businesses and existing businesses looking to expand to include a retail component. The legislation also provides technical assistance funding for organizations, like Main Streets, to help coordinate grantees and vacant properties, creating a closed loop.","1396310869"

Sometimes it was supposed to be just an emergency placement for the weekend that turned into having the kids for several weeks. They had one little girl for two and a half years. So even if it comes down to some government worker saying it will only be a few weeks that might not be the case. There are a lot of variables that go into deciding if and when a parent can have their kids back. 


On another note I dated a guy for almost 4 years (from age 17 to 21) and I really thought I would marry him. After I broke up with him I spent over two years single and then started dating the real love of my life. We got married last year are happily child free.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I've looked for the answer to this a few weeks ago, but Scarlet's shenanigans have changed some of the chain events people used to farm. So I made something of a guide to farming events for experience in an earlier post. Here it is:

&gt;I was in the same situation a few weeks ago. I just got a Necro to 80, now gonna work on Thief and Guardian. I scoured the forums and subreddit on the best events to farm for exp, and ended up with something of a list. 

&gt;I'm gonna assume you have an experience scroll to get you to level 20, but if you don't, just head to any of the starting areas to get to level **10** or so. Then do the Queensdale champion train over and over. This is terrifically repetitive, but each champ is an event and drops a bag, so you'll constantly be leveling and getting appropriate blue and green gear. You can get level 80 exotics, too, regardless of your character level. You want to get traits/utilities that give you speed, and weapons that do a lot of damage. At the lower levels it's hard to get full credit, so you might need to level up elsewhere if you find you aren't tagging the champions. I do this til about level 30.

&gt;At **30**, head to Harathi Hinterlands and go to the southwest area. There's a chain of events that's basically taking a centaur camp and holding it against waves of centaurs. It's a pretty fast chain, so do that til you're almost level 40. Then, head to the north of the map and to the Modniir Champion event chain. You need to be at least level 37 so your hits don't glance off enemies, and even then it'll still happen sometimes. This quest chain is basically taking cloven hoof pass and doing 4-5 events to kill the centaur leader. After the leader's dead, it repeats from Cloven Hoof. The end of the chain is 4 champions, so it's a great way to level and get geared. Do this until level 50. 

&gt;At level **50**, head to the Southwest of Bloodtide Coast to help a Hylek village defend against the Risen. When you get there, you'll probably have to clear out the Risen. When that's done, a Hylek spawns asking for help. Talk to him to start an escort event that takes you to a nearby Griffon Cave. After you're done with that, head back to the village and wait for the Risen event to start again. At level 53 or so, move into Sparkfly Fen and look for the Zintl Holy Grounds. There are 4 events here as part of the meta, just look for which ones are up. What I did was finish the Holy Grounds events, then waypoint back to the Risen defense/griffon event in Sparkfly, then check back on the Holy Grounds. You want to do this until level 60 or so.

&gt;At **60**, go to Fireheart Rise. In the southwest corner of the map, there's a meta event concerning the Grawl. There are three grawl tribes to help, and one defense event for the Ash/Whispers. The meta will tell you if there's an event up. This could get you to level 70. At level 65 I tried the area near Tequatl, where there are the Krait and Risen events, but those were kind of difficult and didn't pop as often as I'd liked. Plus, now that Teq is harder, there aren't as many players there. It might be worth checking out on your server, however. 

&gt;At level **70**, I'd say head to Frostgorge Sound. Orr is pretty empty save for the Temple events (only when the bosses are up), so it's not a good place to farm exp. Personally, I crafted cooking from level 66-73, then just ran around collecting waypoints, clearing the map, and doing dungeons.


In addition to these events, hop on to WvW/EotM when you can and look for a Commander Tag. Run with the zerg and try not to die. Capping points is huge xp for little effort when you're with a zerg. Also, running dungeons on your main and swapping to your alt during the last boss fight is a great way to get a quick 70%. Remember to tell your group at the beginning of the run that you'll be swapping. Usually someone will volunteer to hold the end cutscene to buy you more time to load in. Remember to park your alt in the right zone when you start the dungeon run. Lastly, if you're close to 80 and leveling just *sucks*, check GW2crafts.net to find the cheapest way to level cooking: it usually takes around 5g and will get you 7 levels. ","1396310872"

Its not like your memory gets worse over time. its like what you see on dmt is paradoxical/in a higher dimension or for some other reason cannot be perfectly stored in memory at all ever while sober. It could not be represented this way, it doesn't compute, its like trying to make a circle out of a couple squares. Keep in mind of course im not suggesting this is true just what it feels like to me. I have had the same feeling when dreaming, and I would theorize that the reason dmt feels so familiar may in part be because it is so closely related to dreaming. In some cases (or maybe all cases i just cant confirm nor deny) people actually go into REM states according to mckenna (ive never seen anyone else take dmt). but dont get me wrong, the feeling will stay with you and its possible to have a pretty good memory of it. just not exact and difficult to represent with more than meaningless subjective words","1396310877"

1. Take the Navimag.com ferry from Puerto Natales to Puerto Montt.

2. You can take a bus from Puerto Natales to El Calafate and then transfer for a bus to El Chalten in a single day.  You can NOT do it in a single day the other direction (you have to spend a night in El Calafate).  Calafate doesn't really have anything except for a single glacier that you can do in a day trip.

3. El Chalten has heaps of day hikes.  You can camp, and camping is free, but it is completely unnecessary.  There are at least 3 good days worth of hiking but everyone (no matter how long they stayed) wish they stayed longer.

But at the same time, those feelings of desperation, confusion and numbness to each other - that is extremely personal.

Maybe I'm stretching it at this point, but I'm pretty sure that most of us can agree that the is uncomfortable to watch. Violating, almost. But look at the rest of the film - a fairly uncomfortable perspective on slavery, a violation of basic human dignity.","1396310879"

A denial cannot be construed as guilt and it is impossible to obtain a search warrant solely on the basis of you politely declining to answer questions.

Your gut is correct in the sense that it can indeed be *seen* as suspicious that you refuse to answer questions: just like you would be suspicious if you accused someone of doing something and they responded with the equivalent of ""I'm not telling."" But I doubt it would make officers more suspicious than the fact that they already found drugs addressed to you.

Lying introduces another problem, which is that you are obstructing justice and lying to police. This is a separate offense entirely. It would be theoretically possible to get off on the drug charge but still be found guilty of obstructing justice or lying to the police.

So you are best off invoking whatever right to remain silent you are granted under Canadian law and procuring legal representation.","1396310881"

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day 
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 

**Every year is getting shorter; never seem to find the time. 
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines... 
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way. 
The time is gone; the song is over. 
Thought I'd something more to say.**

Within our bodies though we now know that cells enter a senescent state whereby they no longer divide as a cancer preventative measure and unfortunately these senescent cells release and do a whole host of bad things. They are the primary reason your body seems to age. A lot of research now focuses on controlling/removing these cells and the processes that induce them. This doesn't seem to trigger cancer in the same way as simply switching on telomerase which might be thought of as further down the line. ","1396310887"

**Guide To Young Roddy**

[**Good Sense - (2012)**](http://i.imgur.com/iN3BeZN.jpg)

**[Star Ratings](http://i.imgur.com/7zBBLG1.png)**

This is honestly one of my top 10 mixtapes of all times.  I been a toddy fan since his first feature with his big homie Spitta so I was waiting on his first project like a feind for years. He finally dropped Good Sense 2012 and I had it on rotation ever since.  This mixtape is classic to me; not in the sense that it influenced any other artists.. Its classic in the sense that this is timeless music. Idk,, maybe its just me but I could play this back to back all day and never get sick of it. 

If this is your first time listening to Roddy you will immediately notice the influence Jet Life has had on him.  Its clear that his style is a derivative of Spitta’s but its different just enough (like trademark) to where he can call it his own. The production on Good Sense is immaculate through and through. The flows Roddy lays down on each track are just as interesting. The mixtape is just short enough to where you can digest it easily in one sitting (37 minutes) and just long enough to where you feel like you were given a very quality release.

This project also houses one of my favorite samples of all time from the movie ‘Trading Places’ with eddie murphy and dan akroyd on the opening track ‘Kyle Watson’.  Everything about this mixtapes shows you just how smooth of a cat Roddy is.

Its not as cohesive as its predecessor in my opinion but it didn’t disappoint me in any aspect and I still bump it just as much as #1. This mixtape clocks in at 37 minutes aswell, just like the first one.  It should be becoming clear to you at this point that Currensy is leading a very tight collective with his two most developed young guns, Roddy and Trademark. These three are going to be making big waves in the indie industry for quite a while to come. Whatever is going on over at the Jet Life camp is a great thing.. it must be such a positive creative atmosphere for them to be putting out such consistently great work. Currensy truly knows what he’s doing.


The track ‘4 The money’ is one of the best on the mixtape…

&gt;What up, Mike, that's my step-dad, 

&gt;Homie taught me how to fix a flat, taught me how to bat,

&gt;I know that shit ain't much, but that's way more than my dad, 

&gt;And now I ain't dissing neitha nigga that's my man. 

&gt;But it is what it is, though, my nigga, I'm just saying. 

&gt;My father done it bit, step father done it bit, 

&gt;My momma had a gig, so what that make me? 

&gt;Nigga,the man in the crib small thing to a G. 


The second best track is This One.. this smooth soulful beat just gets dominated by the smooth flow that rides the track.  The content Roddy raps about on this track will leave you satisfied with what you’ve heard aswell...

&gt;I know this life style, might drive my girl crazy

&gt;I know this life style, might make my friends hate me

&gt;My mamma said, ""Boy don't let no money change me""

&gt;Got a bible for my dash and a hammer for my safety

&gt;I'm a beast on these beats they can't tame me

&gt;Shit I’m a rebel with a cause until they lay me

&gt;It ain't no game, I don't know who they think they playing

&gt;And it's fuck you pay me my nigga I'm just saying



Overall if you are a Jet Life fan Good Sense 1 and 2 are necessities; if you told me you were a Jet Life fan and you haven’t downloaded and explored these classics you would be dead to me.

Bales is a very good collab between Currensy and Young Roddy.  The mixtape is made up of a few different producers, from Harry Fraud to King Thelonious to Monstabeatz.  The mixtape also samples Brian O’dea court hearings through-out its tracks; I find the samples to be very entertaining and not detracting from the project at all. Thismixtape samples from the same source routinely throughout the project..

This 3 track EP with Young Roddy was a Christmas Eve gift from Spitta. Judging from my username you can probably tell I was pleased with it. Big Roddy fan so anything I could hear from the young cat excited me. As for the EP, very good. Its only 3 tracks but they are 3 very well put together songs.

Honestly, haven’t listened to this one that much.. It mainly features Roddy and Trademark and of course the big homie Curren$y.  Got some really dope cuts off of it, don’t think many people know about this one to be honest.. never see it mentioned online.

This was a highly anticipated album for me because I am a huge fan of anything where Jet Life members get together and collab.  This album is filled with chill upbeat production and Trademark and Roddy make this into a very well put together project.

I have put my fair share of hours into this album.  It is full of great production that I would describe as ‘epic’. It is a collab between Young Roddy and Trademark but Curren$y has verses on it aswell.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This thread was made for me.

I've lived in 5 different countries in the last three years, travelling with everything myself and my other half need to live comfortably. So my perspective will be of a long term traveller.

1) Read baggage allowances for airlines carefully, and pack accordingly. If you are travelling with a large amount, pre-book excess luggage if you can. Quite often checking decisions are made by whatever airline employee you happen to get at check in, and if they have had a bad day they won't hesitate to pass it on. It helps if you have pre-paid things.

2)Never raise your voice with a check in employee. Be friendly, and if you are going to try and bend the rules or the rules are unclear and you want the outcome that best suits you, social engineering goes a long way. Arrive early, be polite, and take a hot drink for them with you, or a coffee shop gift card from a chain they can get to inside the airport.

3) If you are using an unusual or little known rule to get what you need, carry the policy with you if you can. But be very polite about it. If you need extra baggage allowance, by a third seat and use that seats allowance. Some airlines will argue with you, or try to bill you more. If this becomes a serious issue, it always helps to belong to the airline loyalty program, and politely ask for the employees manager if they are just trying to charge you for the sake of it. Have a box of chocolates on hand.

4) If you have an issue with seating, and it's between that and getting on the plane, get on the damn plane. You do not want to deal with ticket re-issuance and collecting baggage from wherever the hell it might end up. Get on the plane and wait until the Cabin Manager is free, when you get on politely tell the Nearest Attendant you would like to speak with the Cabin Manager at some point. After initial seating and drinks service is fine, don't be a pain in the ass. They may help you solve the issue by juggling the seating when everyone else is already seated/perks like lounge or fast transit passes. Always offer to leave positive feedback with the airline and get their card- if you do this, follow through.

5) If you have food intolerances, never rely on the airline managing it. Their FOH manager may not know what you mean when you explain, and the meal may not come through, especially if you buy through third parties. Always travel with snacks, don't get rude about it. Remember the Attendants are there to save your life if something goes wrong, not bring you a meal. Keep a list of places you can eat in the airports you are transiting through.

6) Travel smartly. If you think that tracksuit is fine because the airport has showers, that info may not be up to date, they may not be available, or it simply may not be possible if there are delays. Plus the stuff in your bags will be rumpled. Most int airlines will be more helpful if you are well dressed.

7)If there is a screaming child in front of you, and you can see it's from pain and not them being a little asshole, offer to talk to the kid, or take it for a walk, or give it some lollies. They are most likely upset because their ears haven't popped, and it hurts! Plus the mother and airline crew will thank you, particularly the airline crew. They can't tell the parent to shut the little shit up.

8)If you need to fill out temp visas to transit, and it's an online application, always make sure you put ""in transit"" somewhere on the form. The algorithm recognizes it and approval can be instant.

9) Don't be an asshole when you don't get your way. Just don't. Be kind, explain your predicament clearly, and ask how they may be able to help you. You will often find they can.

10) If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

*Best airlines to deal with if you have unusual flight conditions. Qantas, Emirates, British Airways, Garuda, Air Asia X (fantastic, and their CEO is really nice) SAA Air (mostly because they are so relieved someone isn't screaming at them.) 

*Less helpful: Etihad, Malaysia Air, most American Airlines( though if there is an issue with your flight time or connections and you are flying united, ask for an SDG. $75 dollars to change your flight to any within that 24 hour period), Avianca (ugh. Don't even ask. They're fine, till anything goes wrong).","1396310894"

They also list a massive increase in spending on gambling and they pick two years 1992 and 2001.  92 was before there was a single casino anywhere in Ontario so gambling in Ontario was racetracks and lottery tickets and 2001 was after almost every casino in Ontario had opened so of course average spending is going to go up across the province at that point.","1396310895"

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","I have a similar story that I would like to share with you OP. 

I have a [lazy eye](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus). It only really effects me negatively when I look at things 3-5 inches away  from my face, then my vision gets wonky. Sometimes I have issues with reading for extended times, but its not major. It may cause other issues in the future, who knows. 

So when the 3DS first came, like everyone else, I was excited about the 3D. But Nintendo started to put out their disclaimers about 3D. Some people got head aches, some got dizzy and others could not even see the 3D effect. 

Knowing my eye issues, I put myself into the ""cannot see 3D"" pile without ever investigating. But then Bravery Default hit the news and ive been starving for a good a turn based JRPG. So I did some research. I looked into whether or not people with lazy eyes could see the 3D effect. The results were surprising, anecdotal, but still surprising. 

The very few results that I came up with were all people like me, wondering if they could see 3D. All them, thankfully, said yes. They didn't have any problems at all. But I came across a couple of people who said their vision improved and it actually helped their lazy eye. Naturally I chalked that up as bullshit and went along my merry way. 

Well I'm here to report that there is a slight chance that it might not be bullshit. Ive noticed that after prolonged gaming sessions, my eye sight seems to have a sharpness and clarity that is completely new to me. Its hard to explain what its like. Ive never needed to wear glasses, so I wouldn't call myself visually impaired by any means. But I do notice something ""new"" when I look around. Whatever that is and whatever is causing it... it doesn't last very long. It fades away after 15-20 minutes. 

Sorry to hijack, just wanted to share. 

tl;dr, I think the 3DS helped my eyes a bit too, maybe?","1396310900"

"rap","t5_2qhas","It really depends on what other genres you listen to.  I listen to a lot of different music, though I tend to veer towards jazzy-type stuff.  I find that jazz combined with hip-hop has a really nice, smooth flow to it and gives the music good depth.  If that sounds like what you might be into, my primary suggestion is a lot of more underground shit.  

Phoniks is a really good producer that's done some nice collabs.  My favorites are him and Antililly:

https://soundcloud.com/phoniksbeats/anti-lilly-phoniks-young-g

and his work with Awon:

https://soundcloud.com/awon/awon-phoniks-streetsaga-remix

Jazz stuff captures an old-school vibe that I really like but the new variations on it keep it fresh.  If you want to go a step further, check out the album ""True Indeed"" by Surreal and the Sound Providers, as well as their solo stuff like ""An Evening With the Sound Providers"" and ""Looking Backwards.""  Real tight shit and I think you'd like it.

I realize this is pretty in-depth and I could go on, but I hope you find something you like with this.","1396310901"

Also with Cena, I have no respect for white people that try to act black and thuggish. People can say that's just a character, but how did that character come about? because he used to freestyle backstage and they told him to do it in the ring. Plus he put out an actual rap album! He has strayed away from all that but like I said all this Make-A-Wish/kid friendly/rise above blah blah blah is all a bunch of ego driven bullshit. Does WWE constantly force feed us whenever anyone else grants a Make-A-Wish wish? Maybe 1 time for every 15 times they mention Cena granting wishes. I occasionally see him whipping around town in his $350,000 or probably more black ferrari, I'd be more impressed if he had a less flashy regular-ish car. When I see him, I don't think ""Wow look it's John Cena"", I think is this guy really going through a mid-life crisis like all the other Ferrari/Lamborghini drivers i see around town? How and Why?

She *should* use them as short term solutions, but all too often, improper training and time restrains cause doctors to allow patients to stay on them for years (like my doctor did with me). Klonopin is usually used for weeks, occasionally months by most responsible physicians. You should want to seek alternatives, because if you enjoy it, you're going to enjoy continuing to take it. You'll eventually build up a tolerance, especially if taken daily, and need more and more to get that same relaxing feeling that you have now. After your tolerance goes up over a month or two, you might find yourself running out early. My advice is to take what you need, but be completely honest with your doctor during your checkups about how much you're taking. I've seen people make very poor choices after getting hooked on Benzos, so be careful. PM me if you need to chat","1396310902"

doing remake on the same day put SK in advantage position, they knew what strategy Gambit prepared for them and how to counter it and they were in good morale knowing they get another shot and Gambit were in completely opposite situation, they worked hard on preparing a specific strategy for SK which couldnt be used anymore and their morale was down for same reason SK was up. 

so to sum it up:

* SK was put in disadvantage because of ref mistake. 

* Riot came along and said hey SK we will fix it up for you. but on the way they put Gambit in disadvantage situation. 

* nothing happens, unlike SK Riot does nothing to help Gambit.

* ...pitchforks...

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt; Its not their money, because they haven't earned it. Thats like saying that if my friend lends me his car its now mine.

The money received by SNAP recipients isn't lent, it's given. To use your analogy, if your friend gives you his car, yes, it is now yours. 

&gt; You'll never find it because sociologists are biased as is their research.

Ah, we're back to the old conspiracy thing....

&gt; No, I want them to lower the amount of aid given to an amount that allows enough food to be bought if it isn't junk food or name brand food.

Once again, cheaper food is not high quality. Less money means less ability to buy quality, healthy food.

&gt;You paint a picture beneficial to your story, but that just isn't how it works. There are numerous people who abuse benefits, or ride around in nicer cars than those who are just scraping by on their own income.

Still, if someone has a low enough income to qualify for foodstamps, they aren't well off. It's simple economics. And once again, the viewpoint arises in your arguments that holds resentments towards poor people who might have nice things. It's back to the old ""they need to know their place"" idea.

&gt; Nothing in the constitution authorizes the use of tax money in social programs.

The Constitution states that the government must promote, even using tax money, the ""Welfare of the People"". Thus tax money can be used to aid those in need. Don't like it? Take it to the Supreme Court.

&gt;You care to show me the math on that?

About 1.5% of government tax revenue goes to SNAP. SNAP serves over 46 million people. Thus the money each citizen pays, unless they're paying millions in taxes, amounts to less than a tenth of a cent per person being served.

&gt; Just because I want a person to have enough money to cover all of their own expenses, doesn't mean I don't like human contact.

You missed the point entirely. We're all dependent on other people. Your idea of total independence within a society is a delusion. Civilization is built upon mutual aid.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Basically what I have learned from my experience with break ups is that there are one of two ways to handle things:

1) Try to be friends with them. This often involves generally trying to win the girl back. Going out of your way to do shit for them. Being a try-hard. There is an extremely small chance that you are James Bond and you will do and say all the right things during the course of this action and it will result in becoming one of her new good friends or best case scenario if you just knock shit out of the park actually getting her back. The problem with this is that there are a lot of pitfalls. In other words, there are a lot of times during the course of ""trying to be her friend again"" that we men can seriously fuck up and irritate (women are easily irritated) or make the woman more distant from us. This option is also just plain hard, and makes you over extend yourself. It ALSO gives the woman lots of opportunities to analyze what you're doing. Why did he bring me flowers today? Why did he send me that txt? Jeeze he sure is trying hard. etc.

Or take option 2) Be a civil gentleman. Only communicate with her during your natural encounters (at the office) and act as if you are a gentleman whom already has a wife but is simply being chivalrous towards her. You may also send her txts for birthdays or other *important* occasions only. Show her you have your shit together, and are happy enough with yourself that you can be nice to her when you cross paths, but don't feel obliged to do anything outside of that. Do not give her any opportunities to analyze your behavior. In other words, send her home with this thought: ""I wonder why (your name) doesn't talk to me more. Every time I see him in the office he's so nice but otherwise ignores me. Why isn't he trying to talk to me?""

You want to get the girl interested man. Make yourself someone whom when she encounters is nice, but she gets nothing outside of that.","1396310907"

But majority were better off physically and their are different reasons for this. 

Firstly, a majority of the populations during the olden days were poor.. and not modern poor, but, like dirt poor. Without money, they didn't indulge themselves in food as much as modern people can. Less food = Less fat. 

Secondly, a majority of the population also did hard work and were able to exercise often. With less food, more exercise, they were all in better- shape. 

Finally, there were in fact gyms - the word gym comes from gymnasium which originated in Ancient Greece. For those to come after Ancient Greece, there were still athletic events that you had to be trained for - such as jousting and wrestling - and many did train for them. By the 19th century, gymnasiums had returned and the modern day gyms are descendents of those gymnasiums that started then. ","1396310908"

Dad sliced open his pinky finger breaking his dorm room window in college. Sprayed finger blood all over an elevator and a nurse. 

I now have a three or four inch scar on my thumb from 6th grade when I whacked it against a very sharp piece of metal in p.e class, trying to jump on the piece of metal. Bled like a bitch. 

Brother thought it would be cool to stick a small piece of gravel in his nose. Tore something in his sinus and it bled for 6 days. He was about 6 at the time.

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","I would suggest JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. It's action packed, ridiculously over the top, and very awesome.

Manga wise I'd say check out Akame ga Kill. It's a series that comes off as a VERY stereotypical shounen, but by the time you finish the first chapter you'll be yelling in shock. It's getting an anime adaptation later this year.

Hunter X Hunter is currently being adapted to an amazing anime, and it's over 3/4 of the way through, but the manga has been on hiatus for 2 years so they may have to end it soon. Excellent series I'd highly recommend.","1396310917"

"paydaytheheist","t5_2t0hx","I was playing Firestarters day 3 on the console, on Proverkill. I join a game w/three randoms. Who were pretty good players I was 89 at the time. We had been trying to do stealth. It was an intense 10 minutes of casing just trying to kill the cam. guard. The three were still wandering the bank with masks on. While I was walking around in casing. 
Theses guys get antsy ""dude put your mask on, were gonna kill the remaining guards in the lobby.""

Now all of them have mics but the quality of their voices were terrible they all sounded the same. So it's hard to even distinguish them. One of them tells me to ""Get over here so we can kill two guards an answer their pagers."" 
My initial reaction is WHERE!!! All three of you can talk but not direct me to A,B or C?! So I run to the lobby where only one guy has covered. The other two take the office space. 

We go in kill the guards and dominate all the hotdogs. While all of us were in the process of answering the pagers. Stealth is broken, cause a civvie ran out of the bank. All of us have suits, and are in the middle of Proverkill. We made it with all the money so we got that going for us in the end which is nice. But I should buy a mic for communication though.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I don't believe we have a purpose in life. Not a point or even a reason for it. Things are going to be bad. That's life. It's not only your life and it's not only mine sometimes. That's just life.

You think life is bad right now, I get it. I've been through depression so many times that I've lost count. But I learn from it. I seek a reason why the depression is there and what needs to be done to get it away. 

Time is going to heal you.  I think the worst part about our lives is that we are afraid of opening ourselves. And I get why. People who are happy with their life and haven't had a bad time for a long time don't want anything to do with negativity. ""The rich gets richer and the poor gets poorer"".

We don't have a purpose in life. People might say that ""I've been wanting this my whole life and god send me here to do this"" bla bla bla. That's a fucking lie. We're not born to do shit.

What we are born to do is to live life. To dance through life. Follow our hearts, that feeling that tells us that ""this is something special"". Because that's how we feel alive. Love the pain and understand why it happens to you.

Life isn't just one way up. Life is a circle. Just like summer and winter comes every year, comes motivation and new opportunity.

* it's not a ducking caste. This is not India. Individuals are not bound to groups in society. 

* I have no idea where to start on only giving 25% of income... I'll start with the fact that it is completely unreasonable. I don't see you donating your entire income to charity?  Secondly , it takes away the incentive to work; a huge factor that drove the USSR into the ground. That brings a whole nest of problems. This boils down to an applied capitalism vs applied communist... And guess what? The standard of living in capitalist countries greatly exceeds ones in communist countries. No one gets richer in communism; everyone either gets poorer o[r dies.](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Book_of_Communism)

* no, everything is *not one*. Frankly, I have no idea what you meant by that statement. If you mean all of our money is shared, it flat out isn't. My dad earned his money by being a damn good attorney (contract, wills and trusts). Except for taxes, he can spend it on whatever he damn well pleases; it's called incentive to work and it's the driving force behind our economy. 

* I don't think you understand international politics. We have enough food to feed everyone in this world plus 2-3 billion more. It's just that, in poorer counties, it's being controlled by ruling parties or being suppressed by socialistic policies (similar to the dekulakization of the early USSR). In places like Somalia, the leading warlord will sit on bags of UN rice while opposing families starve. Ever see the movie Black Hawk Down? Well, that's why the US went in. As seen in Africa, one of the best ways to end poverty is introducing education and a capitalist market. 

You got a little mean there. I'm going to be a bit harsh and condescending back. My family donated $45,000 last year to charity. My dad is on a board of an organization that sets up golf and dinner fundraisers for cancer research; Last year, they raised about $3,000,000. My dad's business sponsors a very poor Mexican soccer team that our secretary's son plays for. All of this was done while paying high taxes (dat California). I'm a semester away from commissioning in the Marine Corps through the NROTC program. Now tell me; what the fuck have you done for your community and country besides sticking needles in your arm? 

Edit: your portrayal (using $1) is wrong and biased. I don't follow your logic at all. My dad earned "" the dollar"" and gave a quarter away. A dollar wasn't handed to him with instructions to share. But he did anyways. ","1396310924"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Okay. I'll point out that mistakes are also possible when speaking or interpreting any language. I could see something red and my mind could wander as I'm writing and I could write blue

And, that would be a mistake. If you are trying to observe your inner experiences, then you have failed in this case. You wrote that you had a red experience, when you in fact had a blue one. Can you agree with this?

&gt; Well, you've defined that experience S is real. The individual in your scenario has decided that symbol S will represent experience S. How is writing down ""S"" any less real than writing down ""red""? In both cases, the reader or writer could err.

Yes, exactly. I take this argument to be an argument from absurd conclusions. If language functions in this way, then language can't do the things it must do. The possibility for error is vital to the very argument. The question is: what procedure can we, in principle, take to sort false attributions from proper attributions? When one writes, ""I experienced S at T."", what are the truth conditions? Certainly, this is a truth apt question, so there should be an answer.

&gt;You could internally experience red in the way that I internally experience blue and vice versa. However, you would say ""red"" to identify your blue experience and I would say ""blue"" to identify my red experience. Since we would agree on the token used to describe the experience there's no way we could know of the difference. 

Yes and no. I don't take this to be an epistemic argument. While I say things like, ""How can you tell the difference"", I take the problem to be conceptual and categorical. This is a problem about how to sort things. On one hand, we have normal cases in which we correctly identify, and, on the other, we have divergent cases in which we incorrectly identify.

It is an argument against an empirical view of language, in which symbols are posited as representations of experiences in the mind. In this view, conceptual categories exist in the mind, and language is built to reflect these conceptual categories. One could substitute any experience in for S, and the thrust of the argument remains the same. The pont is to attempt to build a system of language starting from individual experiences that accounts for the truth value of these experience reports.

In this sense, the reversed qualia case is immaterial. It doesn't matter what we call blue or red experiences as long as we can reliably verify the truth value of experiential reports. To see blue objects as red, is to say that all cases of red for me are called blue by him. The fact remains that one can either fail to use the right label for our inner experience or we can succeed. With this kind of language, however, it seems impossible to define success conditions.

&gt; Did you mean to say they are nomologically impossible? Otherwise it's sounds like you're saying they're possible both metaphysically and nomologically.

My goof, yes. I meant nomologically impossible. It is incompatible with the physical laws of the universe.

&gt;&gt;Given this, we can take speakers at their word, when they say that they have a given phenomenal experiences. 
&gt;I don't agree we can be certain of this.

I am not asking for epistemic certainty. I am asking you to accept that there is an independent fact to the matter. Certainly, you think that there is a fact of the matter that we are capable of capturing in language.

&gt; If the speaker has told us they have some unique experience they are unable to convey the details of (but we believe them for some reason), and they have defined symbol ""S"" to stand for that symbol and we do not err when interpreting their speech and they do not err in emitting it and they also can distinguish this experience internally, I really don't see what the problem is. If they say ""S"", then they have had that experience.

They are generally capable, but not unerring. They can reliably pick out the sensation, but some occasional mistakes will creep in. If it makes it easier, replace S with red. This person has a red type experience that they can reliably identify, but not perfectly. You can't fully understand what it is like to be them experiencing red, but you accept it. There is a defined symbol made just to refer to red experiences, and you can recognize it. How would you be able to sort the true from the false claims, if you had access to everything but the brute fact (ei. That is true, this is false).

&gt; If you allow for errors in any of those cases, then it seems like communicating information about any other experience is subject to the exact same problems.

One needs to define what an error is before one can spot them.

&gt; Perhaps language in the way you are talking about it simply does not exist.

So, you think it is impossible to report our experiences. If this is the case, how does empiricism work? If we can't tell other about our observations, what are we up to when we write a lab report?

&gt; I don't think we can, because we can only show a token in place of the experience. We can't communicate the experience itself. So how could we agree that the token represents a specific type of experience? There's no way to establish a definition of the token.

Yeah, that is exactly the problem. Either a description of the experience is needed or direct reference is possible. If direct reference is possible, then others can access our experiences. Therefore, language would have a public nature. If description is needed, then experience needs to be described and defined for others to understand. Language would be private in nature, since others can't direct reference experiences. However, the second option seems to lead to absurd conclusions. Therefore, the first must be true.

&gt;Well, if you can show how those other options are more ""true"", then I'm certainly interested. If those other options are only appealing because you like the ramifications better, then that won't convince me.

Out of curiosity, do you accept reductio ad absurdum as a valid argumentation technique?","1396310926"

As Facebook grew larger and became more important, it could have chosen to maintain or improve those controls. Instead, it's slowly but surely helped itself — and its advertising and business partners — to more and more of its users' information, while limiting the users' options to control their own information.""

The main issue in a time library is semantic correctness. Most time libraries are built on a semantically incorrect and incomplete design, and as a result there are many buggy programs out there.

"mmt_economics","t5_2t76b","&gt;  and then you jump into an explanation which consolidates the Fed into ""the state"".

The state encompasses all the institutions established by authority of the sovereign. On what basis are you claiming the Fed falls outside of it? Here you're not arguing with MMT, you're arguing with basic institutional structure. Even the Fed describes itself as independent *within* the government.

So no contradiction there at all.

&gt;As I have said before, I don't think it's correct to construct a view where there is a ""hierarchy"" of money based around ""state money"" 

As pointed out elsewhere in this thread, the use of the word hierarchy is appropriate because it describes relationships based on *authority*. My personal check is subordinate to bank deposits because it's a promise to deliver bank deposits and I don't have the *authority* to issue bank deposits. The same relationship exists between bank deposits and government-issued liabilities.

You like to talk about composition of the money supply, pointing out that privately created IOUs vastly outnumber those issued by the government *as if* that somehow contradicts MMT. It does not. MMT also points out the very same thing. So does everyone else. That broad money is greater in quantity has never been disputed.

&gt;therefore rendering everything else as something that is ""leveraged"" from this ""base"". I think it's wrong. 

In order to say it's wrong you have to first *accurately* describe the concept you're talking about. You have consistently tried to paint the notion of leverage as a causal factor or prior constraint in the way that neoclassicals use the money multiplier. That construction is false. As a result, the critique you offer based on that construction has nothing to stand on.

&gt; If you don't understand my argument then please reference the aforementioned texts. 

I understand it fine. If you're having trouble understanding what the hierarchy of money is describing, you can find some good further reading here: [Money as a hierarchical system:
legal and economic perspectives](http://www.modernmoneynetwork.org/seminar-1-money-as-hierarchical-system.html)

&gt; And if you don't think it's a material difference then you might as well claim that there's no difference in any economic theory as this gets to the very root differences in many different ""schools"". 

That's a pretty confused viewpoint. There are differences between how schools view operations at a general level. What you're doing is taking a specific *example of* a general idea and claiming you've disproved the general idea. The logic of that approach fails right out of the gate.

&gt;Popularity really does matter.

It's not a measure of accuracy.

&gt;In my view, that largely stems from the overly aggressive and demeaning way in which its adherents attack people. I mean, look at us. We agree on a lot and we basically hate each other.

I don't hate you, I just point out the contradictions between how you portray MMT and what MMT is. Subsequently you adopted a particularly angry and hostile posture and here we are. This is old ground, we've covered it before. You respond as though the individual you're having an exchange with is an amalgam of every person who ever hurt your feelings then act surprised when that doesn't go well.

&gt; The difference is, I don't also go bag on other Post-Keynesians. I've nothing against Lavoie, Palley, Keen or any of them. In fact, all this hatred seems to come from and get deflected back in one direction - at MMT.

You went nuclear on MMT economists when they didn't reframe their work according to your objections to the JG. That's it in a nutshell. That's personal on your part and something for you to sort out and it doesn't transmit to ""Lavoie, Palley, Keen or any of them"" all of whom have their own individual relationships with MMT at varying levels of collegiality. 

&gt; At what point do you guys realize that it's not everyone else conspiring against you and that maybe the problem is with your message and the angry and nasty way you deliver it? 

Are you genuinely blind to the fact this ""nastiness"" you describe is simply what you *bring* to the discussion?","1396310931"

If we go against the bruins, I would say that there is slim to no chance that we will advance. However, if we take on the pens, we have a shot. If we make it past the first round, then we will definitely have Z and Dats back, and with them we would have a much greater chance in doing some real damage in the coming series'.

&gt;___Masala chai___ (/tʃaɪ/; [Hindi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi_language): मसाला चाय, literally ""mixed-spice tea"" [Urdu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu_language): مصالحہ چاےٴ‎ [Nepali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepali_language): मसलेदार चिया) is a [flavoured tea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_blending_and_additives) [beverage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beverage) made by brewing [black tea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_tea) with a mixture of aromatic [Indian spices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_spices) and [herbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb). Originating in [South Asia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia), the beverage has gained worldwide popularity, becoming a feature in many [coffee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse) and [tea houses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_house). Although traditionally prepared by [decoction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoction), retail versions include [tea bags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_bag) for [infusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infusion), instant powdered mixtures, and [concentrates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrate). In many places, there is a misconception that ""[chai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chai)"" in itself is made with cardamom, ginger, and the other common spices. However, chai is simply the Hindi word for tea and can be prepared black, with milk, without sugar, etc.

Speyside / 60.2% ABV / NCF / $78

Batch 45

* Color: A deep, rich amber.

* Nose: Heavy with sherry, reminding me of the syrupy raisin glaze you’d put on a cake.  Some oak.  Brown sugar.  Angel food cake.  Baby powder, interestingly enough. Plain meringue cookies.

* Taste: Really explodes on the palate.  Earthy sherry.  Golden raisin.  Figs.  Spiced rum.  Toffee and some cocoa.  Perhaps a touch of praline.  Water turns up the sweetness here.

* Finish: Rises up into an intense but pleasant burn that sticks with you.  PG tips black tea.  Ginger and orange.  Cocoa.  Mint.  Water dials down the burn and brings an interesting dark chocolate bitterness to the finish.

* Overall: The nose, taste, and finish of Aberlour A’Bunadh are like a three-punch combination from a champion boxer.  The warmth and spiciness will keep me coming back to this one.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I know this is from like two months ago, but I just saw it. I'll elaborate.

As for what he does, he uses it as a form of possessiveness. He's a switch that seems to lean toward dom, so if we are out and he's feeling possessive, he drapes his hair over me while holding onto me from behind. It feels like a claiming, so much that I don't even care about his hands.

During sex, he leaves it down and drapes it on me, or brushes against me with the tips of his hair. He does not like hair pulling, though, so I do not do that, but I do touch it and run my fingers through it.

As for what I do, I tend to do something sort of like ""hair worship"". I wash his hair for him whenever we are not in a rush. I mix up custom conditioners and oil treatments, as well as hair rinses, and I apply them for him. I also brush his hair in such a way as to prevent breakage and any pain on his scalp. I also randomly touch his hair, even in nonsexual situations (particularly if I have been drinking). And when cuddling or watching tv, I usually put his hair on me somehow.

His hair is thick and long enough that I don't get much hair on his face or mine. It's so long that it is pretty heavy so it seems to weigh itself down and somehow does not get in the way. Usually it is my hair on either of us (my hair is fine and thin, and a little past my shoulders).

There's also a slight animalistic aspect to it. I like the whole lion/lioness relationship. While he has a preference for monogamy, we stick to other aspects of the role. I tend to be a provider and he is a little bit lazy (and gorgeous). He can take the front stage and I can give him what he needs (I'm a graduate student in STEM that makes quite a bit more than him, and he is a starving musician).

As a contrast to him, he wants me to cut my hair really short (like a pixie cut or mohawk). I'm considering it. It would probably look good, but I also like my hair as long as it is.

Hope that helped!","1396310935"

That game was not fair and I NEVER seen anyone in an entire team have 99 kills or nearly in every team.

I know you're giving me the advice here but look, ""boss"". The bottom line is this: I didn't pay 50$ for game to be cheated on. A major multi million dollar corp is getting paid far up the ass enough to shit diamonds. They got the money, but they don't have time to fix the amount of bull shit laying around with glitching, hacking, exploiting, or other trash going about recently? Is their time that limited to fix the damn game? Look at battle field series, Titan fall (no, I do not own it or Xbox either), or other multi platform games. They get on their ball game.

I'm not the biggest greatest player in the world or the worst. If something is wrong, something needs to be said. YOU clearly stated a key factor. I didn't have enough time to move around, break out of ""spawn trapping"" or the right team.

There are other drawbacks though: the bikes tend to swing a bit so you are more likely to get scratches, particularly if you are carrying multiple bikes. You also have to be careful with the cables that run along the top tube. Get some extra padding and straps and it should work out.

The better option though, is a rack where the bikes are supported on the bottom by a platform for the wheels.

Edit: I should add that there are plenty of ""trades"" in non-revenue generating assets that are not arbitrages.  Plenty of macro or commodity funds will take e.g. long oil positions on the thesis that there will be political tensions in the mid-east.  Similarly, the difference between a trade and an investment, in practice, can be quite vague.

I'm not gonna type up a whole essay for you because I don't have time. Please do your own research because the things you've been taught are wrong. Factory farmers DON'T want animals to build muscle since that makes the meat tougher to chew. For example, calves bread for veal are chained up so they can't move. Animals are restricted to extremely small spaces. Industrial farms prioritize profit over the welfare of the environment, animals, workers, and the consumers. There are dozens of videos depicting workers dragging, beating, throwing, and stabbing animals.  ","1396310941"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I had a sister who went through the same thing with her husband. He gained a significant amount of weight since the start if the wedding. And she lost attraction. (And for anybody that lives in candy land and says physical attraction isn't important. Get real, yes it is. It's one of the founding bases of a relationship and stays true till the end) but not being honest is your mistake. You have to let her know how you feel, and why you aren't having sex. My father gained over 200 lbs in his marriage before he passed. My mother and him didn't have sex for seven years before that. And it was the biggest strain on the marriage.  She lost attraction simply because who he was was not who she married. And she saw it was an obvious self-loathing mechanism. But my father being the old school man he was, wouldn't let anyone call him out on his shit or else he'd blow a gasket. If my mother was only honest and supporting, maybe he'd have lived. Who knows? But honesty is the route you need to take. I don't believe your an asshole, I just believe you are being honest with a very primal part of yourself; and it's a part that we all have.

 [**Strabismus**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__Strabismus__ (/strəˈbɪzməs/, from Greek *strabismós* ), also known as ___heterotropia___, is a condition in which the eyes are not properly aligned with each other. It typically involves a lack of coordination between the [extraocular muscles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraocular_muscles), which prevents bringing the gaze of each eye to the same point in space and thus hampers proper [binocular vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision), and which may adversely affect [depth perception](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception). Strabismus can present as manifest (heterotropia) or latent (heterophoria) varieties, and can be either a disorder of the brain in coordinating the eyes, or of the power or direction of motion of one or more of the relevant muscles moving the eye. Strabismus is primarily managed by ophthalmologists, optometrists and orthoptists. Strabismus is present in about 4% of children. Treatment should be started as soon as possible to ensure the best possible visual acuity   and stereopsis.

"lostgeneration","t5_2r40j","First let me clarify that it was not any individual or specific policy his, but more a result of the war. He also recognized this:

&gt; We may congratulate ourselves that this cruel war is nearing its end.
It has cost a vast amount of treasure and blood. . . .
It has indeed been a trying hour for the Republic; but
I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes
me to tremble for the safety of my country. As a result of the war,
corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places
will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong
its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth
is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.
I feel at this moment more anxiety for the safety
of my country than ever before, even in the midst of war.
God grant that my suspicions may prove groundless.

- [Lincoln to (Col.) William F. Elkins, Nov. 21, 1864.](http://www.worldcat.org/title/lincoln-encyclopedia-the-spoken-and-written-words-of-a-lincoln-arranged-for-ready-reference/oclc/445398&amp;referer=brief_results)

That quote has been disputed, but not well enough for me to stop using it.

[This article](http://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/) has a nice overview of corporate history. There is also the book [Unfinished Revolution: Karl Marx and Abraham Lincoln](http://books.google.com/books/about/An_Unfinished_Revolution.html?id=4zCAGOaofmEC) which talks about some of the initial backlash. [This Lecture by the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qcg6HyaMDQ) covers the main points. From a different perspective [David Greaber's Debt: The First 5000 years](https://libcom.org/library/debt-first-5000-years-david-graeber) covers some of the same history and is worth a read on its own for being a genuine anthropological perspective on money and economics.

There are a lot of different takes on this, how things played out, and this is just a glimmer of a rich historical subject.","1396310945"

Union Pacific has doubled and tripled the track already where they could to allow trains to pass each other, but but the bridges and tunnels (including the famous [Tehachapi Loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehachapi_Loop) would be pretty expensive to widen, particularly with 40 trains a day on the main track.

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","BluBerryHash is correct. It's like with Gravity Hills. Where a car will roll up hill- sometimes it is forced perspective, sometimes it is a real magnetic field.

There is one in North Carolina that will give you the creeps because as you walk in it, it gives you the feeling that the terrain around you is constantly distorting and evening out, despite being in and on and around a mountain. It is literally nauseating to walk through that area.

My dad gave me a Bulova watch, it was a present when he retired from a company, and he gave it to me when I started grad school. 

When I visited the gravity hill in Talladega AL- Oak Grove- it caused the watch's movement to alter and the it slowed to a near hault while we were there(a group of people who were interested in weird shit and in grad school). One of the girls who was with us was really sensitive and she vomited while at Oak Grove. Her watch was a fairly expensive Swiss watch and it had the same thing happen. She had a cheaper swatch in her backpack that was sort of a good luck charm and nothing happened to it- its movement wasn't affected, but it was super cheap and inaccurate in the first place. 

When we visited the one in North Carolina, my Bulova died permanently. Something else odd happened- it had an extremely hard, shatterproof crystal lens to protect the face and while were there it made that crystal look distorted. I noticed the longer we stayed there(no effect on cell phone clock) that the more distorted the Bulova movement was, ie time keeping was off and it was slowing. It finally died for good after we had been in and around the ""vortex"" and would no longer work. While we walked back through it, the girl I was with earlier- her watch, a Heuer, died permanently. The oddest thing happened when I tripped due to vertigo and nausea and I slapped the face of my watch against a friend's cell phone on his hip, as I was trying to keep from falling. That shatterproof lens shattered. When I was living in Baton Rouge, I had a quality jeweler, a Bulova dealer, send it to Bulova. Bulova fixed it for free and kept pictures as they'd never seen a movement die like that one did, and they'd never seen one of those crystals on the face just shatter like safety glass into a million pieces. 

This was not a cheap Bulova either, and not one of the newer Caravelles. It was a Bulova signature watch, that had been custom engraved with my dad's named(mine as well, we have the same name). Dad gave it to me for good luck. 

The watch has still never been the same.

An older guy we met, who studies what people consider psuedo-science told me if I found a gravity hill or gravity vortex in the opposite hemisphere and traversed it, it would reverse the effect on the watch. 
I'm curious, but not that curious at this stage in my life.

My 20's were spent state hopping and exploring things like this. I really loved it, too...

If you like big views of scenery you can easily find some property overlooking some part of the city of Fayetteville. Fayetteville is the easily the most hill-ridden city around of decent population size. You could also try Bella Vista if you don't mind it being a retirement city. They have great hills with great views as well.

Edit: The investor network is decent with the Big 3 around (Walmart, JB Hunt, and Tyson). If you have a great idea you could easily find investors. Walmart requires anyone who does business with them to have an office in the area. ","1396310953"

"baduk","t5_2qhqe","You should be able to go through the rules themselves quickly. I can think of very few games that can be explained as quickly as go, so that gives you an advantage.

Maybe you should explain the game as ""the goal is to put as many stones on the board as you can"". This is likely the way the game worked somewhere early on, as evidenced by the [group tax](http://senseis.xmp.net/?GroupTax) that ancient players played with. It's also really easy to explain.

Try to tell a lot as stories.  Tell them about Yoda Norimoto [shattering stones](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/03/the-electronic-holy-war.html) to indimidate his opponent. Talk about the Blood-vomiting game. The [Atomic Bomb game](http://senseis.xmp.net/?AtomicBombGame). Tell them this is where the company name Atari comes from (do people still know that company?)

Ladders are easy to understand but suprising when you first see them. Show one.

You can make a ko fight into a story. ""Sure, you can have that stone into a story. But then I want all of this!"". Don't show to much of it though6 moves should be enough.

This is true and a very nice piece of information but it's important to remember that being able to distinguish a change in a still picture doesn't apply a 100% with video games because we're looking at pictures in motion when we play.

I agree with you though, a high refresh rate monitor is really useful. Maybe not as useful for a game like LoL, but it makes a difference. Having the lowest input latency is also very nice and makes gaming much more enjoyable.

Think about how much Luffy grew after Alabasta arc, he's young and putting his life on the line in fights, so after each of the big arcs (Alabasta, Skypiea, Enies Lobby, Thriller Bark) he gained HUGE growth after each arc.

And in marineford war, Crocodile was right beside him, taking out countless fodder, playing around with Doflamingo (obviously it wasn't serious, but knowing Doflamingo's strength now, if Crocodile was just an early pushover villain he would not have been able to last a second).

Crocodile is pretty insanely strong dude, first time Luffy tried fighting him, he would've been killed if it weren't for his own highest subordinate saving his life. Second time, Luffy managed to find his key weakness, but that still didn't mean anything to Croc who almost killed him a second time (when you think about it, there is absolutely no way Luffy could've survived that second fight, he was protected by plot armour simple as that) and the third time, it was Luffy's willpower (not talking about haki) that allowed him to gain the upper hand over Crocodile.

Luffy's growth from Alabasta to Thriller Bark is insane, but there's no way Moria is that much more stronger than Crocodile (personally I think Crocodile is stronger).

You might also consider dropping the splinter cannons from your Trueborne and just sticking with the Carbines. Is it really worth the extra points for one more shot and 6'' of range you're rarely going to be taking advantage of anyway?

When fighting zeds dodge their first attack and then keep moving in a circle and aim for their heads. They can be taken out pretty easy this way without you taking a lot of damage even using just your fists.

Look for the bigger warehouse and industrial type buildings. They usually have melee weapons in them.

If you are being chased by zeds, sprint in to 2 story buildings and go upstairs and wait. The zeds will usually glitch and you can walk right out past them.

Good luck!

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I agree that the majority of self-pubbed books don't meet that standard and as a consequence will likely be ignored by readers. But as far as marketing goes, there isn't a whole lot done by big publishers anyway. They generally send review copies out with a form letter/publicity release and call it a day. Then they turn around and tell the author to get on social media and start a blog.

Big publisher publicity departments are understaffed and overworked, dealing with hundreds of books over a short period of time. The more the book cost to acquire, the closer to the front of the line it gets.

Otherwise, you're on your own. Just like you are in self-publishing. The difference in self-publishing is that YOU are highly invested in your own book and don't have to wait for permission to try any and all marketing schemes you can think of. If they don't work, you can quickly change gears and try something else.

That's impossible in traditional publishing, where everything moves s l o w l y . . .","1396310960"

Example:

    var client = new BGGAPI.Client();
    var collectionRequest = new BGGAPI.Collection.Request 
        {
            UserName = ""tysonjhayes"",
            Rated = true,
            Stats = true
        };
    var collection = client.GetCollection(collectionRequest);


The collection var should now have my collection that I've rated and the stats for it. Are you looking for a more specific example I can help you with?


The other option would be to load the UnitTest project. Plays is laid out pretty well. https://github.com/ArtWDrahn/boardgamegeekapi.net/blob/master/BGGAPI_UnitTests/Integration/Plays.cs

Highlighting this set of code:

    var playsUserDateRequest = new Request { 
    UserName = ""tysonjhayes"",
    MaxDate = ""2014-02-16"",
    MinDate = ""2014-02-16"",
    Page = 1 };

    PlaysDateReturn = client.GetPlays(playsUserDateRequest);


PlaysDateReturn should now be populated with games I played that day. Try changing the Min/Max Dates to see what changes.

Track Toew's shoulder and his head and see which one gets contacted first. I just can't understand how you're seeing what you're saying you see.

Also, keep in mind that it's Toew's fault he gets hit in the head because he puts himself in that position, so even if the head were the principle point of contact, Orpik would still not be liable for punishment.

That's a valid point about concussions taking less force than you'd think. Bergeron got a concussion last year just by skating into a guy's arm accidentally. (I can't find a video of it, but that's literally what happened.) What I should have said is that, practically, the league can't get rid of all head bumps of any sort unless they want to vastly change the game (which they don't).

She had to wade around in waist-chest deep water with water moccasins and alligators in it for her BIO class. She went to pull her bag off a tree branch where she'd hung it to stay dry and found a water moccasin coiled under it, within striking range of pretty much all of her vital organs. Some knowledge requires a certain level of risk to be obtained I guess.","1396310969"

The decks they build while not necessarily tier one, are still easily viable for competitive play. Just know that what you buy for your deck that's not the pokemon for a deck, is likely to be great for other decks. While already mentioned, with that in mind, try to grab 2 Red Genesect Collection boxes as it will come with just about 2 copies of every staple in the format right now, and that runs you approx 40 dollars. From there you can just buy 90% of the EXs that your deck might need for 5-10 a piece. Make sure you look for the promo versions because their the cheapest.

&gt;___The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression___ is a book written by several European academics and edited by [Stéphane Courtois](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Courtois),  which documents a history of [repressions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_repression), both political and civilian, by [Communist states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state), including [genocides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide), [extrajudicial executions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrajudicial_punishment), [deportations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deportation), and artificial [famines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine). The book was originally published in 1997 in France under the title *Le Livre noir du communisme: Crimes, terreur, répression* by [Éditions Robert Laffont](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89ditions_Robert_Laffont). In the United States it is published by [Harvard University Press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University_Press).  The German edition, published by [Piper Verlag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_Verlag), includes a chapter written by [Joachim Gauck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joachim_Gauck), who later went on to be [President of Germany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Germany).

You're assuming that wealthy people don't spend their money and that's just totally false; do they save? *Definitely*. You're stupid not to. But they also invest and spend **way** more money than any workers would.

Plus this gives people incentive to work their way up. There's been many instances where CEO's were people that started *very* small in a company and worked their way up over years and years and finally got the CEO position.

You should always strive to get higher in life. At least, that's the way I look at it as. If you're comfortable with the job you have then you better be comfortable with the pay you get. If you don't think you make enough, then maybe it's time for a better job.","1396310976"

Do you ever throw food away from your weekly grocery store trips?  If you buy from costco you most certainly will increase the amount you throw out.  Also, you'll need to go to your local store for smaller quantity or special items anyways.  Picky about your bbq sauce or something?  Costco only has a couple of options.  



I may not be answering you question but I don't see it as a pro/con comparison.  Really just a matter of whether or not you're bulk purchasers.  And remember, you have to need the things they sell in order to make the membership worth it.  Frugal is great and doing homework is good.  But you may want to just get a membership for a year and see how it works for you.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","If you don't want to be lumped in with radical feminists, then police your own, because that is all I run into. So until that is not the norm, that's my perception of them, which is why I have no respect for feminists. You want that to change? Change the way you're perceived. Because I love women, but hate feminists, and I have seen very little from any ""feminist"" to make me have any respect for them.

And, I'm sorry, but as far as I'm concerned, abortion is essentially murder. I can see why some people don't see it that way, and am liberal enough that while I do not respect that view, I won't ever vote to restrict the process. However, I do feel that it is a horribly disgusting and immature reaction to a pregnancy and, I have zero respect for anyone who does it.

As far as I'm concerned, they both already had their say in this pregnancy. They decided to have sex, a child is a very possible and real ""consequence"" of that act. Just because having a child is inconvenient, it doesn't mean that you can just kill the child. Not read or willing to have a child? Keep your legs closed or use birth control (and birth control or no birth control, if it happens, it happens). 

And this goes for guys, too. I am not pursuing any kind of relationship or sex in any form right now. If I were to get a girl pregnant, I would be unable to raise or care for the child, so I choose not to have sex. Women can make the same choice. I do know though that asking people to be responsible for their actions is uncool in today's age, but it's what I believe. And, unless you are raped (because obviously your choice is take away from you there), if you choose to have sex, even with birth control, you choose to accept the possible responsibility of having and raising a child, both the male and female.","1396310986"

Also, I didn't start to get good at anything until I was in my early 30s.  Don't be so hard on yourself.

I transfer them to an internal drive dedicated to photos (2TB). Then I run a script that copies them over to an external network drive and fires off the online backup service. Only after the online backup is made to do I start to do post processing on the copies on my local disk.

If you think a $10/month backup service is expensive, calculate the cost of losing someone's valuable wedding day shots. Redundancy and a monthly service plan is far cheaper.

I suggest that if your Doctor doesn't know how much is too much for any particular treatment, or at least know of a source that he can reference, that you should change your Doctor quickly. 

If you don't agree, lets just leave it there. There's no point arguing with someone who disagrees with such an obvious point.

Also, there's no reason there couldn't be a requirement that all 5 members of your team agree to gg, or that one of your rax needs to be down first. I personally enjoy all my wins already, but dragging on my losses for 40+ minutes is really bothersome from someone who comes from starcraft matches that tend to last 15 mins. have i gg'd too early in a game of sc2? of course, but i always watch my replays and am able to improve my play *because* i can then identify how even the game really was at the point where i thought it was over, or points where i could have been more aggressive and i let my opponent off too easily, etc. also, i think the negativity of games where people fountain dive for 10 mins combined with the number of times this happens compared to comebacks (re: a LOT more often) is important to consider. 

edit- i would say this match is an excellent example of how fun a comeback is, but *also* an example of just how *rarely* something like this actually happens. If this happened more often, it wouldn't be nearly as exciting (we likely wouldn't even be posting here), and I think it's important for the game to cater to the majority of it's playerbase in a majority of their matches, not just a niche group in a few one-off events.","1396310989"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","There is something called the Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule which creates a market whose price is between 0 and 1, which can sell mutually-exclusive states for 1 at any time, and with which one can always trade. If the price differs from what you think it should be, you can always trade with this automated market-maker, even if you are the only one in the market. Check out the LogMSR.xls file I put in the folder for this reason.

&gt;And a question about #7, and replicating 'real-world' portfolios. These would all be settled in btc I assume, right?

Yes (or another cryptocurrency).

&gt;If I short a binary at 0.20 in the amount of 1 btc, would I have to put up 4 in the exchange's wallet as margin requirement?

No margin is required. You'd deposit money to make it available for trades, then you could spend the whole 1 BTC on any side of any existing option. You would receive a certain number of shares, which would sell for 1 if you are correct. This return would likely vastly exceed that of the underlying, so you would purposefully de-lever this portfolio by combining it with an amount of cash, to replicate the actual % return of something like the price of Gold (for example).","1396310989"

Please rest assured, I do not blame women at all because of my stance.

It's not a crippling fear, nor do I ever externalize it through conversation or body language with other people. I'm definitely not a misogynist. I like women as people just fine (that sounds awful but I don't know how else to say it), but they hold an awful lot of power (especially in ""he said, she said"" situations; in my experience, the woman is more likely to be believed) that makes me wary.

I started out just by taking her on leashed walks around the neighborhood.  Once she got used to the idea of walking along with me, I'd let her off the leash for a little bit and make sure she stayed close and followed me.  Then I started doing the same thing, but this time on trails.  She's gotten to the point where she knows that she can only go a certain distance away from me before she has to turn back and find me.

Some things to keep in mind:

- Some trails don't allow dogs.  Most (if not all) national parks don't allow dogs
- Make sure your dog responds to the ""Come"" command before you take her out.
- ALWAYS leash her when other people are hiking near you.  You never know what might provoke the dog or if others are allergic to them, etc.
- If the dog poops on the trail, clean it up (just take it off trail a bit and bury it in a safe spot)
- Have a place for the dog to sleep overnight.  I like to keep my dog in my tent, and if it's cold I'll bring along a cut up sleeping pad for her.
- Try to keep them from drinking untreated water.  Dogs can get parasite and the like just like humans.  Although my lab loves getting in and drinking the water, so I know it can be hard.
- Make sure to bring food for the pup!  I use a tupperware container for a food bowl

My dog's happiest are days are when we go out on the trail together and it makes my hikes much more fun as well.","1396311003"
"GameDeals","t5_2qwx3","The wikis are good if you need information about game mechanics, and there are some decent strategy guides for different nations. 

In EU4 it is easiest to start with a nation like Castille or Portugal. They will give you a broad look at most of the game mechanics while giving you a lot of leeway to make mistakes. Colonizing lets you expand without making everyone else angry enough to form coalitions against you.

The classic start for a CK2 beginner is playing an Irish ruler in the Stamford bridge start time. It is isolated enough that the big nations don't immediately kill you, and it gives you an attainable goal to shoot for (form the Kingdom of Ireland)

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; About 300 russian nuclear weapons would be 
&gt;enough to end most of the life on earth.

Whereas good, clean AMERICAN nukes would tidy up afterwards, plant some trees, and spritz some air freshener?

One needs to understand just how close were were to the end of the world during the Cold War.

From the early 1960s to the early 2000s, the response to a confirmed missile launch from Russia was covered by the Pentagon's Single Integrated Operational Plan, or SIOP.

To boil it down to the simplest form, upon confirmation of the launch of even a single Russian missile, the SIOP called for an ALL OUT retaliation. And I'm not being hyperbolic there. At the time of the Carter administration (the last one I have definite figures for), the SIOP response was to launch some TEN THOUSAND NUKES at Russia and associated targets within the space of a few hours.

That would have effectively doomed human life, not to mention thousands of other species. 

Just as well, because the SIOP ends at target 10,000. There no ""then the next day"" or ""in the weeks to come,"" it just ends. The Pentagon simply didn't bother to consider what would happen next (I mean, BEFORE all human life died, that would have probably taken a few years.).

And then reflect that during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the order that would have certainly unleashed that hell was actually given by a Russian sub commander responding to *incredibly* reckless provocation from an American warship that started dropping depth charges on it to force it to surface. The sub hadn't been in contact with Moscow for days, and when the American ship started firing, they had no way of knowing if war had already broken out or not. Thus, the commander gave the only rational order a sub commander *could* in the circumstances: sink the fucker. He ordered a nuclear-tipped torpedo launched, but fortunately, the use of nuclear weapons required the top three officers to agree. The commander and the political officer were all for it, but Vasili Arkhipov, the first officer, vetoed it, and the sub eventually surfaced.

The only reason any of us are alive today is because of Vasili Arkhipov.

3.  The Kinect 2 is still not out for PC.  It's also been developed mainly with the Xbox One in mind, and PC as an afterthough.

If Microsoft were to buy it and still release it for PC, they wouldn't give the PC version priority.  Maybe they'd add support 8 months later.  They would keep the specs stripped down to match the Xbox One's resolution, etc.  They wouldn't want every tech site saying, ""Microsoft's PC version of the Rift is way better than the Xbox One version!""

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","There are obviously always exceptions to the rules, especially considering our species.

Some people can just be wired that way through something like Bipolar disorder. Some people can just like to be balanced out if they are in a high status position in worklife. etc. It's all OK and might even be somewhat healthy or beneficial to them. 

The point is that in the general sense, it usually means something else and these are concerns everyone should be aware of and mind.

To me personally, I have experiemented a bit with light bondage and every girl likes a little slap, hairpull, and a bit of firm neck holding.

You make it sound as if you voted for D's based on promises they made?  What broken promises upset you?

A tiny cubicle holding all that waste, inches from your feet and only a fraction more from your nose.  But God damn does it smell like victory.  I wonder how long I have before they find me?  I wish I could forget why I am hiding in here before they find me.

It's too easy for the scanners to read your emotions. Too easy for the guards at the desk to wisk you away and lock you up for any one of a myriad of reasons.  It's how they control the leaks and the secret keepers.  This new branch of the government does not allow anyone to stray away from protocol.  How else could they keep it a secret for as long as they have?  This secret was beyond anything the world has ever seen.  You kept your nose to the grindstone and all evidence securely locked away.  So many checks and balances to ensure the secret never leaks.  

The people deserve to know.  They need to know.  This isn't something that should be done or decided by the elites.  This was a decision for the whole world.  Its impact will change earth forever.  The upside for the government is that if anyone actually talks they just say you cracked and locked you in the loony bin.  Its easy to do when someone starts spouting off about aliens.  Who would really believe anyone without actual evidence? Ever since 'it' happened I have been trying to get the word out. For years I have byded my time looking for a way.  Two days ago it finally came.  A pipe broke in the recent cold snap. Flooded out an entire documents room. Lots of damage, big job, need an outside company to repair it.  

Contractors were called in and I waited.  I dumped all of the most amazing evidence on an internal usb stick.  The problem is you need to sign them out. They know who has one. You need to return it at the end of the day, no exceptions.  Well my stick is rattling around in a contractors lunch box.  A lucky throw from a second story window.  I still can't believe I actually got it in.  Since the contractors have their own entrance and are barred from entering the facility anywhere else they don't get checked at the end of the day, no searches.  They will notice I haven't signed out for the day and that the usb stick is still not returned.  They will come to find me. I won't be there.  I am hiding here, in the contractors bathroom.  I can't run, you leave the perimeter and they know.  I need to give my message in a bottle the time it needs to reach the masses.  They will soon know that in the rings of Saturn we found a vessel.  To all observations it seemed powered and functioning.  No governments claimed it.  The markings and make of the vessel are of non human origins.  We have sent a ship to investigate.  In the mean time we tried to signal it, every way we knew how.  The people need to know, when we signaled... it answered ","1396311011"

However, expungements do not extend to the federal government. The federal government keeps record and can use it against you even after and expungement. and even if you get an expungement and are arrested for a crime and that information comes out your previously sealed record is no longer sealed and can be used against you.... so in short there is no such thing as an expungement... I wish it did what we are lead to believe.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","You can use the word recent it's just... it's kind of a red flag that a post may need a second look. There are very few posts that say recent and don't violate rule 3. If it doesn't violate 3 (or the other rules) you can use recent freely.

The link flair appears next to the title of the post on the website. If you're using mobile or an app, it may not show them or may show them differently. I can show you where they are in a screenshot if you're still not seeing it on the site. Let me know if that would be helpful. I'd have already done it, but I'm tired and lazy today.

For ettiquette V, we're pretty damn lax about it. It's pretty much only used for people habitually, intentionally reposting. I think I've seen 2 people banned over it, and we're talking every day reposting word for word frontpage and top/alltime TILs, including after being warned. It's one of those things that doesn't seem to have a lot of middle ground. Either the person did it unintentionally or only once, or is a ridiculous karma who that just can't understand the concept of ""stop that or be banned."" Regular users will almost always call it out though. Sometimes they'll be upvoted, sometimes downvoted to shit. It's a crapshoot, and best of luck with dealing with the people that call it out lol. It rarely (read: never that I've seen) leads to constructive conversation.

Yea, some subs have some really aggressive mods. Hell, lgbt's were bad enough it caused a sub split, that's how /r/ainbow came to be. Honestly, being a mod can be pretty draining sometimes. We take a lot of shit sometimes. But that's no excuse to treat others poorly. You know how you were a little snippy with me in your first reply? Same principle. Someone gets your back up, and it's easy to take it out on the wrong person.

I do my best to help explain, because I know how frustrating it can be to not get any information when accused of ""wrongdoing"" (for lack of a better word.)

"Games","t5_2qhwp","In all the examples privacy is a huge issue and I'm not convinced the expanse in technology justifies it.

The Minority Report has some pretty neat stuff but everyone is going to know your name and potentially where you live. I don't have an issue unless it's used to try and bombard people with even more branding and marketing, which it usually is.

Deus Ex's world consists of nanotech which I am anxiously hoping I get in my lifetime but most of it's controlled by shadow governments, some of which care so little for human life they'll create epidemics to control it.

The main reason I enjoy these stories is because of the philosophical questions of the stories. Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell and even the Terminator and RoboCop films always interested me in the ""does all sentient 'life' deserve freedom"" kind of way (to which I think they do) but most certainly not in a ""am I willing to sacrifice my privacy for it"" way.

Things like knowing my name, my address and my retina scans wouldn't be an issue if they weren't ultimately being used to sell me things or as a way to label me.

There's a very good reason why I keep my Facebook profile as private as possible and why my reddit and twitter histories bother me, and that's because employers scanning and picking off targets using these sites is a very real thing. I don't want a world in which that kind of discrimination is made easier.

All my examples are cyberpunk, which simply means ""high tech, low life"". They're set in worlds with awesome technology like complex AI, virtual/augmented reality, nano/mechanical augmentations, etc, but with the ""poor get poorer, the rich get richer"" ideals strongly emphasized to the point where the average home might look like a ghetto today.

I don't think we'll ever to that point of ""low life"" personally, as we don't expand at a rate as fast as in these stories (the speed at which the worlds advance is one of the reasons why the pay gap is so noticeable) but losing privacy isn't a small deal either.

Something you may  be interested as an eye-opener is the following visual novel about a teacher's foray into privacy invasion and how he deals with the consequences of knowledge and moral ramifications behind it. Personally, I find the ending quite worrying.

If no luck in that, try to network and meet people in the field you want to get in to. Eventually you will find someone that is high enough up in the company that will hire you and not worry about your past mistake.

I lasted less than 15 seconds I think, but at that point I didn't even know I was supposed to last longer.

I'm still not the greatest in bed, but I'm working on it. It's been 8 years or so since my first time, I've had sex maybe 8 times total, never with an SO. The last time I had sex I felt super awkward, because for some reason I couldn't find the right angle for my dick to slide in. We lasted about three hours and had a few rounds and she loved it though.

What I've learned; sometimes sex is awkward, but if you're laid back about it, it's still tons of fun.","1396311030"

Feel free to pay your hard earned money to live in a seemingly nice place that will end up falling apart around you, while your requests for assistance and repair go unheard, and your phone calls and e-mails are replied to in seriously unprofessional and disrespectful manners. There is a couple with a baby living downstairs who asked that their apartment be deleaded. The company was annoyed with their request, and took their time in seeing to it. Because of this, they now asked the couple to pay an increase of 10% more for next year, seemingly to just get them to leave since all the other apartments were asked to pay a 7% increase.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Rail is a terrible way to move people around on the scale of the US. Freight rail is a very efficient way to move non-time-sensitive cargo over long distances - a coal-fired power plant needs a certain amount delivered every day, but it doesn't matter if it takes one day or ten to get there from the mine. But achieving that efficiency makes the rail utterly unsuitable for passenger traffic, so you have to build significant additional rail to accommodate pax. Unfortunately, the time-sensitivity of people makes passenger rail less efficient than freight. At Western European density, high-speed rail makes sense, just as it does in the Northeast Corridor in the US (the only part of Amtrak that pays for itself). Outside of that, it just doesn't.

Well the Judge is going to ask why you paid anything to your SO's dad w/o seeing any paperwork, why you made payments to him and not the bank, etc. Most Judges are going to tell you that trying to avoid family conflict is not a good enough reason not to check out the finances involved. You guys were willing to make payments on a vehicle that wasn't in your name, with no legal guarantee it would be transferred to your name when paid up, etc. Legally, your ground is quite shaky. (I have family in the law field who've seen very similar cases and the ppl in your position rarely win.)

I am no expert on incarnational missions, but to my understanding the advocates of it think that missionaries and ministers to foreign cultures should try and assimilate themselves to a culture as much as possible becoming sort of ""incarnate"" to that culture. But many of its detractors say that you can be nice and respectful to a different culture without becoming a part of it and that trying too hard to be something you are not can take away from the message.

I agree they could use a more interesting faceplate design but I think fear of unrecognition has the solidified with what we've seen so far although the Iron Legion had some nice takes on alternating designs.

Wasn't a massive fan of the Bleeding edges abilities but the armour itself was gorgeous same with the black gold although I am very bored of black gold now. And Modular armour YES!! such a deadly suit shame the design wasn't long lived but I guess the cartoons from back in the day were all I knew of Iron Man so I'm ok only knowing its in the old comics and I can go back to it whenever I want some nostalgia with some stories I haven't read! 

honestly I'd love to see the MK III space armour (""GodKiller"") in the movie even if its just as a throw in to GOTG again! But I feel we can probably expect an Argonauts series in the next film. as we know theres a hulkbuster, we've seen Tony look at aquatic designs, stealth and combat armours. So not too far to say he'll have a series of 5 or so cleaned up suits that can do most roles the iron legion could on a broad scale and then his own pinnacle design suit for general use.

Thats what I'm expecting at least but that said they threw me off a mile with the IM3 trailer so whose to say I'm a galaxy away from the truth! But just speculating this is what I'd expect especially as Tony had to fight the argo suits which would give reason for the Hulk to fight the Hulk Buster while not compromising the team plot.

 [**White propaganda**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White%20propaganda): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;__White propaganda__ is [propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda) which truthfully states its origin.   It is the most common type of propaganda. It generally comes from an openly identified source, and is characterized by gentler methods of [persuasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persuasion) than [black propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda) (which purports to come from the opposite side to that which actually produced it) and [grey propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_propaganda) (which has no identifiable source or author). It typically uses standard public relations techniques and one-sided presentation of an argument. [Jacques Ellul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Ellul), in one of the major books on the subject of propaganda, *[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda:_The_Formation_of_Men%27s_Attitudes)*, mentions white propaganda as an awareness of the public of attempts being made to influence it. There is a Ministry of Propaganda; one admits that propaganda is being made; its source is known; its aims and intentions are identified.   Throughout the course of a propaganda campaign white propaganda serve as a cover for [black propaganda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_propaganda) when the propagandist seeks to mask the former.

The materials are sturdy and feel high quality and so far have lasted me a while. They come in a variety of colors and usually are pretty soft too.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","eat it straight out of the jar

first two years of lifting I was in college, put on 10 pounds, was drinking 4 days a week and didn't track food at all, got extremely cut and had very low body fat percentage looked really muscular even though I was only 135 pounds and not very strong

finished college at 140 and obviously my drinking habits slowed down, drink maybe once or twice a month now

first year out of college I put on about 20 more pounds getting up to about 160, in one month will be my second full year out of college and I'm 170

so first 30 pounds for me was almost 2 and a half year but it shouldn't take normal people that long if you track your calories and don't drink 4 days a week, I'd say you could put on 30 pounds in your first year, some will be fat but a lot will be muscle","1396311038"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","A few thoughts.

1. Your criticism of hell is a little misguided. Hell is not the issue, despite that the American church makes a *very* big deal about it. Hell is a consequence of the much larger picture. We aren't just born destined for hell, it's not like God creates humans with a two line option box with checks for ""heaven"" or ""hell.""

The issue, if we are born into anything, is that we are born with what the Bible calls a ""sin nature."" Because God created mankind for the purpose of relationship with Him, and relationship with one another, sin can be looked at as the nature that is contrary to our created purpose - that is, a nature that tends towards defiling relationship. Anything that seeks our personal good over the good of another, anything that prefers ourselves, or any way we live that rejects our relationship with God for our own indulgent pleasure, as innocent as it may seem. 

So if we are born with a nature that causes us to tend towards rejecting God, and we come into agreement with that urge and satisfy it, yes, we deserve hell. Forget about what hell is for a minute, because that's even less of an issue. The *reason* we deserve hell is because the choice we made to reject God required a place for us to spend the afterlife away from Him. That is what hell is for us. Wether or not it's a place of torture, that's a different discussion. But to say that God the all powerful creates people with their default destination being a place of eternal torture is not really right, even though it pulls from a true pretense. It's not the point, and it isn't the issue at hand. It isn't God's intent.

2. The selfishness and wickedness of God thing, that's also a bit of a misunderstanding. ""How is it a misunderstanding to say God is wicked for having the Israelites kill innocent women and children?"" There is, once again, a much bigger picture at hand. This life is easily insignificant on the scale of eternity. As someone else said, death in the light of eternal life really doesn't matter. 

Remember the idea of our created purpose being relationship - when God was having the Israelites do that kind of stuff, the civilizations they destroyed were those that were not only defiling their created purpose of relationship with God through their worship of false idols, Israel, who were God's chosen people because of their forefather's pursuing their created purpose of relationship with God, was at risk of intermingling with them - tolerating their idol worship and practices and letting that influence them to the extent that their relationship with God suffers. This is still entirely consistent - His goal is to protect creation as a whole according to our created purpose, and if there's a tribe that's going to ruin it for the whole bunch, the best thing He can do so that everyone doesn't end up screwed over is to take them out. That may seem unfair, but keep in mind eternity is at stake. Death is a small thing, especially in light of [1 Peter 3:18-20] that says that Jesus preached to those who died before He came. They had the same opportunity you do now to receive Jesus.

So isn't that selfish of God? Wouldn't an all loving God let us choose to love Him, or to reject Him? Well, He does. That's why we aren't robots.. but every decision has a consequence, good or bad. We were not made to live life however we want, we were made to love and be loved, to know and be known, to have relationship. To live in perfect harmony with God and with our fellow man. In God's perfect love for us, though, He gave us the choice to choose for ourselves, and we know the consequences and even though God's way is the right way, love does not insist on its own way [1 Corinthians 13:4-5]. You now are faced with that same choice - I promise you the deeper you go in this rabbit hole, if you can accept what I'm saying, you will continue to find only that God's love for His creation is the only motivating factor with which He deals with mankind. Even the wrath the Bible talks about Him having is something filtered through His love. I know that it's hard to see, but it's true.","1396311043"

"programming","t5_2fwo","This is crap. 

BIN prefixes do not have a static length. The issuers are organized into a tree, and can have sub-issuers several levels deep. Not only the same issuer can span several disjoint prefixes, but same short prefix may have ranges of unrelated issuers. Unless you process cards with AVS, you do not need to change the form structure according to card type. Analyzing BINs on client side is pointless, because the processing logic on the server side can be complicated (some prefixes may be marked as mandatory 3D eligibility, others as blacklisted for certain countries, other have fraud weights, etc). If you are a processor, and route your transactions via traffic management, you can't always predict whether a given prefix would be accepted - you can't even display card logos with any degree of reliability. Acquirers are fascinatingly stupid; a transaction can be declined as invalid card and then accepted with the same parameters thirty seconds later. Conversely, a perfectly valid card may suddenly fail the capture stage. And don't get me started on bank-side batching.

In any case, this is obvious marketing bullshit with all sorts of solidly sounding words which peddles shit that nobody really needs (not to mention you BETTER audit any 3rd party code that touches your PAN information).","1396311044"

Do these scores combined really show who's best at mock drafts? That's up to individuals to judge, really, but I don't think so.

If you wanted to score mock drafters' player-ranking nous then you'd just have to divide players by position and get mock drafters to rank them, because that would allow them to ignore team needs. That kind of defeats the object though.","1396311044"

I've been toying with Arcane skill synergies a bit, and so far, this has been the most effective.  Black Hole: Spellsteal goes off and give an extra 5% dmg for each creature affected, and temporal flux also makes them slow to move, I cast 3-6 arcane mines underneath the enemies, which gain the BH bonus, then boom, hit them with Disintegrate: Intensify, so the 15% arcane debuff triggers before the mines go off.  

I run diamond in helm and evocation, and put some Paragon points into cooldown, to the point that I can almost chain-cast BH.  Coupled with Teleport: Calamity and Illusionist, I have enough CC to do my burst DPS, move around the battlfield when needed, and use Mirrorball with Magic Missile to finish enemies off/recharge with Prodigy.

I have a couple of items I'm looking for, like moonlight ward and a better wand obviously, but it's been solid so far.  Boss fights I have to switch it up, usually to some combination of Archon/Mirror Images/Torrent:Disruption and Energy Armor.

I think you will find that Bubbles is actually the smartest guy in the park even if he is a googly eyed bastard.  I really love how dumb the cops are and how Ricky just seems to talk circles around cops, judges and authority figures.  And the fact that it is documentary style makes the characters seem more human and less like actors.  At least in America we always wonder about and make jokes about how life is in the trailer parks.  I think this satisfies our imagination about a side of life that many of us don't take part in.  Plus I think deep down we would all love to be growing dope, getting drunk as fuck and banging Lucy.  I think I'd rather bang Sarah but you get my drift.  I have to admit that I am jealous of you because I remember my first viewing and remember feeling much the way you do.  Just keep watching and then watch it all over again.  The more you watch, the better it seems to get in my opinion but there is nothing like the first time, am I right?

Also I would not say the acting is all that bad.  I think they ad-lib a lot and that takes some skill.  If I remember correctly Mike Smith wasn't even part of the original concept but once he did his thing they knew he had to be in it.  To act like such a perfect drunk like Dunsworth does takes some skill.  Just wait; he gets even more fucked.  In Say Goodnight to the Bad Guys (not part of the 8 seasons) he is drunker than ever and it doesn't seem forced in the least.

In all likelihood, I'll probably need a knee replacement by the time I'm 40, considering the ACL isn't the only issue.  So all in all, I don't really see how a broken leg would be much worse.  I spent most of last year going to therapy 3 times a week for an injury I sustained almost 15 years ago.  My knee just really pisses me off a lot of the time.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","theoretically he might be able to cause some type of explosion but he has never done it. Magneto does have control over the electromagnetic spectrum so he is not just limited to manipulating metal, but it is by far his strongest and easiest ability.  
As for how he would take down Superman there are a few ways he might be able to kill Superman, but it would really require Superman to be not fighting back. Superman is too strong and too fast for Magneto to keep up in a fight, but here are some points and counter points.  
  
**Superman's speed:** Magneto's son quicksilver has mutant super speed, and Magneto has on occasion caught him, or managed to follow his speed. However Superman is much much faster than quicksilver. Magneto has never caught something that can move faster than light.  
  
**Superman's Strength**: Magneto's magnetic force field that repels others and protects him from damage has stopped many of the strongest characters in Marvel from overcoming him. It has stopped Cyclops, Colossus, and a ton of explosive weaponry. However Superman has enough strength to push the planet and punch out other people who have similar strength. Trying to keep up a shield against Superman wouldn't last long.  
  
**Superman's durability**: The man of steel is far tougher than most metals so nearly anything that Magneto throws at him (pipes, cars, buildings) shouldn't be enough. Unless Magneto found some adamantium to toss into Superman the magnetic control of other objects won't be enough to hurt Superman.  
  
**Some ways Magneto could win**:  
Magneto has on occasion been able to use the iron in a person's blood to tear them apart, depending if Superman's kryptonian physiology has a similar amount of iron in it or another metallic type substance in a high enough amount.  
Magneto has used metals to cover an entire person's body so that they cannot move or breathe, but I think Superman could break out of this.  
My favorite possibility is one of Magneto's exotic abilities he has only demonstrated once to my knowledge, but it is the ability to alter light along the spectrum. He used it once to alter all the light wavelengths to make himself invisible. It would be very interesting if he could use this ability to divert light from the yellow sun in order to keep Superman from getting the sun's sustenance.","1396311048"

If you look radiant has already taken all the outer tier towers which means the game was pretty close and I really doubt people would forfeit at this point. 

What about games where you've taken 0 towers have less than 1/4 their kills and they already have a rax and are now just afk farming the whole map while you sit in base?

What if the forfeit system required all 5 players to agree, was on a 2 minute cooldown and had required conditions such as I said above -&gt; You've taken 0 towers but enemy has your rax + double or more your kills. Do you still think this would stop comebacks like OP's?

IMO If a team wants to forfeit with the above conditions and are willing to accept they may have missed a 1/10000000 comeback than that's fine.  ","1396311048"

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","&gt;My biggest problem with it was that it felt like they kind of traced over  Batman begins a little, especially with his moody wandering of the world.

Batman felt like a man on a mission to obtain some kind of direction in life, a search for justice if you will. Clark on the other hand felt lost and confused, aimlessly wandering the world, because he didn't belong on this planet. 

They are similarly both orphans and I think you might be touching on that, but other than that its pretty much just your standard heroes journey.

&gt;(what 12 year old wouldn't test out his powers a little?) 

One afraid of hurting people or being found out, or you know one that can't control the powers and was traumatized when they were activated in public... and he did use them, several times, to save various people around the world, the bus, the oil rig, Lois lane, he was known as some kind of mysterious guardian angel remember? Also who would have guessed you could fly or run at super speeds, for a kid that's scared of himself these things would be tough to discover.

&gt;as is the idea that he would let his Dad die in that storm.

His dad dying in the storm was poorly filmed, I'll give you that, the angle was weird, and he probably could have saved him by running to him and just walking him out of the storm... 

Realistically a film crew should have been under the bridge with them reporting on the storm, putting intense pressure on the decision... but lets be honest, the idea is still there. 

Not everything can be solved by just saving people, there are larger wars than the battle at hand, and sometimes things need to be prioritized, not for yourself but for others, this is one reality that was finally actualized for superman. He had to make choices and those choices weren't black and white for once (like real choices involving life and death). 

Pa Kent didn't want to lose his son, and Clark trusted that. More importantly they were protecting Clark's potential, because his father, along with the audience knew what was at stake... Superman. 

In other words, there would be a time for a hero like Clark, to save the world or a village or a bus full of kids, but it doesn't mean its now. Sometimes its not worth risking everything you could become for something you selfishly care about. His father taught him that lesson, which is a potent one. 

&gt;Comparing pa kents death in allstar superman with th film version is a bit embarrassing imo.

You can't really compete with this death, it was beautiful in so many ways, ways that only the comic book medium could really accomplish.

&gt;For me I felt they didn't have the courage to really portray the big blue schoolboy we all love, and the film was kind of in the shadow of Nolans trilogy.

Its not about courage its about timing. The bright blue boy scout just isn't ready for the screen. One day I hope they just make a Superman movie based on a slimmed down verison of All Star... but that will never happen. In this movie their tone is clear... they are going for realism (which is an awesome juxtoposition for superheroes I think). For superman, the movie had heavy doses of sci fi and in that sense I wish the Dark Knight had more detective elements to clearly separate the movies, but that's on the Batman series, I think Man of Steel did a fine job defining itself apart. If anything MoS reminded me more of a non funny star trek, rather than any of the Batman trilogy.

And you don't get to add in the employer half of minimum wage workers. Sorry, that's not the employee paying anything. If you want to do that, then add in the pro rata portion of income tax the businesses the rich own into their share. On top of that, with things like the EITC, a ton of the lower class end up getting back more than they paid in for income tax which can negate a ton of the payroll tax they paid during the year.

Why are you so intent on insisting that the poor pay as much of the rich? You may think the rich don't pay enough, which is a fine stance to have, but there's no need to lie and try to say that the poor pay just as much.","1396311054"

"cripplingalcoholism","t5_2s68b","I, in no way, took your post as a negative. I was just venting out what my *problem* is, in that I don't believe I have a problem in the first place ;)

I live an alternate lifestyle to what would be construed as ""normal"", but that doesn't mean it's the wrong type of lifestyle, nor is anyone else better than me because I'm not *normal*.

Whoever invented *normal* as a way to describe a person needs to just be ignored. Normal is what you make of it, and living your life, realistic in your purpose, with no blame on anyone else for indulgence, is a step in being more realistic than most people on the planet. Alcoholism makes me accountable for my life, and I choose to accept it, and drink more because I want to.

As for a ""few shots in the morning and throughout the day"", this is untrue. I normally drink beer only, and usually it is in the afternoon (when shakes get bad). In the morning, I can usually cope, but it requires dealing with the anxiety at face value (I have a GF and I don't like to day drink). She accepts my lifestyle, but I just have more respect than to be drinking in the AM while she is trying to work (she works from home, so if I was drinking she would not concentrate much on work and would want to join me). She is not CA.

That said, it's afternoon drinking. I start around 4pm and I drink until roughly 1-2am. 9 hours straight, normally I get about 25 beers down. If I have other liquor, I mix it up (Gin is my favorite), but once I start, I cannot stop; it is near impossible. I don't care, though, and I don't want to stop once I start. This is a MAJOR reason why I responsibly drink at home. I know how much I drink, and I know I get blackout drunk every time. I sure as hell am not risking my safety with that of others, especially those I care about. Another reason why people who give me shit about drinking pisses me off: They don't know the strength that I have which allows me to avoid issues with this drinking, so piss off and allow me to live my life how I want. If I wasn't drinking, I'd be miserable; looking back on my deathbed at 60, I want to know I didn't just not drink because people ""said it was wrong"" or looked at me funny because of it. Not going to live to be 100 just so I can live to be miserable.

At least one brand of bupropion (Zyban) is used to help people stop smoking by reducing cravings and other withdrawal effects.
http://www.drugs.com/wellbutrin.html

Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not inhibit monoamine oxidase or the re-uptake of serotonin. While the mechanism of action of bupropion, as with other antidepressants, is unknown, it is presumed that this action is mediated by noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Not to rain on the parade, I think a iOS POS s neat thing for certain uses.

However the best restaurant/store/bar POS is handled by a local professional who specializes in such specialized systems and has years of experience.

A dedicated POS is offline and secure, it's going to run if the Internet is down, it will last a long time,can stand some abuse and give the best return on investment.

One has got to remember a busy restaurant and people drop stuff, people steal stuff, people forgot things, very dirty fingers drop things into the trash and so forth. 

It could get very expensive with iOS devices (especially theft and dropped devices) and a restaurant is supposed to make money and not lose it. :)

Also Apple changes, they upgrade iOS often, they dictate the consumer trend and doesn't remain consistent enough for many long term specialized business purposes.

Use a dedicated POS system, it will work cheaper, more reliable and you don't have to worry about it as much. It's not going to grow legs and walk away.

Save the iOS device for fun. :)

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","Copying my response from the blizzard forums:

&gt; Hey guys, I live in the southeastern US and have Cox/Comcast internet. I noticed the brief DC's from blizzard games around 10 days ago. At first I thought it was just WoW, then I noticed it was also with Hearthstone and D3 once I started playing those games again. Did the traceroute like asked, never got anywhere.

&gt; Basically, I experimented with a bunch of settings to try to stumble upon a fix and as of right now, I haven't experienced a DC in around 48 hours. I set my router to reserve an IP for my computer and set Windows to use a static IP. I also set the DNS servers to google's public DNS. Either part of that solution could be the actual problem, either the DNS server or a failure to renew my IP address. Since the DC's were happening on a almost clockwork schedule, I think it was a failure to renew the IP address after X number of minutes, but either way, I've been able to play without DCs ever since I did this.

He or she can not just declare they are no longer a peasant. So therefore, being a bloodsucking businessman, or owning lots of commodities doesn't make you less of a socialist. Because you are smart enough to know that pretending you live in a society you don't actually live in is stupid.

How can you help? if nothing else, you often have to hit bottom to start your way up (then again, people sometimes stay there).  Let him know that he has 2 weeks to find a job and show he can keep the place clean or he has to leave.  It's harsh but he's not going to listen to talk.","1396311062"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Drug laws deprive more people of money/livelihood/freedom than drug use does... I'd much rather use a controlled dose of a ""hard drug"" (which I completely abstain from because of potential risks to my physical well-being) than be caught in possession of that same drug by law enforcement in most states. Using the drug has a small risk of long-term detriment to my life if I've done my homework and have a shred of self-restraint but merely possessing that drug could completely destroy my future aspirations. This fact completely baffles me yet eludes most of the voting public. 

EDIT- any bad habit can fuel poor choices made out of desperation. I completely agree with your point and I've personally seen people go through this exact situation after taking prescription pain meds after surgery and getting hooked. Although they resorted to petty crime to fuel their habit and were punished accordingly and are now correcting their course, thankfully. Possession charges can often have more dire consequences than addiction, which I think is the bigger issue. I think most on the legalization front would rather divert law enforcement funds to offer treatment to those who do suffer from addiction and let recreational users do as they will so long as they don't commit crimes under the influence.

I don't know exactly who Malone Charters caters to, but I bet a lot of their clients probably live in communities very similar to these. So when it comes down to it, it seems that Malone Charters is more upset that they didn't find as compliant a market as they would have hoped.  Perhaps they should take their spokesman's advice and consider if where they are doing business is the best place for them, just as those ""sheep"" who moved into Craig's shadow should have.","1396311065"

Seriously though, most songs sound great on a 12-string, if you can get your technique down.  I find that you can't really bang on a 12-string like you would a 6-string - it just sounds sloppy.  If you're going to strum, it needs to be relatively softly.  More often than not, it will sound better if you arpeggiate your chords rather than strumming them.  My favorite song to play on my 12-string recently is ""From the Beginning"" by Emmerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.  The somewhat minimalist rhythm guitar part sounds great.  There are several Zeppelin songs that works great on a 12-string as well.  I'd recommend ""Tangerine"" to start, as it's pretty easy to play.","1396311069"

If not now, then in the future, because there are generations coming up, of every ""skin colour"" that genuinely want some change, the sort of the change that the ANC does not presently seem to want to give.

I've seen Dan Harmon and Justin Roiland's work over the years ([The Lynx](http://www.channel101.com/episode/394) and [Most Extraordinary Space Investigations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1RZYnBMRpc) are the finest pieces of artistic masterpiece ever birthed by human beings) and they have mastered the art of turning laziness into a comedic asset... so I think this is more a question of the BBC protecting a 50-year-old franchise (an immovable object) and Dan/Justin who probably have more comedic balls than a juggling convention (an unstoppable force)... so were the Doctor and Rick ever to enter the same universe, I would predict that reality itself would simply end.

That means you won't be seeing the same tired, and at time baffling, looks that you saw for 8 seasons straight.

Giants major question is still O line... Lot of new pieces. Still need to see what they'll do in the draft. Need to see if Beatty will turn around the shit show play from last year.

If there's one glaring lesson from last year, our pocket passing QB cannot play without a halfway decent offensive line. Eli has always had a tendency to force balls, taking away a reasonable amount of comfort in the pocket for most of the season is just a recipe for disaster, he gets rushed, blows his reads, just genuinely sucks. Give him a comfortable pocket and he can make bad tools look good.

Having four of five lineman being third stringers or tired/injured/incapable vets is not an option. We've started to get younger and switch in some new pieces but they need to gel.","1396311076"

I expect this puts more stress on the bike than you riding sedately on a decent surface would.

Make sure your tyres are well inflated to avoid pinch flats. You might find it worth while to switch to some large slick tyres, once you try them you'll realise just how much knobblies slow a bike down.

One mistake many people do when taking up exercise is trying to do too much too soon having a most unpleasant experience as a result and then jacking it in. It's better to start slowly and build up from there, this way you'll be amazed how after a while hills that used to be a real challenge a conquered with relative ease.","1396311077"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I didn't want to get into details on how a support contributes as I thought it was self-explanatory. An Enigma ult, a Nyx impale/gank, Shadow Shaman backdoor, can have impact at all stages on the game.

The truth is that MMR measures an ability to win, and people with low mmr playing support have the same ability to win as their teammates. Blaming your teammates it's stupid. Supports can have high-impact in the game, and a higher skilled support would be able to maintain relevant throughout the game.

People in this subreddit watch some pro-play tips and follow them blindly. I know this because I too feel that I know more about the game than my teammates. I watch A LOT of pro-dota, but last hitting skills, positioning, map-awareness and game awareness, are WAY more important than blindly trying to gank mid and planting wards in the same rune spots, following the same pro skill build, etc. 

I assure you that ALL low mmr support players commit mistakes that account for their MMR, including me. The most important being, supporting the wrong way. I've seen supports warding the same rune spots, when we should've vision somewhere else, failing to stack jungle when the carry farm is secure, etc, etc.  A support may think they've done it all, but they just didn't do what they needed to do to win the game. I've committed those mistakes a thousand times when playing support but I don't blame my teammates when we ALL lose as a team.","1396311079"

*  Dont go over 4 hour sessions depending on your pain threshold. I did an 8 hour session on this one cauz i was traveling to get it finished and my immune system hated me for it and i had fever for a week.
*  CODEINE! I live in Canada so tylenol with codeine is sold over the counter but i got my doctor to prescribe me codeine for that purpose only and he agreed... im not a pussy and i have a good part of my body tattooed with no drugs but for long sessions on the ribs i did need the help.
* Sugar. keep your sugar level high, i eat candy while getting tattooes, i find cafeine also helps but thats just me
* Bactine. if youre doing the whole lining and shading in the same session i suggest u use bactine after the lines are done, its a numbing spray but itll only work on already wounded skin. I honnestly only used it the last few hours after two days in a row of tattooing the same spots
* Distraction. music, iphone games, a friend, a friendly artist (although sometimes they need to focus)
* meditation. ""Pain is in my head, i can overcome it. i can think of other things."" just remember you are not being stabbed to death even tho it feels that way, someone is just scratching your skin and its very superficial pain. relax, breathe a lot as to not tense up your muscles... BREATHE
* DO NOT drink alcohol or take any blood-thining meds like aspirin. be rested and eat well before.

&gt; Upon entering high school, two best friends named Hana and Alice notice a boy a year older them while waiting for the train, and they both develop a pretty strong crush on him. One day while secretly following him home, Hana witnesses the boy walk right into a wall and pass out. When he wakes up, she lies and convinces him that he must have amnesia, because he doesn't remember the fact that she was his girlfriend. After this, hilarity ensues as the two girls attempt to run with the lie. Of course, complications soon arise.

I really want to better understand why pts think like this. Again, this is with me explaining in both technical and layperson explanations. Do they think I'm lazy? It'd be easier to write out a script and send them away. Do they think it's a knowledge deficit? Abx or no abx for URI is a pretty easy clinical algorithm. 

Also nurses, a bunch of us are guilty of this too. About half of my nurse pts are awesome because they know and understand abx usage and so I don't have to spend 10 mins explaining. Half of them however think because they're a nurse then normal rules shouldn't apply to them. ","1396311082"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","The market for jobs in the university sector is fierce. There are 8 universities; the universities are structured to minimise the number of formal teaching positions, and these are normally temporary positions given over to post-graduate students. This process tends to be managed in-house, and these jobs are not advertised.

Permanent positions tend to be research positions. Creative writing instruction positions at university level are rare as hens' teeth, and tend to go to successful writers. Actual permanent teaching positions at university level are highly desirable.

There's a broader run of tertiary institutions around the country. Polytechs, technical institutes, wananga, and lots of private institutions. These are really variable, but are mostly comparable to Community Colleges in the United States. These include jobs of the kind that you appear to be describing. These will tend to be advertised through standard employment websites.","1396311083"

We had just switched and I was getting cozy in bed. I opened my eyes and faced the wall, and to the left of the wall was the door. I saw a tall, wide, and bulky black shape peering from the doorway, as if it were standing in the hall and leaning in to gaze into the room. I thought it was my mom, but I found it strange that I couldn't make out any of her features. It was simply a black shadow thing. I called out for my mom quietly, and the thing spun around and fled into the hall. I went to my room and woke up my mom. She said she had not been in the room, and that's when I froze with fear.

What was so scary is that the shadow person and I stared at each other for a good while, and if I hadn't called my mom it would have continued to do so, I think.","1396311085"

It's about at the western edge of the city, surrounded on all sides by suburbia and warehouses. In fact, there's a minimum climb advisory off of runway 14, as it runs directly over a neighbourhood (the rest of them go over commercial districts). As far as the city goes, think Chicago, but higher population density (4 million in the downtown core, closer to 12-13 million in the metro area). It's an early colony city, built on a harbour and extending into the nearby desert.

It's a civilian port, so most traffic is either passengers and cargo between cities, or between the city and a series of geosynchronous stations, which themselves connect to different systems. Occasionally, naval aircraft show up for training exercises and airshows from the nearby Navy Station Gambo.

"Military","t5_2qh8y","What about this rang true? It seems to me that she very much has a chip on her shoulder. What exactly prevented her from competing with the men besides her physiology? 

I knew Marines who would get back from 10 hours traipsing around Camp Barrett doing TBS stuff and then go to the gym and do stairs for an hour wearing full pack to get ready for IOC from the first week of TBS. 

They were given the MOS because they had shown that they wanted it. They passed the CET because they had gone above and beyond in the months prior - no one held their hands through preparing for it. 

As far as I know the Marine Corps doesn't prevent you from exceeding the PFT standard - if you want to hold yourself to the male standard then by all means go ahead. 

I understand the argument that if the Marine Corps expects less from its female Marines, it will get less - the only reason I can do 20 pullups is because that's the standard. The reason I can't do 25 is because that's *not* the standard. However, I don't really buy that - I can't do 25 pullups because there is no hypothetical standard that I'm comparing myself to. But the male PFT standard is very much in your face every day as a female. 

The takeaway is that we should converge on one PFT standard, which I agree should happen. But then you get all the people who are more concerned with equality of outcome than equality of opportunity.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This basically came down almost 100% to the record industry oligopoly of the time. I'm a big armchair music industry fan. I think one of the most profound changes the internet has brought forth to pop culture is actually the distribution of music. Music was 'global' before, but now its undoubtedly global. 

Think back to the 80's and early 90's. If you wanted your song on the radio, you almost required a record deal. Like anything corporate, there are politics at play and if your music isn't immediately appealing to a shockingly small amount of people from a labels A&amp;R combined with at least some social savvy in you or your band's ability to deal with them you're in trouble. You start out shopping out demos to college radio and playing some local small attendance shows and if word doesn't spread quick you're pretty much done. Nobody else on Earth has any way to hear you. 

While Europe generally took the 80's synth sound and did more with it branching out to various other forms of electric music which their local record companies picked up on, the US culture was pushed into a different direction back toward a 'rock' sound. The explosion of popularity with Hip Hop around the same time also kept the major US labels basically ignoring a lot of the Chicago house and Miami bass (or breakbeat) getting pumped out around that time. 

There were actually US 'techno' acts that got considerable recognition in Europe while only being locally popular in the U.S. Two big examples would be in my opinion [Frankie Knuckles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Knuckles) from Chicago and to a lesser extent [DJ Icey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dj_icey) later in the early 90's out of Miami. 

You've probably heard adaptations or samples from [one of Frankie Knuckles most notably tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOLE1YE_oFQ). I've always felt he was probably somewhat influenced by early rap groups such as [Melle Mel's White Lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsTJaP2tC0A). 

You could further make the argument that rap music WAS North American techno of the 90's, although with a heavy vocal element. There was a lot of obvious crossover and influence in the production of 80's/90's rap and European breakbeat, house, and even trance music.

The bottom line however was that the music industry in the U.S. was booming so well off of grunge and rap alone that they were leery about pushing too much investment into house and techno music when at the time it was viewed by the industry as something that was just a subculture niche in Miami, Chicago and to a lesser extent Cali/NY. At the time a mediocre new rap group would undoubtedly still field better record sales than a mediocre techno artist. 

tl;dr Rap was the US techno of the 80's/90's and due to the recording industries profits coming mostly from record scales techno was too risky of an investment for most labels to pursue aggressively in the U.S. market. I'd add as a personal side opinion that the view of techno music as a 'gay' subculture in a generally less tolerant U.S. market further added to major labels aversion to pushing it.","1396311090"

A few responses:

&gt;How is mommy cheating dad's fault all of a sudden?

I would point out (after biting my tongue for a long time) that we don't know anything about the context here. I refuse to speculate, but I'd be interested to know more about what preceded the infidelity. 

That said, if we look at the impact his actions are likely to have on the children, they're not likely to ever say: ""Dad felt emasculated and miserable after mother's infidelity, so he -- quite reasonably -- swam in the neighbor's pool after he became convinced that the wedding vows were null and void.""

Instead, they'll probably say: ""My parents hated each other, so they both cheated."" Contrast that with what could be: ""My mom cheated on my dad, so he divorced her and fought hard for custody of us.""

&gt;I would rather not set the example to my children that you suffer for someone that doesn't return the favor.

That's an overly simplistic either/or and you know it (or you should). Nowhere have I ever suggedted that he ""suffer for someone that doesn't return the favor"". DTMFA, obviously.

"baduk","t5_2qhqe","If you want to present go then you have to know your audience and know what kinds of information appeal to them.

I would at all costs avoid explaining the rules in detail. They're simple and don't take much time, but they also disrupt the flow of a presentation and are unnecessarily technical for an introductory presentation. Instead just focus on the rules as they come up in your presentation. By this I mean, it's easy to explain how pieces are played and that it's turn based. But I wouldn't delve directly into what a Ko is unless you have some way to keep people engaged. (for example triple ko anecdotes or super ko rules.)

Instead focus on highlighting the importance of Go for the individual and key points in Go history. 

Possible points:
Go AI's (crazy stone or zen)
Strategic Differences between Go and Chess is a very common 
Go in media (Hikaru no go, Teen wolf, Beautiful Mind, etc...) with the exception of Hikaru, Go has culturally embedded meanings in these shows/movies. 
Historically, Go Seigen was key in ""revolutionizing"" the Go world. You could talk about how he revolutionized Go and what that means for the health of a good game. Revolutions in games are very common so it could be interesting to compare it to other games if you're well versed in the history of other games. 
The origin of Go, since that's your topic, is unclear but there's a myth that an emperor had the game created for his son. 
Another historical/interesting point is the beliefs behind the triple ko and why it's considered a bad omen. 
Go as therapy is also an interesting point to touch on...


Honestly, Go-moku is very boring I think. Even though there are some tournaments held, I personally think it has a shallow history and isn't particularly interesting by itself. For that reason, I think it's better to start large and cut things out of your presentation instead of choosing a simpler presentation that you might run out of gas on.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","Come to Singapore.... We got cookies here :D

Health wise, I'm a Singaporean Malay Ex-muslim, and my advice is don't go for dates and fasting only. In Singapore, we have a great team of professional dietician in our hospitals if you want to seek proper advice. The great thing about dates is that it has anti-oxident properties, a bunch of minerals, some fiber, a tonne of carbs and that's basically it. You will need a proper balanced diet to get the best out of your food to be in the best of shape. My unprofessional advice, go for a vegetarian diet instead of ""just dates"".

And about fasting, don't starve yourself. I know ""god"" told us not to eat and drink between sunrise to sunset, but that is utterly bullshit. You can go for an intermittent fasting which trigger your body's hormones to go into survival mode. But starving yourself will not benefit you in the long run because your body still need those essential vitamins and minerals to keep everything else going. And don't dehydrate yourself. The worst thing about Islamic fasting is not the lack of carbs but the dangerous lack of fluids. People get into dangerous situations during ramadan primarily due to dehydration rather than lack of food so always drink water if you're feeling thirsty. Water will help flush away any toxins ailing you and keep you alive.

As for social stuff, we got the a lot of meetups in Singapore from all walks of life. :)","1396311095"

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","OK, I got this old HOB filter and want to try to make a refugium out of it. I am not quite sure what all the pieces do and what I can salvage. I have titled the pictures in the imgur album so I can reference them here and for ease of discussion.

Pic 1. I know I need a prefilter, but it didn't come with one. I will double check in the lab tomorrow and see if I can find it.

Pic 2. Top view. The pvc pipe in the middle has a notch cut into it in the bottom 3rd of the box.

Pic 3. Some sort of return. There's a piece of black pipe or tubing broken off and a place for air injection. I don't know if I have a plan for this.

Pic 4. PVC with notches cut into the pipe. I am not certain the green tubing is where it's supposed to be.

Pic 5. This is a pre-filter I have from another setup. I was wondering about getting a piece of plexi to fit into the slots in pic 1, drill a hole to line up with the plastic screw and try to use it.

I know I need a U-piece for the actual siphon from the pre-filter to the fuge, and I have a small pump I was just going to put some tubing on for a return. I plan on running a clip on LED light I've got coming from Amazon to try to nurture some chaeto and some pods.

Any suggestions on how to cobble this together for a minimum cost?

An Arduino may not be suitable for a consumer product but for lower volume equipment that you would find on a factory floor, clean room or on an engineer or hobbyist bench they make sense.

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","What is up with all of the hate against Gamestop? There are a number of reason I'm still going to trade in at Gamestop. Consoles still trade it for at ~$100.00 more. True, trade in value you're looking at is about $6.00 or $3.00 (with membership) more at WalMart; however, if you trade at Gamestop and you have a membership, you will also save about $3.50 on average when buying used. Therefore, the discount isn't that much. 

I think there is too much blind hate for a company that offers value for trade-ins. If you aren't interested, don't take advantage of it. However, you cannot expect Gamestop to give you full value for your games, because, if they did that, then they would make no money.

With the current releases, I am trying to find a balance between putting out original products, products that others like, and products that I personally like. As you can see there are a few very original camp patterns that no one is doing right now in each release. As we get more and more exposure, I will start making the products more and more unique and original.

Also, due to our small size, we cannot put out all different kinds of clothing so we mainly are focusing on hats for now. As we get bigger, we will expand to more types of clothes.","1396311104"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","The three points below all may or may not apply to Hibbert. The plays shown in the video only referred to point 4. I am sure they will emphasize all four points equally when discussing this with the refs.

To be considered vertical, a defender must:

1. Be in the air to defend the shot when contact occurs. If the player is on the ground inside the restricted area, with his arms “vertical” when contact occurs, he will be assessed a blocking foul.

2. Maintain a vertical trajectory by jumping straight up. If the player jumps toward or to the side of an oncoming player, he will be assessed a blocking foul. A player may, however, angle his jump backwards slightly in such a way as to absorb the impact of the oncoming player, and of course, he may land behind where he leapt from because of the force of the contact.

3. Maintain vertical alignment, with his body (arms, hands, torso, legs and feet) in a nearly straight line that is perpendicular to the floor. If a player leans his arms forward or “jack-knifes” his legs toward the oncoming offensive player, he will be assessed a blocking foul.","1396311105"

That's called correlation = causation, which I already said before. You have properties and logic examples available from history of collapses which you are ignoring on purpose, you have the laws of physics explaining why they couldn't be normal collapses, which you are ignoring on purpose, etc.

This is not ockhams razor, this is biased correlation.

&gt;Every other explanation (e.g. ""the plane may have crashed into the building but the building was brought down by explosives"", or ""the whole hijacking was an elaborate plot"", or ""every building was brought down by the planes except WTC7 which was brought down by an controlled explosion"" etc.) expects more unknown variables to be fullfilled and is therefore less desirable. 

Don't mix evidences and facts with personal interpertation of events.

&gt;The planes did crush into the buildings and the buildings went down, or? pretty conclusive evidence here. 

Firefighters also entered the buildings and those went down, pretty conclusive evidence here? Correlation = causation is not a valid form of argumentation.

Of course, there are other bad dictatorships too, like the Kim dynasty of North Korea, the military junta of Myanmar, Pol Pot of Cambodia and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines. These people presided over their countries economic and social regression.

---

&gt;__Dupuytren's contracture__ (also known as __morbus Dupuytren__, or __Dupuytren's disease__),  is a fixed [flexion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexion) [contracture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contracture) of the [hand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand) due to a palmar [fibromatosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromatosis),  where the fingers bend towards the palm and cannot be fully extended (straightened). It is an inherited proliferative connective tissue disorder which involves the [palmar fascia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmar_aponeurosis) of the hand.  It is named after [Baron Guillaume Dupuytren](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillaume_Dupuytren), the [surgeon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery) who described an [operation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgery) to correct the affliction in the *[Lancet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lancet_(journal\))* in 1831.

"SolForge","t5_2unly","What you propose is a good idea.

The problem I'm trying to solve, however, is that 1-2 bad drafts in a row can lock a free-to-play player out of the real fun of the game for *weeks*.  It's not at all difficult to have several bad drafts in a row, either.  Hell, from what I've seen  I went 1-3 with a better deck than some streamers draft.

Sorry for my complaint, but as a free-to-play player, I looked forward to draft when it was announced because it would *finally* give me a chance to compete with the pay-to-win boys.

And you know what?  It did.  I went 3-0 a couple times, only went 0-3 once, and generally averaged slightly more 2-1 than 1-2.  I drafted once every 2-4 days.  I would have liked to draft more, but what I was getting was all right.

However, the new tournament format comes in, and not only am I on a losing streak, but even if I was doing as well as I do on average I'd only get to draft once every 4-6 days.  Even if I go 3-1 and get a free draft, they take long enough now that I'm only going to draft when I have enough time to do two back to back.  So even when I finally win, I'll get less days out of the week I get to draft.

I feel screwed out of the fun I was having before.  No joke, with my overall average, I get 1.5 times less fun now than I did before the patch.  With my current record... literally 4 times less fun.","1396311113"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; The US had (and still has) similar plans and is in the process of advancing them, just that they are using different tactics.

Wow, you are seriously out of touch with reality if you believe that the US is attempting to ""take over the world"", and especially if they are attempting to do so through exterminating large groups of people. You know what the US wants more than anything these days? The status quo, and that does not involve the US taking over the world.

&gt;The US is monstrous, too. There is no denying that. Regardless of your ""but but but Germany was meaner! :(("" bullshit.

Wow, as I said, the US is no angel but it take some serious mental gymnastics to put them on the same level as the Nazis.

&gt; Hating Jews. Check.

Yup, Jews haven't always been popular in the US like much of the rest of the world. Big difference here is that the US has never tried to systematically exterminate them but you know that is but a minor detail.

&gt; Hating gays. Check.

A prejudice that is by no means unique to America and one it is currently grappling with. I don't see how this makes them the same as the Nazis because once again they have never tried to exterminate them. 

&gt; Hating black people. Check.

Another prejudice that the US grapples with to this day. But the US also fought a war over Slavery and then went through the Civil Rights movement. The US isn't perfect, as I have said, but they have made massive improvements over the years.

&gt; Hating minorities in general. Check.

Same as the last 2, I am not even gonna bother.

&gt; Forced sterilization and euthanasia of undesirables. Check.
Human experimentation. Check.

Never a national policy but I agree that eugenics is a black mark on American history.

&gt; Human experimentation. Check.

Same as the last one

&gt; Concentration camps. Check.

Except those concentration camps didn't exist for the express purpose of murdering millions of innocent people. What the US did to its Japanese citizens was deplorable, but they didn't then go ahead and murder them all. 

&gt; Insane world-domination fantasies they are trying to fulfil. Check.

As I said, the US wants business usual. That doesn't include taking over the world any more than they already have. 

&gt; Genocide and ethnic cleansing. Check.

US treatment of the Native Americans was deplorable but it was never the policy of the US to exterminate them. They did fight war after war with them and at times the US was much too heavy handed in their treatment, but it was never *genocide*.

&gt; Slavery. Check. (Oh wait, Germany never even had that, I think we can stop.)

And a war was fought to end that practice. Oh and btw, Germany used slave labor extensively during WW2 so it is incorrect to say it ""never even had that"". Nor would they have stopped the practice if they had won the war.

&gt;Like the US has changed internally throughout history, Nazi Germany would have changed, too. A state of power and abundance usually leads to more liberal developements, which would have eventaully happened in the Third Reich, too.

Oh so you mean Germany would have changed its ways after murdering upwards of 100 million people and subjugating the majority of Europe to its rule? Oh well thats ok then.

It's not so much of salvaging the friendship as to simply giving her more space, now again, her being overwhelmed doesn't mean you are doing anything wrong, in fact if you are doing everything right, (e.g. always being there when she need someone, being a good friend.etc) will actually make it more overwhelming. I always have this rule/theory I stick to, is that if a relationship is not working out, temporarily or permenantly, it's not the fault of anyone, but it's up to both parties to make compromises to fix the situation, so if you do feel like you she is just distancing you, try matching the amount of attention you give her with the amount of attention she give you.","1396311123"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Also if you want a more complicated answer about how those processors work: 

Basically the processor puts out low-voltage AC electricity onto the tracks. At the ends of the approaches (the limit to which the processor will be able to ""see"", a distance which will be chosen based on how fast the trains in the area will be) there will be a wire across the track (sometimes it will have a capacitor inside of it, set up to filter out everything but that particular set frequency of AC, so it doesn't interfere with other circuits).

The box monitors the voltage/current/resistiveness of the circuit when it sits like that. It calculates a value based on the received voltage, with normal being at 100 (meaning 100% of the approach). When a train comes along, instead of the short circuit being at those wires, the short circuit is now the leading axle of the train. As it gets closer to the crossing, it cuts out more rail, and makes the circuit shorter, making the circuit less resistive, and decreasing the voltage drop across it. That value on the display will start dropping from 100, and a speed will be calculated by the processor, based on the slope of that drop.","1396311123"

"DarkSouls2","t5_2vqni","Some weapons also seem to do much more damage on backstabs than others due to their animations, as well.  Greathammer class backstabs on flat ground frequently get three hits of full damage, resulting in much higher damage than even backstabs of more powerful strength weapons.  (For example, I've only ever cleared 1.5k backstab damage with my Large Club +10, never with my 50-higher-AR Greatsword +10.  The two numbers that stick in my mind are a 1920-ish backstab I got on one enemy and a 2270-ish backstab that I 100-0'd an invader with.)

With a lot of straight swords, greatswords, and ultra greatswords, backstab damage seems to be roughly equivalent to two one-handed R2 hits, if I recall correctly.","1396311124"

It is _impossible_ to say ""nigger"" in an African American Vernacular Accent just as it's impossible to say it in a Boston accent, that's just how the accent works. It automatically transforms nigger into nigga. Saying 'nigga' in a General American accent is nothing more than a poor imitation of African-American Vernacular English.

&gt; If you have a black friend who is fine with being called the former affectionately

This comment seems to imply that you assume that I am not black?

&gt; The word is not being reclaimed as a form of address, when considered a form of address it comes out like ""Hello, nigger."" The word had to evolve to another one to be used in addressing people affectionately.

The only people who make that distinction seem to be white and not speakers of African-American Vernacular English. And it's honestly a case of slacktivism. People caring about language so that they don't have to care about the actual problems. Because it's easy to care about language and it doesn't cost money. You can act in that way that you're invested into the problems of the minorities while you can live in the big house in your rich white neighbourhood which you mainly got by being a descendant of slavekeepers. While entire blocks are filled with poor black people living in flats in Harlem, and they got there by no other reason than being descendants of slaves.

One: Just because they say something is there, doesn't mean it is. Humans love to fuck with other humans, especially if that person is a stranger. Some guy comes to your town, speaking gibberish and acting all superior and keeps asking about some picture, you will get annoyed with him and say ""yep, I saw that a few years back. It was over yonder."" Guy leaves, you can now get back to business.

Sometimes they might like the guy and don't want to his feelings, so they say, ""sure I saw something similar"". Guy is happy, maybe there is a small reward, and everyone leaves feeling good about themselves without getting anywhere.

I'm impressed at her intelligence and in her occasional maturity past her age group.

I'm stunningly not impressed at how immature and stupid she is at some things, though. She takes our parents political views as being perfect without researching them at all. She's anxious to the point of being strongly religious due to a fear of death- when she was younger and less anxious, she decided that she was an atheist- but now literally won't even think about things she doesn't like because they make her nervous and she doesn't like that. She's bullheaded, refuses to be corrected even when she's horrifically wrong, and can't take criticisms.

his mobility is still crazy post 6, and he can stick to people like nothing. He roams like no one can.

I'm finally being proactive at fixing my own mistakes and it certainly doesn't come from other people raging at me, it came from playing with a friend of mine in platoons (yeah I'm no True Professional) who would break down my mistakes for me and offer good suggestions.

When he gets back there is a different gun under his pillow. It's because there was a murder in the room across the hall and the murderer saw there was a door open so went to hide the gun in there, coincidentally (I think) looking under the pillow to hide it and finding that there was already a gun there, so he swapped them to frame the owner of the room.","1396311132"

First consider the combination problem. How many ways are there to select 4 positions as women out of 30 total positions without any two adjacent?

Break it into two cases, either a woman in the first position or not. If not, then every woman has a man before her, and you can consider it placing four MW pairs among the other 22 men. If a woman is in the first position, then consider placing three MW pairs among the other 23 men.

How many combinations do you get? For each combination, count the number of ways to then assign which woman to which position and which man to which position.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It's not equivalent in C++ for non-trivial types. i++ is going to fire a copy constructor and matching destructor call. For ints it will be optimized away by the compiler of course, but if it's an iterator of some sort it's going to be implementation dependent. If I was particularly malicious, my destructor could open a network port and fire the missiles. ++i is always going to be optimal for both the compiler and my sanity.

In interpreted languages, the necessary copy may or may not be optimized away in an ""i++"" situation. Why rely on the optimization of the interpreter/compiler when it's trivial to just get in the habit of using ""++i"" in any language where the construct is relevant?

Personally, when I execute code in my head, I read ""i++"" as ""copy, increment original, destroy copy"" and ""++i"" as ""increment"". It's slightly less cognitive load and makes the authors intent clearer. I find i++ inelegant and messy when you are just planning on throwing that copy away.","1396311136"

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Okay so I'm in Silver and I try to ward constantly, if my lane is getting camped I make sure to buy a ward every back but honestly, if the jungler is ignoring me often it just slips my mind or I think my trinket ward is good enough.

This sometimes gets me killed, often it doesn't (but I have to use flash or other spells to get away and have to back).

The only time I can remember just not buying wards when I obviously needed to was a couple days back when I just kept getting caught out by the enemy Talon and almost cost us the whole game (even though all other lanes were winning). It was due to my (flawed) reasoning that I needed combat stats more than vision. After nine deaths I realized I was wrong and started buying some wards, we came back and won by getting a pick on their talon then murdering their entire team because talon was the only fed guy on their whole team.","1396311137"

"ouya","t5_2uhbj","It's not a matter of difficulty. It's very easy to make a timer that counts down... or display a pay wall screen after a particular event occurs (boss fight, door opens, enter world, score cap, etc). But 9 times out of 10, you'll ignore it. Satiated with free entertainment, you'll move along to another free game. 

In this situation, you got to be entertained. And we got nothing.

The question is, why do we HAVE to participate in this business model? Why was this mandated as a policy of OUYA to begin with? We're the ones who spent months, if not years, developing this game, sinking hundreds of man hours into creating this experience out of nothing. Designing, drawing, programming, testing, reiterating, refining, marketing, distributing, and maintaining it.

Your $3 dollar contribution is all that we're asking in order to experience that which we've produced. You won't get ads. It won't be pay to win. It will be a single, atomic experience from start to finish, with maybe some DLC to add to the adventure, or to make the game experience just a smidge different, for variety's sake.

A burger costs $3. A candy bar costs $1. A game at Dave &amp; Busters costs you $0.75. And you'll line up around the block at a Gamestop or Best Buy to buy Call of Duty for $70 on release day. You have no problem with paying for similar experiences like them over and over and over again, even if they didn't turn out to be that fun, tasty, or redeeming.  

But, if it's an OUYA game. Hold on a sec... let's call your accountant. That's a heady decision to make. It is... after all... $3.

Now, take care to know that we'll give you all the screenshots you would like of our game. You can watch a YouTube trailer of our game in progress. You can watch a YouTube video of a Let's Play. You can talk with us, the actual developers, on our dev blogs or on Twitter if you have any pressing questions. You can watch how we built the game through our TwitchTV casts. And you can catch a review from those who didn't feel apprehensive about putting what it would normally cost to buy a latte at Starbucks toward our game, play it for a few hours, then spend another hour or two writing an article or recording a video review.

We're not building $60, AAA titles here. We make independent games that cost $1 - $5. The lion's share of the risk sits squarely in our court, so it's up to us to try our best to make something new and interesting. If we fail, you have everything at your disposal to utterly ruin our day, or to voice your concerns about how we've bilked you out of such a balance-shattering, rent-jeopardizing sum of money.

Otherwise, just remember how grateful we are... when we finally make that $3 score, and OUYA takes its 30% cut, and Uncle Sam takes his 30% cut... my artist, my designer, and I are going to take that remaining $1.47 and cut it three ways. 

Knowing that what we do makes you interested enough to pay for our game... well, that makes that $0.49 per sale totally worth it. Now maybe, JUST MAYBE, you can get 100,000 other people to do the same thing, so that I can earn a half-yearly wage off of our hard work. 

But, please, stop pressuring us for free games. We're trying to run a business here.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold. :-)","1396311138"

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Hi.  I just finished a DMA in Comp today!  Sounds like you are asking about portfolio requirements… things like entry exams should be a no brainer if you are at the right level to enter a doctoral program.

Your portfolio *should* be as diverse as possible.  Orchestral music, choral, chamber, piano, electroacoustic, etc… Even more important, however, is that you have a ""voice"".  Something that a committee can recognize - maybe something that relates to whichever prof you intend to study with.  For better or worse, schools will likely care less about film or pop music, so don't clutter your portfolio with it (although having some interesting stuff like that on your resume will certainly fill you out as an applicant).

That being said, I got into a number of programs without a super deep portfolio.  I had other ""things"" to bring to the table… I was a little older (not jumping from program to program), and am still primarily a performer.  I also have extensive experience working in the music industry, pop stuff, jazz, and tons of arranging experience.  That's what set me apart from other applicants (I think).  I hope that helps.  

Ph.D programs in Comp are pretty rare - but they will focus more on academics, in which case it's about GRE, writing samples, &amp; other yucky not-writing-music kind of stuff.  Plus everything else I mentioned.  ","1396311144"

"RPI","t5_2rg3u","It's fine that you disagree with me, in fact, that you for openly discussing the issue. I do think that Freshmen and Sophomores have the right to vote on the issue because this change doesn't just refer to living off-campus but acting irresponsible anywhere off-campus. Additionally if the issue was just living off-campus,  Seniors (if they're graduating) wouldn't be so directly affected after voting but the other Senators' constituents would have years left to be affect by the issue. 
On the topic of issues being brought to the table with little warning, it's makes the work of student gov reps harder but it's part of the job. Frequently changes to motions will be made that are controversy and may or may not come with warning. For example, earlier this year the Senate debated a GPA requirement for its members that lasted 3 hours. This alone is nothing outlandish but this was special because it was the first ever meeting of that Senate! Many members were simultaneously learning parliamentary procedure (technicalities in how meetings are run to make them fair and democratic). Lastly, quorum is a typical Senate struggle. For those that don't know, quorum is a condition for conducting official business such that a sufficient number of voting members are present. Senators are students first and it's hard to make a 2-3 hour weekly meeting time that sometimes 30 people must make. Those things being said I believe it is the responsibility of the Senate and the group proposing the issue to work together to make the discussion as legitimate(in all senses of the word), as possible.

I myself have been attracted to people who my friends say are average looking, but something about them just clicks with me.  I'm pretty sure it was always shared interests.  Maybe go on okcupid and try going out with people and being a good date.  Try to get to know people because, hey they're people, and you have a way better chance of clicking with a great girl.

I hated for my mom to go anywhere. Later I realized it was an attachment problem--my mom was never attached healthily to my siblings and me and so I was very insecure and hated being alone. 

Anyway, maybe it's a form of separation anxiety. Maybe the fact that your parents are so busy and you end up caring for him much of the time has prevented a healthy attachment between him and your parents. Or, maybe there is a simpler explanation, like he saw something scary on tv. 

Either way, you should encourage him to communicate what the root of his fears are, and include your parents in the discussion so they can help solve the problem.

3. It's already been established that Stalin ordered the executions of around 700,000 people. Senseless and many of them were innocent no doubt. However, of these around half were never executed. So where does this ""Stalin killed 40 million"" bullshit come from? It comes from the capitalist class who repeatedly trumps that up to state that ""socialism will never work.""

China's air pollution comes from a mixture of dirty coal burning, industrial emissions, and automotive exhaust.

The reason all of this is so bad is because they have virtually zero regulations on any of it.

By the way, their coal makes up something like 70% of their electrical needs (they are the largest consumer of coal in the world) and they have some of the nastiest coal anywhere.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Patriarchy isn't a theory--it's a political practice, like any legalized form of discrimination.  We don't live in a patriarchal society here in the west because there is no legal option which men have that women cannot also have; there is no law or regulation or legally enforceable business practice that favors men over women.  You simply can't find any.  There are plenty that favor women over men, but that's why the MRM exists--to get rid of those unfair advantages, too.

I've devoted a whole conversation over on this thread to discussing ACTUAL patriarchal institutions in the Middle East and SE Asia:

http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/21ght1/how_would_you_respond_to_this/cgctd8s

In places like Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Indonesia, and elsewhere in the developing world, there are very clear laws on the books that favor men over women, or give men recognizable legal and political control over women, especially family members.  In my post series above, I posted this gut-wrenching video about Nada Al-Ahdal, the 11 year old girl who ran away from home to avoid being married off to an old man for money:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXespwyiefY

Even though the male anchors are horrified by what the Egyptian cleric is saying about men having the right to ""marry off"" girls as young as 9 (!!!!!!), that cleric is protected by law and those who practice such abuses are upheld by local law and Islamic sharia.  Though the situation in some of these communities is getting better, the difference in women's position in society between Yemen and the US is so stark that only a heartless and brainless fool would even put them on the same playing field.","1396311157"

"boston","t5_2qh3r","I must be honest I thought suits are more expensive than it seems they actually are.  My impression was mens warehouse was around $300, the next level up still below luxury brands was $700-800 and luxury brand ones were $1000+.  I had looked at mens warehouse, but hadn't looked at saks and similar places assuming they were well outside my price range.

Now that I look at them (based on comments in this thread) a decent amount of the luxury brands are actually between $500 and $1000 (though obviously the high end goes far higher).

To be honest all I really care about is I want something that someone who knows what quality suits are won't immediately say ""that is a cheap suit and fits poorly.""  I don't care all that much about brand name.  

If I had more experience I would go with buying online (or get a used one) and get it fitted, but that is something I am reluctant to do without more time/experience.

I appreciate the advice.  I guess the luxury brands are in reach for my price range and while I know they won't be the best deal at least they should be a pretty safe purchase.","1396311158"

"scooters","t5_2qnhc","Have you sold it yet?  Only getting scam artists to respond to your ads?  I'm explaining why.  You want to sell it quick.  I'm telling you that you won't sell it quick unless you set the price low enough to match market expectations for a used, Chinese scooter, without warranty, no local dealer or service, and without proper title and registration.  Do you think legitimate buyers are stupid?  Go ahead and think that and you'll still have a scooter on your hands when you move.  So if you start at the price of a new one, then start deducting for all of the above, you end up with the price range I said.  You can argue all you want about it.  You can bitch and complain about it.  I'm not your buyer.  You need to convince them.

It would actually be easier to sell a used 50cc Tao Tao and you'd get more money for it.  That's because it's legal to ride it without registration or title.  A 150cc can be immediately impounded for more than it's worth if caught on a public road without plates, tags, and registration.

Good luck waiting for a stupid buyer with cash, who's willing to buy it at your price without title and current registration.  Not likely gonna happen.   Fix the title and your value and buyers improve a lot.  

Right now you're limiting yourself to buyers who can only legally tow it away and not ride it on public roads.  Most people don't want that hassle or take the risk of impounding, not being able to get it out of impound because they can't prove ownership, having it sold at a lien sale, losing the scooter and what they paid for it.  They could even have their credit ruined when the impound lot goes after them for the towing and impound fees that are in excess of the auction proceeds.   Just because you were willing to take that risk doesn't mean that anyone else will do the same.","1396311161"

Very limited footballer as well, personally.

Edit: Surprised to see I'm being downvoted. He's frequently in trouble for comments on Twitter/throwing iced drinks at kids heads at theme parks/the usual I guess... As a Wolves player he was frequently returning home to see his kids north of the border. He didn't want to be here and you could tell. He was our top scorer but his only rivals were two young kids, Kevin Doyle who hardly ever scored for us, and Sigurdarson who was so great he's been sent on loan to Norway. For all the goals he scored for us, he wasted a stupid amount of chances. The fact that Nouah Dicko has come in and started banging the goals in demonstrates just how many chances we create as a club and how poor Griffiths's conversion rate was. 

Towards the end of his time here he was regularly being found out by defences. He's not particularly quick, but nor is he physical enough to bully defenders. He's also incredibly one-footed and his finishing is quite scrappy, often dragging shots into the bottom corner through a malaise of defenders. Against better teams he's simply found out.

He'll never be a top player. ","1396311164"

Then we had the flat cap invasion which basically killed the cadet hat and gave way to a bunch of Aussies wearing American baseball/basketball/football teams they had absolutely no idea about - however the real self absorbed ones would pretend to follow said club and seem like they deserve to wear that hat and post bulletins on MySpace saying ""bruins 2-0, bought a mindsnare wax 7inch il never be able to listen to, today is a good day"" I could go on.

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","&gt; Not only does this just so happen to flatter my individual preference (competitive and hardcore), but it also, in my opinion, cements in place the literal 'game' system that encourages players to continue progressing and advancing their characters. Visual rewards and bling are the result of reaching a certain height on the suspiciously Nietzschean mountain.

I like this point, because it brings up a fundamental, possibly inescapable problem with MMO item design: at what point in the game should the visual metamorphosis from peasant to lordship occur?  I do agree that the player should go through a fully realized sense of progression, visual elements included.  But where the sensible player arc might look like a linear rise, or perhaps a logarithmic curve, the reality is much less congruous.  

Visual item progression in MMOs, if we imagine it on a cartesian graph, tends to look more like long stretches on a plateau interrupted by minor upwards spikes where players briefly gain a collection of items which jive in some small way.  Nor does this toothy range resolve itself in the endgame where players are supposed to look the best.  Any player wearing one or two incomplete sets will admit they look like a pile of tailored ass, even when those sets are the best to be had.  Outside of wearing full and complete sets, the MMO pattern of item acquisition produces absolutely terrible aesthetics at nearly all levels of play.  

This presents a quandary.  If players, using customization, feel they looked just as good at level 20 as they do at the max level, then the sense of progression is lost and the visceral propulsion to achieve is erased.  Then again if players, without customization, feel they look like just as much rubbish at level max (plus endgame grinding, not just the fresh players) as they did at level 20, then they've worked hard for nothing, and the sense of progression is lost.  The losses tend to balance out between the two solutions, and it's not like we can implement half a customization system, only when the time is right.  Well... maybe you could.  But that's a discussion for another time.  

Either way: at some point in their journey the player should feel better rewarded for their efforts.  We both agree on this principle, and we both agree that aesthetics are one of the plausible rewards.  The question is, as earlier noted: when?","1396311166"

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","I've played every Super Mario game and Lost Levels is the most difficult by far. There will never be a Super Mario game that comes close to being as difficult because of the difference in structure and controls between old and new Mario games.

I love the NSMB series, but the structure makes those games so much easier to beat than SMB and Lost Levels. In the original SMB, you have to beat the whole game on one set of levels. In Lost Levels, you fortunately get to restart on the current world you are on. But in modern games, you get to restart at the level you were on.

I still love playing The Lost Levels, but let's face it most of the difficulty comes from the fact that the controls suck compared to modern platformers. The level designs themselves really aren't so bad in the original SMB. (They are pretty rough in The Lost Levels though, but still not really much worse than the tougher levels in modern Mario games.)

If you fall off a cliff in NSMB games you can wall jump, fly/guide/spin with whatever suit you might be wearing, hell now you can just bubble in multiplayer.

In NSMB games you can just go back to older levels and hoard powerups and lives and then come back to the level you're stuck on.

I don't know about every series, but for Super Mario, The Lost Levels will always be the toughest by far. (Even the original SMB game isn't nearly as hard; I can beat that game on a single life whereas The Lost Levels is still brutal for me even though I've already beaten it.) That's not necessarily a bad thing though. Nintendo is free to make a NSMB game with the toughest level designs of any Mario game ever. But unless they go back to old controls/structure (which they shouldn't do and won't do) it still won't be as tough to beat.

For modern Nintendo games, I insist that Pikmin 3 has got to be one of the hardest games to 100% that Nintendo has ever made, modern or classic. Whether or not Mission Mode is actually fun is entirely a matter of opinion, but those you have gotten Platinum medals on those mission know how insanely hard it is.

I'll just say it: Pikmin 3 Mission Mode is the toughest challenge I've ever faced in a video game that I can think of at the moment.","1396311167"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Ok, I hate to be the bearer of bad news here, but it's actually not a bits versus bytes issue.

In computing, all data transfer speeds and data rates are measured in bits per second, never bytes per second.  If you're using a service like [www.speedtest.net](http://www.speedtest.net), the values you are seeing are bits, not bytes.  It is VERY rare to see something measured in bytes when looking at data rates or transfer rates, and it's certainly not the issue with the ISP.

The reality is, all ISPs ""lie"", or rather, don't tell the truth.  Speed costs money, and the service going to your house is *technically* capable of reaching that speed under ideal conditions.  But how they measure that speed is unclear, because when you use broadband internet, like cable, you do not have a dedicated connection between you and your ISP.  You SHARE with everyone else on your node.  You have a connection between you and your node, that can reach up to the maximum of 15mbps (in this case), but if the node is overloaded, it will automatically cut the number of connections it will let you make at a time.  Oh, and you share the upstream bandwidth with everyone else connected to your same node - i.e. the node's connection with the rest of the internet.  And then those nodes are often routed through a single geographic center, that also has a limited connection with the rest of the internet.  It's a big connection, but priority on that connection is given to business customers.

So yes, you can ""get"" that, if no one else happens to be using the same frequencies you are at the time.  But that rarely happens, and the more users logged into the same node.

ISPs cannot afford to have bandwidth idle.  Idle available bandwidth essentially costs them money every fraction of a second it's not used, so they try to minimize their bandwidth to still be full at off-peak times, rather than peak times.  It's evil and unethical, IMHO, to publish such direct lies, but no one stops them because a) every ISP does it, and b) most ISPs are a monopoly in their area.","1396311168"

However, this phenomenon is not what's at work during a ""crash,"" when the entire stock market (generally the S&amp;P or a similar index) sees enormous losses across the board for several months, or even years.  Market crashes happen because of two factors; either there is some kind of natural disaster which leads to widespread economic decline, such as the dust bowl in the United States prior to the market crash of 1929, or there is some kind of government intervention which causes a massive bubble to ""burst"", as was the case with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae subsidizing sub-prime mortgages, leading to the housing crises and ensuing market downturn of the late 2000's.

I heard that 0th level spells are cantrip spells. Meaning I can use them as many times as I wish because they are weak. But I also read that bard do not prepare their spells and they can pick any spell from their knowledge base. Does this mean I pick 6 0th level spells from the list and that's that?

 [**Hitchens' razor**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchens%27%20razor): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Hitchens' razor__ is a principle in [epistemology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology) ([philosophical razor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_(philosophy\))). It states that the [burden of proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_burden_of_proof) (onus) in a debate lies with the claim-maker and if he or she does not meet it then the opponent does not need to argue against the unfounded claim. It is named for journalist and writer [Christopher Hitchens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Hitchens) (1949–2011), who formulated it thus:  

&gt;Hitchens's razor is actually a translation of the Latin proverb ""[Quod gratis asseritur, gratis negatur](http://en.wikipedia.org//en.wikiquote.org/wiki/en:Latin_proverbs#Q)"",  which has been widely used at least since the early 19th century,  but Hitchens's English rendering of the phrase has made it more widely known in the 21st century. It is used, for example, to counter [presuppositional apologetics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presuppositional_apologetics). This quotation appears by itself in ""God Is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything"" a book by Hitchens in 2007. 

&gt;[Richard Dawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins), a fellow [atheist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism) activist of Hitchens, formulated a different version of the same law that has the same implication, at [TED](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TED_(conference\)) in February 2002: 

&gt;Dawkins used his version to argue against [agnosticism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism), which he described as ""poor"" in comparison to [atheism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism),  because it refuses to judge on claims that are, even though not wholly [falsifiable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability), very unlikely to be true.

I have it on PC and play it on a regular basis. Game is hella fun and worth every penny. I enjoy the fact that the gun system is simple, I like the fact that in order to Regen (Prestige) you have to complete new challenges.

My one and only complaint is the same as it was with every other game - lag compensation. Not necessarily a problem with the game itself, but the shitty xbox live servers they are hosted on. 

Here is a video I uploaded to youtube about the last game I played on PC, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, for as much hate as that game got, it was fucking awesome. People were just bad at it. Both games are mechanically sound, great detail and level design. I'm using this CoD clip as an example because TitanFall doesn't have a theatre mode to review your recent matches, but this happens wayyyyyy to fucking often.

[Lag Comp in Regular Speed then Slow Mo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuF-nup_h74)

I live in Western Canada, the best option I have for TF servers is the ""Data Center: North Central US [50ms]"" or at least thats what it says in game, yet EVERY single match I play is 90+ ping. And I have a 50down/5up connection.

I also wish like in Call of Duty that they would include some sort of active tracker for connected players so you could see how many people are online. It sucks not knowing how many players are in each game mode.

That's just me being needy though. Besides the lag compensation, the game is superb. Runs smoothly, plays smoothly, and if you're half decent at video games you can even have fun on the [Losing Team](http://i.imgur.com/50IXbpy.jpg)

I really don't get the consensus that (most of us) are defending all those isms. We're just defending this idea that say, recognising sexism against women exists and is a serious problem somehow means that hating men is OK. For me personally it's this kind of tit-for-tat childish mentality that is the real problem, the reactionary idea of one form of hate being okay because it's a reaction of another form of hate you believe to be more prevalent and serious. That's not how anything is going to get better - the cycle needs to be broken.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","I would have to agree. A rating of 1800 allows you to pay your way into the top section of some less prestigious open tournaments, such as the [Neckar Open](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neckar-Open), where you will be whipped bloody and stomped on by the vast majority of the field. Basically, you're deemed barely good enough not to embarass the tournament organizers in front of the titled (2300+, they often get to play for free) players. Around 200 players populate the Neckar A-Open, for instance, and 180-200 is where you would be likely to find 1800s, except for those players with breakout performances, who will rise in rating dramatically as a result (and cease to be 1800s).

Of course, you'd be leagues above newcomers or players who are stuck at lower ratings. Depending on the environment you play in - chess club and such - you might be the lone one-eyed man among the blind, and if you're self-conceited enough, you might mistake your ability to mop the floor with the rest of your club as additional evidence of your towering genius.

If your goal is to pick something impressive to paint yourself as an intellectual titan by virtue of your chess skill, you should go at least for 2000 or higher, the level where chess players start to become referred to as ""masters"" by national federations. (For recognition by the world organization FIDE as a ""FIDE Master"" - two rungs below Grandmaster - you need 2300+.)

**There are no new discoveries of Dr. Warren's papers that include an account book showing a visit from an M. Gage, nor is there a letter from an M. Gage to Dr. Warren. In fact there's no evidence that the two of them ever met. Everything else is correct though and is discussed thoroughly in the three books I used as sources, all of which I highly recommend.**

**J.L. Bell did not have an article in January's issue of *The Journal of American History*, but he is a real historian who focuses on Revolutionary War era American history, particularly in the Boston region. He has a blog called [Boston 1775](http://boston1775.blogspot.com/) that I can't recommend too highly.** 

**Dr. Joseph Warren really was an incredibly important person in the lead up to the Revolutionary War and his life is well worth reading about.**

The following is based on new information that has just barely come to light. So it's not so much the ""Secret History of"" as it is the ""Unknown History of""

One of the more vexing debates in Revolutionary War history (other than who fired first at Lexington) is ""How in the world did [Dr. Joseph Warren](http://i.imgur.com/wcwk6fZ.jpg) know to send dispatch riders to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams?"" Joseph Warren never revealed the name of the person who gave him the information that sent the alarm through the countryside on the night of April 18th, 1775. 

One of the main theories has been the idea of Paul Revere's ""mechanics"" somehow getting the information. Paul Revere and about 30 fellow artisans (called mechanics in colonial times) formed an association to keep an eye on British troop movements. They worked in pairs and reported back to Paul Revere who then passed the information back along to the either the Massachusetts Provincial Congress or to the Boston Committee of Safety. Most likely it went to Joseph Warren who was a prominent member of both groups. 

The problem with this theory is pinning down the exact date of the movements. It was pretty much an open secret in Boston that something was going on soon. After all Gage had done many marches out into the countryside as a way of familiarizing himself and his men with the terrain. He'd sent a scouting party to the main Patriot arms depot at Worcester (a scouting party which nearly discovered and captured) and they reported that it was far too dangerous to attempt to capture the munitions there. There had also been other incidents involving gunpowder seizures and attempted seizures (the most notable of which was the Powder Alarm).

The real question is how did they know the exact date of the march? This is where Joseph Warren comes in. In 1775 Joseph Warren was perhaps the most popular man in Patriot circles in America. He was a rising star, and was a star pupil of Samuel Adams. He was the last member of the Boston Committee of Safety still in town in April when he sent Revere on his way (the others had already left Boston for fear of being arrested), and would join the fighting at Lexington &amp; Concord (where a musket ball would pass close enough to him to knock his wig sideways) and then join the fighting at Bunker Hill as a private citizen (even though he had a commission in the Massachusetts militia as a Major General and could have easily taken command there). He would be killed in the last moments of the fighting, have a [famous painting](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/The_death_of_general_warren_at_the_battle_of_bunker_hill.jpg/640px-The_death_of_general_warren_at_the_battle_of_bunker_hill.jpg) done of his death, and would receive an eulogy from William Howe who after the battle said ""this victim is worth five hundred of their men"". Loyalist Peter Oliver in 1782 said of Warren that had he lived, Washington would have been ""an obscurity"" (though to be fair that's as much a dig at Washington as it was praise for Warren).

As a doctor he was familiar with all classes of people. Nathaniel Philbrick has commented that Warren treated everybody from prostitutes to the gentry and was equally comfortable with them all, so he certainly had the contacts. 

He also was a bit of a womanizer. At the time of his death he was engaged to a woman named [Mercy Scollay](http://allthingsliberty.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Lady-in-a-Blue-Dress-possibly-Scollay_Copley.jpg) who may have been physically handicapped in some way. He was also having an affair with a woman named Sally Edwards, and in fact she was probably pregnant with his child when Warren was killed at Bunker Hill.

So where does lead us? Well, we know that Warren was a doctor who knew everybody and treated everybody and was well respected and liked but most everybody. We know that he was charismatic and good looking and popular. We also know that he wasn't above carrying on affairs even while he was engaged. 

This takes us to Margaret Gage, wife of General Gage, British commander in Boston. It's long been speculated (even at the time) that Margaret Gage might have been a traitor to her husband. She was born in America and people knew that she was unhappy with the political divide and the thought of a war against the country. After the war a Roxbury clergyman who was well-connected wrote that Warren's source was ""a daughter of liberty unequally yoked in the point of politics"", which certainly sounds like a woman who might have Patriot sympathies but have a soldier for a husband.

None of this is new information though. What's new is that recently new documents have been discovered in Boston which appear to be some of the missing volumes from Dr. Warren's medical practices (he kept thorough notes and numbered each volume. We had numbers 1-3, and 5-6--we know that there were at least 8) The missing volume that has been discovered appears to be volume 8. One of the patients listed is the name M. Gage, whom Warren saw several times in the spring and early summer of 1775. What's significant is that one of the dates listed is April 15, 1775, just three days before Revere was ordered out on his ride. There are also some papers in the collection, one of which appears to be a letter from an M.Gage to Warren.

After Lexington &amp; Concord Margaret Gage was sent back to Europe while General Gage remained in America for another year. Upon Gage's replacement in America he and Margaret continued to remain estranged from each other--which speaks to a level of betrayal that's deeper than just passing on some information. Based on Warren's past proclivities it's highly likely that he seduced Margaret Gage. Whether or not he seduced her and only later turned to her for information or seduced her with the intent of getting information is something that we'll likely never know.

Yes, that sounds great!

I'm pretty sure that the pharmaceutical companies, as well as Big Tobacco, will fully support the publishing of completely unbiased results! 

I'm also confident that state and local governments, as well as the Federal government and agencies like the FDA and CDC, will have no problems at all efficiently passing sensible laws and regulations that protect the rights of individuals while also maintaining a base level of safety and well-being for citizens! And definitely without any financial or political influence affecting those decisions!

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","Right; I'm aware that the signal propagates from the sides of the antennas.  What I'm saying, however, is that you should NOT align the antennas in different directions; each antenna is not intended to operate as a separate AP.  It's one AP with 3 antennas operating in coordination to provide better throughput; this is how MIMO works, and is the basis for Wireless N technology.

If you want coverage on multiple levels in a dwelling and aren't getting sufficient coverage from the single router, it's better to add additional APs, not change the 3 antennas on the single AP so that they're out of alignment.

You could change the antennas so that all three are aligned horizontally instead of vertically, and you'd get better up/down coverage.  But again, orienting them so that the three antennas are in completely different alignments will actually detract from the MIMO performance, and degrade overall speeds even if it improves coverage.

I concur that it's location in the rack is not ideal for interference reasons.","1396311173"

"tf2trade","t5_2s0s4","Your post has been automatically removed by this bot because your title is incorrect.

**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted

The full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers"" is inappropriate. However, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos"" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).
5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.
6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).

**Scammers.** If you are attempting to report a scammer on our game servers, please review [this post](http://redd.it/mbpbg) and follow the process within it. If the scammer originated from our subreddit instead, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Ftf2trade). If the scammer is not related to our community, please direct your report to [SteamRep](http://forums.steamrep.com/forums/report/). Unfortunately with the ubiquity of scammer accounts, [PSA] posts warning about specific scammers are not permitted here.

**If you have not already, PLEASE review the rules of /r/tf2trade by clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/wiki/rules).**

Important rules to remember are that prices are required for all items (Rule 10), and to limit your posting of trades ([H]/[W] or [Store]) to one trade per 12 hour period regardless of whether any other trade is closed or deleted (Rule 11).

My school friends were mostly preppy kids who played sports and got into activities such as drinking and smoking pot late in high school. My after school friends and I were effectively dubbed 'sketchy kids' because we got into the aforementioned activities earlier (seems to be the tendency of lower income households). Many of these friends did not go to college despite my decision to. I am still friends with selections of both, all great people in their own way. There is some deeper message here.

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","I'll second the recommendation for the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2.  It is very plug-and-play (on a Mac, at least - PC use may be different), has never had problems, and is built like a tank.  Mine's seen a bit of use/abuse, including frequent travel, and is still going strong.

I will give one caveat: I have experienced a problem with loud pops through my studio monitors (which are plugged into the outputs of the 2i2) when sleeping/restarting my computer.  I'm told by my local audio store that this is due to it being USB bus-powered, and that self-powered units (i.e. those that are plugged into a wall outlet) will not have this problem.  I haven't seen this popping actually be a *problem* per se, but it's definitely concerning to hear.  Installing Focusrite's drivers and class-compliant software appeared to resolve the problem for about a day, but either it was just coincidental or it ""broke"" again after that.  I still need to bug Focusrite about it to see what else can be done.

In all other ways, however, I've been very happy with the 2i2.","1396311179"

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","Not crazy at all! I think your analysis is spot on.

We talk about this in my podcast [Draft Zero](http://draft-zero.com/2014/dz-02/). 

Quick summary:

* Arguably, the film is a dual protagonist film. But I'm not sure that helps people understand how it works.
* Anna is a/the protagonist. Her choices drive the story forward.
* Elsa is the force of opposition to those choices / the protagonist. This is what makes be the antagonist (although see the note below).. She also undergoes a large character change.
* Hans is a Villain but he only becomes a Villain in the 3rd Act because they needed someone to take that role over from Elsa once she has been captured. If they didn't have Hans there would be a decrease in stakes in the third act.
* Anna's resurrection is classic Campbell/Vogler resurrection storytelling. See it as four acts if you want, but I don't think that's helpful.

More technically: Antagonist and Protoganist are, in the classical definition, functions performed by characters rather than being types. That is why you can have a film like Se7en where Somerset is the protagonist but Mills is the main character. And why you can also have sequence protagonists or scene protagonists. Look at both A New Hope and Gravity, the mentor characters in both films are the protagonists until they die.

And like you said, p450 plays a major role in drug metabolism. We were just talking about this today in a chemistry class. A classmate had his genetic profile analyzed through 23andMe. He showed me and our professor his profile. It was interesting to see that even his drug metabolism was assessed. It would be beneficial to actually know which drugs are better metabolized for patients when prescribing.

"Wake","t5_2r8ty","Let me start off by saying that i work at a cable park and have tried many boots boards and i also ride around 2-3 times a week there. I think this question was meant for me, this is because i rode the process boots and system pros for 6 months and a month ago switched over to watsons. 

1. I feel the major difference being the stiffness of the binding, systems have the ""exoskeleton"" making them quite stiff and supportive. The watsons on the other hand still have all the support i need but i felt like i could tweak a grab a little more or press a little harder in the ""looser"" watsons.

2. Yes, closed toe bindings do fit a little tight in the beginning and will loosen up as you break them in. Now saying this dont expect them to loosen up a whole shoe size, most probably around a half size.

3. The taller boots provide a little more ankle support whereas the smaller boot offers still plenty of support and a little more mobility to tweak tricks out.

4. Like i said before i rode both these bindings extensively, i personally was inlove with system bindings when i got my new pair and would swear by them, then i went on to try a pair of watsons and completely fell in love with them, they ride closer to the board than the systems (the system boots have a very thick sole) so i feel like i have more control over every aspect of my board. 
let me finish off by saying that you will not be disappointed by either of these bindings and you will love them both. This was just my own personal experience with them.

That doesn't list any Class-5s for the Cutlass.  

For the size of the Freelancer's Class-2s, I think that there are two metrics.  
Class is the performance, so it's like:  
Class 1 - Fixed.  
Class 2 - Gimballed.  
Class 3 - Missiles.  
Class 4 - Like a Class 1, but on a turret.  
Class 5 - Like a big capital ship turret  (not huge, but bigger than a 4).

Then I recall seeing mention of there being a size. So the hardpoint has a class, and a size which is how big the weapon within the behavior.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Jamie was being led to the laser Guillotine. How had things gone so wrong, less than three years before marked the rise of this government. One that Jamie had fought and bled to establish.

The revolution had been a time of excitement and change. Earth had rules the system for too long. The planet from which humanity emerged had claimed the entire system, and passed laws that ensured all wealth had flowed back to the home planet. But it had been centuries since the population of mars outgrew that of earth, and the asteroid belt was home to billions more.

When once again the parliament had convened, the scattered colonies voted for independence. But the parliament had always reserved a majority of seats for earth representatives. When the colonies were over ruled they decided to fight.

Jamie was seventeen yeas old at the time, a young man working on a communal martian farm. When the call went out for men to fight for Mars Jamie answered. 

For two years the war raged on, slowly at first. None of the thousandths of transport ships and shuttles were designed for combat, so battles were often groups of soldiers dropped onto planets or asteroids and fighting until one side could set up a laser capable of cutting other ships from the sky. It was in one of these battles that a plasma bolt had melted a patch of skin off of Jamie's arm.

But within a few months ships were being modified to carry weapons, and before the second year ships were being produced that were designed for space combat. At that point combat became a game of cat and mouse, trying to detect the opposing ship before it could detect you. It only took a few seconds for the lasers to lock on and destroy their targets.

That was when earth's wealth started to pull the planet ahead in the conflict. Better money could buy better sensors, which could detect targets more quickly allowing for quicker laser locks and fewer losses for the earthlings. But the colonies would not bow before earthan rule, and they used the tools they had in abundance.

Jamie had been on the Galileo. A large mining ship bristling with magnets and tractor beams. The colonies could no longer fight the war, so they had decided to end it. The Galileo and four other ships had deployed to the asteroid belt, they began finding and redirecting large asteroids.

Within a month several dozen country size rocks were hurtling towards earth. And earth had never gotten around to paying for a meteor defense system. The stones plummeted into the planet's gravity well, one launched by the Galileo striking first. The scientists said that none of the subsequent strikes even mattered.

It is funny. If you believe what the old book says, the first life ended on earth was ended with a rock. Looks like that rock came full circle and ended the last life on earth as well.

The war ended, the different colonies carried on. Mars had established a republic, and was quickly becoming the center of human culture. Some folks were even talking about terraforming earth to be habitable again. Jamie had returned to Mars, the planet of his birth and sought out to answer a nagging question that had haunted him all his life.

Jamie traveled the colonies, isolated Europa, the lawless asteroid belt, finally finding an answer in a small clinic on Ceres. When Jamie returned home the reception was that of a monster, an abomination. Which had ended here.

Jamie had been aboard the ship that destroyed the culture that would have responded with acceptance. All these thoughts passed through Jamie's mind as she listened to the executioner read off the sentence, ""...and for crimes against nature, you are hereby sentenced to die. May the gods have mercy on your soul.""

Well, at least the laser was quick and painless... she hoped.","1396311184"

Over the course of a short conversation, it is revealed that the child's actual father, who is part of a big elf mob family, has had the child's mother killed, so now the grandfather and the kid are in hiding outside the city. The following, unintentionally funny exchange takes place shortly thereafter.

Japan wants commercial whaling. I'm not disagreeing there at all.

What I'm saying is that this sort of ""research"" is the closest thing they have to making a case to the IWC that whaling can be accomplished without meaningfully impacting populations. Any paper-based simulation will be dismissed out of hand.

The anti-whaling contingent of the IWC, to me, is the one acting in bad faith. The nature of the organization prevents them from banning whaling ""on principle"" but doesn't prevent them from erecting a series of de facto barriers to prevent whaling.

The only thing that would allow commercial whaling is a demonstration of its viability, and the anti-whaling faction is working hard to prevent that -- even if the Japanese side has done a poor job.","1396311185"

Like I said, I could see them losing to the Spurs, but even if that series is a coin flip or slight edge to SA, getting in at +270 seems like good value.  For OKC I just have a bad feeling about Westbrook's knee, and I still don't know that Ibaka can give them enough scoring in the post.

""cinematic"" is a very loosely used term by both pros and amateurs. it could be that people are put off by the m43 sensor, to which I say S16 is more ""cinematic"" than a 5D so capture size isn't everything. If people are referring to an overly sharp image, thats the same thing people said when the C300 launched.

with the use of good technique, lighting, and filters if needed, any camera can look ""cinematic"".

I will say that a raw workflow is not something for beginners,and the ML hacks don't make it any easier.

"breastfeeding","t5_2rdj4","I have advice.

Get a pump.

It isn't the same as directly breastfeeding, and it will still hurt a little bit at first, but it's what I have to do. I never could directly breastfeed my babes, it was EXCRUCIATINGLY painful (and I went through both labors with back-to-back contractions without any medication/epidural!) and I simply could not do it. However, I got a pump, and despite my nipples being cracked, I turned the suction down low and pumped as much as I could bear until my nips healed and it became easier.

Do not be afraid to give some formula as well if you just can't stand it. I know people everywhere will freak out on you over it, whatever, shutup. It's more important for you to be happy and healthy and sane than it is for your baby to only ever have breastmilk ever.

My hubby was only fed formula as his mother could not produce milk. He's a very clever man and other than the fact that he's a dirty yucky smoker (=p) he's perfectly fine.

Take it easy on both you and your baby and get a breastpump. A GOOD ONE! it will pay for itself within three months. I use a medela double-pump.","1396311188"

Steer with your ass. think of it as swinging your hips to tilt the bike a little resulting in steering. swing them back to unsteer/straighten out.

For bumps, rise off your saddle a few inches and grip your saddle with your thighs to keep the bike vertical and balanced with your feet. this allows the bump to be absorbed by your legs and not disturb your center of mass. ","1396311189"

"news","t5_2qh3l","The Qur'an uses the term Muslim in a two-dimensional manner. Muslim in it's most literal and basic translation means ""Peaceful (sometimes translated to ""willing"") Submission to God"". Muslims believe that Jesus was a Prophet of God, hence, one who willfully submits to God, which makes him Muslim by that definition. All Prophets mentioned in the Qur'an are Muslim (Moses, Jesus, Adam, etc.).

The second interpretation of Muslim is one who has submitted to the message of Muhammad, who claimed that he did not bring anything new, but an old message, the same message revealed to the Prophets before him, and those who follow this message are Muslims.

"cinematography","t5_2ri38","You'll understand it when you go out and watch a movie. It's all fake dude. Even the most natural looking light in movies is almost always fake. Cinematographers get paid to make it look that way: beautiful and  naturalistic. The hard part is that available light VERY RARELY ever looks good in interiors. You'll also understand better if you go and work on someone else's set (preferably on at least a festival film) as maybe a grip or a camera assistant. I know the very idea probably makes you shutter, considering all the money you must have blown on equipment, but trust me. You'll understand, big time.

Also, you seem to be missing the point of cinematography. It's about telling stories with light and a frame. You've almost got the frame part down, but you've got to master the light. Light is half of cinematography, if not more. Any working DP here, please back me up! Light is such a powerful storytelling tool. You're a fool to write it off as frivolous, really you are. I was once too. Then I went to film school and met some amazing DP's and Gaffers that were my age, and I very quickly learned to appreciate light for what it can do for a film. (you don't have to go to school, but it will force you to make films, and it will force you to work with people with 10X more talent than you) Without light, you don't have an image, and you aren't communicating much emotion through the lens. Am I getting through to you?

On the f1.4 comment, you should try and avoid shooting wide open whenever possible. Most lenses are most sharp around f4-f8. This ties into my comment ""light for the exposure you want"". If you want to be at an f2.8 in terms of dof, and you've only got enough for 1.4, then you need to throw another two stops of light in instead of just accepting it as-is.  If a shallow DOF is what you crave, then you can use longer lenses, or a larger image format.

You can create the ""natural feel"" about 100X better when you learn how to use artificial light to your advantage. Will you at least look into it? At least grip or AC on 1 set other than your own? Work with a talented DP that will show you why it pays to utilize light? If you won't do that, then I'm not wasting any more time talking to you, and I urge everyone else to do the same.","1396311195"

For example, naturopaths commonly offer homeopathic remedies, which are completely useless, unless you've gotten a light thirst or need a bit of sugar. Yet they also offer some psychoactive ingredients, which do have an effect (but these scan usually be got from drugs in a safer, synthesised form).

If you think something may be suspicious, google it and look at the Wikipedia or rational wiki page, which can usually be trusted.

TL;DR: For the most the treatments offered are unscientific, and you'd be much better off spending your money seeing a real doctor.","1396311200"

Later— about a year ago now, I think— Eligius had a bunch of problems with DOS attacks and other pools started paying transaction fees to miners, so they left the MTGox provided hosting. This allowed Eligius to start paying transaction fees to miners.

IIRC the domain has always had Luke as a point of contact but the domain was registrar through the hosting companies registrar. I _think_ even that has now been fixed as various Bitcoin community things moved away from MTGox support.

I'm shocked by the remarkable apparent dishonesty of the headline. It's normal for third parties to be the registering party for domains.","1396311202"
"programming","t5_2fwo","Depends on the license, actually. $300 is a fair price, easily, but with what license? I'd *easily* pay $300 as a bounty for someone to build this and put it on Github, but that's clearly not what's going on here.

And I'd happily put in some extra time -- even if I'm working at $100k, $100k / 52 / 40 = $48.08. Multiply by 16 (2 days of work) = $770, so I'm paying $470 extra to not have to think about [questions like this](http://creditcardjs.com/licensing):

&gt; How many websites does each license cover?

&gt; Each license supports one website. Nominal URL variations don't require additional licenses. For questions regarding your use case or for bulk/OEM licensing, please contact sales@creditcardjs.com.

A ""website"" isn't a clear, distinct thing. Let's say I'm building a meta-store, a way for a bunch of other people to sell something -- I don't know, let's say Minecraft levels. If I own minecraftlevels.com, do I have to pay a separate license for minecraftlevels.com/TheLordB if you open a store? What if I let you host this on your own domain, and remove all branding tying you back to minecraftlevels.com -- do *you* now need to pay a license? Or maybe I can arrange for some sort of bulk license, but I bet it costs more than $770... but I still need to spend time figuring that out.

And that $770 is kind of an upper bound -- it shouldn't take a whole weekend. Meanwhile, this $300 is a *lower* bound. You also have to spend time having this discussion with your boss. If you both meet for an hour, and you both make $100k, that's another $96.16. And then there's the time purchasing it, and any time talking to their support people, and so on. And then getting someone from legal to look over the actual license and make sure there's nothing shady.

I'm not saying I'd *never* pay for a proprietary library like this, but it'd have to be something that takes a lot more time and effort to get right. If jQuery cost money, I might pay for that. I don't think I'd ever pay for this.","1396311202"

Everyone has different methods for taking notes and whatnot and if you like to draw a lot a tablet might work best for you. In my experience though, I bought an iPad for college but ended up not using it as much as I thought and selling it. I had a macbook air and I loved it - not because it was a mac, just because it was a super lightweight, fast machine with great battery life. I'm a pretty fast typer so handwriting anything is frustratingly slow.

If you can find a 2012 11"" macbook air I think that would be a great machine for web dev and note taking, and maybe down the road get a cheap external monitor (or plug into one in the labs) when you need a bit more real estate.



That's what I would do in your situation but again, a tablet might work better for you personally.  For me, a tablet just doesn't offer enough advantages to forgo a full size keyboard and access to all my development tools.

But the other thing is though, if Kurt slowed, even a little, then sped up after the crash (just back up to pit road speed), it wouldn't have been speeding because of how they time it by averages between the timing lines.","1396311203"

"BB30","t5_2zasz","Because of my natural phone anxiety, I would not have been able to call everyone who I felt should be told. So I didn't give a rats ass who got told before I posted it on facebook. I wanted it done and over with. I was going to tell my mother in person, she knows how I can't handle phone calls, but my brothers who are not on my facebook still clicked through 'friends of friends' like and told her two days before I was going to drop my other kids off with her and let her know. The phone call was horrible. Not just because of the anxiety. But my mother basically chewing me out on the phone for not telling her. It's her fourth grand child and when I meekly told her I was going to tell her when I dropped off the boys because I figured she'd like to be told in person instead of on the phone, she relented. 

Basically, there are pros and cons to both methods. Like, forgetting to tell someone individually and or having others spilling beans in the wrong manner when telling people on facebook.

Seems the best route, if not suffering phone anxiety issues like me, would be tell everyone who you want to first via phone or in person then when you're sure you got everyone, you can do a catch all with posting on social media to try to scoop everyone else into the know.","1396311204"

Let's say you give someone medicine that cures the diseases they have. Then they go on to have children. Those children will not be immune to those diseases because the parent took medicine. The kids will have to take that same medicine. This keeps us at a standstill because those of us who aren't immune will still live on and breed. In natural selection, only those of us who *are* immune would live.

&gt;Yes, bacteria are growing resistant to current antiobitics, but that's only a problem if we don't invent new ones, which is just as possible

There is only so much that we can do to create more antibiotics. Not only is there limited resources, it could take a long time to create a new form of antibiotic. 
&gt;Mass population could very well be wiped out right now if it wasn't for medicine.

The only reason we could be wiped out easily is because of how dependent we are on medicine.

&gt; Humans are by default not very strong in the ""natural selection"" department

I'm perplexed why you aren't getting overtime though? I had a discussion with a friend who told me that even though I am getting penalty rates, I am not obliged to receive it as my base rate is above the award rate so what I am being paid still works out to be more than the award rate + penalty loading. He also said that is how the FWC interpreted our enterprise agreement (it's for the pharmacy industry sector).

Look I reckon it's great we have such a strong industrial relations in this country but at the same time we need to discourage and provide disincentives for sectors to move jobs overseas. Having a stagnated wage over being unemployed is certainly the lesser of two evils.

The BICEP2 results can be said to support eternal inflation. Eternal inflation is any theory of inflation which demands inflation is an everlasting process. Most of the popular theories of inflation happen to be of the eternal sort, in which the inflation in our universe will give birth to new bubble universes. This leads to one interpretation of a multiverse.

Since inflation is a component of eternal inflation (in which there is a multiverse), and the BICEP2 results support inflation, proponents of eternal inflation claim that the results support the existence of the multiverse.

Edit: Keep in mind that a large portion of physicists are skeptical of these multiverse theories, claiming they are untestable. ","1396311217"

High fire rate is required if you use the SC to protect your team from lots of spam. Most spam occurs on the front lines and if the engie is on the front lines he is more than likely not near his dispenser.

Before, the weapon didn't perform like it needed to, basically when push came to shove, it couldn't hold ground (regardless of the skill of the user) now its a bit of a mess, its got a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling but at the cost just being a mess of a weapon.  As is, the weapons design is counter intuitive, if I use this the way it's supposed to be used I loose more metal?

Sailing down a small river on a small boat Tom sawyer style with earth walls about 6 ft high raised on both sides of the river with Jesus tied to the mast of the boat. He was getting pelted with rocks by all the animals of the kingdom and was bloodied and beaten. When we got to the end of the river it became a circle and the animals were on the walls off all sides with Mufasa or Aslan, some fucking lion king, front and center. He said I had to go on a mission to save Jesus.

Then I was in a restaurant eating with my family. All of a sudden tons of fucking monkeys, apes, gorillas, etc came out of nowhere and started fucking shit up. My family and I got in a stolen van, picked up conveniently placed guns, and drove to the movie theatre while shooting monkeys the entire way. When I got there we thought we were safe because it had large plexiglass doors and the monkeys just piled up outside, but then we turned around and there was a 100ft glass wall with the ENTIRE world of dinosaurs behind it. I remember going up to the glass and it shattered letting out all the dinosaurs, and we ran watching the dinosaurs devour everything, all the people, and the monkeys, and finally one caught up.

Then I woke up and wrote everything down. It was the most vivid dream of my life and to this day it is the only dream I can almost completely remember in its entirety.

"galatasaray","t5_2re7h","See, the thing is, you can't deny the influence soccer has over people's lives, nor how far it reaches. Soccer is just a sport, yes, but can you deny the effects of the anti racism ads? Or the stadium wide protests (like the ones we as Turkish fans have unfortunately gotten used to since we constantly have young soldiers dieing to which our response is usually booing and whistling)? 

I agree that this sub should not be saying ""Vote CHP!"". Everyone is entitled to their own political opinions. But when someone posts something that tries to remind people of the filthy and corrupt nature of a certain party, I see no problem in promoting that discussion. You say we need to learn how to protest. The people have been protesting for months now. No effect. Why? Because these protests achieve nothing. You go out on the streets and yell, so what? What does Erdogan care about that? Do you know what he does care about? If an industry worth hundreds of millions, if not a couple billion, joins together in protest against him. These protests mean nothing unless they're backed by major powers, and since most private companies are thriving off of Erdogan's corruption, why not turn to the one thing that was supposed to be ""for the fans"" A.K.A. the people? 

So, if you wish to unsubscribe, then good luck. But please, if you are the avid fan of freedom of speech that you say you are (and I'm not saying you're not, so don't take this as an insult), go out and tell all people you can, be it your classmates, your fellow employees, your local strip club, or the group of friends you watch your galatasaray games with.

I've had the non-sticky side remain in pad yoyo's even after cleaning the groove with mineral spirits(well both sides, but the non-sticky side is facing out).

The big day comes, and I arrive home from class at Noon to discover a Comcast ""Sorry We Missed You"" note that was time-stamped 10:30 am. I call the number on the note to reschedule the appointment and am told that it will be another several weeks before my appointment can be made. As I'm discussing the unacceptability of this situation, a Comcast van drives right past my house and pulls into the parking lot of a bar not more than a block away and parks right next to two other Comcast vans.

Ah, here is the interesting bit. Chaos is not the absolute lack of order that it is commonly assumed to be synonymous with. Chaos can and does arise from perfectly deterministic interactions and is defined by the impossibility of predicting long term behavior of a system without actually simulating it.

A good examples of this is the [two-pendulum system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum).

Besides, a good master distiller would use the right barrels to theoretically create something that is better than the sum of its parts, and can make due without the absolute best barrels in his small batch. 

So long story short, a small batch may be better if the single didn't exist, though it's probably debatable... And regardless, not worth the cost of losing our previous single barrels!","1396311234"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; How so? I value logic very much, it's how my reasoning works.

Yes, but in your previous discussion you intimated that empirical validation (or verificationism) was the way we know things.

&gt; Is there anything other than the natural world? What supports any claim that there exists anything other than the natural world? I'm not saying only the natural world exists, but everything we experience is part of the natural world, everything we can test, everything we can currently know about, stuff outside of the natural is not accessible to us (if it was then that would automatically make it part of the natural world we can test).

There are numbers. How do we scientifically examine numbers. How do you experiment the #7?

&gt;  If God has the power to alter physics how can we test it, make calculations for it, and generally make scientific inquiry if a being could change how physics works on a whim? 

We could not. 

&gt; If God has the power to alter physics how can we test it, make calculations for it, and generally make scientific inquiry if a being could change how physics works on a whim? ..... are outside our ability to test them... What exactly is supernature? What are its qualities? How can anybody know about it?

This is exactly what I am talking about. Your epistemic choice to only accept things that can be tested. You won't accept logic or rational thought as knowledge about the supernatural, you will only accept that which can be tested empirically. If you begin with the presupposition that the only thing that exists is that which is natural and the only way to know what exists is to use methods described specifically to test the natural world, then what do you expect to get?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","* Step 1: Create a FurAffinity account.

* Step 2: Post some art that showcases that you have even a tiny grasp as to how anatomy and proportions work

* Step 3: Repost your lewd art on e621 with links back to your FA account.  This will get you a lot of watchers very quickly.  Be sure to have some non-porn art on your FA to demonstrate that you're not all about that.

* Step 4: Create a hot character (male or female or other) with a signature feature (hairstyle, tattoo, penis) that you draw in sexual situations and include them in almost every picture you draw.  This will ensure that your character becomes e-famous, and other artists will be begging you to let them draw your character.

* Step 5: Post unfinished sketch outlines in sexy poses and auction them off as ""Your Character Here!""  Starting bid, $10.  Bonus points if the sketch also includes your character you created.

* Step 6: Gain &gt;$100 from someone before the work is even completed

* Step 7: Fall back on the same fox/wolf/cat/dog/horse face you use for your other art but instead change the hairstyle and colors to the whatever the poor sap who won the auction requested, and complete the artwork.

* Step 8: Repeat until that's all you do anymore.

* Epilogue Step: Use some of your profits to commission even more talented artists to draw your character in their works.  This is like injecting advertising for yourself straight into someone's wank session.  Bonus: Get Jasonafex to animate one of your existing artworks, making sure to use Neckbeardy McFedorason to voice the moans and pleasure noises.","1396311239"

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","&gt;Yes, the base C6 Corvette gets better fuel economy than the S2000, with 190 more horsepower. The Foxbody LS1 Camaro SS gets better fuel economy than the S2000, with an additional 85hp (and significantly more weight). Same for the WS6 TA.

Well, that's kinda cherry picking too. The S2000 was at the extreme end of the spectrum when it comes to engine performance. You wont find many vehicles that are that powerful with that small of an engine in most price ranges, let alone in the $30K price range. It may not be the best way to make power, but it's one that appeals to a good number of people.

&gt;The C5 Z06 has a stupidly massive fuel efficiency advantage over the 360 Modena, despite both cars being in the same era, having very similar weights, and making very similar power (the Z06 has a 5hp advantage).

But it's the same story between the C6 Z06 and the 458, same basic differences, different era. 

&gt;It's not just an American thing either. Mercedes-Benz loves using engines with a lot of low-end torque. The CL65 AMG gets slightly better fuel economy than the 458, while also making ~60 more horsepower and weighing nearly a full ton more. (seriously, that's sad)

But it's also turbocharged. Turbocharging offers a huge advantage in this area, and that's exactly why you wont find many NA engines that compare directly with the Z06. The Europeans decided that it really doesn't pay to toil around with NA engines. Look at the MP4-12C, it outperforms the ZR1, makes quite a bit less torque, yet it gets slightly better mileage.  

&gt;You are misinterpreting what I say. When I say ""weak"", I'm referring to low-end torque.
A Formula 1 car hardly has any torque at 1,000rpm, especially if you were to give it the same gearing as a Z06, but that doesn't mean that I think it's weak.

Non-turbo F1 engines idle at around 7,000 rpm. 

&gt;The Z06 is able to outperform the S2000 by a very wide margin, and is still able to match the S2000's fuel economy. The 458 can't say the same about the Z06.

Cherry picking. How many others outperform the 458 and get the same or better fuel mileage?

&gt;A ""few"" to me is 3. The 458 has a 7mpg difference, which is over double that.

In the city, where most people spend most of their time driving, it is 3 mpg.

&gt;My point is that the Ford 5.0 performs better than the Honda 2.3, while almost being able to match the latter's fuel economy (2mpg difference, instead of 7mpg for the 458).

But that doesn't prove anything, it's the same for the 458, it out-performs the Z06 and even the ZR1, it should be allowed to have worse fuel mileage.

&gt;This is mostly due to the 5.0 engine having a lot of low-end torque, and the Mustang having a very tall overdrive gear ratio. Notice how this only applies on the highway, where overdrive gears are used. The 5.0 has horrible fuel economy in the city, and the 2.3 does much better under that environment. But on the highway their numbers are much closer.

Gearing.

"spaceengineers","t5_2ygas","Most of the frills and extravagance come from the structure of the ship, which translates to weight, turning it into a space sloth.  It depends on what you consider frills:  if you want to go pure utility, then you could go so far as to call side walls and a roof frills.  I would also think anything of a size that could be called a capital ship will require far more than 7 maneuvering thrusters, otherwise the mass of the ship is going to laugh at the 2 lil thrusters trying to stop it.  For example, some of my capital ships have two dozen large forward thrusters, with 2 larges and a grip of smalls each direction for maneuvering (this was a warship with some desire for decent maneuverability though).

From my experience, every time I've built a large ship, I've said ""Dang, this would been easier if I had made it smaller.""  I'd highly recommend playing around in creative mode and try to squish your requirements into the smallest structure possible.

Cons: paying. It's not fair to you to have to pay for it. I know you've said you're willing to, but it still isn't fair to put that on you. Besides, what if you happen upon hard times and can't pay anymore? We have to switch to someone else who might not be as willing to pay. I'm just not comfortable with the idea.

paying: you also need to be a premium member to adjust the settings for the game (including choosing the map, adding a game password, etc.). We would need more than one premium member to be able to set up a game for each sector.

randoms: I don't know how, but we've had private games with random people in it. I don't get it, but it has happened.

chance: there is an element of chance in atWar games that some people may not like. It's not immediately obvious when playing, but there is a ""crit. hit"" stat. It's really uncommon, but it's still there.

map designing: Revan has already designed a chroma map. No offense to him, but it's not amazing (not bad at all, rev, I do really enjoy playing on it when I get the chance. It's just not amazing), and it still seemed like it took him a while to make it. Now, you're talking several sectors per territory. We've got what, 30 territories? A conservative estimate puts that at 150 unique maps that need to be made. By the premium member(s) only!

Ranks: atWar uses a ranking system. only levels 1-5 are allowed to play on 'beginner' games. I've been playing for a bit, and am level 3. Someone who hasn't played before is going to start at lvl 1. What happens when I get to 6? Do I not get to play? Do I not get to use the account with my name on it? If enough people get to 6 and we decide to all switch to the 'normal' server, how do new players join? Work for a month before finally getting to join? Nobody's going to do that and atWar isn't popular enough for us to be finding people who are already level 6 that want to join our game.

I like the ideas. I really do. But they still need to be refined.","1396311247"

Women's Rights Activist =/= Feminist. From what I've heard (primarily from women) the Feminist movement has been co-opted by womyn with very extreme views; for this reason, ""Feminism"" no longer really represent sexual equality, but rather embodies misandry. Moreover, it's become a fad to be a Feminist; while women's rights should be fully supported, this does mean there are a lot more ""stupid Feminists"" - ie, women who want to be ""in-trend"" but have no concept of what they're talking about. When most women now say they are ""anti-Feminism"", it is more a rejection of these recent developments than a disregard for the ongoing fight for sexual equality.

But instead she chose the exact words:

The videos strike me as scripted--or at least thoroughly prepared--so I have to think the phrasing was deliberate.

I'd say the unused line would still convey her distaste for apathy (which I think has merit, but is overstated in degree), while not being nearly as susceptible to out-of-context judgment.

With that in mind, I can't help but think she chose that sound-byte for controversy rather than accuracy.  My cynical side assumes this was to drive up views, and comparing that video's stats to the others... intentional or not, it's had an effect!","1396311248"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","This one should be fun. Taken a face value, OP's narrative, the obvious opinion is that her parents are unreasonable. What dose the author want to be true? Granted it is common sense to be mindful of others health issues, even passively, especially after 14 years. That there could continue for so long implies the problem is much deeper. Similarly, either you or your wife out of respect for you or at least your son would reach some ""breaking point."" I believe you have, and I believe that breaking point is ennui and disconnection, specifically your wife. I'm assuming you've had arguments with your wife about this, I'm sure the first argument about it was with her, if not her family themselves. The fact that this persists for so long, and that you are here asking us now, implies respect was lost or absent. Not a judgement, just an observation. Everyone can sense this (through behavior and communication, or the lack of) absence, your in-laws especially, and so the behavior persists because the persistence of the behavior reaffirms the belief. Over and over. For 14 years. Or forever. Until someone breaks the cycle. Or dies. Which is it going to be?

How is your relationship with your wife? Do you feel belittled or emasculated in relation to/by her, or emasculated in general? Do you retreat, that is find yourself drawn, into ""fetishes"" of masculinity (facial hair, cars, etc)? Do you fantasize about divorce, not desire it but ""if I were to get a divorce, I would do it like this.""? Do you feel more in reaction to others, trapped and unable to find satisfaction with a choice? I believe you are not only alienated from your wife but perhaps yourself. I'm thinking you have another child as well (daughter?); if so, do you find yourself ""closer"" to your son? Do you find yourself ""bonding,"" having conversations where you mutually lament with him over this struggle you share? I ask because *this* situation persists, that is you are not ""driven"" to a solution (not a good or bad one, any solution) or a psychological way of coping, because the situation itself is ""valuable"" to you. It reaffirms *to you* that your wife does not understand and respect you, as you suspect, and that your real purpose is your love for your children. The ego doesn't want happiness, it just want to be right, reaffirm beliefs, status quo, and behaves as such. You should sit down and find your personal values, at what basic levels you demand respect, and how they align with what you hold as valuable. Your marriage, your children, your self-respect, whatever. I can't tell you what is valuable, but if you don't define them they will be defined for you. It is inevitable.

You're going to have to make a choice. In the one hand you'll have who you think you are and in the other hand you'll have who you actually are. One of you is going to die. Which one will be up to you. Don't worry about it. As soon as you stop running away, you'll start feeling better. You'll remember you don't believe in any of this fate crap. You're in control of your own life, remember?

We paid it off really quick and so it's not hard for us to sell it now, there is no lien to worry about. 

There's nothing wrong with mobile homes in general, I'm not trying to say that. We just want to go back to renting, which we are more than happy with.

"WWE","t5_2rau9","The whole article is a giant pile of shit and heres why:

*Working While Injured/Being A Workhorse*

The ENTIRE WWE ROSTER works while being injured.  This is a company-wide expectation around big events.  There are countless others who do the same thing, Randy Orton, CM Punk, Big Show, The Usos, Alberto Del Rio, Kane, Undertaker, and Daniel Bryan to name a few.  The article insinuates that John Cena is the only one who works through injuries like he's some kind of god-king talent.  Complete BS

*Too Many Great Matches*

It's easy to have a great match when someone is CARRYING YOU.  John Cena has had the privilege of working with some of the most gifted in-ring technicians and workers of all time.  Not only that but he gets placed there again and again and again even if he SUCKS at wrestling.  Why?  He's the chosen-one apparently.  The golden boy who can do no wrong.  I can think of other talent who would have matches just as good if not better, with the freebie opportunities that John Cena has.

*Real Life Promos*

I can not count how many times (too many times) where we have been forced to see John Cena come out at the beginning of RAW boring us all half to death for 15 minutes.  Elite talker my ass.  This is no Rock or Steve Austin.  Cena and the word Elite should never be used in the same sentence when describing his ability on the microphone.  Cena loves bland shitty dialogue because it's easy for him to spit out.  John Cena is 100% fine with his promos.  He likes his little 4 year old grade school garbage.  He'll never say anything to creative or push back with his own ideas because he loves his spot, and the easiest way to keep his spot is to become a mouthpiece of mediocrity.

*Taking A Step Back*

It really doesn't matter who he's put over, because taking a step back should really mean LESS screen time.  Over the past few years, we see nothing but John Cena everywhere, John Cena on magazines, John Cena all over WWE.com, John Cena prominently promoted on every medium imagineable.  Taking a step back would mean letting someone else establish an identity as a possible #1 TOP DRAW for WWE, but that's just not possible for Jealous John.


*Wrestling The Next Generation Of Stars*

This is the laziest part of the article.  Is this really a reason to back John Cena?  Wrestling the next generation of stars?  Is he putting over anyone except for who he's being forced to put over?","1396311254"

Pickled Sugar Snap Peas

1-1/4 cups white distilled vinegar

1 Tablespoon kosher or pickling salt

1 Tablespoon sugar

1-1/4 cups cold water

1 pound sugar snap peas, stems trimmed and strings removed (be sure you get them from both sides!)

4 sprigs fresh tarragon

4 garlic cloves, sliced

1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes

In a nonreactive saucepan, heat the vinegar with the salt and sugar until they are dissolved. Remove from the heat, and add the cold water which starts the cooling process faster.

When the vinegar mixture is cool, pack the sugar snaps, tarragon, garlic and pepper flakes into jars (I like tall 8-oz. or 12-oz. ones to give as gifts but you could use a pint or quart jar if they're just for you) and pour the brine over it. Cover with a non-reactive cap.

Refrigerate for two weeks before eating.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Yes to the first question.

You can define the edge of the observable universe as the distance where we see the light from the beginning of the universe.  That is what the observable universe is.  It only grows because time goes by, and with that, light travels enough to reach us from farther away.  Remember, the center of the universe is everywhere.  Every point in space came from the same beginning point.

The rate of expansion of the universe is another can of worms.  The easy way to put it is that gravity should be slowing the momentum of the expansion, but we have measurements saying it is actually accelerating.  This is why some scientists have adopted the theory of dark energy.  When energy is not being conserved, we expect there should be energy being put into the system from somewhere else.

EDIT:  The light from the edge of the observable universe is not reflected.  It is the actual light that was created during (or very soon after) the big bang.","1396311259"

I've taken an ASL class since then and have learned most of the basic terms for the other objects in the store like soda, fries, onion rings, burger, hot dog, etc. so that I'm better prepared for next time. It's actually quite common for parents to neglect learning sign language and don't bother to communicate with their children, or force cochlear implants on them (I'm only using the word 'force' because the deaf community is mostly against them because they don't consider being deaf as a disability).

Of course now that we're fighting insurgents that do leave a man behind, armies are moving back towards bullets that are meant to kill, like the 7.62x51

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","1. A worse division means a higher chance for success and a playoff birth. That sounds pretty desirable in my book. Plus he gets two revenge games against the Eagles every year. 
2. None of the receivers you named caught more than 60 passes, nor did any break 900 yards on the season. I hardly consider that scary, let alone comparable to the top receiving groups in the league. Now the Redskins are certainly not the model for how to build a receiving corp, but you have to admit that theirs is at least, just as good as the Raiders'. 
3. While there are questions about RG3 I hardly believe he can be compared to Terrelle Pryor who had more interceptions than touchdowns last year.

You're definitely not an ugly duckling, but some people do just grow into their looks. They lose stubborn baby fat in the face (I had awful cheeks in middle school and high school!).

The odds are against you, but it can be done, I believe in you.

If you can force yourself to get some excercise, like a short jog, that can really help to make the withdrawals end sooner. Also, a really long soak in a hot bath with epsom salt, a half cup of baking soda, and a few drops of lavendar extract (if you can find it, but this is the least important item of the three) can really relax your muscles and purge your body of all those toxins to help it end sooner too. Masturbation always helps too, I'm sure you already know. If you can do a 15 minute jog, jerk off, then take that epsom salt/baking soda bath, you may start to feel a lot better after.

&lt;Grin&gt; Is a friendly, casual PvP/PvE guild, US/PC/AD (though we welcome cross faction members), with a solid core that's been playing together through beta. We have players of all types, and from all backgrounds. Several of us have been ""top tier"" gamers in previous mmo's but want to take a bit more relaxed approach this time around.

Our rules are fairly basic:

1) Teamwork above all else. Through teamwork, everything else comes naturally.

2) Bigotry of any kind will absolutely not be tolerated. We have members from all backgrounds, and we enjoy our diverse community.

3) You must download teamspeak3. You do not have to talk, or even own a mic, but it will be required for any pvp or pve guild groups and events.

4) No spamming or scamming.

We prefer players who are 18 or older.

If you would like to join, post here or send myself (@ghastlygrin), or @Empjoy, mail in game.

See you in game!

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Well, last year he got paid $495,000 by Philadelphia in MLS [according to the Players' Union](http://www.mlsplayers.org/files/September%2015,%202013%20Salary%20Information%20-%20By%20Club.pdf). I can't imagine we're able to spend that much, but I'm guessing that the wage is a few hundred thousand dollars.

Aside from getting guaranteed money (which is sometimes less common in foreign leagues with less financially stable clubs), he's playing in an environment that, while not extremely challenging, will still be competitive. Marcos Senna is probably the biggest name in the league, and from [interviews with him](http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2013/11/08/marcos-senna-talks-new-york-cosmos-nasl-growth-cristiano-ronaldo-vs-lionel-messi-and-more-ahead-of-nasl-soccer-bowl/) it seems like he's enjoyed the ability to pass on knowledge to younger players and shine in the spotlight again. This is my club's first year of existence (after years of a supporters' group agitating for a professional team in Indianapolis), so the pressure will be on Kleberson to help them win quickly and make it into the [new ""playoffs.""](http://www.nasl.com/article/uuid/19mjcfxw5twlf1kav40nm9i7w8/nasl-clubs-to-compete-for-the-championship#.UzoDIMe25i4)

It's hard for me to quantify the level or the growth of the NASL, as it's only a few years old (U.S. second divisions have been historically unstable, but hopefully this one is here to stay), but it's gaining ground. It's certainly not at the level of MLS on the pitch, but it still has that grassroots-type feel that gets people excited to watch, and the play isn't all that bad ([here are last year's goals of the season](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmkYrDDQ2YI)).

If you don't think about things analytically, then you will make the same mistakes over and over. So like everything it's a balance.

...oh ok...

There are 83 characters(numbers/symbols) in one line. There are 42 lines in one page. There is 4 full pages and a 5th page not filled up. There are 7 more lines and 8 more zeros in the 5th page.

83\*42\*4 + 83*7 + 8 = 14533

The number being powered by has 35 digits. So that's 9.971949e35. Since we're going by years, not millenia, it's more like 9.971949e38. So, the number that's powering has 14497 digits, so we can write it as 5.603784e14497.

The nerves branch off as you move down the spine, and they match up with different parts of the body: the nerves that go to the arms branch off from the spine higher than the legs, for example. That's why you only lose control of your lower body when you have damage at a lower part of the spine, but lose control of both your lower body and upper body when a higher part is damaged.

The problem here is not fixing the vertebrae, which are bones, but the spinal cord which is made of nerves. We don't know how to fix spinal cord damage with current medical techniques.","1396311280"

In order to believe this rather innocent interpretation, you are forced to conclude HFT aren't making any money.  If they're just randomizing the price around a set point, there's no reason to believe they'll come out ahead on any given trade.

And if HFT isn't making money, people wouldn't be paying top dollar to get in on the action.

But, of course, your little scenario isn't actually happening.  What's happening is that you've got a pool of prices - $100.22, $100.05, $99.75, and $99.98 - which average to $100.  You submit your order for one lot at market rate (assuming you'll get a share for around $100).  Then the HFT program sees your order enter the system and immediately buys the lots at $99.75 and $99.98, pricing them at $100.04.  Your order is filled and the HFT collects the $.29 difference between the under-average lots and the sale price, then cancels the order for the $99.98 lot returning it to the pool.

The HFT acts as an entirely unwanted middle-man, monopolizing equity only as it is demanded, and then releasing it when the demand is filled.","1396311283"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","The Buddha testified that he recollected his past lives and that he directly perceived the truth of rebirth, the cyclical process of the disappearance and reappearance of sentient beings, upon his awakening. These are the two realizations he describes as having attained in the first two watches of the night of his awakening. In other discourses, he addresses at length the opposing views of his contemporaries on the truth and nature of rebirth, some espousing annihilationism and others differing conceptions of rebirth centered upon some notion of self, and distinguishes his own teachings on rebirth against them. He further elaborates on the causes for the process of birth and death, of what sustains continual becoming, while one remains afflicted with the three poisons, in the teachings on the twelve-linked chain of causation. In short, the teachings on rebirth form a significant part of the Buddha's teachings on the nature of existence, as we find them in the suttas. The point of Buddhist practice is to experience and to verify for oneself the truth of the Buddha's claims about the nature of existence. 

The Buddha's teachings on rebirth have not been confirmed or 'proven' (science isn't in the business of proving hypotheses; it gathers and evaluates evidence in or against their favor, reaching provisional conclusions) in the results of scientific research, you're correct on that point. But if the only parts of Buddhism you would not reject out of hand are those which echo the results of scientific studies conducted thus far, what's the point of studying or engaging with Buddhism at all? You would be better served reading the abstracts of the latest scientific papers in whatever fields interest you than studying the suttas, in that case. ","1396311285"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;Either all racism is wrong, or all of it is okay.

Define the term ""all racism"".  There's a large gulf separating what Colbert's doing and institutionalized social/economic oppression of Asian-Americans.  You can make an argument that this sort of humor is proto-racism that could lead to a spark in someone's mind which could progress many years later to institutionalized social oppression, but it's a bit of a stretch.

As a liberal, I have to say this is, honestly, where some liberals fall off the rails.  We aren't going to eliminate racism, or racial stereotypical humor.  Banning it from formal channels isn't going to stop people using it in their homes.

We can hope to be AWARE of it, however.  In this case, there's very little doubt Colbert is parodying racism, unless one is really just looking at excuses for outrage.  At some level you can be so paranoid about extinguishing everything that remotely seems like racism that you actually avoid any ability to discuss it.  This sort of mindset would have banned at least one Charlie Chaplin film (promoting Nazi tropes!) and Jonathan Swift's writings.

I've seen this kind of humor applied to white cultural tropes all the time (see Chris Rock, Stuff White People Like, etc).  Is that also racism that should be banned?

EDIT: If you need a more august historical precedent, look at what Mark Twain does with Jim in Huckleberry Finn.  Is Mark Twain being a racist by exaggerating all of Jim's slave-trope superstitions?  Or is he satirizing that depiction of African-Americans AND organized religion?  It's pretty clearly the latter.","1396311287"

This isn't quite right; you make it sound like RRSP and RRSP mutual fund are two different things (1 and 2).  It's actually 2 different allocations of the same thing (like 1a and 1b) - you put money in and then decide how it's allocated.

Why on earth are you advocating for mutual funds when you can do it yourself as often discussed on this sub for a fraction of the cost? (2% MER for mutual funds vs. 0.5% for index funds in a self-directed portfolio)

Why would you advocate for RRSP over TFSA when the OP is very likely to make much more money later on and could then use the RRSP to reduce his declaration?

Yes, but MK wrote it first, on his own, uncalled-for, and Bethesda pulled it into *Skyrim* from.

It's not even a matter of needing the innovation, on the contrary, the simplicity of finding full armor sets was lauded in numerous critic circles as one of the many ways in which From innovated the action mmo genre.

It's also more than just fashion souls, as the mad warrior armor is pretty much the heaviest set (and therefore the highest defensive benefits) that you can squeeze under 70% without leveling any vitality for some classes.

From doesn't gain anything from imposing a gear grind, they aren't an mmo company charging monthly subscriptions, and the game past it's initial phase is not about collecting gear.  What this setup does is forces anyone who wants to look a certain way, or have certain stats, offline, pretty definitively not doing any activity that the souls series is known for.","1396311296"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","To prove once and for all that math can be fun, we
present: Wherein it is related how that paragon of womanly
virtue, young Polly Nomial (our heroine) is accosted by that
notorious villain Curly Pi, and factored (oh horror!!!)
     Once upon a time (1/t) pretty little Polly Nomial was
strolling across a field of vectors when she came to the boundary
of a singularly large matrix. Now Polly was convergent, and her
mother had made it an absolute condition that she must never
enter such an array without her brackets on. Polly, however,
who had changed her variables that morning and was feeling
particularly badly behaved, ignored this condition on the basis
that it was insufficient and made her way in amongst the complex
elements. Rows and columns closed in on her from all sides.
Tangents approached her surface. She became tensor and tensor.
Quite suddendly two branches of a hyperbola touched her at a
single point. She oscillated violently, lost all sense of
directrix, and went completely divergent. As she tripped over a
square root that was protruding from the erf and plunged
headlong down a steep gradient. When she rounded off once more,
she found herself inverted, apparently alone, in a non-Euclidean
space.
     She was being watched, however. That smooth operator,
Curly Pi, was lurking inner product. As his eyes devoured her
curvilinear coordinates, a singular expression crossed his face.
He wondered, ""Was she still convergent?"" He decided to
integrate properly at once.
     Hearing a common fraction behind her, Polly rotated and
saw Curly Pi approaching with his power series extrapolated.
She could see at once by his degenerate conic and dissipative
that he was bent on no good.
     ""Arcsinh,"" she gasped.
     ""Ho, ho,"" he said, ""What a symmetric little asymptote
you have I can see you angles have lots of secs.""
     ""Oh sir,"" she protested, ""keep away from me I haven't
got my brackets on.""
     ""Calm yourself, my dear,"" said our suave operator, ""your
fears are purely imaginary.""
     ""I, I,"" she thought, ""perhaps he's not normal but
homologous.""
     ""What order are you?"" the brute demanded.
     ""Seventeen,"" replied Polly.
     Curly leered ""I suppose you've never been operated on.""
     ""Of course not,"" Polly replied quite properly, ""I'm
absolutely convergent.""
     ""Come, come,"" said Curly, ""let's off to a decimal place
I know and I'll take you to the limit.""
     ""Never,"" gasped Polly.
     ""Abscissa,"" he swore, using the vilest oath he knew.
His patience was gone. Coshing her over the coefficient with a
log until she was powerless, Curly removed her discontinuities.
He stared at her significant places, and began smoothing out her
points of inflection. Poor Polly. The algorithmic method was
now her only hope. She felt his digits tending to her asymptotic
limit. Her convergence would soon be gone forever.
     There was no mercy, for Curly was a heavyside operator.
Curly's radius squared itself; Polly's loci quivered. He
integrated by parts. He integrated by partial fractions. After
he cofactored, he performed runge - kutta on her. The complex
beast even went all the way around and did a contour
integration. What an indignity - to be multiply connected on
her first integration. Curly went on operating until he
completely satisfied her hypothesis, then he exponentiated and
became completely orthogonal.
     When Polly got home that night, her mother noticed that
she was no longer piecewise continuous, but had been truncated
in several places But it was to late to differentiate now. As
the months went by, Polly's denominator increased monotonically.
Finally she went to L'Hopital and generated a small but
pathological function which left surds all over the place and
drove Polly to deviation.
     The moral of our sad story is this: ""If you want to
keep your expressions convergent, never allow them a single
degree of freedom.""","1396311300"

Although the language might seem offensive, it's pretty true.  Desperation makes people cling to sometimes ill-informed reasoning.

I think one major problem American medicine is going to face over the next few years as we start to more seriously examine our health system is the rhythm between patient autonomy and health care provider expertise.  Toss in the continued shrinking of time with individual patients and you have a guarantee for miscommunication.  I don't think you'll ever find true balance between patient autonomy and paternalism, but the field is starting to see we tipped things too far in the patient's favor with the growth of principlism (autonomy/justice/beneficence/nonmaleficence) as our ethical foundation.","1396311300"

This goes on all the time and just because there are higher concentrations of zombies in the cities, its not to say there would not be an eventual occupation and behavioral change in the animals. 

Additionally, referring back to predatory animals, large territories are set up, which the individual does perimeter checks on. So they could occupy space in and around the cities, but it does not mean they would stay at that exact local. ","1396311301"

Even though I look Chinese, the older people in Chinatown know I was born here and probably have terrible command of Chinese...so they give me some allowances.  If I travel to China, Taiwan, or Hong Kong, people there will give me a bit of a harder time...*til they learn I'm from the US!*   You might also have an accent that your relatives are being especially hard on - maybe you can understand and speak the language, but you don't sound the same (in terms of accent &amp; vocabulary, &amp; other nuances) as one who grew up like your older relatives did.

I'm pretty good at mimicking sounds, so accents have never been a problem for me.  I have somewhat of a conversational command of Mandarin, and when I'm outside of the US, the most common thing they guess about me is that I'm from Hong Kong (caused by listening to my dad's family speak Mandarin with heavy Cantonese accents).  I tell them I'm from the US and they get surprised. This is great for me since I can usually shop and ask shopping-related questions without receiving the American price tag for things....but I have my limits.  I have a HUGE lack of vocabulary.  I can understand what others say maybe 75% of the time....but I don't have the vocabulary to answer back in full Mandarin very well.  I really ought to study more.  I can read about 40-50% of signs, menus, posters, etc.  Comics are super easy.  For news, my ability drops a lot to like 30%.  I basically can't do it.

It was hard to learn what I can speak, though.  My dad's family were the Chinese speaking ones - primarily Cantonese but Mandarin when we were outside - except my parents were divorced since I could remember. At home, my mom's side spoke Tagalog, but would switch to English when they addressed us...unless they were angry, haha.  So I couldn't really rely on home to learn Mandarin....I took some classes at a community center and practiced a bit with some friends.  Except a lot of my friends speak Cantonese but no Mandarin, so my choices were again limited there.  At least I've got shopping down!  I'm happy to say it does help a lot, especially when you travel.  My mom and sister sometimes rely on me to ask questions when we vacation in Chinese-speaking parts of Asia.

I write letters to my dad in Chinese, and he loves them.  But I definitely have to keep looking things up in the dictionary - again, my lack of vocabulary really bites me in the ass.  So I type it on the computer first, check it over and over, and then handwrite it!","1396311302"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;You have price and worth definining each other without a basis for that definition. This is a textbook example of a Chicken/egg problem.

Let's try this pretty simply:

1.  [Value: the amount of money for which something will find a buyer &lt;the real value of that house is close to a million dollars&gt;.  **Synonyms** valuation, worth](http://www.merriam-webster.com/thesaurus/value[noun])

2.  [Price: the amount of money that you pay for something or that something costs.](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/price?show=0&amp;t=1396310739)

Price has the same meaning of value (the amount of money for which something will change hands), and value is a synonym for worth and if a = b and b = c, a = c, you're wrong.

They're not defining each other, they simply mean the same thing.  Kind of like how ""foolish"" and ""silly"" are synonymous without actually being circular.

&gt;If it costs x amount to feed someone, and the owner isn't ""willing to pay x"" then he cannot use that employee without having someone else pay for it.

Only if you assume that the cost of employment should be something other than ""the actual price of hiring the employee for the hours worked.""  Which, you know, is how wage is actually defined.

&gt;Your wordplay and obfuscation won't work on me, stop trying.

It's not obfuscation, just reality.  It costs Walmart $7.25/hour to buy the labor they want.  When the government decides that the people working for minimum wage need more money, it does not magically become part of the cost for Walmart.  Nowhere in an employment agreement can you find ""must pay for the employee's upkeep.""

&gt;So did the employee learn to read and write in a vacuum? No, they didn't.

Certainly not.  But also not relevant, since the employer is paying only for the labor the employee does during the time they're paid for.

In the same way none of my clients are responsible for my student loans except insofar as I take the fees they pay me and pay my loans.

&gt;No its not, because milk doesn't live.

Labor is a service being sold, not the person.

&gt;No, that's your definition based on circular reasoning.

Also the definition from Merriam-Webster.

Or is your argument that every definition for a word must be justified a priori?

&gt;The intrinsic theory of value is the one not based on circular reasoning

Of course it is.  It assumes that value exists because it exists.  The actual definition of value is the only one that defines value as what it is: how much you can get someone else to pay for something.","1396311302"

They have huge units (giggidy) for decent prices - no 1brs, but the 2br apartments and townhomes go for $1300-$1400, and are pretty big. It's a really quiet community because it's kind of set back from the road, and the area in general is a great location for Going Out because it's convenient to a bunch of other parts of town. The kids that live here (not that there are many of them) aren't assholes, and there's a pool, fitness center, laundry, and dog park on-site.  Management and maintenance have been great and all the neighbors are friendly. Oh, and, my commute to Buckhead (via N. Druid Hills/Roxboro Rd) is about 4.5 miles total and usually takes less than 20 mins each way. If you decide to check it out, let me know - there's a referral fee I'd be glad to split!

"dawngate","t5_2x9kd","I already posted this on the facebook, but in case you don't read those, here is a wall of text of what I think about the roles.
Tactician is very problematic, and is still too powerful for the other roles to be very useful. In high mmr games, it isn't uncommon for a team to have 4 tacticians and 1 hunter. Now, I know top level players will analyze the hell out of everything, but I don't think it is very balanced for tactician to be so powerful that even carries will take it over gladiator. The main problem I have with tactician is that it isn't low risk low reward. It is more like low risk but medium reward. Since it is very easy to be harassed in dawngate while last hitting in lane(mainly due to everyone effectively being manaless), tactician is a good option. You just last hit when you can, get vim for harassing, and rack in tons of vim even if you have to miss some cs.

Next, compared to predator, there aren't really too many reasons to take predator over tactician. Dawngate is already very snowbally, and the exp difference you create even without predator are already pretty large. Because of this, it seems better to just take tactician on shapers like Kindra and Farris. Tactician gives you more consistent and practical bonuses, since it only get harder to pub stomp your lane as you play against better players. As others have said, without roaming being very viable right now, it is kind of hard to justify taking predator. If something changed so that it is easier for predators to lane gank or harass spirit wells early on, predator would be a little better. Even then, it's just really hard to argue against tactician on any laner.","1396311304"

The 20% was for *unmitigated* climate change, pricing in risk and non-market costs, and using equity weights to adjust for the disproportionate impact on the poor. Essentially, it was an estimate of the impact on aggregate utility of unmitigated climate change - a 7+ degree increase above the pre-industrial level.

The 0.2-2% in the current report, on the other hand, reflects a limited estimate of the market costs of a 2 degree increase in temperature.","1396311305"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Look, you've had your fun, but let's be clear: drop bears are not real. Sure, it's fun to scare tourists with these kind of shaggy stories, but they're definitely not real. Even though I've never actually been to Australia, I feel pretty confident in saying that.

And it feels a little irresponsible to be promulgating these kinds of fake stories, even if just for fun, when there are very real dangers out there. I think Australians like to think they're pretty tough in general so make up stories about drop bears as a way to distract themselves (and tourists) from the real obscenities happening in their country.

There's a reason you don't hear more about alien anal probing in Australia: *because they're scared shitless it'll drive tourists away*.

Think about it, if you can get tourists into believing that drop bears are real, it lulls them into thinking there is a ""just barely manageable"" danger that they can deal with. When in actuality there's nothing you can do about getting anally probed by aliens in Australia. Absolutely nothing.

Staying at the Four Seasons in Sydney? Anal probe.

Backpacking in the outback?  Anal probe.

Scuba diving at 50ft off the Great Coral Reef in Australia?  Definitely anal probe.

I just want you Australians to know that we're on to your secret, but the truth will come out!  And as if you didn't need more proof, what about the fact that ""Australia"" and ""alien anal probe"" both have 3 a's??? Bury your head in the sands if you think that's coincidence!!!!!

Does a pacifist still oppose violence if his family/community/country is attacked? No. There comes a point when you have to sacrifice one of your principles to uphold others.

With what? You realise that (thanks to the aversion of people like Chamberlain in the '30s) the UK's land forces were pitiful in mid 1939?

&gt;But UK and France agreed to sacrifice Poland which was a fucking betrayal.

Let me make this one clear. Poland *was lost* the second the Germans decided to invade. There was *nothing* either the UK or France could have done to stop that defeat. So what to do? Invade immediately against a numerically and technologically superior force, or build up forces while there is the possibility to and fight when it comes to it? The latter option was not just the option chosen, but was the smart one.

Look how quickly the UK and France were defeated in the Battle of France 7 months later after months of military buildup. To suggest that we should have invaded Germany immediately is to suggest we should have intentionally lost the entire war for absolutely no benefit to Poland, or to any other nation outside of the axis.","1396311312"

"depression","t5_2qqqf","Yes, I have experience of CBT for chronic depression. It's pretty matter of fact type work, there isn't a whole lot of going back into you past.

A lot of its is based on the separation of thoughts, emotions and feelings and how they feed off each other. Not all thoughts are real (can you think of the cow jumping over the moon?) but most of  them you fully believe them

They use workbooks called 'realistic records' where you write down details of an event which caused you stress, then you write down how you felt and give it a score. Then you come up with some other possible reasons for the event and reevaluate your score base on these realistic reasons. And you do this over and over again until you see patters in real life

Other ideas that are uses are Negative Automatic Thoughts (NAT). These are thoughts that you think about self without even realising it (""nobody would want me"") which form part of your core beliefs . This was an eye opener.

Anyway, I found it quite good and it seemed to be very focused on immediate tasks I wanted to achieve. I have experience of other therapies but the mostly focused on my past, parents and emotions.

It all comes down to how you feel with your therapist and how the relationship develops. Good luck ","1396311313"

I fully enjoyed it, and to this day is some of the only PvE I enjoy. Players just have the ""auto attack and afk"" mentality stuck in their head, and whine when something is moderately difficult. That is partially ANet's fault for making the game so facerollingly easy at launch, but the player mindset needs to change, and easing them into it isn't going to accomplish as much as a debilitating punch to the face.

I understand that ANet needs to experiment, but anyone with a calculator and half a brain can see that the swiss-style format is extremely unhealthy for leagues, and hardly promotes the competitive nature that WvW thrives on. The crit damage nerf is quite obviously corner cutting. S2 is a bit for obscure, but is, at it's core, the easy way out to get what they want.","1396311322"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","&gt;Yet you say his actions were based on being against human rights and seeing gay people as less than human.

Because they are. Believing queer families should be split up is seeing gay people as less than human.

&gt;You could also call it protection of freedom of political affiliation, which is, you know, a human right.

This isn't a political opinion, its an infringement on human rights. Marriage equality is a human right. Splitting up families and keeping those who love each other apart is not.

&gt;Then you aren't supportive of gay rights. Improving society is all about changing views. If you only care about some kind of punishment you are missing the point.

You're such a concern troll, jesus christ. I don't give a fuck about changing opinions because it isn't my responsibility. Why should I have to talk to someone and try to convince them that I'm not subhuman? No one should have to do that.

Bigots should be punished, and part of changing views is the view that being a bigot is unacceptable, and someone should be fired for being a bigot. Its like its controversial somehow. You're totally cool with someone supporting money to having families ripped apart, but the second someone insults someone for doing it, and wants to stop supporting a company that uses that person has their face, you get mad and start crying about how I'm ruining gay rights.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I work at a physical therapy office.

I believe that we have a moral obligation to make healthcare available to all citizens, and the ACA moves us closer to that goal. However, I have yet to see any evidence that healthcare is becoming more affordable. My boss used to pay me to spend time with patients and document what I did with them. Now he pays me to check his EMR (Electronic Medical Records) for accuracy so we are sure to get reimbursed. The amount we get reimbursed for each claim keeps falling. So now he pays me to spend less time with patients so we can make less money. 

For instance:  For a Medicare appointment we have to have a receptionist get authorization from a physician. Then we have to walk them through a pre-service survey, and other ACA related paperwork. Then he pays me to take height, weight, and blood pressure for no other reason than to report to Medicare. (we can SEE the morbidly obese without confirming with a scale so why confirm the obvious) Then he has a list of intake questions to add to his evaluation that usually don't pertain. Then we treat the same as we did before the ACA. After the appointment, he has to document all the irrelevant questions that were asked and make sure that it submits to Medicare properly through additional billing codes we add to our HICFA (standard insurance billing forms). I spend the last hour of my day checking all the codes to make sure they meet Medicare's requirements. For all this, we get reimbursed on average $32.50. 

Almost everything I mention is added steps to our workflow. We used to just get the MD/DO's auth, see the patient, document the appointment and bill.  Five years ago when I started this job, we were reimbursed around $50.00. 

So we do more work, for less money, and spend less time with the patient. We now LOSE around $0.50 per Medicare appointment. The Soviets used to do economics this way and it didn't work for them. I doubt it will work for us. 

tl;dr The ACA has lowered our reimbursement, and increased our cost to serve patients. I'm waiting for the 'affordable' part to kick in.","1396311323"

Introduction to Dubstep or whatever the name of this song is, it's a classic. Don't know the artist. Might be Dubba Johnny. 




I'll check my iPod for more music, I'll be back in a bit. 

Edit: I've found the best of my playlists, and added it all here. I'll update it if I find anything I've missed. Hope you enjoy. 

Edit 2: I forgot about this one. It's a huge mix of like ten different dubstep songs. Search for ""Heavier Than Your Mom"" by Chris Vipe on soundcloud. Very good mix. It's got a bit of pornstep at the end, just a warning.

(I thought the body odor was real even though it turned out to be fake, and I hated my body for betraying me. I also was getting rashes from putting on so much deoderant.) At one point, my supervisor held me back and made me leave after the bullies because she was afraid they would attack me in the parking lot. Problem is, the bully was the top producer in the office and makes the office miserable for anyone who speaks up about her gossiping and bullying. I just couldn't stand it anymore, toward the end. I didn't feel safe. 
2. I already did, was denied, no surprise there. Since I put in my 2 weeks they have it in their books as me quitting.
3. Nope. I had surgery in October and the wound took a long time to heal. They used every opportunity to make my life am embarrassing moment-hell, though, re:the wound. They'd blame the rain on it, if they could. No really, like I was in the office 3xweek due to people complaining about me, and 99 percent of the complaints were false.

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","The actual karma-points in and of itself is a trivial score-keeper that doesn't have any true meaning to any one redditor, wether karma-whore or not. The sensation lies in the sheer attention and acknowledgement from other community members that comes with the karma. It is like a high that some people get addicted to, which leads to karma-whoring. 

To make it more intuitive, think of facebook. Pretty much anyone who has a facebook account with several friends can relate to the feeling of happiness when a photo or status-update gets an unusually (relative) large amount of likes. But no one really cherishes the number, it is the meaning of the number! It means that an unusually large amount of people appreciated your photo/status. It's an understandable reaction, because it equals confirmation and appreciation from your peers, which is a feeling mostly all humans pursue.

So when you say that it's a self-post and you don't get any karma... Well, it's irrelevant. Now, I'm not saying you are a karma-whore, I'm just saying that your argument is invalid.","1396311325"

"ifiwonthelottery","t5_2vgya","So there is one user in this thread who should be ignored. His concerns are negligible. This is a great idea. 

Obvious challenges: getting artists. Media coverage. Etc. Your winnings will need to cover this and purchasing the land. (Essentially starting a business from scratch).

Now, I don't know how Public Schools go through excepting donations but I imagine it isn't a simple as setting up a bank account for them. If the bank account is in the school's name...are they liable? So you wouldn't do that. You'd put it in your name and cut them a check? I have to imagine there are certain taxes/laws associated with just handing a ton of money to a school.

Schools are not perfect institutions. Some will be corrupt. You should probably vet them and ask them to disclose their budgets which hopefully should be higher with your funding. Will they want to do this? How else do you ensure your money is going where they say it is? Maybe a contract. Get a legal staff. You won the lottery. you'll have lawyers anyways. :)

I love thinking about businesses, especially start ups. My brain for whatever reason is programmed to find flaws in shit and go...""what else could go wrong."" That way everything is perfect...which it will never be...which is why i'm always busy.

You'll need to obviously make sure you're not going to violate decibel ordinances in the township, but seeing all the money you're giving the school that's an easy bridge to cross. 

You'll also have to spend money on media to get the word out that this is a good thing. Some folks might look at it like you're just bringing trouble into their town. Drugs are bad, mmkay.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I've ridden a Cannondale CAAD8 (Aluminium/Carbon Fork/Tiagra) for several years now. I didn't really NEED a new bike (who ever does?) but this deal fell into my lap and I couldn't say no. This could likely be the last road bike I ever buy.

It's a 2006 Litespeed Tuscany. Beautiful Ti frame, Carbon fork. When it was made, it probably came with Ultegra, but at some point since then it was upgraded to SRAM Red 10-speed, FSA SLK-light Carbon Cranks and Mavic Ksyirum SLs. Since I received it a week and a half ago, I substituted a Mavic Open Pro wired Powertap on the rear, Selle Italia Flite saddle (it's an older one you can find on ebay, it's the only saddle I've found that I actually enjoy) and some new bartape. 

This thing is a dream. In the last year I've gotten into long distance riding - I have a 235 mile solo ride planned for May and the prospect of completing that on the STIFF AS BALLS Cannondale was a little un-nerving. On this thing, though - it will be smooth sailing. 

Thanks guys, I'm pumped about my new ride - just wanted to show it off a little. I'll be taking it out for a spin with my Monday night crew here in an hour or so. Should be a good time.

Plus if you are friends with the production staff, try asking them if they need volunteers. Not only will you gain valuable experience, but you can earn community service hours at no charge to you.

My favorite source of plays (my ""theatre Bible"" if you will) is a decade-old Drama textbook my college professor. Everything from Chekhov to Arthur Miller to Tony Kushner to Moliere in one text.

"taiwan","t5_2qhrg","From a procedural perspective, allowing a small interest group to take the legislature (and, briefly, the executive) hostage to meet their demands is anti-democratic.  Certainly far less democratic than a bill passed by a majority vote of duly elected representatives.  Disagreements with regards to legislative procedure should be resolved by the judiciary, or the legislature itself.  That's how it's done in functioning, stable democracies.  This is literally the first time I have heard a stable democracy have its legislature completely stopped by protesters.

From an international law perspective, Taiwan reneging on its trade agreements is bad for its credibility and harms its ability to negotiate agreements in the future.  It is likely also illegal and Taiwan may face some consequences from, for example, the WTO.

Finally, at bottom, entering into a trade agreement with China does not pose any danger to Taiwan's sovereignty.  There are only two ways Taiwan loses its sovereignty: through Chinese military action, or voluntarily.  The former cannot happen as long as the US maintains its promise to defend Taiwan.  In addition, there has never been a situation where increasing economic ties causes an increase in belligerence.  Countries with strong economic ties usually *don't* attack each other.

The only possibility of Taiwan voluntarily joining China is if either a) China becomes a liberal democracy like Taiwan and there is still enough sentiment of a unified China or b) enough Chinese citizens become Taiwanese citizens to overcome the massive support for the status quo.  The trade agreement doesn't affect either of these.

I think, overall, the movement is motivated by an unreasonable fear of China and the recent Crimean annexation (I mean, why now, instead of when the treaty was first negotiated?).  Comparisons to Crimea are inapposite, though, both because the US was in no position to stop Russian troops (which already were stationed in Crimea) and the Crimean populace has largely been in favor of leaving Ukraine and joining Russia, regardless of the dubious vote they held.  The fears that increasing economic ties leads to a loss of sovereignty are similar to unreasonable and unfounded fears that conservatives in the US and Europe held with regards to NAFTA and the EU.","1396311329"

There were no design ""tests"" of the crash scenario (what does this even mean).  In fact, there are no records at all of the parameters and values used to determine the design response to a 707 impact. 

Your link also intentionally garbles the facts.  The belief was that a lost 707 (low on fuel) might hit the tower.  Single impact.  Low speed.  What happened was not even close to that scenario.  Fire was never factored.  Core damage was not factored. This is confirmed by Robertson himself.  Who is alive and oddly for someone so intimate with the buildings and a reputable structural engineer has no problems with the physics of the collapse.  


Skilling's quote about over design is always (surprise!) cherry picked because he talks specifically about loss of perimeter columns.  Read that again.  Only loss of perimeter columns.  Not core damage.

The oil from the mozzarella becomes the dressing. 

Chicken salad made with rotisserie chicken is pretty easy, too. You can use the lid to the chicken as the bowl to mix everything in. If you want to sub avocado for some or all of the mayonnaise, it adds healthy monosaturated fat. 

You can cook bacon in the microwave, for BLTs and the like, too. Or just for eating, because...well, because bacon.

Of course you should be skeptical about things. But if you're trying to reach Buddhist enlightenment, you should not be skeptical about Buddha's teachings. Rather, you *will* have doubts and be skeptical when you start, and once you've probed and prodded and asked enough questions and your doubts have been satisfied, then you will drop the fetter of doubt, and that will be a good spiritual attainment. Faith is what gives you motivation to continue until you reach that point.

Based on context, I would assume it's ""thanks"" but I'm never sure. Google/Bing seem to have a terrible time translating Lithuanian, for instance (context: she's talking to her friend):

&gt;"" labai grazios!:-)""
&gt;
&gt;""very grazios!:-)"" - Google

&gt;"" Tai jau  kitiems metams ruosemes , bet jai ilistum i kadra tikrai nepamaisytu, ane  x""
&gt;
&gt;""It's already the following year:), but i ruosemes it ilistum really nepamaisytu, ane:D kadra x"" - Google.

First off, don't use the jetpack. Start on the construction site trampoline, ragdoll until you get to a decent height, then go to each one in [this order.](http://i.imgur.com/innYOrI.png)

It's easiest to maneuver ragdoll as soon as you start to rebound, and then just adjust your aim as needed. You'll have a decent amount of airtime.

It'll probably take you a couple times to get it down, but it's super easy after that.

Another tip, to get to the top of the construction site quickly, use the pool trampoline closest to the construction site (#2 in the image) to get on top of the school building next to it, than use the right-hand side set of fans (*circled in orange) to fly up there.","1396311343"

The ocean is pretty unavoidable, but Smoker, Ace, Crocodile, and probably the others are able to prevent themselves from falling in, whether it's by flying or sticking to something or just pulling themselves up. Seastone can be reformed into a weapon, and dodging a seastone weapon is the same as dodging a normal weapon.



You saying that you can't train Haki like Boa Mari did is also false. Rayleigh forced Luffy to train that exact way. 

Haki is a powerful punch. It's not powerful if it misses. If you dodge it, it won't hurt you. If I flicked you, it would hurt more than if Garp tried to haki punch you and missed.

"news","t5_2qh3l","You're not supposed to learn that much from the complaint. A complaint is supposed to make a ""short and plain statement"" of factual allegations that on their face could be plausible, and that give notice to the other party as to what you're suing them for. You want to say just enough to survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which asks the court to conclude that no reasonably jury could possibly find the defendant liable based on what you've said. Or your case can be dismissed for other reasons, like jurisdictional issues. Both saying too little as well as too much can hurt you there. Once you get past a motion to dismiss, which is a big deal, you can start demanding discovery (i.e. depositions of the defendant, access to his or her documents, etc.) to flesh out your case. Then you (or they) might move for summary judgment arguing that there is no genuine dispute as to some or all of the elements of your claim, or you might settle. But at the beginning, you don't want to say too much in order not to give the defendant grounds to argue that you've pleaded yourself out of court, or give them information that they can play against you later, and you want the court to focus on the central issues.","1396311345"

Unfortunately, all you're doing is showing your ignorance - this is rugby, not soccer - this is Reddit, not America, and your post just further stereotypes why people think Americans are such ignorant dicks...so, rather than shoot yourself in the foot, why not try trolling where people don't know more than you (maybe 4chan...not sure, tbh).","1396311350"
"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","&gt;Mhm. I think the marriage was nothing but Marvel throwing their two most popular black characters together to 1) gain some publicity and 2) give in to Hudlin.

Gaining publicity is apart of the business. That's why whenever marvel or DC has a event or has a marriage or introduces a new character they talk about the more. To invite new readers, help spread the word, and to make sure the hardcore fans know they aren't jus doin this and leaving it to die without promotion. 

They didn't give in to Hudlin. Maybe they just realized that if both priest and Hudlin wanted to do this maybe there was something to it. 

&gt;It's kind of insulting to black people. 


It's not insulting to black people. Marvel was being progressive. We had a black Panther who was unapologetically awesome and a storm who was written very well. Best she's been written in years.  During civil war she intelligently put reed Richards and stark on more than one occasion. 

It's something positive for black people. Finally we see a portrayal of black love that has a powerful couple and shows them in a positive light. That is sorely lacking in all media. 

&gt;I have read some of the stories involving them as a couple. They were okay but not good enough for me to like the idea. Most of the stories were in BP, written by Hudlin who I don't particularly like in the first place, or Fantastic Four, a book that I've never enjoyed.

Sometimes you should forget who's writing it and just enjoy the story. If you come into it with that ima hate this mentality then of course you aren't gonna like it. 

&gt;I also really dislike anyone who is strongly connected to BET, but that's a personal hatred for that channel. As I said originally, God himself could come down and write that story and I would still hate it.

Same as above. 

&gt;If you like the marriage, more power to you. Me personally? Despite it making Storm look weak, I could not have smiled wider when T'Challa dissolved their marriage.

It did not make storm look weak. At all. I just finished the run in its entirety. And i never once saw a weak storm. She is shown as an equal to T'challa, she's smart, competent, and powerful. ","1396311350"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","A revamp of our punitive system is needed. Incarceration isn't an effective deterrent against deviance anymore. Some municipalities (Clark County Washington at least) are moving towards having drug courts for misdemeanor drug charges. Participants go through stages of progressively less surveillance and only do jail time if they fail a UA or abscond. The goal is to keep people out of prison here.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","...And? LeBron shoots like 44%. You're right, Kobe needs a very good offensive rebounding big man to win,  because he's not super efficient in the Finals since teams gear up their defenses on him (even alongside Shaq, read Mark Cuban's commentary on the Pistons' strategy). His inefficiency is mitigated by having an Elite offensive rebounding big man (see Pau in 08 vs 10).

If FG percentage were all that matters,  then '11 LeBron would be better than '12 LeBron. If you're going to discount him averaging 32-7.5-5.5 or 29-8-4 because his TS% was only at about 53% (higher than his team's efficiency on way higher volume by the way) then you're saying that drawing double teams, spacing the court, being active on the boards, being active on defense,  drawing fouls on the other team,  gearing up the defense so that other players face less pressure,  etc. You're saying none of that matters because of efficiency (especially when it's something that is mitigated by having a teammate). I don't know about you, but I'd take '10 Kobe over '11 Bron any day,  FG% be damned. 

(Note this is not a defense of '04 Kobe. That shit was unacceptable. But 2000 they lost without him,  and when he came back he carried the lakers with Shaq in foul trouble. Sucked it up after that but he was injured so...  Those are the two ""bad""  Finals he had. The rest were good to really good.) ","1396311351"
