"politics","t5_2cneq","I disagree.  Said corporations aren't really worried about stopping the infringement of their content as much as they are fighting a new paradigm which doesn't involve them.  

See the lawsuit against Youtube which cost Google 100 million to defend against even though Viacom didn't have a leg to stand on.  

Were they worried about infringement?  No, Google does everything in their power to stop it and immediately responds to any allegation of infringement, no matter how unsupported or unproven - taking down waves of legitimate content in the process.  In effect, Google is firebombing their own properties for Viacom's benefit - and that's not good enough, because Google isn't paying Viacom the big bucks.  

A quote I read recently stated that Google was a whiner for mentioning the cost of the lawsuit - Viacom deserved all that money in the first place, and it was Google's fault for not paying.

""I had to pull a ""What about the wimminz?"" just the other day. Men suffer great injustice in the West, but regarding men's rights in Iran...where women have no rights at all...was a stretch too far.""

Actually, even in a place like Iran there are many important men's issues. For example, take a look at their war with Iraq. The Basij were known for rounding boys up and using them to detonate mines by forcing them to run across mine fields. Also, in Iran, widowed husbands are only awarded half the amount of compensation money that widowed wives get; and in Islam men are mandated to take care of women, even when they can take care of themselves. And then there's the issue of stoning. Men are only buried waste deep before they are executed so more of their body will be exposed to the rocks and they will be stoned longer.

Equal rights isn't a zero-sum game and some times both genders get screwed at the same time. Iran is such a place, where both men and women are oppressed. I think your being very apprehensive about Iranian culture, and as a result you're rushing to a conclusion about how things are there. Definitely, it's not fun to be a female there. It's not fun to be a male there either, though.","1280620819"

For some reason, you've chosen to focus on your assumption that I object to British people using British words on British television, instead of my real problem, which is the statement itself.

For the record, what do *you* think they were saying?  Is it:

1.  Among black males aged 17 in the US, prisoners outnumber people who go to a thing that British people call ""college"", which is something you do from ages 16 to 18 before going to University, even though *no such thing exists in the US for them to go to*, or
2.  It is alarming that, among black males aged 17 in the US, prisoners outnumber people who go to a thing Americans call ""college"" (and that British people call ""university"").

My problem is that #1 is either nonsensical (if you take it pretty literally) or *factually false* (if you take ""college"" to mean the American near-equivalent, which would be the last few years of high school).  My other problem is that #2 is trivially true but meaningless because in the US few people of *any* sex or ethnic group go to post-secondary education at the age of 17.

Under the capitalism we know and love? All too likely! Nearly all of those 40 people will be working full time just to get by and they will feel like they don't have the time. They mostly won't have the information. They shouldn't be like this, they should be living below their means and saving their wages and planning to invest them communally, but sadly people are irrational and victimized and foolish and marketed to and a few hundred years of capitalist production has seriously atomized social relations. Undoubtedly they *could* do it but they don't do it. Some of my free time is spent helping to educate working people on how not to screw themselves over financially, how not to end up in debt slavery, how to use their wage to their long-term benefit, how to stop buying crap they don't need. Most working people don't even have a rudimentary household budget, let alone the initiative it takes to game out revenues over a couple of years. Bourgeois parents pass those skills along to their kids, but nobody teaches these things to the working class. This sounds negative, and I don't want to condemn people for living in a society that prevents them from living up to their potential. I honestly believe that shown a path out of this consumerist nonsense people will take it, but it's not on anyone's agenda because it doesn't make anyone money, except for the individuals who figure it out and suddenly realize that saving $300 is better than buying an iPhone especially when they buy that iPhone on credit.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","It has to do with a bug in the game and the nVidia drivers, more specifically with the shaders. Hopefully this will be fixed soon, but for now playing the Windows version is the best workaround to actually play to your hardware's capability. I actually do this on the 13"" MBP on medium and get great framerates. (As a side note, Bootcamp is a nice thing to have anyway for things that come up).

There's more information [here](http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/224842575):

&gt;Right now, the Mac client is seeing some pretty major performance issues due to bugs with both the nVidia graphics drivers in 10.6.4. Snow Leopard, and a bug within Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty.
 
&gt;The Shaders, Lighting, Shadow options eat up all of the available video memory, or VRAM, very quickly. This results in the computer paging out to the standard RAM and to the Hard Drive to store the shader details, which is much slower than VRAM. This makes the game slow to a crawl. 

&gt;Blizzard, Apple, and nVidia are aware of these two issues, along with others, and are each working on fixes for their respective bugs. ","1280620950"
"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;I think taking them off the streets where they are far more exposed and putting them in shelters were violence would get you kicked out would help. Are you saying that being placed in a safe environment somehow doesn't make them less likely to die? Are you being serious here?

You can't look at the national murder rate and use it to extrapolate  that it is more dangerous to be a homeless man than a homeless woman.  Shelters for women exist because, in addition to all the issues that the homeless (regardless of gender) have to deal with, homeless women are more likely to be raped or abused.  They're also more likely to be on the streets because they're fleeing a severely abusive partner.  They are the victims of *very specific* types of crime that overwhelmingly come from men.  

Of course getting people off the streets and away from violence is a good idea, and it's a good idea regardless of gender.  My point is that a *gender specific* shelter for men is not as necessary as one for women because men do not face the same scope of problems, and because women are not the ones making the national murder rate for men so high.  

&gt;Not counting what you though I said, I never discounted anything nor claimed that the evil 'malicious she-bitch-feminists' conspiracy is responsible.
I just pointed out that men are suffering too and it is being almost completely ignored. This to me says that the entirety of society isn't constructed to give privileges to men as the patriarchy theory claims.


The issue here is that you're wrong.  I don't want to minimize the very real male suffering that goes on (e.g. male prison rape) but to use it to draw a conclusion about the entire concept of patriarchy is incredibly shaky logic.

I can't really make you believe in a concept that virtually every single competent theorist or sociologist (or academic in general, really) accepts as truth, but I do want to stress the magnitude of your error.  It's like concluding that we have racial equality in America because white people often get made fun of by black people - it's an absurd conclusion and a ridiculous denial of the many many things that people have written about race relations.  


&gt;The problem is that the same thing is not being done for men.

I agree.  I'm reminded of how unfair paternity cases can be when I drive past a ""Men's rights law center"" every day - I absolutely recognize that there are areas in which men get the short end of the stick.  We also have to register for the draft, and that kinda sucks as well.  

Ultimately, I just take exception to your denial of the idea that patriarchy plays a role in gender relations in the US.  It's just such an impossibly huge error that I'm not really sure how to address it. ","1280620950"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Not slower than the flow, but too close to the car in front of them. That's the main cause.

There were some animations I saw years back that modelled it. I'm sure it's still out there somewhere.

Anyway, what happens is when people are following too close it forces them to have exaggerated reactions to the changes in speed of the car in front of them. They will accelerate rapidly to close the gap, and they will brake rapidly to avoid hitting the car in front when it stops. This inconsistent movement then gets exaggerated by the car behind them, and the next, and next.

The way to stop the wave is to put more distance between you and the car in front so that you don't have to react directly to their speed changes. If you ever get caught in one of these waves, when you see it ahead of you make sure you have adequate distance between you and the car in front, reduce your speed *before* you arrive at the jam in an even, consistent manner, and approach the jam gradually. By the time you arrive at the jam it will possibly have eased and you won't have to stop. Your more even movements will be reflected in the car behind you, potentially ending the jam.

After seeing the animation of this technique I've tried it lots of times in real life, and g'damn it, it works. If traffic is snarled up and going stop and start, then leave a bigger gap between the car in front and make your speed changes as even and smooth as possible, and you'll be the guy who fixes it all.","1280621004"

They were a big eye-opener that really helped me find the willpower/motivation to cut back.

Sure, carbs are yummy, but really, they're just not worth it. There's plenty of other yummy food out there. Find a low-carb cookbook and start experimenting.

My daily meals now consist of eggs for breakfast, turkey or tuna, raw veggies and a piece of cheese for lunch, 4oz of milk and some nuts for an afternoon snack, and dinner is a steamed green veggie, chicken, beef, or pork, and one carb, whether that's bread, potato, or corn.

One dog came in that ate an entire 3lb box of hershey's chocolate bars. The owners didn't discover this until a few hours after the event, and it took them 30 minutes to get to the office. My mom brought him into the back yard and gave him ipecac. I wish we'd taken a picture of the aftermath.

They monitored him for 24 hours at the owner's request, but they really didn't think it necessary. The dog was fine (other than drinking massive amounts of water and throwing up again about an hour later).

I also have a friend with a very (behaviorally) strange husky-mix. After a party one of their cats knocked over a bag of reeses cups. The dog ate them all (probably around 50) - amazingly, not including the wrappers. They discovered the mess the next morning and the dog was completely fine.

I am a fan of the constitution and net neutrality - A DATA NEUTRAL INTERNET - is well in line not only with how the internet was created but also in line with the 1st amendment. It reinforces our rights.. not takes them away. There is a difference.

Drawing on your imprisonment idea... do you know how big the private prison industry is in America?

""Judges Plead Guilty in Scheme to Jail Youths for Profit""

Think about the amount of money being made by existing well established companies who have the money and resources to lobby and influence the government (as well as you ore me via advertising and misinformation) to keep their policies the same for their profit. While the prison industry in my opinion is not a great example it is an example that shows what industries will do to try to influence government for profit. 

Passing legislation with the concepts of net neutrality in it will prevent companies from stifling free speech,  and information on the internet. The battle isn't over once its passed.. we need to keep standing up for our rights.. I'm sure there will be attempts to weaken the bill both before (maybe even by passing a bill named net neutrality but really allowing corporations to do what they want) and after its passed by repealing or weakening its provisions.","1280621147"

I'm currently getting all the tackling skills to IV so I can quickly get points on enemy ships and avoid getting popped; I've been improving! I didn't lose my frigate the last fleet op which saw a lot of action.

From here I'll be training for a Drake. Very inexpensive. Requires a small skill set to function, can serve as heavy tackle, functions great for ratting or mission running and you wont be a primary target in fleet ops unless the opponent knows what their doing. As a Goonie recently wrote, it's EvE's ""miracle ship"". The ship seems to be very forgiving and a great platform to learn EvE's mechanics from.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It is just a technical matter, the Obama administration says: We just need to make a slight change in a law to make clear that we have the right to see the names of anyone’s e-mail correspondents and their Web browsing history without the messy complication of asking a judge for permission.

It is far more than a technical change. The administration’s request, reported Thursday in The Washington Post, is an unnecessary and disappointing step backward toward more intrusive surveillance from a president who promised something very different during the 2008 campaign.

In a 1993 update to the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, Congress said that Internet service providers have to turn over to the F.B.I., on request, “electronic communication transactional records.” The government says this includes the e-mail records of their subscribers, specifically the addresses to which e-mail messages were sent, and the times and dates. (The content of the messages can remain private.) It may also include Web browsing records. To get this information, the F.B.I. simply has to ask for it in the form of a national security letter, which is an administrative request that does not require a judge’s signature. 

But there was an inconsistency in the writing of the 1993 law. One section said that Internet providers had to turn over this information, but the next section, which specified what the F.B.I. could request, left out electronic communication records. In 2008, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion saying this discrepancy meant the F.B.I. could no longer ask for the information. Many Internet providers stopped turning it over. Now the Obama administration has asked Congress to make clear that the F.B.I. can ask for it.

These national security letters are the same vehicles that the Bush administration used after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to demand that libraries turn over the names of books that people had checked out. The F.B.I. used these letters hundreds of thousands of times to demand records of phone calls and other communications, and the Pentagon used them to get records from banks and consumer credit agencies. Internal investigations of both agencies found widespread misuse of the power, and little oversight into how it was wielded. 

President Obama campaigned for office on an explicit promise to rein in these abuses. “There is no reason we cannot fight terrorism while maintaining our civil liberties,” his campaign wrote in a 2008 position paper. “As president, Barack Obama would revisit the Patriot Act to ensure that there is real and robust oversight of tools like National Security Letters, sneak-and-peek searches, and the use of the material witness provision.” Combined with his recent sex scandal, liberals are not amused.

Where is the “robust oversight” that voters were promised? Earlier this year, the administration successfully pushed for crucial provisions of the Patriot Act to be renewed for another year without changing a word. Voters had every right to expect the president would roll back authority that had been clearly abused, like national security letters. But instead of implementing reasonable civil liberties protections, like taking requests for e-mail surveillance before a judge, the administration is proposing changes to the law that would allow huge numbers of new electronic communications to be examined with no judicial oversight. 

Democrats in Congress can remind Mr. Obama of his campaign promises by refusing this request.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Well, here's the thing:

You have $100 to spend, but that ain't much in the bike world.  Cancel out anything new, because anything for that amount will be garbage.

Next, get a rough ballpark of your size.  .I am 5'11'' / 180 cm.  I ride a 19"" - 20"" mt. bike and a 57cm road bike.  Buying anything too small or large for you would be a waste. That should narrow you down. You want to have enough stand over height to save your parts yet not so short it's uncomfortable to ride.  Post your size, etc.

Brands such as RoadMaster, Columbia, NEXT, Murray, Mongoose, or anything you find in a department store shouldn't be purchased used. They're bad enough when they're new, but they're basically disposable bikes to begin with. Don't waste money on cheap bikes with cheap front suspension.

Steel bikes may present more value. (Long story...)  Fuji Sports 10 / 12 : Raleigh Grande Prix  :  Old Motebecanes :  Steel Treks, etc.  There are a LOT of these bikes out there.  I would actually recommend advertising your need and price to your local network of friends, and someone may have just what you need sitting in their basement / attic.

If you will be riding in an urban / reasonably flat area, don't rule out a single speed that has one chain ring in the front, one gear in the back,  and no derailleurs. I recently built one up for a customer from [SE Racing](http://www.sebikes.com/Singlespeed.aspx) that was a good example -- new for well less that $300, but there's a a bunch of companies out there doing the same thing.  

BUT, a [fixed gear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_gear) is quite different from a single speed because you can't COAST without your feet moving like hell to keep up with the pedals. Don't be fooled into buying a fixed gear if you're not prepared.

Good luck . Bikes rock.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Your arguments are becoming circular.  For instance, 
&gt;The Republican party platform calls for no exception even to save the life of the mother, even when the fetus can't be saved. That makes it pretty clear what the agenda is.  This would hardly have gotten in the platform--and remained there for 14 years and counting--if it weren't a mainstream opinion.

First off, it it were a **mainstream** opinion, abortion would be illegal.  Secondly, the Republicans have proven they're only interested in having the plank for show, so it doesn't matter what it says.  Thirdly, just like the Democrats appealed to the far-left fringe of the party to win the Presidency in 2008, the Republicans use things like this to appeal to the far-right fringe.  But, as Obama has shown recently (where's the public option for health care?) and the Republicans have shown in the past, what's said to win an election means nothing after the election is over.
&gt;You don't consider trying to pass a Constitutional amendment that would *require* the deaths of innocent women for no reason other than the right wing's emotional gratification to have anything to do with ""dismantling freedoms.""?

If that's what I thought was actually going to happen, then I would agree.  But there's no way that a) such an amendment is going to be brought up for ratification at this point and b) such an amendment would have a chance of passage *unless* there was an exception for the health of the mother.

&gt;Yet you still refer to these people as ""Pro-life"" and make excuses for them.

As I've said, I don't like the term ""anti-choice"", and if you go back and read the thread, I don't think I've made excuses for them.  I may have explained what I see as their position, but I've made pretty clear that I don't agree with a lot of it, so I think this accusation is baseless.

&gt;At what point? Are you talking about viability?

Nope, I'm talking about the moment of conception.  However, for what it's worth, the Bible mentions there's no life until the mother can feel the baby move, so you could make a case that the Bible would allow for pre-emptive abortions (not that I would, but still...).

&gt;Exactly! The politicians don't want it, because they don't want blood on their hands. But it would be political suicide for them to take it out of the platform, because it's what the right wing voter wants.

See the above point about exclusions.  I don't think I've proven your point about the ""huge popular demand"", because I don't think it exists, and you haven't proven that it does, except by saying that because of the way the Republican platform reads it proves that there's a big demand that women be allowed to die.

&gt;And you can always find a dishonest apologist who claims that a woman's life is never in danger, even when she dies.

Maybe, but no matter what the apologists say, the abortion will have been done.  As I've said before, to some fanatics there should be no exceptions and therefore, no thought is necessary, but to most of us there is some thought involved.  I wouldn't think that you could have a law restricting abortion *without* an exception for the life of the mother, but then, I'm not a fanatic.

&gt;The right to exist is a pretty basic freedom.

Yep - that's why I'm against abortion, at least when it's used as retroactive birth control.  Most abortions are not necessary to save the mother's life or health, and those are the ones I'm against.  Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that women shouldn't have control of their bodies, but they have control when deciding to have sex, and especially when deciding to have unprotected sex.  After that, if they get pregnant they should not be aborting what is another human being.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","exercise and eating right is generally the right recepie for weight loss but it takes a long time - like 1-2 pounds per week.  So if you wanna do it the healthy way its also going to be the 'slowly but surely' way.

I had a sleep disorder as an undergraduate that cost me a year and a half of school and made me gain 45 pounds because it torpedoed my metabolism.  I lost it over about 6 or 9 months and am now back to my size 2/4 self. 

the first thing you need to do is find an online site that will calculate the number of calories you need per day based on your Basic Metabolic Rate.  Its easy to find a site like this.  They will tell you how many calories you need per day if you want to loose weight.  Also once you reach your goal weight, you can then use the site to calculate how much calories you need to mantain your current weight.

Once you figure the above out, eat and exercise accordingly.  I use workout videos to work out with.  I find that I am not one of those ppl who like working out so I need variety.  You can get a variety of pretty intense workout videos now.  I don't like the gym because I need instruction and direction, and plus I feel like I waste time getting in the car and then driving there and back etc.

Also buy cookbooks made for low fat or low calorie recepies.  Diabetic or heart healthy cookbooks are also very good.

You should absolutely eat a good breakfast!  Whats PB crunch?  It sounds sugary.  I eat a smoothie with a bananna, blueberries, skim milk, lowfat plain yogurt, and vanilla extract.  Also I have  some high fiber cereal and a glass of OJ.  I get that uber high fiber stuff that has like 1/2 the daily dose of fiber per 1/2 cup and tastes like cardboard.  Trust me it is worth it because (assuming you drink atleast 6 cups of fluid per day) it will keep your system moving and decrease the bloat!!  If you can't stand the taste do what I do and add 1/2 a cup or a whole cup if you are extra hungary, of healthyish but better tasting cereal to the mix and then top with a sliced bananna or some strawberries or blueberries or something.

take a look at the Canadian Food Guide for an idea of what types of food u should be consuming and in what percentages. I think your diet needs some fruits an veggies.  Even eating some V-8 juice would be a good start.

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","What I mean is, in an ideal world, the effects of the practice should be given, not blindly followed.  I think from a beginners perspective, a lot of the times the conclusions of the practice are not framed in the correct way to make sense.  For example: Chakra's are a real occurrence, at some stages you can feel a sort of energy flowing through different locations of your body.  However, how it's framed in many traditions implies that those things are there for some other reason, happen because you're energy is blocked up, or that they mean a certain thing.  But what's not imparted is that conclusion is reached by way of introspection using a specific technique, it's generally not something found if you don't practice that technique, nor are many of the explanatory theories very good at explaining the phenomenon or what happens.  The reasons behind the phenomenon is usually wildly out of touch, whereas the actual occurrence of the phenomenon is still valid.  

However, the practice itself will most likely change what you think about things.  ","1280621230"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was at a party and it was pretty late so my friend and I decided to go home. As I was leaving, a guy who lived in the house came up to me and accused me of bringing my own private stock of their beers home with me. I'm standing there in a tiny little dress with a too small handbag hanging off my wrist. There's no place where I could possibly hide said beers, unless he thinks I'm hiding them in my cooter. 

I'm very non-confrontational so I say ""No, don't worry, I don't have anything,"" and I turn to go out the door. Easier said than done. This massive guy doesn't believe me, so he grabs me by the arm and spins me around so I'm facing him (I had to look up about a foot or so, I'm talking about a BIG guy). He asks me if I have any beers and I look down at myself again asserting that there is no where in my tiny dress and handbag to put them, and say ""No, let me leave."" This asshole shoves me full force into the corner of the doorframe and I hit my head. I'm not very big, I weigh about 115 and this guy had to be over 200 pounds. At that point his friends come over and start freaking out at him. I'm standing there stunned as this guy is looming over me like he wants to kick my ass. The only thing I can think to do is to knock his beer out of his hand... not much with self defense, I guess. Frighteningly enough, the beer lands on his cell phone. At that point, I see a terrifying rage come over his face. I run away because I'm seriously fearing for my life at this point.

Relieved that its over, my friend and I start walking back to my apartment. As we're walking I can hear swift foot steps, I look to my left and I see the guy running full sprint through someone's yard at me. Obviously I'm scared because it appears as if he's coming for me... or has some other reason to be running really fast, I don't really know. Luckily, it was dark out and the people whose yard it was had lined their the front yard with wooden poles connected by chains about a foot high. As the guy is full on sprinting he trips over the chain and high velocity face plants into the sidewalk right at my feet. I had a good chuckle and continued walking home.","1280621305"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","On the way to high school one morning year, I saw a car that had been speeding, swerved to miss something in the road and lost control. It slammed head-first into a tree at full speed, and got thrown back across the street in a flat spin, hit in a ditch (in someone's yard), and rolled a few times. 

The driver was in my senior class (didn't know 'em), and was in the hospital for months. The passenger didn't make it, which I could clearly tell when I drove by.

I drove by about 3 minutes after the event, the entire yard was already full of cars, friends/family who saw the car. 

I told a friend of mine what I saw (didn't recognize the car) when I got to school, it turns out he was good friends with the one who didn't make it. ","1280621328"

In other words, the CEO who makes a salary of $1M a year also has investments, stocks, etc, that make him an additional $5M a year.  He pays big on the $1M, but probably pays less on the $5M.

"racism","t5_2qhgd","I noticed you just did, and I personally tend to point out examples of vegans drawing these parallels, and not vegetarians, and I think this is salient. Vegetarians are all over the world, including third-world nations and former colonies, and are usually (number-wise) a result of religion and/or culture. On the other hand, vegan is a lifestyle *choice* that for the most part, tends to be taken by Western white non-improverished in certain geographic markets that can sustain the lifestyle. It's no wonder white and class privilege have a tendency to show up in the arguments.

&gt;And women are raped, ergo dairy cows are raped.

Yeah, there's [this article from 2005](http://www.satyamag.com/jan05/matthews.html) making the rounds in some feminist spaces that equates human reproduction with animal reproduction, written by a woman. The term ""rape rack"" is taken as an affront to cows, where the real argument isn't that animals are being ""raped"", it's that humans are being devalued to the level of animals who are incapable of giving consent. *Sigh...*

I don't follow Dan Savage that much, but I'm amazed he would say that in 2009 after [Nate Silver thoroughly debunked that myth in 2008](http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/11/prop-8-myths.html).

The key point about the broken windows fallacy is that something of value was *destroyed*, so the end result was, as the baker said - we could've had the same economic stimulus, and my window, *plus a suit*, but we've lost that suit.  Next this video tries to pretend that spending on public works is the same thing, except that public works actually *creates something of value*.

Now, I know that the hyperconservalibertarian majority here on reddit loves to deny reality and claim that economic stimulus doesn't work, but that's not my point here.  I'm not trying to refute it, so don't try to convince me that it's a bad thing or doesn't work.  That's not the debate I am trying to make, it's a distracting tangent.  The point is this: Whatever you do or don't like about economic stimulus, it is fundamentally a different thing than the hooligan &amp; baker analogy.  If it's bad, it's bad for a different reason.

Anyway, I if/when you do speak to her about it it's extremely important to speak only of yourself and never refer to her or her actions as if they were wrong in any way, and try not to refer to her actions at all (I'm referring to this case, in others it might be okay to refer to her actions as wrong in my book).

WRONG: You spent the night at a guy friend's house and it made me have bad feelings.

RIGHT: I found that I was having some unexpected bad feelings about this past weekend.  I've been hurt in the past and I feel those things come back to me.  I realize I said I was okay with it and that was true when I said it.  When the weekend came, I realized I was not okay with the situation I found myself in.  I found my boundaries...

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; _Not slower than the flow, but too close to the car in front of them. That's the main cause._

Yes, slower than the flow. Slower traffic causes people behind them to slow down and merge left to pass. This slows down traffic in both lanes. From overhead you can watch a rolling ""bubble"" of traffic surrounding a slow vehicle. If the traffic is dense it can set off a massive standing wave.

&gt; _The way to stop the wave is to put more distance between you and the car in front so that you don't have to react directly to their speed changes._

This assumes that everyone is traveling at the same rate. If they aren't, following at a certain distance doesn't work. In those cases you're supposed to pass on the left, but in heavy traffic there's usually either a righteous prick driving too slow in the left lane, or so many cars that you can't get over before you have to slow down. Once you slow down, the same thing happens to the guy behind you and thus the wave begins.

I'm fascinated by the fact that left lane campers want to slow down people they perceive as going too fast on the one hand, but on the other hand don't seem to want to own up to their responsibility for impeding traffic flow (slowing people down).

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","You seem like you might still be depressed, and this is the thing you need to deal with first and fully work through, so that you can find and be in a relationship that is secure and satisfying for you and that won't become a co-dependent scenario (because when you're depressed and being with a certain person makes you happy, you do end up being dependent on them rather than able to confidently be happy in your own life and enjoy sharing that with another person).

Therapy is not necessarily for everyone, but seeing one doctor and not connecting doesn't mean you should give up. There are a wide variety of methods, and I personally recommend cognitive therapy. Practicing good methods of thinking vs. negative hurtful ones is a tremendous skill to learn. There's a number of cognitive worksheets available online; I suggest you try them and if you like where they're going, look for a doc who specializes in cognitive. 

You're doubting yourself now because you're depressed. Don't focus on self-doubt and worrying that you'll hurt someone else. You are a thoughtful creature. You thought it through and you left her, and that took guts. Of course you miss her, you spent years in a relationship with her. It's only natural to miss her and to see her doing well without you to be upsetting. It's okay to feel these things. It's normal. You know that you have a lot of work to do figuring out who you are, and it's normal for that to be intimidating. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and you will get there. It's okay for it to suck right now being where you are. But it will get better slowly (having recovered from depression myself, I'll say it's going to feel like the slowest thing in the entire goddamn world). But you get there eventually. And hopefully, when you get there, you'll have learned alot  about yourself. And those things will take you to new and interesting places and people that you can't even imagine right now. 

tl;dr It's okay to feel depressed. Try cognitive therapy. ","1280621468"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; TL:DR - we mock Christians for evangelicalism, in being evangelical about our atheism how are we any better.

Mockery is hardly evangelizing. Pointing out serious factual problems with religious claims isn't evangelizing, either.

I think that the impression you have of atheism has been negatively influenced by /r/atheism. I say that because the front page content of /r/atheism seems like it's usually **50% crap**. If you think that the content posted to /r/atheism is representative of most atheists, I can understand being a bit worried.

First:

* **The downvote button is not the disagree button** (Thanks for that one, [painordelight](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/cvu6g/has_anyone_else_ever_questioned_if_we_are_as_bad/c0vobt7).)
* **I'm saying this because I want /r/atheism to have better content.**

So, what do I mean by **crap**?

* As I post this, the top two submissions on /r/atheism are a re-re-re-repost of the Popemobile and a picture of a goddamn chicken sandwich.
* Story number 5 is a Hitler quote. Yes, we know that Hitler believed in some kind of weird-ass nazified form of Christianity. (Well, most of us do--more on that later.)
* Story number seven is a re-re-re-post of the classic ""who killed more people in the bible"" bar chart. (Spoiler: God wins.)
* Further down, there are two more image submissions in reply to the chicken sandwich. One is witty, one is not. Neither are actually interesting or capable of holding my attention for more than a second.
* There's a post about how ID's deliberate vagueness leaves it open to some very, very silly interpretations. I appreciate the effort, but it's old news.
* Next we have the ""Christian tramp stamp."" It's amusing, as are most stupid tattoos, but could we keep this stuff in /r/wtf? The *only* reason it got posted here was because it's a tattoo of a bible verse.
* Following that, Stupid Christian Facebook Posts: Episode MCXVII.
* Finally, we've got another ""LOL at this dumb Christian"" submission, courtesy of the website Clients From Hell.

Halfway down the page, I lost interest in reading any more submissions because the signal-to-noise ratio is so awful.

In my opinion, /r/atheism needs:

* Fewer image posts. Please. I've seen them all several times now. 
* Fewer ""LOL what a dumbass"" posts. I'm no longer amused by the run-of-the-mill dumbassery that is the subject of most of these posts.
* More *real news* that's of interest to atheists. E.g., news about court cases focusing on religious freedom (and freedom from religion), atheists running for public office, etc.
* More lengthy, thought-provoking submissions. There's too much intellectual ""junk food"" here.
* An archive for image posts, which would provide hours of entertainment for newbies and (hopefully) reduce the number of re-re-re-posted images.
* A FAQ for new atheist readers, with links to recommended reading material and a list of commonly re-re-re-posted submissions (""ZOMG, Hitler was a Christian!"", etc.) I'm recommending a new, second FAQ because the current FAQ seems to be written for theists rather than atheists.

That's my rant and those are my suggestions. It may seem tangential to the original post, but I'm pretty sure that we would see fewer concern posts like this if the content of /r/atheism wasn't so spotty. (Which would also enhance the quality of the /r/atheism front page.)","1280621520"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A lot of security is, frankly, security theater. Like the TSA employees at the airport, they make you feel safer than you actually are. Of course, in this case, the security theater is put on for more than just yourself. Thieves are looking for several key things when deciding which house to rob, and ensuring yours looks like a pain, they'll pick someone else. Don't feel bad, they're going to rob somebody, so better them than you, right? I know that sounds cruel, but getting yourself robbed hoping to save someone else the trouble is just stupid.

I'd change the locks, if only because new locks will likely be more difficult to brute-force your way through, and who knows who has a copy of the key now. It will also give you some piece of mind. While you're at it, make sure your house is easily visible to the neighbors (thieves love having cover) and if possible, get shatter-resistant glass windows. Go for an alarm. Whether it calls the cops or not is irrelevant, just get one that's loud. A lot of thieves will run when an alarm goes off.

The point of security is not to make your home a maximum security prison, or an impenetrable fortress, it's to make your home as undesirable a target as possible, and to ward off anyone dumb enough to try. You'll deter pretty much every low-level thief with a few easy to see security measures, and can catch most medium level thieves who will try to use brute force to get in. A higher level criminal probably won't care as much, but I doubt they'll target you unless you give them a reason to.","1280621562"

Or completely bypass the Robo and get a Stargate instead. Experiment with the Graviton beam on Phoenixes (tanks are especially yummy for those guys).

Assuming that there is a special set of doors and alleyways which warp time and space sufficiently to create a path you can traverse, this makes imagining time travel paradoxes simpler than imagining time-teleportation.","1280621612"

I once wrote and directed a movie.  It was a sort of mockumentary, and as such, we did a lot of improvisation.  In fact, several scenes were specifically written to be improvised.  After it was done and edited, I decided to go through it and see what percentage of the finished product ws scripted, and what percentage was ad-libbed.  I went through each scene and said:  That's moving the story forward or the actors seem to be reading lines - it's scripted.  Or:  The dialogue's too natural and fluid or that joke's too on-the-spot, I can't write that well, it has to be improvised...

A year later, I stumbled across a copy of the shooting script - and was shocked to discover that I had actually written many of the scenes I thought were improvised.  Scenes I thought actors were ad-libbing with wild abandon, were actually word-for-word out of the script.  My writing and the performances were so good that I actually fooled myself!

This can occur in several ways.  First, the border issues that were already discussed within the comments will play a factor.  The obtaining of information across country lines will undoubtedly make it inherently more difficult for a government organization to obtain data related to the connection.  Additionally, several proxy servers are anonymous in regard to logging.  If you travel through a server that does not log connection information or removes such information on a frequent basis it will effectively remove any traces of you ""bouncing"" through it.  On a third note, proxy servers will identify you as coming from the last server hop which will help in avoiding any scripting on a specific website that might harvest this type of information.  For example, try accessing a site that redirects based upon geographic location using tor.  You may end up at the co.uk version of the site if your final hop is through a European country.","1280621671"

The best tips I can give you are make friends with your RA (This is KEY, I got away with so much shit freshman after my RA did shots with us). If you are a drinker, hide your alcohol well and if a dorm party is getting loud, you are better off just leaving. Learn the subway, it will be your best friend. Always look like you know what you are doing, people are less likely to get mugged if you look like you know what you are doing.

I had to start doing a majority of my studying and homework either at the library, a small cafe that I visit regularly, or anywhere more public than my house. 

I think that I didn't mind getting distracted or putting stuff off at home because there wasn't this social expectation that I should be getting work done while I am studying.

&gt;The joint cannot be cracked again until the gases have dissolved back into the synovial fluid, which explains why you cannot crack the same knuckle repeatedly.

I tend to crack the joints in my fingers three ways. Flexing them backward, usually to pop the ""first"" joint (closest to the hand); compressing my fingers inward toward the palm in a ""U"" shape to crack either of the next two joints; and by (essentially) bending my finger sideways at the joint to pop the middle one (something I've not seen anyone else do but always made perfect sense to me).

Oftentimes, I can pop my knuckles any one way, and almost immediately pop the same one in a different way. In fact, I've cracked the same joint on one finger 4 times while typing this, not including the compulsive cracking I did while reading the article.

on the other hand it would be incredibly fun to troll all these ""kids"" to pass the time, once you hit that age where girls grow up, getting some action wouldn't be out of the question but not being able to have a relationship of real value for years might make it a very lonely time. 

2 things i would do would be 1) to start my long term investments and do what ever it takes to convince the parental units to help out. EX; get the IRA rolling you would get it to the point where you can leave it grow till retirement by the time ""time has caught up"" and 2) get the real education out of the way I wouldn't want to leave the social environment as there are so many life lessons that it would be a fun experiment to go ""to school"" but start college and racking up credit hours so that i can sell my self easier to any future employer.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Gotta disagree on that one. There is no ration to fear. Fear is when rationality breaks down.  Even if you face your own morality you have the choice to fear or accept it. 

You've already stated that the feeling you get is more than just a threat of his presence. It's memories of the way you've treated him and the feelings attached to it. 

Fear triggers when there is so much emotion it affects your ability to calmly assess the situation. You become overwhelmed by the multiple thoughts connected to one moment and your body falls into panic mode. You can tell yourself to calm down but unless you face the emotion head on fear will have power over you. 

This isn't just any type of fear. It's intimidation. There is someone else who wants to keep you fearful. You need a purpose. When you do things you need to know why your doing them. 

Who you are must be stronger than what you fear. 

I'm going to put it frankly. You can't be a bitch about this. You have to stand up and do what needs to be done. Being afraid doesn't do you any good. In fact if you were in front of me and you asked for a ""hug"" or ""cheering up"" I wouldn't give it to you. I might actually slap you across the face because that's what you need right now. 

Every time you avoid a place he may be It's not protecting you, it's destroying you. You need to be wherever it is you need to be regardless if he is there or not. Life is full of intimidation and you can't let it control your life. You have to be strong on your own. 

That panicky feeling will not go away unless you confront the things you are afraid of and grow stronger from them. You have to build a resistance to the things you fear. There are emotions deep within you that will not reach a calm unless you allow yourself to feel and grow past them.

The point where you really have to adapt to your opponent comes if the initial push doesn't end the game anyway. If your opponent one-bases for an early push himself, your expansion might be risky. 

If you look for variation because you want to try something different, maybe try early charge into HT. I was gold/silver in the beta with the old leagues (lowest was copper, platinum highest), and I found a HT build to be a lot of fun, but harder to pull off. 

If you want to be a better player in the future, don't worry about builds too much, concentrate on mechanics. To me, just building more probes was key. I made loads of mistakes, but I was allowed to when the opponent had 2/3 of my income :). Mechanichs will stay with you, the viability of a certain build changes. If you want to be a better player now, concentrate on one build. You will get to know your build faster this way. How to adapt against Muta/ling, when to get a third expo, polishing your early build order etc.","1280621924"

Peter Pocklington is one of the most-reviled men in Edmonton because he sold Wayne Gretzky to Los Angeles and fucked around threatening to move the team. He also owned a meat-packing plant that was the site of a particularly nasty strike.

A couple years ago, some friends and I were out partying at a bar downtown, and who walks in but Puck, who was in town after being subpoenad. This was right after the smoking bylaw came into effect and he was making a big pissy pants stink about not being able to smoke on the patio.

It seemed like a good idea, because we were all quite drunk, but we hatched a plan that I would piss on him from the sidewalk. I walked up to a tree opposite him and pulled out my wang, when suddenly a tinted window rolled down and a big ugly man told me to ""get the fuck out of here.""

That pretty much nixed the peeing on idea, but I didn't end up walking away empty handed, so I whipped out my nuts in my best flies eyes pose and said ""Sell this to Los Angeles, you motherfucker!"" then ran away from his bodyguard through the dirty back alleys of downtown Edmonton.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The problem is that a lot of the motivations for going to these things is social. They already had a funeral, special masses are a completely different affair and they have had them for over a month. When the main reason to go somewhere is to show that you are going there, it becomes a little silly. And it also influences the motivations for why people want you there in the first place, so you probably end up with stupid reasons like ""it would be embarrassing to someone if you didn't show up"". Doing it for the image of atheists is up there too, although I know you just tossed that in at the end and aren't saying they should rethink their involvement in the good atheist campaign.

Supporting people is fine. If you care about them enough to warrant it you'll come up with a way to do it. But there is a difference between showing support and following a rigid guideline society has set up for you to officially show support that leads to admonition for not playing along. When it becomes part of a show, it's worth stepping back and not participating. If people will not like your decision there it only means that people will have learned that you do things they don't like; sometimes that's better than tricking them into thinking that's not the case. And hopefully people who do step back like this from time to time don't join in the masses that shake their heads disappointingly when someone else decides to do so in different circumstances.

I'm 6'6"" and the R1 is an excellent choice for a tall person, ergonomically speaking.  It's one of the few sportbikes I fit on comfortably.  Other good options, the CBR600 F4I, Triumph Daytona 675.  I'm thinking.....

I really liked the Triumph Tiger 1050 and it's also very comfortable for a tall man.  Not a full on sportbike, but it does a good impression of one.  

If I remember any others I was very impressed with I'll let you know.  FYI I have taken several test rides on all of the bikes I mentioned here, and found each to be good.  Not ""comfortable"" compared to your Transalp (or my KLR or KTM) but good.  A trade I'm quite happy to make for the performance.. 

Edit:  Note that I said CBR600 **F4I** and not any other model.  CBR ""F's"" are generally roomier than the RR's or anything else.  I also ride a [CBR1000F](http://img525.imageshack.us/img525/6707/p101000431.jpg), which is an older model that was discontinued in the 90's, and it's vastly more roomy than a modern CBR1000RR.  The RR wins in every other specification possible though!

Edit #2:  Where do you live and what are you going to do with the Transalp?  I've always wanted one... Sort of rare in the US though.  

Edit #3:  BMW S1000RR. Never ridden one, but I have sat on it several times.  As roomy as the R1.

Nothing like having prince charming sweep you (average loser girl with everything going wrong in her life) off your feet, making everything better and treating you like a princess.

Also, porn is awesome. I don't expect girls to fuck their best girlfriends or get gang banged by my friends. So I really don't see the problem.

*edit* 

And to be honest, I think porn has done more for women than for men. I mean yea I masturbate to it, but since when have men worried about pleasuring women, their needs and giving them oral sex?

"AltHealth","t5_2ryoo","Good question. Thanks for asking. I'll explain by way of example, since I'm having trouble writing down my heuristic.

By ""disconnected from reality"" I mean things like [Breatharianism](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Inedia). There are people scattered around the world who claim they can survive on just air and sunlight, maybe also requiring water. However, none of them have ever been able to demonstrate this with an observer present, and many have in fact been caught smuggling food! People who are convinced to try it are at risk of nutrient deficiency or dehydration.

Homeopathy, on the other hand... I find the basic principles unsound, even ridiculous. However, I know people who swear that it has worked for them, even for their pets. It's relatively inexpensive and, since I believe it works via placebo effect, entirely safe. For all I know, there may even be something to it—I just can't see a mechanism.

As for how informed I am, I can only say that I have a decent grounding in biology, genetics, human anatomy and physiology, chemistry, and botany. I'm pretty well aware of my limits within those fields.

These are all ways something can be grounded in reality:

* Reductionist study [1]
* Theoretical support (computer models, thought experiments, etc.) by Western science
* Personal experience [1]
* Acquaintance's experience [1]
* Traditional beliefs
* Mainstream beliefs

There are dangers associated with relying on each of those. The first two often use reductionist approaches that can dangerously simplify living systems. The middle two are subject to confirmation bias, low repeatability, and other noise-inducing factors. Finally, the last two are suspect because they are rarely challenged, leading to hilarious prevailing beliefs like [fan death](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fan_death).

When we were kids we got three chickens - Milo (after the chocolate drink), Lofty (lords knows) and Cheep Cheep.  Cheep Cheep died, but the others lived for many years spawning many babies. Each time there was a new batch of chickens, one was christened Cheep Cheep. This one, inexplicably, always died. The application of this 'curse' became like some bizarre and horrid ritual in our perverted child-minds. Which shall be the chosen sacrifice this time?  Mother eventually ruined the game by suggesting we just eschew Cheep Cheep as a name altogether. Stupid Mother.

So, what was my point? Oh yeah, Cheep Cheep is a very dumb name. Most of our other pets had biblical names relating to their circumstances (Moses the cat found on the side of the road; Lazarus the chicken found half-dead in a rubbish heap of dead chickens).","1280622043"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I worked in a polling station once (in Canada) and here are two tips to get you through the line faster:  
  
* If at all possible show up during normal business hours.  It's semi-busy first thing in the morning, deserted from 9-4:30, and a complete zoo from 4:30 until the polls close.  Personally I think every employer should be required, by law, to allow their employees an hour break to go and vote.  
* You know the card they mail you leading up to the election?  Bring that with you when you go to vote!  It has all the information the people at the polling station need (your address, riding, etc.).  If you have that all they need to do is check your ID, if not they have to look everything up.  If you go when it's deserted it's not a big deal but if there are 50 other people there who don't know their information you're looking at a considerable wait.  
  
BTW this topic is completely accurate.  From my anecdotal experience seniors probably made up 50% of all voters at my station (and probably 80% of those who voted during the hours of 9-5)...seniors do NOT represent half of the population!","1280622044"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt;I'm not that assertive, does that mean I can't expect a fulfilling relationship?

Not necessarily, but it does make it quite difficult to keep yourself happy longterm. In addition to that, part of being a 'challenge' is  being assertive - knowing what you like, who you are, what you want out of a relationship and life, and refusing to accept anything less than what you want is a challenge for suitors - they've now been tasked with attempting to get you to accept something other than your standard (always set the 'ideal' bar in your head too high, let them convince you why they're worth your time, effort, and compromise).


&gt;If I want a relationship am I just supposed to randomly pick times to argue, be disagreeable and rude to a girl just to be ""a challenge"" or is there some way I can be nice and be a challenge?


Arguing with a woman does not make one a challenge, it makes one annoying. Flirty aloofness is far more effective in the longrun, a simple 'devil may care, I'm doing my thing whether you're with me or not' attitude will get you a lot farther, make you harder to pin down. Part of being in a relationship is learning how to give and take - if all you ever do is give (being a doormat) there is no challenge, there is no balance - you're nothing more than a slave to her whims, and that bores a lot of people. Demonstrate confidence in yourself by unapologetically pursuing what *you* want out of a relationship (and life in general), rather than constantly kowtowing to the other party's whims and desires - your heart is the prize, let them figure out how to get it, and don't lose yourself in the process.","1280622082"

I cancelled the account with a credit balance of $200+ dollars on it.  They continued to bill me until my credit balance was exhausted and then for another 2 months.  This is after I cancelled the service and was not getting service.  I then proceeded to fight with them for 3 years only demanding that I not be charged the two months after my credit balance had run out.  They finally admitted what they did and credited me the amount owed.  I was free and clear at this time.  I called to establish new service with DirecTV.  Their technician did not show.  I called and they said it was due to an outstanding balance that I had.  I explained that this had been cleared up and they said yes and this was confirmed by 2 emails to me from DirecTV.  So I called again and ordered service.  Same thing happens, no show and they said they stopped it because of my outstanding balance.  I said OK, forget it then.  I open my credit card statement and they charged me for 2 installations and equipment.  I called them and they said that they had already turned this amount into collections even though it had been paid and I received nothing from them.

German people IN GENERAL had no problems with the Jews...until the Nazi propaganda machine told them other wise.  Germany was actually the BEST country for Jews until 1933 rolled around.  Russia was deemed the worst up until then.  And your connection between US camps for Japanese citizens and the Nazi concentration camps for Jews is way off base.  Spies for the Japanese were all over the country.  We were, after all, AT WAR with them after they declared war on us with Pearl Harbor.  When did the Jews attack Germany again?  Oh yeah, they didn't.  How many Japanese people did we perform outrageous medical experiments on?  None.  How many Japanese people did we work to death?  None.  How many Japanese people did we gas to death, shoot to death, march to death, send death squads to seek them out?  How many?

Even without the Holocaust, there is still PLENTY of reasons to declare war on Germany, and PLENTY of reasons why the war was just.  For starters, GERMANY FUCKING INVADED THE SOVEREIGN NATION OF POLAND.  And then invaded and conquered France, a known Allie to Britain and the United States.  Then when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, Germany, for some strange and frankly, stupid reason, declared war on the United States.

Your argument is flawed in so many ways, and your logic is laced with stupidity.  ""Let's declare war on Germany so Eisenhower can get elected"" is basically what you sound like.  They declared war, they got beat.  Deal with it.  They killed mass amounts of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and other races. Deal with it.  There's a reason why the population of Jews suddenly DIPS during this time frame.  They didn't all just magically ride a German rocket to Mars.","1280622112"

Those contracts that the major auto makers have with the ruling oil companies are punitive to the point of forfeiture of all property to the oil companies. Back in the earliest part of the twentieth century, there were about ten electric auto makers, in just twenty years, there were none. There were only four fully electric train engine manufacturers at the beginning of the twentieth century, but in just fifteen years the coal companies had bought out every last one of them and shut them down permanently. The nature of the problem is that there are solutions being held or suppressed through patent control, possession, or outright assassination. There no theories, just plots to make obscene amounts of money at the expense of humanity. Fuel cell technology and wireless transmitted electrical energy are pre-twentieth  century inventions. There has been over 110 years of practiced and proven fossil fuel technology that has not been significantly improved since Ford rolled out his mass marketed model T.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","That still only covers some of it.  For example contributions to 401k and HSA come out of pre-tax income, but with 401k you are then taxed when later withdrawing the money.

Where there is sales tax, each state, county and city (or equivalents) can have it varying by all sorts of things (eg gasoline is different than food, and food can be different for eating at a restaurant or take out).  In my city I pay 9.5% sales tax, portions of which are state, country and city.  You usually pay the sales tax based on the location of the retailer, but sometimes it is [based on where you live](http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_12036320).

And then they love to tax you on other stuff.  For example my landline has 12 surcharges and taxes.  That brings the $8.87 I am charged for the actual phone service to $15.61 total.  I count 4 federal taxes, 5 state taxes and 2 city taxes.  The remaining one plus some of the federal and state ones are rather ambiguous.  The feds and state can have various laws in place, and so the phone company then charges additional fees in order to comply with those laws.  In their words: ""This charge is assessed to offset the costs incurred to remain in compliance with state and federal regulations.""  [This page](http://www.norlight.com/inc/commonfeesandtaxes.asp) is a good example of what they can come up with.  This same kind of nonsense is present on all my bills to varying degrees.

Another example of taxes is if you stay in a hotel anywhere.  You'll find various taxes added to your bill such as occupancy, ""impact fees"" or to fund nearby stadiums.  A [Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=tourist+tax) gives a good idea.  Airline tickets also have a [variety of taxes of fees](http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/2007-04-16-air-travel-taxes_N.htm).

Perhaps the most frustrating thing is that displayed prices do not usually include all the various taxes, fees and surcharges.","1280622210"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The premise of this AMA is absolutely reprehensible and violates the most basic aspects of academic freedom.  In the title, you ask for people to act respectfully yet you act most disrespectfully by being disingenuous.  

What is the source of the behaviour of which I speak?  You imply that you are an _expert_ through your mention of having a PhD in the Natural Sciences (there is no point in mentioning that otherwise) yet you wish to remain anonymous (which you've stated in your replies).  In essence, you are saying that you are an expert but that you're not going to provide us any way of verifying that you are, indeed, an expert.  That is, we are to take it on _faith_ that you are an expert.  The irony of this is that you claim to be an expert in the Natural Sciences yet you want us to accept your authority on faith.  This petition is patently absurd and you should be ashamed of yourself for making it. 

The average person does not understand what it means to have  PhD.  By saying that you have one, particularly in a specific field of study, is taken to mean that you are an expert and your opinion has more sway than the average person (this is the whole point of your AMA).  What most people don't understand is that this is complete nonsense.  Having a PhD in an area does not make you an expert in anything outside of the topic of your dissertation.  Being an expert in a field is obtained by working in an area and subjecting your work to peer review.  Being an expert is having a reputation that is built up over years of work and service to the field, all of which is verifiable.

I've sat on numerous professorial hiring committees and I've read hundreds of CVs of applicants with PhDs.  Having a PhD is a minimal requirement but does not demonstrate your worthiness of the position.  What demonstrates your worthiness is your publication record, which you are (conveniently) unwilling to reveal.  I've rejected hundreds of PhDs simply because their publication record was not of the calibre that would be expected in the department or the university. 

tl;dr.  You cannot assert that you are an expert (explicitly or through implication) without providing evidence to support that assertion.  To do so is disingenuous.

Lately, I've been thinking about competing in it and have been taking more lessons and practicing more.  A result of that has been a little extra fat loss, so I did research on the sport and found out that Forbes had rated it the healthiest sport on the planet.  It makes you burn roughly 1000cal for every hour of aggressive play.

Would that be because of Squash's close simulation to a HIIT workout?  I mean you will find yourself sprinting towards a ball at full speed, returning back to the T, and sprinting again until the rally's over. Squash is definitely not akin to endurance sports like soccer where you might be running non-stop for 90 minutes.

Such a spirit would be the free spirit par excellence.""

I think that Steve Martin and Bill Murray are the best advocates, since they are widely known and liked, as well as being amongst the wittier, astoundingly astute comedians. Seth Rogen's humour on the other hand, whilst it has its moments of brightness, is mostly aimed at those with a keen sense of the absurd. As we know, marijuana smokers are better able to see and laugh at the absurd (think fits of ""HUHUHUH"" laughter followed by silence and then more ""HUHUHUHU""s). It is a type of humour that might go over a lot of non-smokers' heads. Finding out that Bill Murray and Steve Martin smoke might actually inspire a little thought on the matter.

In theory, Obama might have been the best amongst these, but the quote relates to the fact that he used to smoke it.. What is his current stance? Maybe I should know, but I'm not from the U.S.

They were talking about transferring me to a specialist and getting me an emergency transplant.  I had a fever of 105 that wouldn't come down even with the use of a cooling blanket.  They finally got it down to 101 but it wouldn't get any lower than that for 3 days, which meant that I had to spend 3 days in the ICU.  I had a horrible rash over my entire body and gained 40 pounds in water weight.

I'm 25 years old and I never expected to come so close to death so early in my life.  Sure, people my age die in car accidents occasionally.  But I never expected to be hospitalized for organ failure.  I freaked out once I got home because I realized just how close I was to never waking up again.  I've had some sleepless nights since then, but I know that what happened to me should never happen again now that my doctor has pulled me off all medication (I have bipolar disorder).  

Death is a part of life.  I know that I will die sooner or later; I just prefer that it be later.","1280622293"

Businesses make decisions based on net present value. If hiring a worker today has a positive net present value, they'll do it. But that calculation has a risk component.

The risk premium has gone up. Future policies are uncertain, and the government keeps signaling that the economy is not improving. If government would stop taking actions that increase future risk, then  businesses would be more willing to invest in projects that were less profitable. But higher taxes, extended unemployment benefits, low federal interest rates are all signals of increased risk.

One of the nice things about it is that because my therapist doesn't work for a practice and she doesn't take insurance she is not beholden to outside forces when determining what I might need. What I mean is that last December/January things took a considerable turn for the worse in my head. She was able to increase my regular session from 50 to 90 minutes and add a second weekly session for me. No fighting with insurance companies or trying to justify to management. She made changes based solely on what I needed at the time and I am eternally grateful for that because I'm pretty sure it saved my life.

But I can't help but think that if I hadn't had 2 years being primed about every possible flaw in our relationship (which had been wonderful and I had been truly happy in up until the point he started pressing me with doubts), I might not have been so quick to give up and abandon her.  I know I have to take responsibility for my choice, and I do... and maybe my conscious us just latching on to the 'inception' craze, but I can't help but think that my life would be very different right now had he not been in the picture.

There is no proof that Calderón is using the military to secure his political position, but there are some suspicious circumstances.

President Felipe Calderon says the drug lords are interfering with Mexico's election process. Calderon's conservative National Action Party (PAN) party won the 2000 election, but since Vicente Fox there have been several scandals and accusations of corruption.

Anybody can tell you all of the blood libel incidents throughout history, some of which did occur within Germany.  Look it up.  

&gt; Spies for the Japanese were all over the country. 

No, they weren't.  What a load of crap.  

&gt; We were, after all, AT WAR with them after they declared war on us with Pearl Harbor. When did the Jews attack Germany again?

http://hidhist.wordpress.com/war/do-freedom-of-information-act-files-prove-fdr-had-foreknowledge-of-pearl-harbor/

&gt; How many Japanese people did we gas to death, shoot to death, march to death, send death squads to seek them out? How many?

How many Jewish people do we claim they did this to?  Six million, on the dot, is the widely accepted number.  Do you know where that number comes from?  I suspect not.

&gt; Even without the Holocaust, there is still PLENTY of reasons to declare war on Germany, and PLENTY of reasons why the war was just. For starters, GERMANY FUCKING INVADED THE SOVEREIGN NATION OF POLAND. 

Some people are killed.  Your solution is to kill more people.  How many people died immediately at Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  How about Dresden?  There was one attack suffered one attack during the entire war on American soil, but Europe in its entirety was basically decimated.

&gt; Your argument is flawed in so many ways, and your logic is laced with stupidity. ""Let's declare war on Germany so Eisenhower can get elected"" is basically what you sound like. They declared war, they got beat. Deal with it. They killed mass amounts of Jews, Slavs, Gypsies, and other races. Deal with it. There's a reason why the population of Jews suddenly DIPS during this time frame. They didn't all just magically ride a German rocket to Mars.

It doesn't ""dip,"" there were massive periods of emigration.   Some post-war surveys show an almost negligible drop in population, most of it attributable to war-time starvation.

A ""none of the above"" option wins by majority if presented.  Statehood consistently comes in second.  
Because it's been upheld that the status can't change without congressional consent, the tendency for a vote for no change tends to stall out congressional action.  

The general attitude has been that only a plurality is needed by the Puerto Ricans, be it in a plebiscite or a constitutional convention.  There is currently a bill before the senate that would institute a binding vote by Puerto Rico to choose either status quo, sovereignty, or statehood, with the vote to be repeated every eight years if persistence of the status quo is chosen.  

I've probably made a few errors in my description of the situation, it's not one I've been very focused on, so don't take it as gospel.  But I do get the perception that it hasn't been unfair, and that the majority of the Puerto Rican population is against sovereignty.","1280622427"

"canada","t5_2qh68","The provinces and federal government were created in 1867 by the British North America (BNA) Act. It's now known as the Constitution Act and is a key part of Canada's constitution. It splits stuff between the provincial and federal government. The framers of the constitution wanted to make a strong federal government so that Canada wouldn't split up and have a civil war eventually like they had just witnessed in the US. Since then, the opposite has happened by a series of legal decisions and political moves and now the provinces are stronger than the federal government. Meanwhile, the US system has gone the opposite direction (and completely against their framers' intention) and has a stronger federal government a weaker states.

International treaties are implemented by the federal and provincial governments creating interlocking sets of legislation so that they can do things that involve the domains of both (re: most international treaties). 

Cities are a creation of the provinces. All municipalities are created by provincial legislation. They don't have anything to do with the federal government.

Canada has a unified court system. Criminal law is more or less constant across the country. Other laws not so much (although many provinces copy each other's legislation so there are statutes that exist in very similar versions in different provinces). ","1280622493"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; If such a thing as infinity exists

This is the problem with philosophy. You ask whether ""infinity"" ""exists"" without defining what you mean by ""infinity"" or what it would be for it to ""exist.""  Then you ask for some real-world consequences of infinity existing.  

Mathematicians do have definitions of infinity, but they are very precise, and vary based on context.  They are nowhere near as fantastic as philosophers make them out to be, but they are far more powerful and they turn out to be actually useful.  To give you an example of one definition of ""infinity,"" it can just be taken to be ""arbitrarily large;"" that is, when I say, ""as x approaches infinity, 1/x approaches zero,"" I just mean that I can make 1/x very close to zero by making x very large.  In fact, if you tell me how close you want 1/x to be to zero, I'll tell you precisely how large you need to make x.  

Is this notion of infinity as exciting as thinking about a unicorn riding a rainbow?  Maybe not, at least if you are not familiar with this more precise way of thinking.  However, this way of thinking has allowed us to see vastly farther into the structure of the universe that any philosopher's notion of infinity.  Indeed, it has contributed massively to our understanding of astronomy, medicine, quantum physics, population dynamics, chemistry, biology, climate science, architecture, and hundreds of other fields, not to mention pure mathematics.  

To sum up, starting a question with ""If infinity exists..."" is about as useful starting a question with, ""If rocks are happy...,"" ""If ideas have colors...,"" or ""If numbers have souls....""  These are ill-defined concepts.  They can be debated forever with no answer ever arising, since nobody really even knows what they are debating about.  I am not trying to discourage your curiosity, but just trying to let you know that your question will not lead you towards satisfying your curiosity.  In short, you are barking up the wrong tree.  If you really want to learn about ""infinity,"" try checking out a basic calculus book (I recommend [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Stewarts-James-Stewart/dp/0495011606/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1280622197&amp;sr=8-1), but you should be able to find a cheap copy than Amazon's).  If you have some time, maybe even think about taking calculus.  It's not really that hard, so long as your algebra skills are in good shape (most people have a hard time with calculus because they don't really understand algebra).  

Anyway, good luck in your search!  I hope you pursue it!","1280622495"

1) There would be nothing wrong with following ""too close"" if it weren't for the fact that there's such a delayed reaction in speeding back up. People slamming on the brakes isn't a problem (as long as it doesn't cause an accident), it's then allowing the car in front of them to get away from them (essentially the opposite, allowing too *much* space too grow between them and the car in front).

2) Putting more distance between cars reduces the number of cars that can flow through a given point per minute for a given speed. Most jams are caused by merging traffic (whether it's from an onramp or from a lane ending). For a given traffic density, once there's a merging situation, if the drivers in that scenario are comfortable with following more closely, there will be no jam. However if they're at their minimum following distance, they will have to brake to allow more people in, which will communicate slowing through all of the traffic behind them all the way until you reach a point where there is less traffic on the road.

tldr: To speed up traffic leave as little distance as is safe between you and the car in front of you, but more importantly do not lag in your reaction to a car speeding up - hit the accelerator and don't allow that distance to grow.","1280622599"

Yes, that is disconnected from reality.  This, however, is something that is immediately obvious.  Can you make the same claim definitely about diseases like cancer or ""HIV/AIDS?""

Do this on another computer and download the networking driver for your system. Put it on a thumb drive or burn to a CD, install it on your new system and then make sure the rest of the drivers are installed.

And next time always ensure you'll at least have networking drivers ready before reloading an install. While Windows 7 does have a lot of drivers and has been very good at finding the right drivers, you can't count on it to have every single driver.","1280622627"

Sure, political activists are always going to be in the minority unless a major revolution/rebellion is occuring.  However, very, very few?  The Montgomery Bus Boycott meant many people's only form of transportation was walking, however a massive number of people participated and it was successful in changing the policy.  A common strategy in the movement was using peaceful civil disobedience to get arrested, which filled up jails beyond capacity and was extremely costly to the state.  

As for violence, unfortunately there was lots of that:

Police violence at the Selma to Montgomery March, also known as [bloody sunday.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloody_Sunday_%281965%29#First_march)

Violence against the [Freedom Riders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_Riders).

Police violence against peaceful demonstrators at [Kelly Ingram Park](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Ingram_Park).

The list is unfortunately much longer than this, however you get the point.

Less commonly seen is the combo breaker--a troll-type meme typically unasked, yet all too real. This single obnoxious comment can halt the progress of the comedy train rolling through one's brain.

I was particularly surprised to see *The\_Joke\_Explained* try to shoehorn this trope into what many would surely deem a rousing display of novelty inspiration. His comment, which satisfies the promise made by his username, is as dry as the Sahara desert; so droughted that there can be found no hint of comedy hidden between the letters.

Initially I feel dsappointment, for *The\_Joke\_Explained* has surely broken the chain. I search for a reason. Well, it is true that *NothingMoreToAdd* put a stopper on whatever progress the combo had achieved--after all, the combo requires a positive feedback loop the operate. Andthen it hit me--*The\_Joke\_Explained* was continuing the  *awkward* combo originally begun by *Off\_Topic\_Guy*. Having recognized the absurdity of the novelty combo occurring, *The\_Joke\_Explained* gave in and chose to make the reader stop laughing entirely.

* Honestly, by the end of the series I didn't really like any of the high school kids.  Their pasts seemed all too convenient with how influential they became, even though I know the story probably wouldn't be as interesting if they were more normal.  I'm pretty sure I liked just about every other character more than them, though, and would welcome some more backstory on the adults, especially Simon.

That scoring probably means theres a larger portion of black people who live in places where education isnt important. 

Another theory is certain sports are black dominant because they lack the resources to play sports like hockey. I'm guessing in the beginning of the sports boom way back when, soccer here in the states didnt get played. So sports like football and basketball were the only sports that didnt need much equipment became popular in the large black communities where money was scarce. So sports like baseball, hockey and other sports that relied on a lot of equipment. 

Now with role models like Kobe Bryant and Reggie Bush in sports along with the pop culture of rap mixed into sports, it gains even more of the black community.

When it comes down to why blacks are better, perhaps they want it more. You rarely hear about a white professional player who came from nothing, usually its the exact opposite. So money and opportunities fuels them to become better (obviously there are exceptions).","1280622687"

I just got finished working on my game's trailer with a friend of mine. He's a great video editor with a lot of creative talent. I worked with him to let him know exactly what i thought was important to show, and the results can be found at [www.blocksthegame.com](http://www.blocksthegame.com)

I've tried 3 different therapists over the past nine months, and all of them felt like throwing money into a vacuum cleaner to get the same kind of reflective therapy I can get from standing in a bathroom mirror and being honest with myself.

However a key over-sight is this: If only a few of these conspiracies are true, then there is going to be a concerted effort to inject bullshit into the conspiracy movement in order to discredit the ideas. The easiest way to attack conspiracies is by getting nut jobs to jump on the bandwagon. 

We also know reasonably well, without resorting to conspiracies, that public opinion is carefully monitored and manipulated, and there is a massive PR apparatus. When you combine this power with some of the more stupid explanations: lone gunman theories, unlikely suicides, bad explanations etc. It becomes obvious that ""good PR"" is a euphemism for bald faced lies. Isn't it fair to say that when someones is caught in lie after lie at some point they have a credibility problem? 

Perhaps many conspiracy theories are a load of crap, but blame the establishment for creating a haven for them. People wouldn't be so attracted to theories if the establishment wasn't quite so pompous in pumping obvious garbage to the public. If conspiracies are harmful then the blame rests with these liars.

Up till this point she had always slept in my room because she was scared of the dark but she decided it was time to be a ""big girl"" and start sleeping in her own room. She was a heavy sleeper and had been her entire life. So the first night she fell asleep around 9 with all her lights on. I was walking to my room and my mom was in the hallway putting up towels. I heard my sister snoring really light but it sounded funny like oinking. I looked at my mom and we just smiled at each other. Then it got a little louder. So I went in to wake her so she could move to another side and calm the snoring. I called her name several times and she didn't wake up. My mom was standing in the doorway and watching me do this. So I shoved her a bit. Still nothing. Then I shook her pretty hard and she still didn't wake up. My mom started to panic and screamed for my dad. He came in and thought she might have choked on skittles that she ate before bed. He started beating her on the back trying to ""unlodge"" what he thought she was chocking on and nothing. She still wouldn't wake up. That's when we called 911. When they got there and put her in the stretchershe started coming to. While they were rolling her away she looked directly at me, completely terrified, and started slurring with tears streaming down her face. I was sooo scared. My mom was going crazy thinking shed lost oxygen and could possibly be brain damaged. She rode with my sis to the er and my dad told me to get in my car so we could follow. I was bawling and ran into her room and gathered a bunch of stuffed animals to take to her in hopes of her remembering anything. Her sad face and unclear words raced through my brain over and over again during the car ride. I kept blaming myself for letting her sleep in her own room. When we got there we raced to the area where she was being held. My arms crouded with stuffed animals, I ran in and she was up and speaking clearly. Turns out she had a seizure. She was later diagnosed with Epilepsy. I will **never** forget that moment, looking at her and how she seemed so terrified and helpless. I'm tearing up writing this and this happened over a decade ago.

Now it's important to understand that although both countries speak English, there are differences and variations on the meaning of a number of words.

One of these words which has different usage is ""college"".

Examples are:  a holiday scavenger hunt, a summer fireworks party, or a slaughter of enemy players with a story to go with it.  
If such imaginative play and storytelling sounds like fun, RP is the place for you. A non-RP server will have players that view WoW as more of a stat grind or team tactics game, instead of as an immersive world with it's own history.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","If infinity exists, then all *possible* events occur. Unfortunately, it is very difficult for us to imagine what is possible and what isn't.  For example, I can imagine traveling faster than the speed of light, however it may be physically impossible in ANY universe.

Also, our concept of exactly *what* infinity is could very well be skewed.  Imagine us as ants crawing along the surface of a large sphere.  We may walk round and round the sphere, and eventually conclude that we are on an infinite plane (the curvature would be unnoticeable if the sphere were pretty large).  However, another observer could easily see that we are just misinterpreting our situation...the sphere is indeed very finite, and we just lacked the proper perspective.

You touch on the idea of reliving your life.  Because you exist, then your existance obviously falls into the ""possible"" category.  However it's another question of whether the universe *must* unfold in a way that creates you over and over.  Also, what if our idea of time is incorrect?  What if the unfolding of the universe is static, like a reel of movie tape, and we are just running through as though the film is passing by the projector?  in that case, ""you"" are just a static entity in a few frames, so I guess you'd be ""alive"" when those images are playing, and ""dead"" when the reel is spooled somewhere else.

One more thought experiment to consider.  Imagine a time before the universe existed, when there are two options for the fate of the universe.  The first option is Non-Existance (NE).  If this scenario became reality, nothing would ever exist, EVER.  The second option is Existance (E), which is ALL THIS *waves hands around*.

Ok, time for the kicker: You Exist.  The NE option, if it was ever even possible, is no longer an option.  Once you have Existence (again, whatever E is), you can **never** go back to NE.  Alternatively, E **must** have been around for all eternity, for isn't it true that  something cannot come from nothing.  Similarly, if we even conceive of a time of complete non-existence, it would be impossible for existence to suddenly, spontaneously be created out of nothing.  And just as it couldn't be created, Existance can never be completely destroyed.  It can certainly change form, possibly in an infinite number of ways, but it can never become NE.

You are part of Existence. While You, the fleshy sack that is EdibleAccount will die, it is only an illusion of the Ego that you are seperate and distinct from the rest of the Universe.  You may think that your existance ends at your fingertips, and it's true that your human form does end there, but to another observer the molecules in your body and those in the sun are just two different forms of the same *stuff* that is part of a greater whole... Existence.  Your human form will perish, but existence - of which you and I are small parts of this greater Wholeness - is here for all eternity.","1280622976"

Wouldn't it be more accurate to say that you like to avoid discussing differences in beliefs with friends who have them? Changing their personality completely isn't an issue as no one's personality is constant and they're changing all the time without you. 

There's nothing special about having friends with different views than your own, that's almost synonymous with ""having friends"". It is however, kind of dumb to have to rationalize your inability to discuss those differences. If you could, then you could go mountain climbing *and* talk about Islam, Judaism, atheism and Christianity.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","The way paternity tests are done are different, and quite a bit cheaper, than the genetic tests for disease associations.  Paternity tests just amplify the DNA and then cut at a specific sequence causing a variety alternate length fragments to be produced.  Looking at a subset of the fragments, between a father and a child, about half of the fragments should be the same size.  This looks like it will still be the cheapest option for a while.   

Tests that look for genetic disease are a bit more complicated.  You would have to either look at the specific sequences found at a highly divergent locus or set of loci associated with disease.  This can be complicated because even the most variable locus I can think of, the MHC, has perhaps 1000 alleles per ethnic group.  While the MHC is associated with many diseases, specific alleles aren't very strong predictors for most diseases.  Whole genome sequencing can change this, but I don't see it as something that every small county hospital will have for at least 10-20 years and then you have a huge set of privacy questions and what to do with that information if you do keep a record of everyone's genetic code.

Of course, when people do have their DNA analyzed for specific diseases, as part of a research study or simply to check if they inherited the same genetic disease from their parents, it can reveal if they have different biological parents than they thought.  I have heard from people who are genetic counselors that this actually happens somewhat frequently, maybe for 5-10% of the population.  ","1280623010"
"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","I share her disgust at poorly made things. This is a serious problem, as are third-world wages and the general decline of wages worldwide. 

Her answers, however, are simply incorrect. Paying more does not guarantee improved quality or better treatment of workers. Check the label on your high-end clothes. They are made in the same third-world low-wage places that the cheap stuff is. It has been ten years since a commercially made dress shirt has been manufactured it the US.

What we need to do is inspect for quality before purchase, and learn to repair after. What we tend to do is inspect for fashion correctness before purchase and replace at the first sign of trouble. (I practically guarantee that her IKEA cabinets are fine but were installed badly four years ago, need to be reinstalled, this time finding the actual stud.)

Both these things have a learning curve. Looking for redundant seams, finished edges, etc. does not come naturally when picking out clothing. Checking for repair-ability is an art and comes with practice too.

Solidarity with third-world workers is more difficult than simply boycotting this company or that country. I would suggest that the place to start would be when having a conversation with customer service or tech support, since many 800 numbers are in the third world. I once got a laugh from an 800 number worker when I said that I suspected his real name was not Steve as he told me, because there are no Indians named Steve. We need to use these times to have non-scripted conversations, and can then begin to support and understand each other.","1280623010"

One day a legitimate novelty account, incorrect_meme_user, redditor for nine months, posted a picture to reddit with the caption, ""Look guys I also found him"".

Firstly, it seems to imply that there is a physical imperative for matter to somehow increase in complexity, which is an assumption which never seems to be stated explicitly in these kinds of discussions.

Secondly, it's hard to see how evolution would be left out of the tent. Given the information/hardware system that makes evolution possible, I can't see how you can discount contingency.

You asked How truth could be either leftwing or rightwing?
One could think that as beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, so truth can be seen from a point of view. A good argument contends that it is ""relative"". A common expression I've heard is that truth as a slightly left wing bias. The truth of our youth, our world view often differs greatly with the ""truth"" of our world view as adults does it not? 
What is ""truth""? Hell if I know! I once avoided jury duty by posing the question that if the DA expected me to decide, or the Defense expected me to discern which of the two people involved was lying, that I would just have to flip a coin. It was a case relying on one man's word against the other. How was I supposed to determine who lied? What was the truth? I don't know, I wasn't there.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As suggested previously, however, the variation of stellar radiation over time and planetary orbital distance are as critical to the development of Earth-type planets as their mass. For example, the planet Venus in the our Solar System has about 81 percent of Earth's mass. Unfortunately, Venus is located just outside Sol's habitable zone, as derived from the Sun's current luminosity (or ""brightness""). Four and a half billion years after its birth, the shrouded planet is much too hot to support the presence of liquid water on its surface because of its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere and sulfuric acid clouds, which retain too much radiative heat from the Sun through a runaway greenhouse effect. On the other hand, conditions on Venus may once have been more conducive to Earth-type life earlier in the Solar System's history when Sol was as much as a third less luminous than it is today.

Reason: We have seen 0% of the universe...Yes, we've searched through so little of it that is rounds to 0%.  Think about it.  We've landed spacecraft on Mars, and searched through a few miles of it before the craft ran outa power.  So uh, we've searched through .000001% (being generous) of one planet.  What about the remaining 100000000000000000000000000 planets?  If life evolved on one planet, the chances of it evolving on some other planet somewhere out there are 100%.  Furthermore, we can't ""see"" life through telescopes...Shit, we can BARELY tell what color the damn thing is when we find the planet.  (outside of our solar system of course), so I don't count any of these planets we ""see"" as not having intelligent life.  We have to physically go there to find out.

Will we find life any time soon? Probably not.  
Reason: Our technology is still too low.  Obama has put in motion massive research of new technology (by dropping the damn rocket tech that can only barely get us to the moon).  Most people diss him, but it was the correct choice.  We need a new technology to actually go places...""Star Trek Tech"" for instance...Currently, our maximum range for a human is Mars (Russia/Japan will complete this within our lifetime).  We already suspect Titan and Europa will have life, we just can't get there and find out (in any useful timeframe).  Furthermore, Europa has an ice shell which we just don't have good enough technology to break through yet.

Will we find intelligent life?  Kinda.

Reason: Define intelligent.  Is a fish intelligent?  Its intelligent enough to eat and reproduce.  So in that sense, yes, we will find intelligent life.  But don't be surprised when hundreds of years from now we visit Europa and find nothing but fish.","1280623157"

It was alright as she was drunk but I didn't care at that point - to be hooking up with someone was awesome. 

I saw her making out with multiple dudes later on in the party but I couldn't have cared less, I had finally achieved female contact! I went home that night one very pleased young man.

The following night I was invited to a party in some club in town. I was still grinning from ear to ear about my last night success and due to some magical force I ended up making out with a smoking hot Brazilian girl.

One day my dad let the dog hang out in the garage while he went to the curb to pick out some weeds.

Unfortunately the car had one of those shoddy metal trailers for hauling yard maintenance equipment with a bad sized pumper on it that over extended that ended up slicing my dog right now its side. He lived with this giant gap in his body with his internals falling out and my dad begged me to help him keep his body shut and to move him into the car.

Saying the War on Drugs was ""an expensive bust,"" he advocated the decriminalization of drug use and the concentration on harm reduction measures for all other illegal drugs. He suggests that drug abuse be treated as a health issue and not as a criminal issue. Johnson does not advocate recreational drug use and strongly supports a don't do drugs policy.""

Mr. Johnson is attending a Young Republicans meeting in Sarasota this week and they have cordially invited People United for Medical Marijuana (PUFMM) to attend. PUFMM is working to legalize this medicine through a constitutional amendment proposal on Florida's 2012 ballot.

It gives the same effect, but the quality isn't even close.  There are ""3D"" LED TVs that presumably use some kind of processing and dynamic lighting to make people and objects ""pop"", but as I said all it does is make them look like they're on a green screen.

There are normal TVs that can display anaglyph images like we've been discussing, you know how those work.  Problem with those is colors get messed up if the image and glasses don't match exactly in tone.  Most anaglyphs use red/cyan, so if you use red/blue all that green gets through and screws up skin tones.

The new(ish) type of stereoscopy uses LCD shutter glasses to completely block out all light to one eye at a time without using funky colors.  This is usually coupled with a TV with twice the refresh rate (120Hz TVs are nice to keep headaches to a minimum).  While your left eye is blocked, the TV displays the image intended for your right eye.  I've heard suggestions for using this technology to display two completely different images on the same TV.  e.g. the image alternates between player 1's and player 2's screen and the glasses block both eyes at once to give some non-split split-screen.","1280623260"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","this may be the exact opposite of what most college students will say, but NEVER cut your sleep. don't trust energy drinks. (they never worked for me, and they're really unhealthy if you think about it.) if you haven't finished everything you need to by the time you get droopy, then go to bed and finish tomorrow morning. wake up earlier if you have to. and napping is your friend. seriously. especially to combat the afternoon slump. 
and i agree with zestways. study in a library, especially if you're notorious for being sleepy like i am. the pressure of all those quiet people working in the same environment will make you more studious. if you are someone who likes to study in groups, find someone that will actually work with you, not someone that causes you to get off track by chatting.  
And the most important thing is, learn to manage your own time. no one can teach you this. i had a really hard time with this my first year of college too, but you have to do set goals for yourself. take breaks, sure, but don't stop unless you've met your goal. for example, if you have a load of work to do for the weekend, tell yourself that you'll work on friday night in order to party on saturday night. it's a bummer for sure, but it will help if you prioritize. good luck man!","1280623282"

I've struggled mightily with depression for years and I can't tell you how often I have been handed ""The Simplest Solution In the World!"" by well meaning friends and family. I appreciate their need to help and offer solutions, but it can be frustrating to be told that 'curing' my depression is as easy as riding my bike more often or eating more vegetables or just having a more positive outlook on life. Certainly, those things can and do help, but they are not cures for me. What is particularly frustrating, however, is when I try to explain this to the person it gets turned into a moral failing on my part. If I'd *really* wanted to get better I would do these things and they would work.

One of the aspects of my current therapy that I love the most is that we are determining a sort of mental ""baseline"". We are sorting out which emotions and reactions are caused by the depression, which are the result of childhood abuse, which are perfectly normal and acceptable and which are just uniquely mine. I am completely and utterly fascinated with the relationship between the physical brain and the more intangible mind and my therapist is awesome for helping me to learn about this in conjunction with helping me to learn about myself. Like figuring out that my brain reacts far more readily to dopamine (and activities that produce dopamine) than to serotonin, this has allowed us to modify my therapy to allow for more activities that fire up my dopamine receptors.","1280623320"

I really have no advice - this is way out of my pay grade.  The only thing I can offer is that there is no such thing as ""the one"" - we all have bunches of people who would be right for us.  Of course finding them is tough.  A number of us met our SO's on dating sites.  I met my wonderful boyfriend on OKCupid - it's been 13 months now and we're very happy.  Another thing that made online dating so good for us is that, like you, we have specific, um, interests that might be a bit out of the ordinary.  It makes it a little bit easier when you can say, ""I am this (whatever ""this"" is) and I am interested in ""this"".  You know upfront that people who who are open to your ""kink"" are the ones that you will be dealing with - you don't have to go through meeting people that wouldn't be suitable for you and have to worry about making your ""announcement"".

I don't wish to be presumptuous, but, from what I hear, the folks over at [r/SuicideWatch](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/) are very kind and extremely helpful with depression.  (I'm not trying to imply that you're suicidal - just to hook you up with understanding souls.)

I say this as someone who used to download music when it first came out, back in the Napster days where it was easy I definitely did.  I always used the excuse that I couldn't afford to buy it.  I made a point to go to shows and buy merch to make up for it and that felt okay, but now I can afford it so I pay for it...oddly enough I don't go to as many shows as I used to, trump it up to older age.

To sum it all up: If you honestly can't afford it then download it, but if that artist comes to town go to the show...if they don't then tell your friends, help promote the artist online.

The primary purpose of the program was **not** to help people, but to *get Christians to be more charitable.* That was the point, which was apparently crucial enough to be unable to be subverted, even by something such as *feeding hungry people*.

It's bullcrap like this that makes me question all the ""Christians are so charitable"" statistics. If your aim in being generous is to be generous, instead of  *to help people* then I can't trust either your heart or your mind to be in the right place when it comes to *actually* helping people. If all you want is to prove how charitable you are, then you're going to end up giving a man a fish every day for the rest of your life, instead of doing the correct thing. 

It reminds me of the commencement address at a friend's graduation ceremony at a religious school. The whole point was about how important it is to help the poor, but I was really creeped out because the entire speech made it sound like there was this type of people, ""poor people,"" that are different from us and exist for us to do God's work on by helping. It wasn't about helping them get out of poverty, or empathizing with them as human beings, just helping them because they are poor people, and that's what poor people are for.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","There are three types of placement scenarios for TFA:

1) Hard-to-staff regions like the Delta: in these, there are simply not enough teachers to fill the spots available, and TFA is simply not competing with traditional teachers. 

2) Hard-to-staff subjects in urban districts: here, there are plenty of teacher applicants in a district, but not enough (or not all that many) in specific subject areas. For example, we only place Math/Science teachers in Oakland, because while there are more teachers than positions as a whole, the district feels that it cannot find enough math/science teachers for its needs. 

3) General placement in urban school districts:
This is the most controversial situation, and probably the one you're most against. There were probably quite a few applicants for my position, many of whom had spent several years on their teaching degree and credential. Why should it go to a TFA teacher? I think part of this is just the historical relationship between the district and TFA- if we did a good job in the past, they contract with us for another year. Part of it is cost-effectiveness: we're indoctrinated to put in massively long workdays on an intern credential salary, which is cheaper by the hour than someone fully credentialed their first year. There's also the fact that high-need subjects and schools are never perfectly predicted, so sometimes we end up in schools that may not need us anymore, statistics-wise. There are a bunch of factors at play, and I don't understand or agree with some of them, but...

At the end of the day, we sign up to serve. I could have been placed in the delta or on a reservation, to a place where non-TFA teachers simply don't want to work. I didn't intend to displace a traditional teacher, but I'm going to do my best for my kids, at my school, because that's where I am.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think I know where this came from.  There is a book of translations of the talmud done in english.  These quotes are almost verbatim in terms of translation.  Was it a document with these in a row or right next to each other, after the hebrew written version?  Did the document look like pages from a book?  If so, these are taken from a translation done by a catholic priest done in the 1800's; both of those facts make the translation as neutral as a quran translated by an southern baptist.  

First, as one guy mentioned, there is no ""heaven/hell""
Also, it is believed that your are asked questions when being judeged.  One of the first, if not THE first is were you honest in your business practices?  So I can only assume ripping people off and stealing is not the case.  

""Portion in the world to come"" sounds very Revelations.  In Judaism, pretty much everyone gets to go to the same place, some just need ""cleaning"" which would be the idea of ""judgement.""  Everyone must be cleansed, by fire, but it is not supposed to exceed a year.  Also, there is no real idea of Armageddon, which is what that sounds like.  

In Judaism if a gentile follows the seven noahdic laws (spelling?) then they are a righteouss gentile.   So there is no ""HAH!  we're better than you.""  kind of sentiment.  

If a jew does not intervene  by killing someone who is about to commit murder, they are guilty as well.  

There is also a teaching that says, since you too were once strangers in a strange land (slaves in egypt), do not disrespect others.  This is often translated as accepting converts equally (if not more so) and also not to disrespect another.  

Hebrew is a very intricate language, much like english.  A slight cantilation mark can mean two totally different things, and has a very context based word definition structure.  

 its hot outside.
 that chick is hot.

That house is on fire
 that band was on fire last night.  

That cloud is up in the sky?
Whats up?

Keep in mind there is written ""proof"" for the protocols for the elders of zion (written around the same time, the 1800's), which ""PROVES, beyond a doubt,"" that Jews are trying to control the world. 

Such other wonderful sentiment written about jews by religious people.

A jew should never be harmed; but should be forced to eat and live in pig feces and have their property revoked.  Guess who said that?   Martin Luther, of Protestant fame.  

Compared to other widely taught church fathers, that was tame.  Many wanted to just outright kill them.

While Jews remain a significant majority of the population, as they have been as early as 1845, their numbers have grown just 114% in the thirty years since the city's unification in 1967. The Arab population, in contrast, has expanded by 163% in the same time. At 36% of the total in 2006, Jerusalem is now far more Arab than it was in 1967 when East Jerusalem was recaptured.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; I noticed that many reddit users have a hard time telling that there is no realistic difference between fascism and communism. It seem that they mistake the words of the dictators for the consequences of their actions,

The fact that fascism (far-right) and communism (far-left) end up oppressing people and have very similar consequences, does not imply that the two are the same political system. People don't consider them to be the same because, like you, they feel they are just labels for lies of big governments exploiting their citizens.

Most people consider them the same out of ignorance. They are simply not informed about the theoretical differences between these two political systems and their history. My statement does not in any way advocate either of these two flawed systems, but rather underlines how many Americans wrongly assume that fascism and communism are synonymous even in theory. They simply know that both are evil, and as such they fail to distinguish them.

Hitler and Stalin were both evil and had similarities in their modus operandi, but to say that they were the same type of leader would be a gross mischaracterization of two of the most ferocious totalitarian regimes of the 20th century.

&gt; having little to no familiarity with any events that occured within any state that is cited as an example of either.

I hope you are not referring to me, or you'd be mistaken. I'm quite familiar with the history of both systems.

&gt; I think it's possible that, just maybe, these are just words that are being used to trick you, and every country has a government that's just a huge house of cards made of lies, designed to take every penny from you and make you live in unspeakable squalor, and that the more laws that are enacted, the closer a populace is to living under complete totalitarianism, where the government can simply prosecute them at will, as a scapegoat for their own failures.

I never disputed that both lead, in practice, to evil, totalitarian regimes that take advantage of their people.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","A lot of good choices.  Some others (sorry if re-post, but at least no more from *Up*):

*A.I.* - the Blue Fairy scene.  Christ.  Say what you want about the film, and I didn't love it, but even when I saw that in theaters at age 12, I was depressed.

*Cold Mountain* - most of the ending in general, thanks in part to the music and the fact that you invested a lot in these characters for nearly three hours...and then that happens.  BTW, this movie has one of the most bad-ass villains of all time, and no one seems to ever mention him in movie villain lore.

*Millions* - it's totally predictably and arguably a bit sappy, but the scene where Damian finally sees his mom and asks what her miracle was.  Anyone could have told you her response before she said it, but I still tear up when I hear it.  Just reminds you that all you ever want from people you love is to validate their love for you.

*House of Sand and Fog* - this is right up there with *Requiem*, *Revolutionary Road* and *Dancer in the Dark* as one of the most depressing films ever made.  But the suicide scene at the end takes the cake, mostly because you know how avoidable it all was.

*Gone Baby Gone* - two scenes here.  The first is when Patrick discovers the bloody underwear in the sink, and if you ever read the book, that scene was a million times worse.  I seriously had to stop reading it for a week or so because Lehane's description was so graphic and jolting; it singlehandedly made me lose faith in humanity and question how something so cruel could happen so easily and regularly.  And, of course, the ending, where doing the right thing turns out to be the worst thing.

*Mysterious Skin* - Brian finally realizing what happened to him as Neil holds him on the sofa.  Serious question: has anyone watched this film more than once?  It's the most incredible film that took me three sittings to get through.  I can't imagine more than 10 percent of moviegoing Americans have seen it, but it's the most profound experience I've ever had watching a film.  Like the aforementioned *Gone Baby Gone*, but for the entire running time instead of a single scene.

*12 and Holding* - Gus' monologue, story told to psychiatrist.  I knew at that moment that Jeremy Renner was destined for great things.  Holy shit, his acting in that scene gives me chills.  [Reference](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VEUS3kcEp8I)","1280623518"

On the one hand we have people who say that life itself is proof of a God, while scientists groan and say there is no proof of God and that science is gradually proving that there are natural causes for the phenomena they are observing.

On the other hand we have people who see UFOs and say they know they are from another planet because what else could they be. The scientists groan and say there is no proof that what we are seeing comes from another planet and that they need measurable proof. 

The difference between these two is that the eyewitness testimony people are providing are just that, eyewitness testimony. Scientists can not test it to explain what it was, and people cannot provide proof of it being extra terrestrial.

I for one feel like far more attention should be paid to what UFOs are by the scientific community in order to figure out WHAT they are. I am certainly not going to stand here and say I KNOW what they are. ","1280623567"

Not great cinema or anything, but a good ""I need to see what happens next, it's gonna be cool!"" sort of show. Also, blood and boobs. It's only one season so far, so quick watching.

But before you waste time on Spartacus, you should go back and watch the handful of season they made of Rome - it's similar, but much much better plot and production values (summary: guy 1 and guy 2 end up joining the Roman legions, stuff happens with lots of politics and action).

I call that discussion maneuver ""the polite backhand"".  Your demographic is showing.

My response was not defensive; it was merely thorough. I like to be clear, especially when dealing with someone who seem to have previously ""missed the point"" for whatever reason.

&gt;  never once said I thought you'd just had a life of ""poor, unfortunate experiences"".

Not precisely those words, no. But you did say ""It's a shame you've had some bad experiences"" and ""Come on now"" and ""Be reasonable"".  I see little difference in meaning: Whether or not it was intentional, you were talking down to me as a ""less reasonable"" and ""less fortunate"" creature.  More of that same ""polite backhand"" that I was talking about before.

I do not expect you to understand what's wrong (IMO) with the way you have been interacting here.  I'm sure you think you've been perfectly normal, polite and reasonable.  To which I say again, your demographic is showing.

&gt; I disagree with you. It's not the same thing as hating you as a human being

1) Yeah, I know what disagreement is.  Did I at any point claim that ""you hate me as a human being"", or even infer that?  You keep trying to put words in my mouth.  When I spit them out and correct you, that's ""justified defensiveness""

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","The concept of infinity in math is often just a way to denote something else in a more convenient way. You have to read the statements involving ""infinity"" in a different way than you'd read the ones involving finite numbers, but they still make sense.

If I asked how many times I'd need to watch Star Wars in order to become a real jedi, a possible answer would be ""infinity"", meaning that it'll never happen. It just means ""if you did it 1,000,000 times, it would still not happen, and the same goes for 10,000,000 and so on"".

Just to be clear about something else, too, there are things that are infinite in nature and don't repeat themselves.

If you generated a number's decimal digits by rolling a 10-sided die and having the digits be those results in order, you'd have a 100% chance of having at least one occurrence of the digit 7 in the number. However, if you used a 6-sided die, you'd never get a 7 (it's not on the die).

When you're talking about infinity and you're involving physics, it's probably all different. You're free to think that, eventually, because there's randomness in the world, you'll eventually land on the same place all over again, but I never got any interesting insights with that giant ill-defined ""ifs"".","1280623680"

You constantly smell like solvent, even if you haven't cleaned a gun since you last showered and are wearing 'clean' clothes, kind of like how a smoker **always** smells like a smoker even if they haven't smoked in a week because that stuff permeates everything and doesn't ever really 'wash out'. 

You're in Starbucks/grocery/school/office/whatever, you start looking at objects and barriers, trying to figure out what constitutes cover and what constitutes concealment, and against what types of weapons: ""I bet that metal door could stop just about any combat pistol round, but no way it's stopping a deer slug or high-velocity rifle round...Bob's only got a cubicle, that thing wouldn't stop a .22, if someone came in here and started spraying, he'd be toast...I'm glad I've got an office :D ...my filing cabinet's chock full of paper, it'd stop most things, I wonder if I should reposition it so that it's cover against the most likely direction of incoming fire? hmm..."" 

You know the make, model, and caliber of the sidearm for all local LE agencies (PD, Sheriff's dept., anyone else with officers that carry openly) and how many spare mags they carry because you always have a quick look to see what they're packing whenever you see a LEO.  You also know what kind of longarm (shotgun/rifle) they keep in their cruisers if they have it in the usual rack between the two front seats. You are a nosy son of a bitch.

You keep finding random empty cartridges in your car that have spilled out of whatever they were in and rolled into every possible nook, cranny, and crevice, and usually roll back out to make an appearance only when you have someone else in the car, who will now wonder what happened to the last person who was in your car with you.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","&gt;You can't look at the national murder rate and use it to extrapolate that it is more dangerous to be a homeless man than a homeless woman.

If more homeless men are being abused or are dying than homeless women, then it means that homeless men need more protection than homeless women currently need.


&gt;Shelters for women exist because, in addition to all the issues that the homeless (regardless of gender) have to deal with, homeless women are more likely to be raped or abused.

Rape is one out of many types of violent crimes, and the ONLY one who's main victim is not men.(outside of prison) So men have to deal with much higher chance of having every type of violent crime being perpetrated against them except rape. Why is rape so much worse than murder or all other violent crimes?(especially since most rapes outside of prison aren't actually violent, I wonder how only violent rapes stack up between the sexes, can't find a source on that)

Anyway, in my opinion shelters for men are needed at least as much as they are needed by women.

&gt;They're also more likely to be on the streets because they're fleeing a severely abusive partner. 

Men are just as likely to be abused as women. We don't know how severe it can get because most men know that they are almost certain to not be believed and are terrified of making a complaint since it is very likely to get them to end up in jail...

Since we as a society tend to ignore and not believe men that are abused, you can't say with certainty that women are more likely to be homeless due to abusive partners, because no one actually knows how many men are homeless because of abusive partners.

&gt;They are the victims of very specific types of crime that overwhelmingly come from men.

Which justifies having women only shelters, but does not in any way justify not having shelters for men as well.

&gt;Of course getting people off the streets and away from violence is a good idea, and it's a good idea regardless of gender. My point is that a gender specific shelter for men is not as necessary as one for women because men do not face the same scope of problems, and because women are not the ones making the national murder rate for men so high.

My point is that except for a single type of violent crime, men face far more dangers than women.

The more problems that are faced by a certain part of the population the more help that part of the population requires.

And as for the perpetrators of most murders being male, most murders occur because of the war on drugs and the insane amount of money it provides to gangs and organized crime. A homeless man has the choice of continuing to live in the gutter or joining a gang and selling drugs... Which involves fighting for turf and killing people. 

To, me this implies that men need not just as many resources as women to help them get their lives together, but more more resources so they can avoid getting pulled in to gangs...

&gt;The issue here is that you're wrong.

If I am wrong and the whole of society is structured to make men's lives easier and put down women, then why in the blue hell do so many men's problems get completely ignored while problems faced by females tend to get addressed and acquire massive funds to help solve? This makes absolutely no sense.

&gt;I agree. I'm reminded of how unfair paternity cases can be when I drive past a ""Men's rights law center"" every day - I absolutely recognize that there are areas in which men get the short end of the stick. We also have to register for the draft, and that kinda sucks as well.

Which is the part that I don't get, if the whole of society is structured to make men have more power then how do men keep getting the short end of the stick in so many areas?

Perhaps I am misunderstanding what patriarchy is supposed to mean.

&gt;Ultimately, I just take exception to your denial of the idea that patriarchy plays a role in gender relations in the US. It's just such an impossibly huge error that I'm not really sure how to address it.

Women suffer from many injustices in the current system that is true and if that was the end of it then I would probably agree that there is a patriarchy.

However, men suffer from many injustices in the current system that is true and if that was the end of it then I would probably agree that there is a matriarchy.

Do you get what I am trying to say? Both sexes suffer too many injustices from the current system, for that system to be set mainly against one of them and for the betterment of the other.","1280623765"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","Go on a diet (doesn't matter what type, just have a sizeable caloric deficit) with:

1. Adequate protein intake per kg of bw. Intake also varies based on how deep your caloric deficit is. This will help spare lean body mass (LBM). A common recommendation is 2g/kg as by the International Society of Sports Nutrition. In a diet, perhaps slightly higher would be best.
http://www.jissn.com/content/4/1/8

2. Regular resistance training. You should attempt to lift at the same intensity as when you were not on a diet. Your overall volume of training should drop, but to maintain, you should KEEP the weight level and drop off a couple sets (2-3 sets of bench press instead of 5). In fact, you can drop volume off by 66% and still maintain if you keep intensity the same.
Don't do this high rep, pump+tone crap you see steroid-using bodybuilders advocating while cutting. Their rulebook is adapted towards optimizing training+drugs.","1280623769"

Back before I was born, when my parents lived in another city, there was this old man who lived next to them. He used to sell scraps and stuff (most likely stolen) he bought from drug addicts and other low lives.

He had said for a long time that he wanted to dig up some dirt and sand in his basement, to get some more space, but he never got around to do it. Then one day his house was surrounded by police; they had received an anonymous phone call that he had several bodies buried in his basement.

I was at my friend Greg's house in college, playing a 4 way game of Magic: The Gathering because we'd recently discovered we were both into it when we were younger. His roommate was there, and so was one of his friends from home, who had been hit by a car when he was a kid and had a history of seizures. So we're playing our game, and all of a sudden he sticks his leg out and starts messing up all my lands with his foot. I start to ask him ""what the hell,"" but I realize his eyes are rolling back and he's starting to seize. My friend, thank God, starts to take control over the situation, and is on the phone with 911 almost immediately. The 10 minutes between the call and the ambulance getting there were totally harrowing; the kid with the seizures was fairly big and strong, and he kept trying to force his way up to the second floor bathroom. Me and Greg had to physically restrain him on the stairs because we didn't want him falling down them. It was completely hprrifying, I thought the kid was going to die right in front of my eyes. It would have been weird regardless of what we were doing, but the sudden intrusion of some real life shit was a really bizarre contrast with the fantasy card game we'd been playing.","1280623809"

Due process doesn't matter when the ""crime"" is growing a plant. Putting people in prison for growing MJ plants is completely irrational and insane. Due process is irrelevant. The fact is the state has the power to lock people up for such ridiculous reasons. Name some power that corporations have that is equivalent. 

&gt;Think about the amount of money being made by existing well established companies who have the money and resources to lobby and influence the government (as well as you ore me via advertising and misinformation) to keep their policies the same for their profit. 

But I thought the government is out to protect us from big corporations? Isn't that the point of net neutrality? You can't have it both ways. If the government is up for sale to the highest bidder, then net neutrality is up for sale too, which means big corporations win. 

&gt;Passing legislation with the concepts of net neutrality in it will prevent companies from stifling free speech, and information on the internet. 

Private companies have very little interest in stifling free speech. I agree they might try to censor people who criticize them, but other than that censorship drives customers away. Observe that throughout the world, it is various governments which are actively censoring the internet, not private firms.

Endotherms DO alter their metabolic rates to counteract environmental conditions by modulating heating processes such as fat burning and shivering. The advantage of maintaining their internal temperatures within a narrow range is that enzymes are highly temperature sensitive in their activity so endotherms may develop highly efficient, optimized enzymes to take advantage of this.

""My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause."" -the tyrant, abraham lincoln

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","enchiladas verdes

Ingredients

    * 2-3 chicken breasts or thereabouts
    * 1 big onion
    * 2-3 jalapeños
    * 1 lb tomatillos
    * 1 clove garlic
    * 1 tablespoon olive oil
    * corn tortillas
    * shredded cheese of your choosing 
    * salt, pepper, spices, chile powder, etc  
    * some vegetable oil for softening the tortillas

Directions

* Boil the chicken however you normally boil chicken. With 1/4 of the onion, some salt and pepper, a few spoons of the powdered chicken base, etc. Bring it to a boil then lower the heat to simmer, cover it and forget about it for an hour. Cut off the heat and leave it sitting to cool for as long as you can. Then save 1/3 cup of the liquid (strain it if you used spices or anything that will muck up the works) and dump the rest. Bone &amp; Shred the chicken. Now you have shredded chicken. Feel free to boil a shitload of chicken this way, and save whatever you don't use to make tacos or sandwiches later on.

* Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.

* Take the husks off the tomatillos, wash them until they're not sticky. Wash the jalapeños too. Put it into a saucepan and add enough water that would cover them if they didn't float. Which they will. Bring it to a boil and cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Then drain it and let it cool. Cut the tops off the jalapeños and cut the seeds out of them.

* Put the tomatillos, jalapeños, onion, and garlic into the blender and puree it. Don't do this while they're still really hot or the steam will blow the lid off the blender! You could cover it with a dish towel before you put the lid on but you'll waste some of it that way. Just let it cool some, and blend it little by little.

* Dump the puree into a saucepan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, the 1/3 cup of broth you set aside, and a tiny bit of salt. Simmer for 15 minutes.

* Put the shredded chicken you plan to use in a pan with some chopped yellow onion, some chili powder, and some pepper and cook it a little more but not until it dries out, just until the onion starts smelling good.
 
* Soften the tortillas in oil. You could use pam or something but it really does make the taste/texture just to brush some oil on either side of the tortilla and then stick it in a very hot pan for a few seconds on each side. You don't want to cook them, just make them soft. 

* Inside each tortilla, put a little of the chicken, a spoon of salsa, and some cheese. Roll it up and then stick it seam down in a baking dish. Do this until your tortillas have filled the dish. 

* Use the rest of the sauce to pour over the enchiladas and then cover them with cheese. 

* Put them in a 350 degree oven for 25-30 minutes until it is bubbly and delicious.","1280623842"

My first year working in a domestic violence agency, I was meeting with a new client at their safe shelter. It was my first day (yes, my FIRST DAY) and I guess I must have had some kind of skeptical look on my face when this woman was telling me her situation because she began saying, ""You don't believe me, do you?"" And before I could reassure her, she was lifting up her long dress up to her knees to reveal marbly mangled skin I can't even call her legs. They looked fucking terrible -- not even in National Geographic have I seen flesh look that bad. Apparently, her abuser enjoyed dumping boiling hot water repeatedly on her legs.

The other disturbing thing was witnessed while working for the same agency. This beautiful 18 yr. old girl had had her teeth drilled out by some crazed dentist in Utah for reporting her Mormon step-father to SRS after years of him raping her often at night. I didn't ask her to, but she showed me her teeth where her molars were completely caved in and crumbling into her gums. She applied Anbesol like most 18 yr old girls apply chap stick. It looked like a botched job and terribly painful. I spent the next day buying baby food for an 18 yr old and trying not to cry in the grocery store.","1280623898"

Regulation is more like the rules of the game, and the salient differences between games aren't really about which ones have more or fewer rules, they're about *different* rules.

Now, there are a lot of laws that, in effect, can be described as prohibiting a contract between two consenting parties.  There are some things it's not legal to sign away.  But it all comes down to the details.  I don't feel like discussing the generic concept of ""prohibiting contracts"" is a constructive discussion in this context.

For example, is it ethical for the government to declare invalid any contract, however ""voluntary"", in which someone signs away their right to take their employer to court when their employer is complicit in gang-raping them?  That's exactly what the Franken amendment was about.  I'm sure plenty of redditors - who overwhelmingly favored the Franken amendment - would not support the generic statement that we should ""prohibit contracts from taking place between two consenting parties"" which is why I think that sort of discussion is unhelpful and misleading.","1280623904"

The last chef made up the schedules for the next 3 weeks so we would all know when we had to work etc, and made the extra week up so the new chef could slide in easier. Basically a really nice guy and a great chef. I had been working 90 hour weeks for awhile, I knew how to cook everything on the menu, knew all of our gourmet take away food recipes and if anyone needed help with anything I could answer their question (no I wasn't the Sous Chef, we didn't have one).

The new guy, comes from a hotel environment where everybody wears different colour scarves to say what level you are at and he calls a staff meeting to say he wants to do that with us. So after the meeting I come up to him and respectfully say that since none of us have any formal training and how we work well as a team already, that the scarves idea might set in some jealousy and create friction. He just said that this was what he was going to do regardless, which is fine, he's the boss, I was just telling him my concern and respectfully backed down.

Well shortly after that my 90 hours a week got cut down to 40, then 30, then 20. He had started other people doing the gourmet take away food, even though the place we were making it for started complaining after he made the switch. I also never attended the 'optional cooking training' classes he had. If I'm not getting paid for it, I'm not gonna go back to work.

So Christmas party rolls around and I ask for a few minutes of his time privately and I tell him that I am looking for other work, and I wanted to be upfront with him about it. He said fine, he was going to fire me soon anyway, and that I did not need to give him any notice, I could just take off at any time.

Two months after I leave he's fired for sexual harassment (they canned him on the spot) and is leaving to take a camp job across the country. Meanwhile he is trying to get a 17 year old girl who worked in the kitchen to go with him. He's married and has kids. Thank God she never went.

Also the crafting is just fun. It's like Diablo II's Horadric Cube but more awesome and rewarding. In order to create and object you must place certain items in specific spots which forms the item/tool. For example two sticks for the handle and three iron bars across the top to form a pick-axe.

It's also a ton of fun to explore all the randomly generated areas in the game but those creepers and skeleton make me run in absolute fear.","1280623921"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No worries. I do a lot of bulk buying and support so I see trends among brands. The common reliability problem I keep running into is inadequate cooling with and with certain nvidia chips the problem was compounded. The GPU hit higher temps than in the specs causing component failure (See Apple's issue with the Macbook Pro recently). A lot of the manufacturers also put the hard drives near the GPU and they were affected.

HP and Compaq's problems have a lot to do with a shift to cost-cutting some years ago and the fact that the systems use cheap and proprietary components. The DC input jacks are not very strong and the pins inside or the solder holding them to the mobo break very easily with very little pressure. The fans and heatsinks aren't good enough for the amount of heat produced, and they use really cheap and thin ribbon cables for connections (keyboard/multimedia buttons/display/etc). Not ideal for a device that gets moved around. It's sad because they used to build really solid devices.

Toshiba surprised me because I never really gave them any attention until I started a major refurb project and I noticed that they consistently exceeded my expectations in the quality of the design. More fans, better and larger heatsinks, locating sensitive components away from the GPU and CPU, stronger internal frames and quality cables. Toshiba really flies under the radar and doesn't come to mind. I guess they're like Buick. Reliable, but not exactly sexy.

Sony tends to mimic (as close as they can anyway) Apple designs (see the chic-let keyboard), and for the most part they are reliable except from issues related to the amazing heat output of nVidia graphics.

Lenovo's problem is that they have overcomplicated their designs. They start with a solid product and then keep adding features...what happens is that you have so many points of failure that something as simple as a windows update to improve power management can result in your wireless card no longer working at all because it conflicts with Lenovo's utility. The R and T series Thinkpads have a multitude of problems relating to the power management system stretching from the BIOS to the included software for Windows. The big costly monster that comes up often is the battery. A perfectly good battery will refuse to work because the controller decides there is a problem. You can get them to work with a fair amount of hacking/modding but if you screw up the damn thing might overheat and melt/burst.

ASUS has strength in the fact that they use good main components (mobo, cpu, etc.) but the design is haphazard. They have a tremendous amount of OEM experience, yet they're competing on the low end of the price scale and there's only so much you can reduce your profit margin before you cut corners. The shells leave something to be desired and the refinement isn't there. To me an ASUS would be a Hyundai and a Toshiba/Sony would be a Lexus. Technically similar, but during daily use you would notice the differences. Everything from the feel and response of the keyboard to the clarity of the display. I think once the brand name gets stronger they'll definitely become a top tier producer in quality...you can see the talent is there just not the budget.

Dell is such a crapshoot nowadays its not even funny. Some of their systems are excellent, but lately I'm telling customers to avoid. They're also running into an interesting issue where the ""intelligent"" charging/power system on the laptops decides that something's up and it refuses to charge the battery. They're switching to a new style of BIOS and this is the first widespread problem, but I've also seen issues relating to fan control (fans shut off during high load), wifi/bluetooth and hd performance.

Apple computers are solid but in the end you do pay a lot for the name.
And they only handle problems when they can no longer deny them, Mr. Jobs' personality permeates throughout the company.

When looking at a laptop think about how you will be using it and then objectively decide whether the device can handle 2+ years of that.

Obviously everyone has a bias so those are mine. That's pretty much all the info I can give you on things. I think you'll find something you like.","1280623969"

CBruceNL made a really good post about how Canadian government is set up (you could nitpick, but how he describes it is how things work in practice most of the time), so I'll post some issues that have attracted attention lately. I'll focus on federal issues because I don't really know what your provincial or municipal issues will be. This list will tend to focus on Conservative issues because government issues dominate our attention. In no particular order:

**Economy:** Mostly government expenditures and taxes (fiscal matters) and job availability.

**Census:** Should the long form be mandatory? Has been in the media a lot lately.

**Immigration:** The main issue is how we should prioritize workers and family reunification. There are a number of smaller issues, like handling children born to Canadians abroad and handling refugee claims.

**Infrastructure:** Canada has had an infrastructure deficit for decades now, which basically means our infrastructure is decaying faster than it's being built up. Every region has it's own issues, but everyone is feeling the impact of old bridges or sewage, insufficient public transit or something else.

**Crime:** Youth justice, paroles, pardons, organized crime, white collar crime, and especially drug crimes.

**Copyright:** Mostly whether circumventing DRM should be illegal.

**Senate Reform:** Should the senate be elected? Should they have term limits?

**Environment:** Mostly oil sands and potential harmful GM agricultural species.

**Pensions:** Anything surrounding the Boomers' retirements is a big issue right now.

**Telecommunications:** Net neutrality, foreign investment, regulation, etc.

**Military/Northern Claims:** You can't really look at these issues separately. The military is a huge money sink, but northern land claims could have a huge impact on the country's future.

**Personal Rights and Freedoms:** Has been getting a lot of play with the G20 recently and now with the census.

There are a lot of other issues, but I think these are the ones getting the most attention right now. I would personally add government transparency to the list, but I'm not sure how many people really care.","1280623978"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Most of the measures they chose are the generally accepted standards for measuring the given concept.

One way to analyze the post is to consider that there are at least two conclusions that can be made for each of these observed facts. Normative economics (which deals with *should*) is a lot messier than just measuring the available statistics.

For instance what should be the conclusion from reading about wages in the textile industry in other countries. The statistic might be a little more relevant if we knew how many dollars of output they produce per dollar of compensation, rather than dollars per hour spent working, but if they are less productive than their Cambodian counterparts, then maybe they should be doing something different. We know that it is expensive to clothe, feed, and educate an American before they even enter the work force. It is also expensive for an American to live in this country every day as an adult. Is the answer to impose restrictions so that every American in every industry has to pay even more to clothe themselves, or is it better for the American textile worker to apply themselves to a more productive occupation?

Alternately, why is it so cheap in Cambodia? Is there a lot of child labor? Do buyers here know they are might be hurting the next generation of Cambodians by making the short term opportunity cost of education too expensive? Are there really bad environmental practices? Is there even the use of *slave* labor? Maybe the foreign capital will enable Cambodia's economic development, maybe the factories exacerbate wealth disparities that hinder progress.

The problem is less with the statistics than if anyone allows themselves to let a writer suggest there is an obvious interpretation and conclusion that should be made from those statistics.","1280624013"

She was making this horrible, inhuman sounding moaning noise. Turns out she had epilepsy, which now is thankfully controlled. Scared the shit out of me, even now remembering it makes me shake.

The second one(s) happened when i lived in london with my ex. I have bipolar disorder and it tends to go psychotic when im off my pills. Anyway, one night i walked past our living room door and saw inside there was blood and brains splashed all over the walls, it looked like a massacre had happened in there. My ex came down and confirmed there was nothing there, i was hallucinating. A couple of days later i walked into the computer room and saw a man in an electric chair in the middle of the room, obviously dead and crawling with maggots.

Also, keys will scratch my phone screen, so they naturally are kept away from the phone (therefore, front left pocket). This leaves only my wallet, and since I don't want an unsightly bulge in my right pocket to take away from an unsightly bulge in my middle pocket (if you know what I mean), the wallet rides with the keys in the front left.

Now, let's compare that with loving someone you've never seen, never spoken with, and who for all intents and purposes might as well be a figment of your imagination. If you stop loving this person, you're going to be damned to burn in hellfire for all eternity.

Some people have never had the luck of being introduced to this second person, so I'm afraid they're damned forever, as well. Spiteful, no?

Earlier, you asked, ""How can you have faith in him if it's obvious he's out there?""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Back in the 70's I was a kind of manager for this flea bag apartment complex in downtown Ann Arbor. It was just a big building with a lot of single rooms with a bathroom and showers on each of the 4 floors. Mostly old guys and poor people lived there. Every night I had to walk around to the halls to make sure that nothing strange was going on. On Christmas Eve I noticed that a guy had left his door open a crack but then I remembered that he did that because he liked to have the air circulated through his room.

So the next morning (Merry Christmas!) I'm walking through the halls to make sure everything is OK before I go to my parents for Christmas when I notice that the old guy's door is still open, which is strange because he always gets up and some point and closes it. So I'm thinking, ""damn, this is just like a horror movie,"" and I knock on the door and ask, ""hey, you OK in there?""

Silence, no response. Oh boy, so I push the door open and peek in and there's this old guy laying on the floor, clutching his chest with the most horrible pained look on his face. I have to go in and touch him to make sure that he's really dead. And is he ever! Cold and stiff and I'm knelling down next to him thinking, ""man, I will NEVER make fun of those poor dudes in the movie who find the dead guy and while they're checking to see if they're dead get ripped to pieces by the monster that's still in the shadows"".

So I'm pretty sure that the old guy died of a heart attack some time during the night, man, on X-Mas Eve to boot. I was never so happy to get the fuck out of a room in my life. Called the cops and they took care of everything pretty quick. Boy, the rest of the day I was pretty darn thankful for even the crappiest presents I got.","1280624107"

The action scenes are believable and fast-paced. The characters are well-defined.  The dialogue between characters is written well (not wooden.) There is a smattering of humor and at times I laughed out loud. There are small stories spinning within the larger epic story.  Nothing works out like you expect yet the series is very satisfying.

You can use anything to backfill the void (even newspaper), and fill with grout,putty etc. depending on what you have available.

There were just so many small ways that she and I complimented eachother so well - even her flaws (demanding princess) I found sexy and enjoyed catering too.

I think what's really killing me now is just the difficulty of my Gender confusion (Massive backlash from both my family and _all_ of my relationships since), intersected against her playful warmth and bantering with the idea.  I can't help but think how much better my life would be right now had I just a little more faith...

If I was going to off myself over all this shit, I would have done it some-time in the past year.  The simple fact is that my body is too afraid of death to let my mind take that leap.  Which means I'm stuck wallowing in the emotional crap that results.

There was no e-commerce, which was 90% of the entire project. We had given him $4500 up front and were going to give him another 50% when it was finished.

Well we told him we were unhappy with the work and asked for another resource.  He told us to go fuck ourselves and said he wasn't going to give us the money back.  We had a contract and could have easily taken him to small claims court, but after a while we just decided to let it go.  

Cut to now and I'm working with a guy who used to work with this developer, his company had fallen through due to shitty practices and pissed off clients. He tells me this developer was driving and a fucking brick came through his windshield and smashed him in the face totally fucking his face up.  They apparently threw it from an overpass.

I think we can confidently say that about everybody. Even about all the scientists that are working in their own areas about most of their own areas. An the scientists are the real skeptics (or at least they should be by definition), because its the nature of their work - to question everything.  
What I have problem with is:  
1# people who have no experience or even a brush with science that are questioning the results of scientific research or analysis improperly and because of their inexperience coming to a different conclusions and then spreading those conclusions in a laud an aggressive manner - pseudo scientists.  
2# people who are spreading misinformation because they are being paid to do it (usually part of group nr 1) - paid shills.  
3# people who form an opinion using said misinformation without fact-checking it and then would require enormous amount of evidence (which they don't understand because of no scientific experience  and/or no education in said fields) to disprove it - deniers.

So would you say everybody should back off and leave those groups alone to their work? I would actually not have a problem with that if it would not degrade my internet usage experience - sometimes when I accidentally a stumble upon an article i get huge cognitive dissonance.","1280624203"

I noticed a lot of people in that time were hooking up on IRC to play practice matches so that's something people can do. It'll of course be best to sign up as soon as  you can since this is a first-come, first-serve type of deal.

We're going to be using random seeds for matching. This might mean that some diamonds will play bronze or silver players but I think it'll average out. Also note that we will be advancing the top-4 from each week into next week's tourney if they wish, and these players will also be randomly seeded and may even face each other in the first round.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not the worst, but the one that I am willing to share:

About 5 years ago my wife and I were at the Stonestown Galleria, a mall on the outskirts of the Sunset in SF.  We were standing betwixt the up and down escalators at the Nordstrom's end of the mall, deciding on whether or not to eat convenient mall poison or head out to the neighborhood for something tastier.  In the midst of my Orange Julius advocation, we heard a *whump*, followed by a piercing wail.

We turned to the down escalator to see a white couple scooping up a tiny asian toddler.  My immediate thought: ""Poor guy, he probably fell down at the bottom,"" and relief that his (adoptive) parents were there to grab him up.  At that time, I had two kids of my own, one of which was about the same age as the crying kid.

The I saw the blood, and the frantic look on the face of the ""mom.""  She was squeezing his hand, which was spurting blood everywhere, asking ""are you his mom?! Where is his mom?!""  We stepped over to the ""not-mom"" holding the kid to see -- with absolute horror -- that two of his fingers were gone, chewed away by the escalator.  The remaining three on that hand looked pretty chewed up.

We said that we had no idea where his parents were, and started to help ask around the area for them.  A few MINUTES later -- minutes -- two ladies came running down the escalator, looking horrified.  When they got to the bottom and saw his hand, one hit the ground in a dead faint.

Over the next 20 minutes, here's what we learned:  The boy had walked away from his aunts while shopping in J. Crew.  He jumped on the (understandably tantalizing) escalator, and the white couple (both nurses) got on behind him.  They said they wondered why the boy was alone, but figured his parents were at the bottom or behind them -- the Sunset is mostly Asian, so such a youngster is not at all out of place... plenty of possible parents abound.

The kid fell at the bottom, hands first.  He was super unlucky in that one of the yellow ""guard"" teeth that protect the escalator bottom was missing.  His tiny fingers slipped right into the gap and were severed just like that.

The mall ""security"" took about 8 minutes to shut off the escalator, eventually finding his mangled, clearly non-re-attachable fingers.

So while this probably pales in comparison to many of the stories above and below, seeing a kid the same age as my son in such agony and fear was deeply, deeply disturbing.  And I'm sure the aunts will never forgive themselves, knowing that they forever mutilated their nephew through negligence.

And last I checked -- about four months ago -- that escalator remains gaptoothed and unrepaired.

TL;DR a tiny little boy got his fingers chopped off by an evil escalator","1280624315"

When a communications medium is born it usually targets a niche and specific audience. When it becomes popular and mainstream it must appeal to everybody and inevitably becomes a purveyor of pop culture. It becomes a top 40 hits station. It becomes diluted enough to be liked by everyone but not remarkable enough to be loved by anyone.

That happened to reddit, digg, the Sci Fi channel, the entire Discovery Network, etc. And believe it or not, Music Television was a music channel a long time ago.

It seems that the only way to preserve a content purveyor is to intentionally make it unappealing to everyone except for those that fit the cultural footprint that it had when it was born and to enforce its etiquette with severity.

Popular media is OK. There is nothing wrong with it. But allowing every channel to transform into a market for the mainstream makes everything uniform, bland, tasteless and boring.","1280624372"

We roamed the strip, came back to the hotel, things happened kind of naturally. I was nervous of course, but I got through it. It was kind of clumsy and awkward. I told her about it later and she said she didn't notice anything peculiar about my performance. It was a great experience with somebody I really cared about. I even got to wake up the next morning next to her. You won't get that with a hooker/escort whatever.

Don't stress about it. What I came to realize was that I had been avoiding getting into a relationship for fear of getting hurt and the extra responsibility of being in one (if you are not ready for that you shouldn't be sticking you dick in other human beings). Make your self available and be in social situations with good friends in places you feel comfortable (doesn't have to be a club or bar) and of course be realistic about your mate. Give it a couple months and you'll find someone.

But when I'm at the library, there isn't much to do when I do decide to take a break other than check my e-mail or maybe click through a few reddit links.  The wooden chairs there also seem to keep me more focused on my work as I have less tendency to sit back and let my thoughts wander.

I also try to queue up music to help with my mood.  When I'm writing or coding, I like to listen to electronic music or anything with a good beat because it keeps my fingers moving.

---

* Protect the person from injury - (remove harmful objects from nearby)
 
* Cushion their head

* Look for an epilepsy identity card or identity jewellery

* Aid breathing by gently placing them in the recovery position once the 

* seizure has finished (see pictures)

* Stay with the person until recovery is complete 

* Be calmly reassuring

**[more advice from wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy#Responding_to_a_seizure)**


bit of advice from me: if someone is taking control of the situation, try to film it. Reasoning:

&gt;It is helpful if those present at the time of a seizure make note of how long and how severe the seizure was. It is also helpful to note any mannerisms displayed during the seizure. For example, the individual may twist the body to the right or left, may blink, might mumble nonsense words, or might pull at clothing. Any observed behaviors, when relayed to a neurologist, may be of help in diagnosing the type of seizure which occurred.

"self","t5_2qh96","Electronica, hip hop, metal, ambient.. ok those are innovative in the early 80s.  Since around 1997, though, what new style or sound has been invented?  Hip hop minus deep bass?  ""Rock"" without guitar, or with a guitar buried behind piano?  800 new samples &amp; remixes of something Oakenfold did in '85?  Everything else on Pitchfork that sounds like the same washed out, sedated soft rock?  Going from Elvis to Jimi Hendrix is a lot more radical than shifting from Madonna to Britney Spears.  We're well on our way to replicating the lameness of 1940s-1950s music - that is just how the cycle goes.  Eventually it devolves so far that we've got Beiber and a hint of what the next era will look like.

There are basically four seasons in society:  High, Awakening, Unraveling, Crisis.  In the last crisis, the Depression era, we first met the word hipster and the ""innovative"" music was little more than an urbanized &amp; santized version of the rural jazz &amp; blues from the prior unraveling.  Similarly, in this crisis, we've got watered down &amp; more family friendly versions of that metal, electronic, and rap that was innovative during the unraveling (1982-2001).  By the end of the crisis, people will probably be universally attaching the word ""doofus"" to hipster, just like they did after the last crisis.

There have been four awakenings in American society, but while they introduce awesome artistic achievements and philosophical ideals, many of those changes don't become politically possible until some 40 years later when the crisis mentality kicks in.  

One of the most important things about the 60s awakening is that it is one of the first awakenings in all of human history that offered a purely secular vision.  They're usually extremely religious affairs and if the hippies had tried that one or two awakening cycles prior, they would have likely been burned for witchcraft (a more historically common awakening event). 

And where are these ideals at work?  Well, brush up on your Timothy Leary again because when he says ""turn on, tune in, and drop out,"" he wasn't describing the hedonism his critics accused him of.  He's actually describing something a lot more like the current drop out economy that cares more about local food than what those fuckheads in D.C. are doing.  ""Turn on"" your brain so you can think for yourself out of the 9-5 hamster wheel modern life will put you on.  ""Tune in"" and get active in your local communities.  ""Drop out"" of supporting destructive institutions and causes.

So yes, you're right about some things. It is the current Reddit generation that will probably do the heavy lifting politically and take credit for making Awakening ideals into political reality.  No one in other generations are going to give a crap about our music, though.","1280624460"

However, I disagree that big companies (like JPMorgan and/or Coca Cola) have anything to do with it. The percentage paid by a large corp vs. a middle class individual is irrelevant. No matter how you look at it, the large company is paying tens (and probably hundreds of millions of dollars) vs the couple thousand the individual is paying. Besides that, and more importantly the large corp is providing jobs, health insurance, pensions, ect, ect, ect....for thousands and thousands of people.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It's undeniable that Jews are moving into East Jerusalem but in Israel property rights are protected whether the property is owned by jews or not so if they want a property they'll have to buy it. They buy it either directly or through Arab middlemen but buy it they must. If the Guardian have someone in Jerusalem, and they certainly do, they'll know this but they'll still write up their pieces as if they've only landed there yesterday. It's entirely dishonest, misleading and, quite frankly, serves the tastes of a readership whose who's appetites would be, ahem, quite different than mine.

The fact that we know settlers are in East Jerusalem and are doing everything they can to bring more isn't useful knowledge to bring to any attempt to analyze this story when we know that Israel has an independent judiciary and laws which protect property rights. Many of these laws originate from the property laws which applied prior to the mandate under the Ottomans. The fact is that if an Arab holds title to a property then if anyone wants it they'll have to pay for it. The Guardian know this full well but why let facts bugger a good story? Speaking of stories you might be interested in this: http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article7113617.ece  It certainly doesn't contradict your point about Jews moving to east Jerusalem but you'll observe that they have to go to extraordinary lengths to acquire property.  

We're in danger of getting into a different discussion than the one we started out on which was, at least from my point of view, that the Guardian piece was an execrable piece of journalism. We'll hear no more of this story from the Guardian, they grabbed the thinnest slice of information and constructed a very unappealing narrative from it. The article plays to a particular script and artfully paints old school stereotypes, Arab victims and rapacious Jews. There's a huge market for this sort of stuff and The Guardian are never short on the supply side and Reddit is never caught short when it comes to supplying mouth breathers to react like Pavlov's dogs at the sight of such copy.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; The fact that fascism (far-right) and communism (far-left) end up oppressing people and have very similar consequences, does not imply that the two are the same political system. People don't consider them to be the same because, like you, they feel they are just labels for lies of big governments exploiting their citizens.

Mmnhm.

&gt; Most people consider them the same out of ignorance. They are simply not informed about the theoretical differences between these two political systems and their history. My statement does not in any way advocate either of these two flawed systems, but rather underlines how many Americans wrongly assume that fascism and communism are synonymous even in theory. They simply know that both are evil, and as such they fail to distinguish them.

Yes, yes.  Your assumption is that communism means ""government enforces equal wealth for everybody,"" and fascism means ""unequal wealth for everybody,"" or some similar bullshit.  Both of them mean less equal wealth, more oppression, more scientific stagnation, and more misery.

&gt; Hitler and Stalin were both evil and had similarities in their modus operandi, but to say that they were the same type of leader would be a gross mischaracterization of two of the most ferocious totalitarian regimes of the 20th century.

Name a single compelling way in which they were different.  They were both claimed to kill millions in labor/concentration camps.  They both had massive cults of personality.  They both had moustaches.  They both overlooked a massive totalitarian takeover of industry.  They both consolidated other countries within their empires.

Interventions are during debates and are the other reason people stand up, and a current speaker (lower case s) can allow an intervention by personal choice, though he or she loses respect among their fellows by not allowing some interventions.

And people scoff at the Speaker because he or she's the Speaker - it doesn't do for some MPs who are looking for that status of edgy and radical that they merely obey the instructions of the Speaker; some have to rebel and complain, sometimes publicly!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I disagree.  If a public official went out and talked in detail about Santa Claus and the color of his belt buckle or something we would ridicule him (presuming he was serious and not joking).  Equally absurd claims, such as those concerning Christianity (which have equal amount of evidence as Santa) should also be ridiculed.

Private individuals should also be mocked privately like we do for all of the other behavior we don't approve of, like believing in alien abductions, Santa, etc.  I don't think, however, private individuals should be mocked in public, but public individuals can be mocked in private.  I point out this distinction because public figureheads in particular are an extremely detrimental problem when they believe in things like religion -- just like our libel and slander laws, which protect those people (private person vs public figure), we should act in that fashion, but we should indeed privately, in our social groups, shun or ridicule people who believe in things that are stupid -- like homeopathy.

When it comes to any other topic, when someone believes something that isn't true, has no evidence, or is otherwise entirely stupid, it's understandable and even practice to ridicule it -- this is not the case with religion.  It's also not because it is a personal emotional connection to an imaginary figure.  If that were sufficient, then people who have strong emotional ties to other nonsense would be safe from our ridicule as well.

So, let's say we continue to ridicule stupid ideas and start including religion in that.  We run the risk of eventually ridiculing good ideas that appear stupid at first.  This is a risk we take, and already do take.  Good ideas, however, inherently contain truth or some aspect that makes them good, that should be evident over time and as so long as the advocates of such ideas are capable of adequately defending the ideas with evidence and reason -- something that religion lacks entirely, and proudly lacks.  I cannot begin to list the religious people who are proud of their 'faith,' which is basically a notion that they believe such wild claims on trust alone.","1280624601"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At a store where there are racks of bicycles on display there was a family who were looking up at the bikes. I walked down another aisle and when I turned the corner there was a little boy climbing the racks - he must have been 7 or 8. His mother was yelling for him to get down in Chinese, and he's yelling back, ""NO!"" and then he would laugh, because he's almost to the top where all cool bikes were. But then he slipped and his leg got caught in a bicycle chain. So there he was, swaying back and forth, crying, because the chains were cutting into his leg and he was upside down.

So all the employees are running to the racks and the kid's mother is hysterical. Two minutes later the father comes and he's very upset, so he starts to climb the racks, because the employees were looking for a ladder or something like that. The boy has been upside, bleeding from his leg for close to 8 minutes now - blood is dripping down, which is dripping across his face and onto the store's floor. The boy is screaming, the father is screaming and then the boy begins to throw up, because well, he's been upside this whole time. So there's vomit and blood showering on the families below, as a crowd has gathered and when the father gets the boy, he begins to vomit, because I guess he smells it or it could be all of the blood, but anyways, there's vomit and blood just drenching all of these people below and that's when the chain reaction started.

It was like one person gets a whiff of that sour, acidic stomach acid that's always percolating, and it connects to the next person. There are give or take, 15 people, hurling at the site of this boy hung up like some sort of horrible fairy tale and the morale is not to disobey your parents or else you'll throw up, and then the employees come and they see this small gathering of vomit and blood and whatever other bodily fluids found their way into that accidental social gathering.

At the time, I remember going outside and watching the ambulance pull up and I sort of said something about vomit and blood, but I don't think I made a lot of sense.","1280624706"

You don't need anything. You can take what you want. This means a woman will have to try to convince you that she is the best.

It's simple to be like this. If you go to a bar and order a drink, I bet you say something like, ""Can I have a beer?"" as if you are asking the world if it's okay. Instead, say something like, ""Get me a beer, please."" This will make the world notice that you know what you want and can get it simply by asking.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It might be slightly cheaper, but really, not by much at all.  A good industry to use to quantify the cost of living differential from one area to another is real estate:  you can pay $500k for a 3bedroom townhouse, probably without a garage, in Northern Virginia.  In, say, rural Georgia, $500k will buy you a goddamn *mansion.*

Cost of living tends to balance out, though, because whereas you can pretty easily land a part-time job that pays +$14/hr in Northern Virginia, you'll be lucky to be making $9/hr at the same part time job in Georgia.  High-level professional jobs also tend to carry the same disparity, with obvious exceptions; even if there's not a huge disparity in the average salary between a ""low cost-of-living"" and a ""high cost-of-living"" area, there usually is in the *mean* salary.  There are obviously more industries than just real estate that have these same (approximately equivalent) differentials, but real estate is a pretty decent indicator of cost of living.

Since there are so many industries that fluctuate with the wage differential across America - service industries, retail, groceries, etc. et al - it would generally take a *large* purchase to ""cheat the system"" and get any particular item for ""cheaper"" than somebody in a high cost-of-living area, because the generally-less-expensive industries - i.e., service - will wear that advantage down over time.  Likewise, high-value industries have a much more direct effect on the disparity.  This is also why the real estate industry tends to be one of the best, if not the best, indicator of cost-of-living for a particular area; since a home is generally the most expensive thing the vast majority of Americans will ever buy, it has the most direct correlation to the overall cost of living.  Everything else - including wages - is subject to a wide range of caveats and variables.  

Statistically, a $1000 HDTV purchase is nothing compared to a $200k house.","1280624727"

"technology","t5_2qh16","I kind of agree, but as a geek I liked Vista. I didn't really say much about it to anyone though. The main reason people disliked it was because it took manufactureres awhile to adopt support for it, not because it was badly designed, but because their programs were badly designed (or they didn't feel like releasing new drivers). The part that is bad about it, and is still (though not as much) bad about it is the required specs. I recommend 7 to people with new computers but I still feel it uses way, *waaay* too many resources to do what it does, personally it's just fucking ridiculous. It doesn't matter these days so much, but that's no excuse. Your OS should not use 1GB of ram stock to do slightly more OOTB than what XP could using ~350MB.  

In short the reason (I believe) people like 7 is because it's built off Vista, which was good, and time has passed. Drivers and programs support 7, *because Vista paved the way in support*, and because hardware has increased to disregard the system requirements. ","1280624728"

&gt; Or it may draw similarities between owning and employing a person, which equates the term with a lack of workers' self-management.

2) Asshole elitists who refuse to listen to anything that more than three hundred people have heard of and think that if it was released after 1996 it's shit.

A much better explanation is, our observable Universe is defined by our visibility scope in similar way, like the visible area oflandscape under fog. In dense aether theory the appearance of Universe, the red shift and dark matter/energy can be modelled with dispersion of light waves at the water surface - we can see, at sufficient distance every surface wave is dispersed into noise, so we can observe the most distant objects at the universe hidden in the noise, too.

It seem inconceivable that anyone would ever align themselves with an organisation that has systematically hidden child abuse for decades. Even now, with the change in church law, there is still no obligation on the part of clergy to report abuse to the police.

I'm sorry I don't really have any zany questions about why you are a scientist (you went on to work in a scientific field yes?), I don't necessarily think that science and religion are incompatible, even though I am an atheist.

Let's take a Cantor-like approach for a second, and decide that we mean something along the lines of mind-blowingly big.

To create an example for the OP, let's throw in an MWI supposition. Back of the envelope: 10^80th hydrogen-sized particles in the universe (I know, I know ... back of the envelope, though... OK?); 10^40th planck time-units per second; 1 'binary' decision per particle per planck time.. (yes, yes: I know...). 

So that get's us about 10^120th universes per second. Now: all of these have fundamentally the same rules of physics; and from any particular point in universe evolution ... each universe will only have 1 ancestral 'path', but 10^(120*t) (Is that right??) descendants ... so that's a lot, even if they do exhibit some 'trendiness' or momentum.

It's important to notice that this is still not ""infinity""; just really big.

If you were going to then posit a integer infinity of start-overs (redo from an initial vector) ... then I guess that you could fill the possibility space. So, to the degree that any particular outcome did *not* violate this universe's laws of physics. Then ... yes. Soup/Salad: yes. Unicorn on rainbow ... I don't see mammal tissue being up to the task unless it was a very very small unicorn, or under low gravity. And it would only apparently be riding the rainbow from your perspective; not using it as a support structure.

Anyway: it's tautological isn't it. If you have an infinity of infinities; will state vectors pass through all unconstrained combination? Probably. I wouldn't want to hang around and wait for it. Immortal monkeys typing the works of Shakespeare and all that.","1280624935"

&gt; 116.3b The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) resolves.

Players can't cast spells when they don't have priority, so if your opponent doesn't have priority he can't cast Lightning Bolt. He has to wait until priority passes to him, which would be after you've activated Jace's ability.

It's a long method, but maybe using the area code for where you believe they live (according to their Myspace location), you can lookup the prefix (first 3 digits of a phone number) list, and try all of them followed by the number in the SSID.

So, if for instance, their SSID had 1234 in it...
And their likely area code is 111
And the prefixes for the area are 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, and 888

Try calling 111-222-1234
Then 111-333-1234
And so on. At each number, ask for the person who's Myspace you have.

Doing this, maybe you can find a phone number (will be a landline as well) and then you can use that to likely find an address.","1280625054"

"japan","t5_2qh2u","Hold up. ""Secondary school"" in this case is considered ""junior high and high school"", and the joyo kanji is easily enough to be considered literate, and at the very least, functional. That's why they are the ""general use"" kanji. Considering that there are only a few hundred primitives that form all the kanji in different permutations, it's not too tough to ascertain the gist of a compound, and the pronunciation as well. Knowing just the joyo kanji would probably be enough to read any comic books or magazines. Anything beyond 3000 kanji is likely to be old variants and disused words, akin to learning old Shakespearean English, or Chaucer. I doubt the majority of university students know more than 3000, and probably just recognition (they wouldn't be able to write from memory).

Using Heisig's ""Remembering the Kanji"", you could learn to recognize and write the 2000 joyo kanji in several months of disciplined study. At the very least, it would give you the capability and confidence of ordering off of Japanese-only menus.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Hi, Adair. We'd just like to take this time to inform you that the basis of TodayILearned *is* for things that you learned today...

While this is interesting information, it also appears to be your blog, and this particular submission came from January 2009. If we allowed room for things 'in the style of TodayILearned,' we would have to accommodate a lot of people's blog items and guides that they're promoting, which would lose what makes TIL unique, that  Redditors are sharing what they learn today as it happens, and not things they [want people to know](/r/YouShouldKnow) *[[YSK subreddit](/r/YouShouldKnow)].

So, we do appreciate your submissions, but many of them have been off-topic to the format of TodayILearned. There are other parts of Reddit that may serve better when it comes to linking to your blog.

But, you seem to be a person with an interest in history, so, if you find other interesting historical submissions throughout the course of your day, feel free to submit those and share that with people. But, in addition to TIL, there is also [/r/history](/r/history), maybe even [/r/psychology](/r/psychology) for some of them.

But, rule of thumb, again, if you didn't learn it today, it doesn't belong here, even though it may be perfect in another place on Reddit. Thanks.","1280625121"

Shop around,  get a good price, and a good doctor (Especially this, you'll regret not completely trusting the person knifing around in your jaw).  

I recently got mine out,  zero insurance and cost 1200 for light anesthesia(same medication that puts you to sleep,  only less of it), 4 molar removal, 2 impacted.

I originally wanted total-knockout anesthesia,  but it was 300 dollars more.   I didn't have any pain,  and was totally ""gone"" throughout surgery. 

The aftermath wasn't bad,  no infection,  and no more life crippling pain.   Life without pain is so cool,  My teeth had been hurting since i was 17, and i always put it off because of money problems within the family (i didn't want to be a huge burden to anyone).  But it became unbearable at 21  and asked for help.

GET IT DONE!  Teeth grow,  and the older you become,  the farther they tendril up into your skull.  I was 21 when I had my removal,  and the doctor feared breaking into the sinus,  or hitting a big nerve going down the side of my jaw (bad things happen if this is nicked)

It means if you make *your* life your priority, you will win the game. If you take yourself seriously, if you hold yourself in high esteem, if you have ambition and display courage, if you make something out of yourself, *you won't need to chase women, they will chase you*.

Because the number one lesson about women is you won't ever convince a woman to love you as much as you love her. She has to figure that out for herself and you have to earn it.

First off, how many people, when noticing a stranger on their property, have an initial thought ""shoot them?""  I've heard stories about wackos and I'm sure you have too, but this is not something that happens very often or something that many people think is an ok thing to do. If that person is aggressively intruding, trying to harm the property owner or take their property, then a majority of people would think it was ok to shoot the intruder.  Principles could be agreed upon within the local communities as to what is and isn't acceptable behavior on ones property.  The NAP is not sacred, and that is why it is called a principle.

&gt;Do you even realize that both of those forms of force are forms that build states?

States are violent in nature, but their power comes far more from feigned legitimacy than violence.  

&gt;As the free marketeers buy up or claim more and more private property, leaving less for other people, encroaching and forcing the populace to agree and abide by contracts in order to live on said private properties, and then leveraging that to more advantage, how is that not statism?

I don't have much desire to address zero-sum-game nonsense that you folks peddle, other than to say it's nonsense.  The state is a zero-sum-game, the market is not.  

&gt;To those who think that just won't happen, how do you think we took over America from the first peoples?

You mean it was businessmen killing them and forcing them off their land, and not the army and government?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Your 4 truism, while really cool in thought, aren't objective truths or even morals.

You're conflating objective statements with non-relative statements.  My statements were entirely objective but they were also relative.  The relation here being ""to all other systems yet tried.""

This should have been clear from the fact that I stated that none of it was **absolute**.

&gt; Even if we observe the evidence and come to moral conclusions, without variable controlled experimentation, we cannot know which moral system works better for society than another and without a concise means of measure, identifying an objective moral system is impossible.

I do not need to satisfy the empirical statistical model to empirically observe that today was cooler than yesterday, in my neck of the woods.  (Yesterday was in the 90's; today it's in the 70's. Gotta love Arizona monsoon weather!)

You're conflating the scientific method with all objectivity -- and that's an irrational act.  They are not equivalent, and they needn't be.

Now, if we were to engage to the level of scientific rigor to **prove untried systems** -- well, I'd be all over supporting that like flies on shit.  

However: for the majority of the things I discussed there have **been** a sufficient number of trials to make the statements in the empirically rigorous manner; we need only to look at the tens of thousands of nation/cultures throughout history to sort them in order to make the statement.

&gt; this isn't an objective truth since a society could be made up of self destructive people that seek destruction for the society. 

A society that ceases to exist no longer functions.  This is a moral failure.

&gt; This is actually pretty dangerous when left to interpretation. It may seem great objectively but without quanitification and a means to quantify the level of hurt vs the level of gain,

Utilitarianism again.  It is, in fact, awfully dangerous.  And we discuss this all the time.  But then again, we also permit eminent domain, and do not discuss it -- in general -- as being an immoral act.

We also discuss how to most morally implement taxation schemes when those are based on nothing other than damaging individuals for the good of the society.

&gt; This discounts the social benefit of deception.

A society that does not engage in deception **is better** than a society that does.  They function better; they achieve more; they react better to new circumstances; they are capable of engaging in longer-term planning, etc..

&gt; A society can benefit from a lie and stating that it is objectively better discounts any scenario where a falsehood would serve society better than the truth.

Ahem.  **Objective** != **Absolute**.

Try to understand that.

I haven't missed any points you've made. I've read your posts thoroughly and found them to be lacking in reason in certain aspects (vague as they were). 

You seem to be applying one set of rules to yourself and another to me here. I tell you that comparing feminism to a jihad is overdoing it and you promptly suggest that I've taken it out of context and know that (which I disagree with, just so we're clear on what I'm disagreeing with here as it seems to be something you're confusing with psychoanalysis for some bizarre reason). 
But then I respond to your suggestion that I said soemthing which I cetegorically didn't and you insist that I didn't need to say it for you to decide that I did. 

So to clarify: you got annoyed that I gave an opinion on something you actually *did* say and you considered that unreasonable somehow. You, on the other hand, have decided to accuse me of saying something I didn't then insist I may as well have. 

And what on earth is the nonsense about my ""demographic showing""? You're acting far more like an ""ism"" than you can see with this statement. The only thing I'm showing is that I disagree with you and feel you've been unreasonable in your response to that. Anything else is you adding your own predjudices to the equation. 

You *did* get definsive, you *do* need to chill. There's no polite backhand about it, I meant exactly what I said in exactly the way I said it. 

""I do not expect you to understand what's wrong (IMO) with the way you have been interacting here. I'm sure you think you've been perfectly normal, polite and reasonable. To which I say again, your demographic is showing"". 

Right back atcha. (except for the ""your demographic is showing"" part. Shoot me if I ever say that phrase to anyone. Seriously).

This is what call/cc is meant for, as well as the various delimited continuation styles (prompt/abort, reset/shift, control, &amp;c.). This would make any work he does far more portable (yes! even scheme code can be portable, but not if it relies on any particular system's FFI, such as CttC), and would generally be more interesting to the community as a whole.

Let me clue you in on something, son. Of course it's a rigged game. A rigged game that depends on us to keep it spinning, but even if only 10% of the public voted... those votes would still decide the fates and direction of the other 90% of those too jaded and above it all to vote. Minds are changed increments at a time, and the best Madison Ave advertising agencies know this well. Repetition, repetition, repetition is how PR works, or as I call it Public Rinsing, a slower, gentler brain wash. Still does the trick, though.

Politicians hire these people to craft messages: Fox, along with Sean Hannity, Michelle Malkin, Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh rinse you every day night and lo and behold, PUBLIC OPINION POLLS SAY 92% OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE CONVINCED SADDAM HUSSEIN HAS WMD!

So I'm a clueless asshole, huh? You're a 20-something kid who acts like he just realized he's the smartest person in his family. Clue: You're not.

Here's clue No. 2: Pick a side and fight. Do your part to change minds a bit at a time on the grassroots level, if nothing else. Only weak sisters sit on the sidelines and bemoan the process. You don't like politics? Clue No. 3: Neither do I, but I like to work and eat and breathe air, so what these fuckers do affects me. 

And finally, the clue we've all been waiting for: Fight or don't fight, lawcorrection, you're shit's still getting taken and divided. It's up to you if you want to fight for a bit of say in what your shit is spent on. I choose social programs, non-war and rebuilding infrastructure. The other side: they choose big business, war contracts and religious special interests.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Being aroused by gay porn is relatively common among straight guys. It may be you're not interested in straight porn because you're in a loving relationship and the allure of other women is naturally muted by your feelings towards your girlfriend. I'm in similar long-term and porn doesn't turn me on nearly as much as it used to.

As to having problems with sexual performance in bed, nervousness can be a huge factor in preventing you achieving and maintaining an erection. It's cumulative feedback: the more worried you are about it the harder it is to...well...stay hard. Relax and don't stress about it. If you're not feeling ready, don't force yourself. It'll only make things worse.

My advice would be to talk to your girlfriend about your concerns (except, of course, about the attraction to gay porn which, while pretty normal, probably won't help matters). You'll probably find her very sympathetic and willing to help you work through it. That in turn will help take the pressure off you a bit. There are plenty of other ways of giving each other orgasms in the meantime. If you're girl is craving sexual satisfaction, try going down on her after some long, easy foreplay. In my experience that's always a sure fire way of pleasing a woman!

The flipside, of course, is that you might be curious about having a sexual relationship with guys. To that I'd say listen to your instincts. Don't listen to what other people label you as. If you're curious experimenting then don't let anything stop you! Go with the flow and enjoy yourself. ","1280625364"

My understanding is that you can convert a GLOCK 23 (.40 cal) to shoot .357 Sig, but you can't convert a GLOCK 32 (.357 Sig) to shoot .40 cal. I think one problem is that a larger caliber barrel will not be compatible with a slide that was designed for a smaller caliber.

2. I don't give a shit what impression I give to christians, as their hatred and biases have already been dictated to them and will not change, and they view everything as a challenge of their faith, so nothing I say or do can possibly have any impact.

Maybe you're one of the ones that didn't get turned into a hateful bigot by the taint of religion.

Basically, everyone are limited to about 5 minutes for every issue. Their supervisor are trained to tell the front line solider not to care. If there is something wrong, they automatically sides with the buyer if it is Ebay. Also they routinely freezes account whenever something look wrong. They simply don't care about the actual user. I have no real story beside having an account that got frozen due to someone implying on one of their payment saying that the product are for adult. Even though the product have nothing to do with adult entertainment, they don't care. They simply close the account. There are no contact info, you have to dig really hard to find any e-mail address or number to call. And to get them to do anything, you pretty much have to threaten them with lawyer action.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's backtrack a little. This discussion started when you said:

&gt; I'm curious about the roots of your assertion that prepositions can hold final positions without violating any syntax.

Are you claiming that prepositions in final position is a *violation of syntax* because it (allegedly) increases ambiguity? Or that it's a violation for other reasons?

I'd also like to question the logic of your most recent post:

&gt; The purpose of a set of prescriptive rules is to enforce a greater level of conformity than occurs naturally; without prescriptive rules dispersed across a population, dialectal differences are less restrained.

Why are dialectal differences a bad thing? Today, many people in the English-speaking world ignore prescriptive rules, and we can all communicate fine. This is especially true in the case of prescriptive rules that have no foundation in English grammar, for example the prohibition against splitting infinitives; everyone can ignore them because no-one speaks that way normally.

&gt;In the current discussion of preposition stranding, there should be concern that ambiguity is increased when propositions and their objects are separated needlessly.

You're claiming that preposition stranding increases ambiguity - the burden of proof lies with you to prove this to us. Further, regardless of whether or not it increases ambiguity, are we to avoid all contexts where ambiguity is possible? Or are stranded prepositions somehow special?","1280625498"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I saw someone die. I was in Astrakhan, in Russia, which is a total shithole. All the pipes are above the ground, it's very industrialised, to the point tht the compass in our car was no longer reliable. The whole place had a bad vibe about it, confirmed when we saw a pack of wild dogs chasing someone down a street. We were crawling down the streets at 2am, 7,000 miles from home, with me comparing every sign we saw to the word next to ""hotel"" in our Russian phrasebook - гостиница.

We found a petrol station and filled up (after almost being stranded in the middle of Kazakhstan, this had become a survival habit, along with keeping excess water at all times). There was an altercation across the street - some people were arguing. I'm not sure exactly how many, now, but I remember what happened next. We were all sort-of watching it,a s you do when people are yelling at each other, and then it just happened. It was so sudden, so unreal - you expect there to be a build-up, or a warning, or *something* to be different when someone loses their life, but the second it took was no different to the second that preceded it.

One of the men had a glass bottle. We hadn't noticed it before. He smashed it against the wall beside them, with the neck still in his hands - Astrakhan daggers, I suppose - and lunged. The bottle went into his opponents neck, and he fell, as quickly as gravity could pull him down. It was like a puppet having its strings cut, except a really heavy puppet made out of sacks of potatoes.

We drove off and didn't look back. Found a hotel a while later, left in the morning, and kept driving East.

I didn't know how to feel at the time and I still don't know now. It doesn't really bother me, and that bothers me the most. It didn't seem real, it still doesn't, but I know for sure it happened, and it had almost no impact at all, on any of us. I saw a man die, and no one cried, no sad music played, it was very uneventful for such a violent act. It scares me that anyone could die with so little ceremony, with so little warning, with so little *meaning*.","1280625508"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Thanks for the post. I especially admire your ""All of this has been answered by many sources. Those questions are born out of stunning ignorance and a refusal to face reality."" Comment. It implies that any person who questions the official story, or looks for new evidence in support of a thesis is a crackpot who should seek out mental health assistance

No it implies that his specific questions have been explained. I like how you tried to spin it into some vague quest for truth. But if you were really interested in the truth you would be here agreeing with me bace of little things like, facts, evidence and logic.

&gt;On point 1: popular mechanics? really? That's a five-year old article, and the ""final"" report was issued less than two years ago, and can be found here. And here is a good article with objections to the report, its assumptions and methodology.

Yes really, all of that are peer reviewed facts. 

&gt;Numerous scientists have confirmed the presence of active nono-thermite in the WTC dust, collected around the time of the buildings' collapse. I saw no explanation in the ""deubnking 9/11"" article. Instead they relied on a red herring by demonstrating the inefficiency of consumer-grade thermite. An article publihed in the Open Chemical Physics Journal late last year by Niels Harrit confirmed the presence of nano-thermite chips and curious ""spherules"" in WTC dust samples. Here is a copy of that article.

Despite the mountain of evidence in front of you..you choose to believe in nut jobs, btw your link is broke. You are fucking, insane and more importantly fucking stupid. I mean it's absurd how stupid someone has to be to even think  for a second that it's logical that a demolition brought down the towers. The science, facts, events of the day and months before and  the plain old common sense of rational people disprove this..

You.Do.Need.Help or a basic fucking education and some social interaction with people.

In the morning we decided to just chill out, hung over, and eat some pancakes. My friend whose house we were in got out all of the ingredients and started mixing. All of a sudden he holds his hand out with the whisk in it and just starts pointing and shaking, and turns slowly around from the counter to look at us, still pointing and shaking. We think he's fucking with us, and ask him what's up. SUDDENLY, he drops, hits his head against the cabinet below the sink with the an extremely loud cracking sound, and starts seizing on the floor, with the most haunting blank, helpless stare on his face. We immediately jumped into action, my life guard friend guiding us, protected his head with pillows and called 911. We knew he was epileptic, but didn't ever expect it to happen, and I'll never forget that sound that his head made (though luckily it didn't do any damage, I think the crack came from it being a cabinet door and slamming shut).","1280625519"

Angela and Domina each wear a long cloth draped between their legs and a winged headdress. Tiffany and Angela are shown in the Spawn Bible as having sharp wings. [...] All three of these female characters are warrior angels who fight in the war between Heaven and Hell.

&gt; The CIA begins recruiting American news organisations and journalists to become spies and disseminators of propaganda. Frank Wisner, Allan Dulles, Richard Helms and Philip Graham head the effort. Graham is publisher of The Washington Post, which becomes a major CIA player. Eventually, the CIA's media assets will include ABC, NBC, CBS, TIME, Newsweek, Associated Press, United Press International, Reuters, Hearst Newspapers, Scripps-Howard, Copley News Service and more. By the CIA's own admission, at least 25 organisations and 400 journalists will become CIA assets.

The CIA ran it for 30 years in house, it was supposedly shut down by G H Bush after being exposed in the church committee hearings, but all they did was change the media ownership laws and bury it deeper through privatisation. Now 90% of the worlds major media is in the control of 6 companies, and the dissemination and disinformation continues.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Broadly speaking I agree, and eventually the money will probably return.

No, it *must* return in order for it to be of value.  Nobody's going to hold on to a foreign currency and watch it lose value to inflation when they can buy tangible things with it (things that don't lose money) or they can invest in order to grow them.

Think about it this way, how stupid would you feel if you were a billionaire in Mexican Pesos prior to 1982 and you kept them all in your mattress?  If you'd bought *anything* with them at all before the currency tanked then you'd have come out ahead.  If you'd invested them you'd still have done better than losing 1000 to 1 in the hyperinflation.  The argument only completely fails in the case of total currency failure, like Germany's Weimar Republic Deutsch Marks went through, but *everyone* who holds currency faces that loss with any fiat currency.  It should come as no surprise, then, that plenty of investors keep their money in a multitude of currencies as well as non-perishable commodities (gold and oil among the top).

Any way you slice it, the money isn't sitting around in a coffee can or under someone's mattress.  It's going back to the economy that it came from in some fashion or another, if for no other reason to combat inflation and in many cases in order to grow one's assets through investment.

Ever wonder why it is that so many rich people fill their homes with damned expensive art?  It's not because they have taste (necessarily) but rather because art continues to have value while the value of many other things decline.  Jay Leno's car collection is valuable because it contains a lot of rare, restored vehicles that can't be obtained in other ways.  However, everyone else's cars lose value the second they leave the dealer's lot.  That's a poor investment.  Picassos or Fabergé eggs (especially, since they contain precious stones and metals) will retain their value.","1280625591"

If you could let her make the same ""choice"" an infinite number of times under the exact same circumstances including the same experiences (if you could rewind or reset time) she will still ""choose"" to reject evidence. 

She may one day have experiences that lead her to ""choose"" differently, for instance, if she hears convincing arguments that evidence is the most important thing, or if there is a traumatic event that makes her question her faith. But, if she ""chooses"" differently it will be because she has had experiences that compel her to do so. 

Alternatively, to say that given the same ""choice"" under the same conditions someone is capable of ""choosing"" differently (if you rewound or reset time you would get different results), is to endorse choice without quotation marks. This is what I mean by freewill, but is more accurately referred to as contra-causal freewill. 

It is central to the Christian faith because without it, Adam and Eve could not have ""chosen"" differently, and God stacked the cards from the start.

A few years ago as an intern at [Wolf Park](http://www.wolfpark.org), I went down there with a group to see how other wildlife facilities are run and we got an awesome tour from Joe Taft, the director. It's like a labyrinth of corridors and enclosures, definitely not a controlled environment like at a zoo, which I think adds to the awesomeness. You walk in the entrance and you're likely to see staff cutting apart a dead cow with a sawz-all (they take dead livestock off local farmer's hands so the farmers don't have to pay a rendering plant to haul it off), and the paths take you right beside the enclosures so you gotta watch out because the tigers like to turn around and spray at people. A lot of those animals have some crazy horrible back stories, so it's cool that they are so well cared-for. They even have an in-house animal hospital for the cats, complete with operating room.

On topic, however; To me it seems there is a circular logic that really doesn't resolve itself, and even in her own bi-polar argument, she doesn't so much win as stalemate.

It's almost as if its portrayed that with out religion we end up living at the end of each others proverbial gun. That, instead of living a moral life by choice, inherited behavior, and group dynamics, we are living merely to not get shot.

I see it more as we as a collective society live by established moral rules that are both group derived, as well as inherited from the generation before. 

We have built a society around ourselves that values certain things as good, and certain things as bad. Religion takes credit for it, but its group behavior. We have decided as a group, that stealing is bad, and killing for the sake of killing is bad.

The next group over might see things slightly different, but their group and inherited behavior may be slightly different. (isolated by geography, race, or maybe other cultural differences).

We see variations within the groups (abnormalities) where say Mental disorders, or even 'wrong' behavior being inherited that goes against the group dynamic but our established group collective ""morality"" is established to deal with it.","1280625758"

False analogy, straw man, you don't really need fancy logical fallacy names to explain why what you're doing fails, hard. Invalid reasoning to reach a true conclusion is still fallacious.


edit: Got a lot of criticism and this applies to all of it, will just throw it in here so I don't have to copypaste it to all comments

An analogy is an argument about arguments (i know, meta, just bow out if you can't handle it) claiming that they are similar - its purpose is to suggest if one is false (or true), then the other must be too. The analogy posted above me does NOT describe the structure of the argument it is trying to - the one I posted here does. It keeps in tact the logical structure of the premise, reasoning and conclusion. You are objecting because the person above me posted an analogy from an argument which is based on false premises (anti-evolution) to one based on false premises (adding numbers to get a million), and disregarded the entirety of the deductive structure of the first argument. I kept in tact the structure of the argument, but made an analogy from an argument based on false premises (anti-evolution) to one based on true premises (the one about i). I did this to make you uncomfortable as it forces you to seperate the argument structure from the content. 

Of course, analogies are almost always false and always used because one or more parties to a debate is too stupid to understand the argument without them. ","1280625760"

Usually, the people who put together a campaign find staffers by asking the people they've been on campaigns with before - people who were very involved, did a lot of work, seemed good, etc.  It's people networking.  So volunteering on some campaigns is likely to lead to a job on some others in the future, if you want it.

There are other paths.  Being a prominent blogger, working for a politically active organization, attending trainings, etc.  Basically, stuff that gets you in regular contact with the sort of people who are likely to be putting together campaigns in your area.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","An atheist doesn't necessarily believe that gods are not possible. An atheist is typically just a person who is not convinced by the proposed evidence or philosophical arguments, or they may just not be interested in religion at all.

In the question of aliens, it's ""more possible"" because of the sheer number of suns in the galaxy that could have habitable planets orbiting around them, plus the age of the universe. In other words, we can use *observable information* to come to this conclusion, and there isn't any observable information that would contradict the conclusion. It's more likely than a supernatural entity because life on Earth is pretty explainable without one. Adding a deity only adds another layer of complexity.

Our understanding of life also has predictive power. We can see an ancient fossil and use evolutionary theory to predict what its descendants would look like a million years later. Then we find the descendant fossils, and the prediction turns out to be correct.

From a [recent article](http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn13677-evolution-myths-evolution-is-not-predictive.html):

&gt;Nevertheless, although evolution's predictive power might appear limited, the theory can be and is used to make predictions at all sorts of levels. Darwin realised that the Earth must be very old for there to have been enough time for all the life on it to evolve. It has turned out to be even older than he thought.

&gt;He also predicted that transitional fossils would be discovered, and millions (trillions if you count microfossils) have been. Researchers have even been able to predict the age and kind of rocks in which certain transitional fossils should occur, as with the half-fish, half-amphibian Tiktaalik.

&gt;Or take the famous peppered moth, which evolved black colouration to adapt to pollution-stained trees during industrialisation in Britain. Remove the pollution and the light strain should once again predominate, which is just what is happening.

&gt;Perhaps the most striking prediction in biology was made in 1975 by entomologist Richard Alexander. After studying the evolution of eusocial insects such as termites, he predicted that some burrowing rodents in the tropics might have evolved the same eusocial system - as later proved to be the case with the naked mole-rat.

""Intelligent design,"" meanwhile, does not possess this function. It is not useful as an educational tool, because it does not have the explanatory power of evolutionary theory. Instead, it insists that we accept the introduction of a magical being to explain what evolutionary theory *already explains* very well.","1280625783"

""The major religions are incorrect because they make claims that are demonstrably false.""

Or, on a more extreme side:

""I agree with Christopher Hitchens, religion is caustic, malicious and malignant.""

If the Atheist backs this up with an argument and explanation, what is wrong with that?  The problem now is that politicians say ""I believe in God, He exists,"" and sometimes even ""He wants you to do X, Y and Z.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","We were at a party at a house on a rural road, next to a curve in the road. Some were drinking and smoking weed.  About half of us were tripping.  It was dark out, around 10pm.  My best friend and I were sitting on the front porch, listening to the crickets and looking at the stars.

A car comes down the road at a good clip.  Near the house, it starts to make unexpected noises: screetch, screeeeeeeetch, CHIRP,  SCUUUUUUUURRRRRG!!  Later I figured out that the driver had skidded, overcompensated, skidded completely sideways, and flipped the car onto its roof; but at the moment it was happening it made zero sense to us.  Totally not the expected behavior of a car when you're tripping.  Or any other time, I guess.

My friend and I just looked at each other.  ""Did... did that just happen?  Did a car just wreck in front of us?""  We agreed that it had, and walked toward the road.  

Headlights on the upside-down, non-moving car were still on, music was coming out of the windows.  As we're walking toward the car, we see a guy pull himself out of the window.  He stares at the car, puts his hands on his head in a gesture of despair, and yells ""FUCK!!!!  FUUUUUUCCK!!!  FUUUUUUUUUCCKK!!!!"".  Then he turns and runs down the road in the direction he'd come from.  We hadn't even walked the length of the lawn.  We had to confirm with each other that we really did see the shout and run act, too.

The tape deck was still playing Lynrd Skynrd.  We stared at it for a bit.  Didn't want to see if there were any injured people inside.  Worked up the nerve - no, car's empty. No one's listening to the tape.  Crawled half-way in, ejected the tape.  My friend took it, marveling at it... wondering if Skynrd had caused the crash by some bad voodoo (we weren't fans of the band).

We had it together enough to know that the headlights should be left on, in case another car came along.  We went inside and told people.  They thought we were telling a crazy story because we were tripping.  We insisted they come outside, they ""played along"", and then they were all ""holy shit! there's been an accident!""  Yeah... we said that...

The police came along.  They came up to the house, wanted to come inside and look around.  A couple of tripping folks had a calm conversation with them - No, they weren't at our party. No, we didn't see the driver.  No, he's not here.  No, you can't come into the house.  He's not here, really.  He ran down the road.  Yes, down the road. Towards town.  No, really, he did.  No, we couldn't see what he looked like.  No, you can't come in.  Finally they decided that it was actually a coincidence that the wreck happened in front of a party.

The rest of the evening was pretty mellow.

About thirty minutes into the drive, a loud explosion went off about 300 meters ahead of my vehicle.  The air erupted with gunfire and rocket propelled grenades began to fly through the air.  My humvee's gunner began to return fire, then a message came over the radio that Marines had been wounded.  We drove ahead to where it had occurred and I exited the vehicle with my trauma gear.  Laying on the ground in a lake of blood was a Marine who had both of his arms blown off and large avulsions on both of his legs.  The corpsmen who had gotten there before me had placed tourniquets on three of his limbs.  There was nothing I could do to help, so we rolled him onto tarp and carried him to a truck and loaded him onto the back.  As reports of more casualties came in, I got back in our humvee and headed further out.  

I saw a Marine kneeling down with a painful expression on his face, clutching his tourniqueted arm.  Except for a bullet wound, he appeared to be in reasonable shape.  I handed him a morphine auto-injector and he plunged it into his own thigh.  I got back in the truck.

When I sat down, my Staff Sergeant told me about a Marine who had gone down across the canal that ran alongside the road.  I grabbed my medical gear and looked for a place to cross the canal, but there was no bridge in sight.  I hoisted my bag above my head and waded through the waist-deep brown water until I reached the other side.  There I found a young officer who was surrounded by several enlisted men who were propping him up into a sitting position.  He had been bandaged below his right armpit and above his left hip.  Suspecting a single bullet wound, I removed the upper bandage and prepared to apply an occlusive dressing to prevent a tension pneumothorax.  Retrieving one from my thigh pouch, I pressed it onto the wound, only to realize that it would not stick because it had become soaked as I waded through the canal. Frustrated, I wrapped the wound with gauze as best as I could and we loaded him into our truck (which had found a crossing over to the area) in hopes of evacuating him to a safer location.  As we sat him down, he rolled over a bit and the bandage slipped just enough to reveal the wound.  About a liter of blood began pouring out of the hole immediately, as if his torso was an open bottle and it had been tipped over on its side.  Massive internal hemorrhaging.

We got him back to a safer location and pulled him out and laid him down on the dirt.  He asked me if he was going to die.  I told him he'd be OK.  One of the recon corpsmen, who had been trained to a much higher degree than I, rushed over to assist me.  We reinforced the bandages and got our IV equipment ready.  We tried his arms, we tried his legs, eventually we tried to get a catheter in his jugular vein.  Everything had collapsed.

By the time the helicopter arrived, his eyes were black pools.  I loaded him in and we started trying to revive him.  The helicopter took off with me inside it.  The officer was dead.

When we landed, I went to the communications tent and told them to radio my unit and let them know what happened to me.  I felt awful about leaving them behind, though things had calmed down by the time the heli landed.  I sat down on the ground.  The sleeves of my uniform were soaked up to the elbows in blood.  A Navy Chaplain came over to me and used his canteen to wash the blood off of my hands.  I walked to the laundromat.    ","1280625859"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","hmmm...going back to 2000 would be interesting for me.  I was 8, so it would be sorta hard to do anything to take advantage of anything I now know (I suppose I could go the ""8 year old boy genius shows knowledge of calculus"" route, I'd probably end up just suppressing most of the the academic stuff I've learned so I would fit in).  

It was right before I started my 5-6 year long fat phase.  Not sure if I'd do anything to try to avoid it, I'd probably just not worry about it as much, because I'd know that by the time it actually mattered (early high school), I'd be fit again.  

I've also got a couple of your standard ""I didn't act on a crush, but I will this time,"" type things, one of them really major, that I'd definitely go back and change.  And just in general, there'd be some people I'd spend more time with, and some people I'd spend less time with.  

But what would really make going back to 2000 interesting is that it was the year my mom died (October 31....worst Halloween ever).  Just in itself, going back and having her be alive would be a trip, but I honestly can't say what I'd do, knowing that I only had 10 months left with her (assuming we're waking up on New Year's day).

You are clueless as to public finance because you seem to think that spending from the social security system is different than wealth transfers from any other programs. It is misinformation to not include that in a breakdown of federal spending. You cannot possibly make an economic argument as to how it is different.

He also talks about it being ""all Dawkins-centric"" when that's really not the case at all: people are **more** than willing to criticize Dawkins on things they disagree with him with -- and it happens to be the case that I am one such person.

Second, what was her emotional state during the date?  What kind of body language did she give you?  Her emotional state will provide you with the cues you need to guide the interaction.  If she is giving you negative energy (short answers, distracted, in her own head with distressed or restless body language) you need to react to that accordingly.  There are several ways to get a woman from a low energy state to a high energy state.  Which is the best?  Debatable.  Sometimes there's nothing you can really do, and you have to respect her and give her space because nothing else will really shake her out of it.  Other times its something of a shit test (albeit, a subconscious one).

Third, sounds like you're in the Friend Zone.  No worries.  You have an experience to learn from.  Approach more women, this time armed with the lesson from this FR: use her emotional state as your guide.  When she IOIs, escalate kino.  When she is low energy, respect it.  When she is high energy, reward that with kino (which creates a sexual bond between the two of you that will lead to sex, if you follow her emotional cues properly).","1280625986"

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","My 2 cents on the Aeropress (Which I've had for a little over 2 years)
(( I also own and use a French Press  ))

The main differences between an Aeropress and a French press is 

* 
A) You get a stronger brew from the Aeropress

* B) It's faster than a French press
* C) You can make single cup brews with the Aeropress

I really can't compare it with an espresso machine, because they're on completely different levels of coffee making. (Aeropress $20.00; Espresso machine ~$1,000) And, it doesn't make the same type of coffee as an espresso machine.



You have the same control over the extraction time with an aeropress as you do with a French press, although the time required for an Aeropress is around 30 seconds as opposed to 3 mins with a French press. I don't know about uniform extraction from either, because I'm not sure what that means. 

It really requires very little cleaning. It takes me around 30 seconds to clean it off when I'm done using it. You rinse the filter holder and coffee tube  under warm water, rinse the plunger, and wipe it off with a paper towel. The paper filters (package of 350) are easy to get from Amazon.com for around $5.00. 

By now, I think it is well know that the Aeropress produces good results, and for 20 bucks I don't think you can go wrong.","1280626007"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","You make a fair point. However, I feel feminism has been subject to ""dirty word"" syndrome more than the examples you've given. 

Fundamentalists exist in all walks of life, sadly - and yes, they do give certain groups a bad name. 

But I feel what gets taken for militant/extreme/funadamentalist within feminism is far tamer in comparison to what will get taken for the same within other isms. 

It's a sad fact that if people are treated unfairly, they will often express themselves negatively. Women are not exempt from this. I'm not saying I agree with it, I'm just stating a fact. 

I am a feminist and in no way hate men or see myself as superior to them. My feminist friends are the same. But we're not the ones who catch people's attention. You've probably met more ""decent"" feminists than you even realise because they won't have advertised it to you or said something you have found distasteful. 

Often, within oppressed groups (which women still very much are all over the world), the oppressees (is that even a word?) will attempt to give themselves privilages since society affords them so few. The simplest way to do this is often through linguistic privilages. So you have jokes that are acceptable for one group to make but not another etc etc. 

This (as we have seen through other movements) can lead to a lot of misunderstanding and anger from the group that doesn't realise these linguistic privilages are often all the oppressed group has. 

These militant feminists you're talking about may not be going about things in the right way, but they're not angry for no reason. Absolutely, they should learn to express it in a more positive way, but I hope that people can learn to understand that their anger comes from being victims of an inequal society, purely because they happened to be born female.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;No, my issue is with your claim that those people exist

They do.  I know one.  Sure, it's anecdotal evidence, but if I'm countering the claim that none exist, then I only need one case anyway to disprove it.

&gt; that is entirely unproven; and the former is not proven in any meaningful context.

The guy I responded to what trying to present his numbers as if they meant something meaningful.

All I have to do is give a reasonable chink in that armor.  It is then up to him to show that the chink I presented isn't relevant.  (And even then, he'd only have to do that in order to satisfy people who think the chink may actually be relevant, of which I am one.  If you don't find the concept relevant in the least, then that's your prerogative.)

I showed a reasonable process by which that chink can take effect.  ""dawkins attacks"" and ""attacks can entrench"".  Nothing has yet been said to address that possibility.

I don't need need to show that it actually happened in order to have it be an issue with the validity of the numbers.

For example:  If I proposed that redheads are smarter than brunettes, and then gave you a set of IQ tests from 40 students that supported that... I can make objections about it not being a representative sample and that is enough for those numbers to not support the claim properly now.  [I don't have to actually run my own study and prove a counter claim... I just have to submit a reasonable connected mechanism.]

Or example with AGW:  Maybe solar output is actually causing our current Global Warming problems, which makes the hockeystick charts, etc much less convincing that it is anthropogenic.  Now...  scientists took that reasonable complaint, ran studies, and showed that it isn't a significant component, rendering that concern not a concern.  But until they had done so, that concern was enough to make reasonable doubt to the anthropogenic causes of GW.

See how it works?  One person presents numbers to support a claim (which is what I responded to).  Another person (me) says ""no, those numbers are insufficient because you didn't accounts for this other factor that could be relevant"".  Then someone either says ""your process is not relevant because there is no connection"" (which doesn't apply here because I showed the connection very clearly, and you apparently don't object to it) or presents some information that wraps the new concern in while still supporting their position, or concedes the point.

&gt;And you would be wrong to do so without supporting materials to document the claim

As I said, I don't intend do.  We can't agree on the basic fundamentals of what constitutes relevance.  It is way out of our abilities now to dig into a specific instance.","1280626035"

Well worth reading.

In television, the (now canceled) series ""Joan of Arcadia"" showed Christians as regular people who often had a positive impact.  Of course, it was a bit of a weird show - how many others have God showing up in person every episode?  But that said, it wasn't nearly as preachy as Touched By An Angel or other Christian shows, and stayed well away from any particular brand of Christianity...or, really, any sign of Christianity *per se*.  

Also in television, the old but popular M\*A\*S\*H series had a likable pastor who often served as a moral voice and yet was well liked by the other characters and (generally) the fans.

You need to have a comparison matrix. Show a list of services, show your competitors and where they are lacking; where you are offering more.

They also thought (as did I on my three month trip there) that they would walk down the street or into a bar, and have Japanese girls throwing themselves at them, begging for sex, love, or marriage.

Or that they would become a host, paid to take Japanese chicks out for dinners, drinks, dancing, romance and sex, all paid for by the woman.

The truth is, the only ones who got laid stayed there for a very long time, and ended up hanging out at places like the Western bars, where only Japanese girls with a fetish for white guys and no concern what people think of them would go.

It's a bit like white girls going to an all black bar in the US- the minute they walk in, they are labelled.

The Japanese chicks you meet overseas who hook up with you are the ones who leave Japan to fulfil their sexual/emotional fantasies. The ones who stay in Japan wouldn't usually dare be seen with a white guy- the US military and drunken player yanks, aussies, and brits have ruined any chance of us having a good reputation there.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Ok, for example, from the Ivy League entry:

&gt;This extreme numerical over-representation of Jews among the senior administrators of the Ivy League colleges and universities cannot be explained away as a coincidence or as the result of mere random chance. You must ask yourself how such an incredibly small and extremely unrepresentative minority ethnic group that only represents 2% of the American population could so completely dominate the administration of America's leading colleges and universities.

I have asked myself this question, and the conclusion I have come to is that the Jews are over-represented in the fields of academia, various sciences, finance, media, information technology etc., because they are:

* studious
* often of extremely high intelligence
* driven by culture and family to achieve in these fields (the best revenge is to live well)
* greed^H^H^H^H^H fiscally astute
* nepotistic, tribal, conspiratorial?
* and so on

Perhaps that is a stereotype, but if you've taken a look at the kabbalah and other jewish religious teachings, you'd see that they are extremely complex and require years of deep study and research. Much like the hindu religion(s), studying this shit requires a lot of hard work and brainpower, and makes you a smarter and more capable adult than the average TV-raised dumbed down westerner.

Maybe I'm stereotyping but I've spent years looking into this stuff and have yet to be convinced that the Jewish World Conspiracy theory is more compelling that the Diverse Rich Fuckers World Conspiracy theory (a theory that allows for over-representation of Jews amongst the Diverse Rich Fuckers, due to reason outlined above).

And it's not through lack of research or ignorance... I've told you before I've read much of TIU and listened to lots of their podcasts etc. I've seen everything on WRH and listened to everything Texe Marrs has put out. I've lurked stormfront and just finished reading On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.

I'm not convinced, and despite the recent rise in postings to this subreddit regarding the Jewish World Conspiracy, I don't think many of us here are convinced either.

But as usual I'll get downvoted for this...

I sealed it off, built a base and a staircase going down the 500m deep shaft to the floor and started mining all the useful stuff out of this massive underground cave. Once done, I decided to channel the underwater spring and dig a hole to the outside so I could boat in and out...except what I actually did was discover *another* deep shaft that the water (and I) promptly poured down into an even larger underground cavern.


From there mined a bunch more stuff, and seeing as getting up would take forever anyway I decided to dig deeper into the cave. I found a waterfall and jumped down it and found a great big underground lava chamber full of all sorts of rare metals, and a tunnel leading away. I climbed through *this* tunnel and found **another** great big underground cavern, this one full of monsters. I quickly sealed up the choke point and stuck a door there, building myself another  base in here from where I could launch expeditions. Low on wood I decided to plant trees everywhere in my little underground home for future resources, which a skeleton then decided would be an ample time to shoot at me through the door, taking me down to 1 health.

"energy","t5_2qhkd","Specifically to your reservation on solar power's potential:

The earth gets around 174 petawatts of power from the sun all the time (depending on our location in orbit). Around 85 of those petawatts are reflected or absorbed above ground/sea level, so we have the (unattainable) potential to generate 89 petawatts of energy. Assuming we only try to collect 1% of that energy at 1% efficiency, we still have 8.9 terawatts of energy for use. Current human energy use averages around 15 terawatts, so solar can play a significant part in our energy future.

Don't forget, that is just terrestrial solar energy. There is space solar energy as well (however impractical it is at this point).","1280626267"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This is something my grandmother saw on a two lane highway in Mississippi in the 60's, not something I saw. Just something that has always stuck with me. 

She was driving from Mobile Alabama to Jackson Mississippi early in the evening to go see a relative or something, I can't recall the reason for the trip.  She stopped at a gas station and struck up a conversation with a truck driver not much older than her, mid twenties or so.  I got the impression she thought he was cute. They said their goodbyes and he drove off two or three minutes before her. 

Ten miles down the road she saw where another car had hit him causing his truck to end up on his side on a small bridge over a creek. The gas tank of either the truck or car had been punctured and a small fire had started. It wasn't large but it was growing quickly. There were two cars in front of her and as she drove up some men were trying to find a way to get to the driver out.  The driver was conscious and yelling. My grandmother got out of her car and could see that the fire was growing around the cab. Because of the bridge and angle of the cab the men on her side couldn't get to the cab before the fire reached it. Someone had left to go find a phone or help but by the time they returned 20 minutes later it was too late. My grandmother and the men returned to their cars and one of them left, I guess because he didn't want to stay there not being able to help. My grandmother wasn't familiar with the roads there so she went back to her car and waited for the road to clear. She told me she heard the man crying for help for ten minutes before he finally burned to death. 

She said it wasn't loud screams of terror, just the pleading cries for help.

She didn't really 'see' anything, but hearing someone scream for help and knowing she couldn't do anything about it fucked with her head for a few weeks.  Plus she had just had a conversation with the got not even an hour before.

If you want to be really cool/smooth you can learn to give it a bit of gas as you push the clutch in so that it revs up a bit, and then as it's dropping back down in revs you let the clutch out so that it catches it at around 2 or 3k and goes up from there. The revs shouldn't drop much lower than 2k (depending on the car of course)

Also, pay attention to when you shift. If it's flat you can shift lower in the gear. If it's uphill, rev it up a bit higher than normal before you shift.

Lastly, I just go 1st to 3rd in my car by revving it slightly higher in 1st and working the clutch a tiny bit as I let it out and it's crazy smooth going from 0-45 mph. You could try that?","1280626426"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Your points are well taken, and we are dealing with anecdotal evidence at best.  I'm not aware of any studies proving or disproving the parent replacement issue.  My (admittedly anecdotal) evidence is based on my career in healthcare.  I have the opportunity to ask a lot of people a lot of questions about their present situation (social history) and their family history. It is uncanny how many people recreate their childhood in their adult life.  Interestingly enough, I think women are more prone to do this than men are - a huge number of women who don't know their fathers will be single mothers with no male involvement in child rearing, women with alcoholic/addict fathers will seek those men out for mates, etc.  It's almost to the point where you can guess the social history once you have the answers to the family history when you're dealing with certain issues.

As far as the relationship modeling thing, I think the outcomes are much more subtle than the (very logical) conclusions you drew from my examples.  I think the issues are more about communication styles, ability to trust, dealing with interpersonal conflict, and dealing with stress vs. cooking style and other less emotion oriented activities.  I'm also acknowledging that people change as they gain experience.  This kind of thinking (in my opinion, anyway) is much more accurate for someone in their early to mid twenties.

You raised a really interesting point about the same sex couple issue.  The only same sex couple interested in kids I'm close enough to talk with this stuff about is still trying to conceive, so I have zero personal experience with this.

Give and take does not mean you physically take something from someone, it means you expect reciprocity. Honestly, feeling the way you do isn't healthy, it clearly demonstrates that you have an *extremely* low opinion of yourself - you need to work on yourself before you try anything with anyone else. If you don't know how to go about helping yourself, find someone that can connect you with the right resources - therapists are good for this.

&gt;All I want is to make the other person happy, I don't feel they should ever have to make a compromise for me

They can hire help to do that for them. They're looking for *relationships*, with people they *respect*, not hired hands. It's impossible to respect someone who has no respect for themselves. 'Taking' in this context is nothing more than commanding respect based on who you are as a person. No self-respect (worrying about appearing selfish because you are who you are? Big red flag) = no respect from others; unless you're interested in the whole sub-dom culture you're not giving yourself the best chance at developing a healthy, normal relationship based on mutual respect and reciprocity. *You and your feelings matter every bit as much as her and hers* - you need to start rethinking things a bit here. You don't need to treat a girl disrespectfully to show confidence, but you shouldn't put up with a girl treating you disrespectfully as well - something that's hard to do when you have no self-respect, when you feel you don't have a right to expect proper treatment as an equal in a partnership.


&gt;If I'm in a relationship I don't want to feel aloof,


The 'devil may care' attitude isn't a game, it's a way of life. It's living life for yourself *first* and letting everything else come in stride as an outgrowth of your own likes and passions. Flirty aloofness is a tactic - it helps *in the early stages* in hooking a girl's attention, making her curious as to what's going on there, who is this stranger and why does she find him so ...compelling. It's not a game, you aren't there attempting to misrepresent who you are as a person, there's just simply no reason to lay everything out on the table in front of every girl with potential you meet. Keeping yourself emotionally distant kills two birds with one stone - it piques interest and it protects you, keeping you from getting your heart too involved in a girl at the outset, giving you the time you need to figure out if you really want to go there with this particular girl. Protecting your heart and sanity is no game - it's smart, and will leave your head clear enough to recognize every girl with potential, giving you a better shot at finding someone you truly click with.","1280626506"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""I was in a band in college and we played a show this one weekend. I was pretty smashed after drinking for free all night, and this surprisingly cute chick saunters up and started with the whole, ""oh my god, you like write songs and stuff?"" Despite the fact that I am usually a bit shy in situations like this, she had her arm around me and is doing all the work. ""Fuck it, let's do this,"" I think to myself. While she is mid-sentence, I grabbed her hand and started walking her out the door.

We headed back to her apartment, and things started to heat up. We were on her bed, ripping off eachother's clothes. Suddenly, in one swift move, she pounced me, knocked me onto my back, jumped on top of me, spun around and started sucking me off, 69 style. I was totally into it, and started reciprocating. Only a few moments pass before I felt a tap on my forehead. My face was fully between her legs, yet there was this tap tap tap on my forehead. Every couple of seconds, tap tap tap. This tapping continued and started to take me out of the moment. I pried my face from between her legs to get a better view of what was going on. To my horror, I witnessed, dangling from her asshole, a fucking tape worm, bouncing like a fettuccine noodle with every excited movement she made. I was totally disgusted, but kind of in shock, and she had no idea what is going on, just gobbling away down there. Before I knew it, I had thrown her off of me and I was stringing together a long series of ""fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck"" as I put on my pants and ran out the door.""

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok so from what you said there are two things you can buy. You can either buy a small netbook like laptop to do school work on, and everything else like games and so forth be done using your home desktop. Or if you want to you can buy a beefy well built laptop, and not worry about laptop problems ever.                    
So if you want a netbook like thing, I suggest you spend around 399$ and buy one of the acer netbooks, I am a comp sci student, and it suffices for all my programming needs (only problem is that compile times take around 2 min on heavy programs).         
But if you want a beefy laptop here is what you need.      
I agree woth bigpoop that i5 will suffice, but do go for i7, way better, and to top it off, you laptop will stay up to current technology for longer.              
As for RAM you do not really need 4GB, 2GB RAM will suffice for everything. If you want to run windows 7, it only takes 1GB, and even starcraft 2 only requires 1GB RAM.              
As for SSD and HDD there is not much difference. If you are a clumsy person, I suggest you get SSD, because if you drop your laptop and you have HDD, then it will create a scratch on the disk and to put it simply you will be fucked.       
For battery get 9 cell battery, even though its ugly, it will be wonderfull to use it while you are commuting to school, given that you ride subways.       
For OS I suggest you get windows 7 32-bit edition, since it only requires 1GB RAM unlike the 64-bit that requires 2GB RAM. The difference is amount of command sent on the bus, 32 bit sends 32 bits per command, and 64 sends 64 bits per command. Difference is a bit of speed, but unless you give a damn whether your browser opens few nanoseconds quicker I suggest you get 32 bit one. As soon as you get it, partition your hard drive, and deligate 30 or 40GB of space for ubuntu, and dual boot it(if you need help on that PM me). Do all the entertainment stuff on ubuntu, since it never gets viruses and is faster than windows, and do school work on windows 7.        
As for graphics, since you will not be doing heavy gaming, I would say anything will suffice. GForce or NVidia are recomended thou.      
That is all, and now just to answer the questions you asked.       
        
Processors      
1) GHz is amount of instructions per second, 1 Hz is 1 instruction.      
2) cores: they are very important. one core does one instruction, 4 cores can do 4 instructions at once (if the program is written properly). But since most of the programs nowadays are written without considering cores, then you do not need to many. To play crysis on highest you only need 3 cores, since thats how the programming is written. So just get Quad core and live happily, until programmers are forced to write programs that use all the cores.        
3) In general I suggest you get i7-620M processor, it will not give you any trouble.        
              
RAM            
2GB RAM will be good for pretty much anything, if you want to get 4GB, but more than that is just stupid. RAM works like this. Lets say you are in the library, it has many books, so lets say you take certain amount of books and take them to your table. The amount of books you table can hold is like RAM. if your table is huge and it can hold millions of books, then it will be just as troublesome looking for them on your table, as it was finding them on the shelfs. That is why you do not need huge RAM.       
       
OS        
Windows 7 is good for school work, since you are not going to have any difficulties using word and such. And Ubuntu or Linux mint is good for entertainment, since you will never get viruses. If you are advanced user I suggest using only Linux, if not, then dual boot it. I can help you with dual booting.    
And for graphics just choose NVidia, or GeForce","1280626523"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","I think you're responding to a different point.  I was talking about dollars leaving the US eventually probably returning.  However, as I said, it's notionally possible that dollars can circulate in other nation's economies without having to be used to purchase US goods and services, invest in US businesses etc.  

The likelihood of this is very low, but, for example, last night I spent $10 on a Vietnamese meal in a Vietnamese restaurant run by Vietnamese people.  Tomorrow they may bank it in a US dollar denominated account, spend it on some other local goods and services, buy gold, exchange it into local currency, buy goods or services from a US owned/run business or any or a whole myriad of other options.  Only some of these would result in those dollars or their equivalent making their way back to the US.  In the longer term, the likelihood of return approaches 1, but it's not inevitable.

Edit:  I should clarify that in Vietnam, whilst not strictly legal tender, US dollars are widely accepted and, unless you're paying taxes or visa fees (and I believe it's also illegal to require payment in dollars or even advertise only dollar prices), you can pretty much use dollars as if they were local currency.  This isn't the case in many countries - try paying for something in dollars in the UK and it's unlikely to be accepted.","1280626532"

Yeah, I know people who have games the system on the statute of limitations with credit card debt, and I think it's a shitty thing for someone like me, who pays their debts, but the law is the law and the protections I enjoy under this system can allow others the opportunity to exploit it, provided that creditors see that kind of behavior as an acceptable risk, which is what this all boils down to in the first place because no one really knows if they will be able to pay off a debt that is not settled by the end of the day, period.","1280626609"

 the Republicans who when in power couldn't have cared less about the deficit by virtue of lessening gov't spending

when any number of studies have shown this to be the most ineffective kind of stimulus (because the rich can afford to sit on the money)

Who spent another TRILLION dollars, not to mention several thousand American lives, on Iraq full well knowing there was no threat 

and whose deregulatory policies fueled the financial collapse

who turned Clinton's deficit surplus into a deficit

who have denied a fraction of all that money for unemployment  benefits to the people that they helped so much become unemployed

even though it is, unlike their policies, very stimulatory and DOES pay for itself

Now we know that this was a mistake and played a huge part in the current recession.  I have to say that i side with the economists on this issue. This is because there is no way to help those less fortunate if businesses cannot thrive (as long as they operate honestly) enough to employ more workers.

"trackers","t5_2rjuw","This post is in regard to how the record labels and production companies complain about how piracy will kill their profits and cause layoffs for thousands of employees. It is also in regard to how releasing your content (music, videos, and programs) for free, you can still earn a very respectable income.

Take for example the (not exactly TV) show Pioneer One. It was made and paid for via donations from torrent users. Because it was entirely based on donations, it had eligibility to have free advertising on the frontpages of many torrent sites, most notably The Pirate Bay. When the show was released, people liked it so much, that they donated so more episodes could be made. Pretty much instantly after debuting the first episode, they received enough money in donations to make another three, which will lead to more and more donations.
Also, with music, musicians barely make shit off of selling albums if there is a huge record label involved. The main way they make money, is by their concerts and merchandise.
I would rather pirate a CD and then donate what the album costed directly to the band rather than buy the CD and see pretty much all of the money go towards the record label and let the artist see just a small amount of it.
By giving the consumer the option of getting something free, it appeals more to the senses, and makes them WANT to give money to the people who made it. People don't want to be strong-armed by huge companies with CEOs that make irrational amounts of money. If when I buy a DVD, I have to sit through COMMERCIALS and ADVERTISEMENTS for something I just bought. It is ridiculous.

I also think, that if companies want people to pay for their products (those that can be transmitted through the internet of course), they have to give incentive. Like I said earlier, why do I have to PAY to watch the advertisements on TV or in the movie theaters, when for free I can watch it with no advertisements (although, during the commercials I can put my time to good use, browsing reddit).

Just like companies though cassettes were going to ruin the entertainment industry as well as CDs and DVDs, it hasn't happened. Companies have to put more faith in their products. If they make a good product, people will want to pay for it (or at least some of it).

If you are a pirate, please get Netflix. It's only $9 a month, and with all the stuff you can stream, it's worth it. Then at least you can support some of the companies your are COPYING from (pirating=/=theft). Also, once Hulu Plus is formally launched, consider it (though I wouldn't get it yet, not until we know it's not going to be completely shitty, and they get shows faster, and more shows).

If you pirate because you're dirt poor, or there's simply no other easier way to get the content, it shouldn't be a problem. But if you at least have some money, please consider buying Netflix or at least some of the shows or music that you really love (though donating directly to the makers is best, so that those pesky corporations don't get a dime of it).

And these massive lawsuits against piracy HAVE to stop. They are ridiculous. It makes more sense to shoplift than to pirate. If the person pirating something isn't making a profit off it, leave them alone. Though, if a person is making a profit off it by bootlegging it and selling it, I do have a problem with that. It's plain stupid to give a sue a college kid for a million dollars. These are scare tactics, and they should be stopped.

The companies need to evolve as technology evolves, otherwise, more people will pirate, which after all, might not be such a bad thing as some people make it out to be.

But anyways, I would love the invite. I seed to 2.00 ratio or more when I can, my uTorrent is always open, because I never really need any of the upload speeds since I never have to upload videos or pictures. &lt;3","1280626834"

I ran out of the living room out to the back garden. There was my step father, rolling on the concrete yard, foaming at the mouth. He was having an epileptic fit. Hias clothes were slightly bloodied from his fall, and all damp from the previous rainfall.

I'm not exactly sure, maybe there's more to the question that I'm getting. 

She seemed interested in the stuff we were doing, and found the places fun and interesting (as did I). It was engaging stuff.

&gt;What kind of body language did she give you?

It was her body language as it normally is.

Which is fine. Except, I dont know what in the world I could have done better to get a better response. I did what I could as far as I can tell.

The trash bag works because it comes sterile, presumably, but I've never tried that.  If you use a trash bag, put it in a container and tie it off with a lot of room to grow.  The CO2 production should puff up the bag, which you may need to vent depending on the size of the bag.

A single brewer's yeast packet should suffice.  I usually use liquid yeast which cost $5, but there are dry yeast packets also.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","I agree with jax9999 about Beautiful Thing, though my first introduction to it was reading the play, which I liked better than the movie. It's just one of those plays(movies) that makes you feel good. Also, I thought the coming out aspect of the play was relatively realistic, at least to my own experience.

Here's my list:

""To Wong Foo"" (Full title: ""To Wong Foo, thanks for everything, Julie Newmar"") is perhaps my favorite movie of all time. It's campy, hilarious, fun, and heartwarming. Not at all realistic, but that's not the point.

""I Love You, Phillip Morris"" was very well done, and really adorable. Also, Ewan McGregor rocks my socks.

""Angels in America."" If Ewan McGregor rocks my socks, then Meryl Streep rocks the rest of my clothing.

""Goldfish Memory"". Really, this is just ""relationship"" themed, but two of the couples featured are gay (one male couple, one female couple). Anyway, it's a really well-done film that just looks at life and love and what people do, and manages to be both very real (good characters do bad things, what?) and very entertaining. Also check out ""A Four-Letter Word"" for a gayer-but-not-as-good version.

""Friends and Family"". This is campy as all hell (and with all the gays down there, apparently, hell is very campy), but so enjoyable. Also, the lead couple is very attractive (you don't think so at first, but they grow on you). My primary objection is that they never kiss, and in the adorable moment at the end, you feel really deprived that they don't.

""Le Cage Aux Folles"". It's an oldie, but it's remembered for a reason. Hilarious from start to finish. Also, the original French version is so much better. And that's saying something; I really enjoyed the American version, too.

Of course, ""Milk"" was a phenomenal movie.","1280626916"

""No, I am a strong advocate for men's rights...but men are oppressed in Western civilization, and women are oppressed under Islam.""

You see the world in black and white, with all misandry happening in the West and all misogyny happening the East. There is sexism everywhere, I'm afraid, and it's not always against one group. There are ways women are screwed over in the West, just as there are ways men are screwed over in the East. Islam oppresses both genders by forcing them to adhere to strict gender roles.

Touching on men a little bit, men in Islam have to support women, no matter what. And there is a lot of Muslim scripture that demeans men, such as the Hadith where Mohammed was asked who deserves the most love and respect. He said that﻿ ""the mother is number 1, number 2, and number 3; and, then the father comes after that.""; meaning that fathers only get 1/4 the respect and love that mothers get, in that religion...

Again, I think you're being apprehensive about this and are jumping to conclusions. It's blinding you to how bad men's lives are in third world countries, and it's creating a false dichotomy between men's rights vs. women's rights, and west vs. east. Remember, everywhere there is sexism, and there lies our enemy.","1280626954"

In photography, editors can crop out an aid worker a few feet away to only show the person who is suffering in the name of showing a perspective, *their* perspective. Some of this isn't really even intentional, but every person has a viewpoint and will instinctively try to tell people it... and when money is factored in, their skills of telling their viewpoint can be bought and sold to the highest bidder.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","The following is not my writing, but it is gold - and you should read it. [Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/arj1l/i_am_a_functional_alcoholic_29m_ama/c0j18ll).

Some people in this thread just. don't. get. it. There is such thing as a functional alcoholic and it doesn't necessarily follow your preconceived notion of what a Lifetime movie, daddy beats mommy, pickled liver wino on the street alcoholic is. You still have a job and you manage to wake up in the morning. You have friends, you have relationships, you pay your bills and buy your groceries. However, as soon as you get home at the end of the day, you drink. Even if you told yourself all day you wouldn't, you grab a bottle and start throwing down whatever form of alcohol is available until everything feels right again. It's like taking medicine that fills a void inside of you, and once you start to feel warm and fuzzy, that's when everything is ""normal"" again. Couple that with it being after dark and you're in this wonderful womb of contentment where you're convinced you can get away with it.

You don't measure how much you imbibe in terms of number of drinks, but how many inches of the bottle goes down in a night. You drink as a reward or motivation before you start most any task, then you drink afterwards to celebrate accomplishing it. Most likely you drank your way through it anyway. Before going out to any social event and most anything outside of the house, you have to get buzzed. If you're lucky, someone else is driving so you can get wrecked beforehand and not have to worry about sobering up before you get home. And yea, you drive drunk, a lot.

You go to great lengths to hide your consumption. Almost no one knows how frequently you drink, if at all, and surely not to what quantity. You might keep a bottle in the cabinet for show and have another hidden somewhere to drink from, or you may drink out of that main bottle and refill it daily to maintain the appearance of being untouched. You hide empties in the car then throw them in the trash at a convenience store so no one finds them. You keep Gatorade, gum, mouthwash, Excedrin and cologne handy at all times. You wash your face and neck excessively, change your clothes or take a shower if you think you might be sweating out and starting to smell like booze. You keep extra notes available and make lists in prominent places to make you remember to get shit done so people don't catch on to you being a stupid fucking drunk most of the time. Fact is, you don't remember a lot of stuff and learn to lie and play everything off. You make up a new persona that people are willing to forgive then make doubly sure you don't make the same mistake again.

And all the while, you are able to ""function."" You wake up in the morning, go to work (sober but hungover, maybe even not that bad because you're good at this), get your shit done, get paid, then go home and start the cycle all over again. It's not just being someone who drinks too much and it is not easy to just stop. When you start thinking about having a drink it takes over your entire thoughts until you get it. You get tunnel vision and the hardest thing in the world is to just not drink. Still, nobody fucking knows you're like this. Nobody. You are an alcoholic, you are addicted and know you shouldn't be drinking when and as much as you do, but orchestrating it in order to hide it, to remain and appear functional, fully consumes your life.

Nuclear material can be examined as well, the unique isotopes and their ratios do reveal who extracted and concentrated the Pu or U for the weapon. Chemical WMDs require industrial capacity that was so sorely lacking in Iraq that any planted material would be recognized as a dupe.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","In mathematics there are different types of infinity.

One fundamental distinction is between countable and uncountable sets.  On an infinite road, the set of all mile markers (1, 2, 3, ..) would be countable, but the set of all possible positions on the road (including e.g. exactly Pi miles) would be uncountable.  Another example of a countable set is all the different books you could possibly write if you lived forever, including the one about the unicorn riding a rainbow.  All of the situations you can possibly describe are within the realm of countable infinity.

An interesting question to me is, what if reality has an uncountable nature and is therefore indescribable?

(To reach the uncountable, all you have to say is ""the set of all sets of ..."".  So while the set of all mile markers on the infinite road is countable, the set of all sets of mile markers is uncountable, as is the set of all sets of books you could possibly write.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt; You disagree with gender roles? What exactly does that mean?

Roles in life based on gender where it isn't biologically set, i.e. childbirth &amp; sperm production.

&gt; Yes, I believe in the existence of both men and women and in acknowledging that while we may be equally valuable, we're not the same.

We're not the same but we're not that different. I definitely wouldn't assign roles in a relationship based on gender.

&gt; I think pretending we're not ""men"" and ""women"" is delusional.

In what sense is anyone pretending we're not men and women? By saying we're individuals, that's pretending we're not men &amp; women?

&gt; Sounds fine to me. All I said was don't assign all of the blame to the other party. Growth starts from within.

I was referring more to your assigning things based on gender, i.e. a man needs to do X to earn X from a woman. This is what I'm mainly referring to:

&gt; But from a man's perspective, there are a few essential things to keep in mind in order to generate a healthy relationship... a man worthy of a woman's attention and commitment

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Story time! So a friend of mine was a 20 year old virgin. Nerdy, uptight, anxious... In other words, had ""Please fuck me"" written on his forehead. It was obvious that it was just the stress relief he needed and I was more than willing to do it for him... Especially since I found him incredibly attractive. One night he and another friend of mine were over at my place. She and I decided to get him drunk, stoned, and barred out (with his consent/knowledge of course) to loosen him so that we could seduce him and give him the night of his life. So commenced the weekend that we all will never forget. One of sex, drugs, and rock and roll ;-) Surprisingly enough, he and I are now dating and have been for 3 months.

My reason for sharing this story is that you never know what fun is awaiting you if you. Do not give up yet. Also, not all girls are this ... ""outgoing""... but still may want to have sex with you so you should take it upon yourself to be bold. It will not always turn out well but sometimes it will so its worth the risk... at least I think so.

*edit: if i found out that a guy i was with fucked an escort, I would be extremely turned off. I would eventually get over it because it's really not my place to judge... but it would take me a little bit.

"space","t5_2qh87","The [RNA world hypothesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world_hypothesis) is looking pretty good to me.

If you have a look at the lead image on that page, you can see the chemical structure of the amino acids. They are simple molecular structures. Glysine, the simplest, has only 10 atoms in it. It's a fascinating chemistry study.

The reason it's called bio*chemistry* is that it is, at its heart, how atoms stick together, and the way they fold up as they do because of [Molecular Geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_geometry). 

So, for example, the angle of the water molecule 0-H-0 is 104.45 degrees. It's called the ""bond angle"" where the forces that hold them together are balanced and stable (or not).

Carbon will fold up into rings of usually five or six atoms, with the bond angle of 109.5°. Rings of three and four are possible, but with bond angles of 60° and 90°, they have a larger ring strain and are unstable.

If you put hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and sulphur together in the right conditions, the atoms will stick together until they're in small clumps of 10 to 27. From here on in, they're called the amino acids. 

Now it's the clumps that start sticking together, only they tend form lines, and the lines tend to stick together in pairs. Once you get about 160 pairs of amino acids in a chain, they begin to self-replicate, with varying degrees of success. 

Vastly oversimplified, but from there on, it's basically [Conway's Game Of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) for a few billion years, but still based on those [ simple chemical reactions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khW3nLG_xoY).","1280627038"

"trackers","t5_2rjuw","The following is my take on how a future where file sharing is legal could exist.  It assumes that 'piracy' wins and when preventing the sharing of content is impossible new methods must be developed.

In a future where file sharing will win certain things will have to change.  Music and Movies are the easiest and simplest changes because both have alternative sources of income (theaters and live shows).  

If non-profit sharing is made legal the record industry in its current form won't be necessary since we don't need to pay for the music recording and redistribution with the web.  This actually has advantages for both the artist (no exploitative contracts) and the users (being able to share freely).  It'll also put an end to the corporate created Disney singers that exist solely to pull money from a market and not because of their musical talent.  

Record companies could still help with advertising/touring with new artists and artist income (which now comes almost exclusively from tours anyway) shouldn't change, the larger audience they might gain from their recordings being freely distributed may actually improve their sales anyway.

DVD sales would be a thing of the past in a future with legal file sharing, but theater showing will still be going strong (Avatar and Inception are evidence of current theater successes).  People like to see movies in the theater.

The issues with Software become a bit trickier, but what would have to happen would be a change the current idea of the software market.  Instead of having a company churn out proprietary software to buyers you have companies consisting of programmers that are contracted to make software that matches the needs of others.  This software is then freely distributable and 'free' in the GNU sense of freedom.

Videogames are the hardest problem to solve in a legal file sharing situation, but it would have to come down to selling a service along with the game (access to servers/online play/updates).  People who simply get a copy of the game would be missing key components.

Television would be an inexpensive subscription based service with no advertising that allows you to easily stream the newest shows when you want them fast.  If they want to include advertising then it better be free service or it will (and should) fail.  Television in its current form of 10 minutes of commercials per program while paying a large amount of money per month is unacceptable and unsustainable.","1280627075"

There's no chance until we can beat the speed of light, and so far that violates huge parts of the most important parts of physics.  If someone wants to try by diving into a black hole, be my guest!  Give me a call when you return!

Right:  Maybe ET knows how to violate the speed of light, but in that case we don't know how to build a telephone to receive his call!

My wild guess about why we have not heard from ET is that any ET more than a million years ahead of us, and that MUST include nearly all of them, long since knew that to communicate across outer space had to use something faster than the speed of light, and they do, but we don't understand how and can't get their signals.  But that's WILD stuff.

For now, to talk about communicating with ET, have to be smoking some really strong funny stuff.

Ask me again in 1000 years.  No, make that 1 million years.

A century later, some in the US used the term to refer to a pure form of capitalism, apparently in response to the term ""liberal"" changing meaning.

You'd think that younger people would be passionate about elections since they will be around for a long time and be more vested in the outcomes. Maybe because older people have mortgages and pay more taxes; maybe because they fear things going south at a time when they have fewer options. I'm not sure why but older people tend to favor the status quo.

You guys need to sound the alarm. You have more power than anyone has ever had. People used to dream about finding a way to spread their message to virtually every voter in their districts; the internet, social media etc. could be that dream come true. 

But there's a saying ""All politics is local"". It's how successful campaigns get off the ground, by rallying the people on the ground level, getting the issues out there and organizing to get the voters out. Get involved locally and it could be done.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","I've been in Sweden for 1.5 years. I have to say I've been accepted with open arms, and getting my papers in order, a bank account, mobile phone line, personal number, etc was a breeze. I even started a single-person company without as much as a hitch. When i had a meeting with the tax people to learn about how it works they actually set up a special date just for me and got 2 people to meet me. We talked for like an hour as well.

I find that overall Sweden is a very open country towards immigrants. The thing with  the assimilation thing is that lots of immigrants tend to join up with other people from their countries. I work in a school and I can tell you that some parents even hassle their kids into not hanging out with other kid with different backgrounds. 

Of course it isn't perfect. There are immigrant areas and not enough help for non-swedish speakers. It's tough if u don't speak Swedish, even though it's much easier for english-speakers here than in many other countries.

I'm lucky that my girlfriend is Swedish and I'm in a nice neighbourhood and I'm an EU citizen. Others are less fortunate and fnd far less help. I think that when it comes to immigraton the effort has to come form both sides - the immigrnt can't just show up, but has to expect and upward struggle. I think it's natural-adjusting to a new place isn't easy. The recipient country should also do its part. I think Sweden is better at accepting immigrants than most other countries in the world, including 2 neighbours - Denmark and Finland. Swedes (at least in cities) seem to be very open, well-travelled people.

Anyways, that's just my experience of things. Did I mention I got free Swedish lessons? And free education? I'm doing a master's degree at a top class university for freaking free!

There are parables and stories which are meant to convey some principle or ideal - but which require interpretation.

A book that says ""I am the word of god, and you must live according to the information you find within"" is only helpful if it doesn't require a lot of debate as to the meaning.  A book written by only one or two authors, all around the same time, will be somewhat less ambiguous than the bible.

And what do you do if there is any confusion?  With the bible, you can argue about it, but nobody will have the ""true"" answer.  With Islam, according to the video, you must disregard any earlier commandments that are contradicted by something later.

So, we can talk about fundamentalists / extremists - but what you're really referring to are people who are true believers.  They're just doing what their holy book says to do - a book with much less ambiguity than the bible.

If the bible said ""You must conquer the world and institute christian law over every human on earth, disregard all statements to the contrary"", and people believed it to be the word of god, they'd be doing the same thing.","1280627195"

Unless the dog gets hold of ones jugular and prevents blood from reaching the brain/breathing and or damage to the
arteria carotis the dog will need quite some time to cause enough damage to kill. 

I think the reason why most police dogs manage to stop suspects is that the suspect is more intent on getting away from the dog than to actually stand his ground and fight to the death. Dogs tend to try and latch on to a limb and pull back, if they lose grip they try again. The idea is not to get away but use ones own weight to ones advantage and get the dog in a headlock, one may lose an eye/cheek/nose in the process. Not letting go and cutting off vital blood supply to the dogs brain will cause it to pass out in a matter of seconds. The point is that one will get quite badly injured but still be able to disable the animal before it causes enough damage to be fatal.

Sorry but 200+ pounds should be able to disable / break limbs or fracture the vertebrate of a dog.

Dog basically grabs arm and holds on pulling the man to the floor. The dog does not let go. Whats to prevent you from wrapping your legs around the dog when hes on top of you, locking your ankles and preventing the dog from breathing?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;Because you haven't yet shown that it leads to what you're saying it does. You can't keep asserting that without something to back it up, chief.

I never said it DOES.  Not sure how often I have to repeat that.

All I have to show is that there is a reasonable mechanism that suggests it might.  So far you haven't asserted that the mechanism I provided CANNOT have the effect I suggest that it can.  Therefore it MIGHT.  

As I mentioned, I was responding to a guy saying his numbers supported his position.  All I have to do is show a reasonable connection that MIGHT be a flaw.  The connection I'm suggesting isn't ""well butterfly population in the area cause Dawkins to have the opposite effect he intende""... no, I provided a reasonable POSSIBLE connection.  That we know for a fact that when attacked people irrationally sometimes hold their positions, and will even defend things in their side they know to be flawed... further convincing themselves in a visceral sense at least.  That we know for a fact that Dawkins approach, when compared to others, comes off at direct attacks to some people.  When you put these two FACTS together, it is REASONABLY POSSIBLE that he may cause some believers to reinforce their faith.  POSSIBLE.  POSSIBLE.    not LIKELY, not DIRECTLY FOLLOWS,  Not GUARANTEED.  POSSIBLE.

Since that reasonable connection is established (and you have not yet said it is an unreasonable connection, you haven't said that the mechanism is in no way connected to the conversation), doubt is reasonable created in the OPs claim that his numbers support his claim.

Therefore is is reasonable to say his numbers do not reasonably support his claim.  End of story.  That was the entire point.  His numbers don't back up his position.  I'm not claiming any other position is supportable as part of this argument.  [I did make a side note that I did beleive by position was supportable and that I didn't intend to do so because we can't get beyond the basic mechanics of the core argument...  that was a mistake I should not have introduced that distraction]

**TL;DR** He asserted that his position was supported by his numbers.  I asserted a POTENTIAL REASONABLE POSSIBLE problem with with his numbers in respect to how they relate to his position.  Therefore his numbers do not as of yet properly support his position.","1280627300"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in college, we had several strange suicides within a few years.  One of them, a girl walked to a road where big trucks pass by frequently and waited for one to come, then jumped out in front of it at the last minute.  My mom is an accountant and does payroll for his company, so she saw him not too long after it happened.  Even a few weeks later, he was still really shaken up; I guess the girl had made direct eye contact with him, and was staring straight into his eyes when she threw herself in front of his truck.  It also almost cost him his job, because they had to do a full investigation and decide whether to revoke his license.  

Turned out the girl's mom had called the college shortly before the incident to warn them that her daughter had been very despondent and depressed, and to keep an eye on her.  That, and testimony from the girl's friends was enough to rule it a suicide and let the guy off.  Didn't make him feel any better, but at least he's not unemployed.","1280627311"

Since I was swimming near by, I thought I could check what they are looking for.

I reached to get him, but his skin was very slippery and I could not lift him on the surface. 

Since I could not stay much more without air, and I panicked a lot, I left the place and swum fast to the coast to find help.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Here is truth with weed experiences as I've seen them and seen others around me.

Everyone has at least had one bag high if not more....but they don't happen too often and it's most likely what mood you were in before or during that made your high bad. First time high's if you only take one or two pulls will most likely of not going bad. It actually might take once or twice on separate occasions before you fully feel the high.

Now the ""I will never smoke again cuz it makes me really paranoid and uncomfortable."" Is very rare from the many...many people I've talked to about pot and known. But I've gathered that, that sorta of experience more often happens to women. But like I said this is from my experience and the stories I've heard...but I'm not quoting any science or statistics.

If you were to have a bad experience you wouldn't go crazy, it wouldn't permanently fuck you up...you wouldn't go jump of a bridge or something....you're very likely to just sit down or lay down somewhere and not move until it wears off. 

I had an experience like that but it was from a bowl of kief [kief is resin that collects in grinders and containers...so very concentrated stuff]. Never from weed.


Long story short...if you were to have a bad experience it would just go away after a few hours and you'll probably never use it again.

If you don't like the smell, to someone who has smoked before I'd suggest eating it...but that might be too intense, or you could eat a small amount and wait half hour before eating more [cuz of the lag time before the high hits you].

You could try drinking some weed tea...but I've never tried it, you'd have to ask others if tea is less potent way of ingesting it. I'd imagine it would be much less potent especially in a small amount.

But if you are addicted to many other things outside of alcohol then I wouldn't start using weed in any way. It'll just add itself to alcohol...which I like to enjoy together and other's I know puke from that mix.

Sry for the TLDR comment. But I'm of the belief that everyone should try pot at least once in their life.","1280627406"

Is there free will in hell?

If there is no free will in heaven and free will seems to be this very important thing to religious people since they talk about it all the time, then what makes heaven so great? If I have no free will, then I am nothing more than a mindless slave.

It helps if you're capable of backing up your theories with compelling facts, but it also helps if you're capable of being proven wrong without getting emotional over it.

That being said, my tellers are a 20 something woman, a 40 something woman, and a 20 something man. My Service rep is a woman over 50. They are all very good at their jobs. 

At any bank, some branches just suck. I can think of two or three within 20 miles of mine that I loath going into, and have clients complain to me about just like you did. But, there are two dozen in that same 20 miles that I think are awesome. I would suggest trying another branch of your bank. Is your home branch near home? Try the one near your work or school. 

As to the getting something done quickly, it honestly depends. To open a new checking for a new client, I need **minimum** 25-30 minutes. I have several things I am required to do--required by my company, like ask you questions about your banking, and required by Uncle Sam, like verifying your name, address, SSN, and DL # so my bank stays PATRIOT Act compliant and doesn't get fined. Then I have to provide you with several disclosures and make sure you understand what they say. It takes time to do all that.

If you need to cash a check or make a deposit, go to the teller. Anything more complex than that, a service rep or manager can help you. If it's a busy branch, you may have to wait.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","To answer 1 and 2: I usually go with fresh roma, despite the fact that many times canned tomatoes are tastier. I like the fresh ones because they have more body, and canned ones are usually too mushy. The tomatoes will also soak up the oils from the peppers, so they're not simply for body. For the best tasting salsa, let the flavors mingle for an hour or so before serving. Go easy on the salt at first, let it sit, and then check to see if it needs to be re-seasoned. 

#3 Yes. The most common are roasted corn and black bean, but there are plenty of others. You can also use tomatillos, which makes an excellent sauce. And if you ever find the sauce is just way too hot, add some sour creme and it will calm down and you'll have a creamy sauce. Or pour it on top of a block of cream cheese. The dairy will calm the capsaicin, which is what makes the chiles hot.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was shadowing a surgeon and the patient died on the table.  It was an elective procedure to remove pressure on an anyeurism.  The anyuerism ruptured during the procedure and the patient bled out in front of me.  The problem was that the procedure was endovascular, which means it was performed through wires and catheters which were moved to the aorta through blood vessels from the thigh (you guide it through x-ray) into the aorta. So all you have is this little incision in the groin and this person is bleeding FROM THEIR AORTA into their chest/stomach. So they have to do emergency surgery.  They rip this woman's stomach open and throw all her organs aside (liver, gallbladder, intestines, etc.) and attempt to repair the anyuerism.  While this is happening a surgical nurse is doing chest compressions so all the innards are bouncing around.  Blood is squirting absolutely everywhere and the body cavity is pooled with it.  The woman's heart stopped three times.  In the end they couldn't save her and it looked like a scene from a horror film.  This gaping body pooled with blood and covered in bloody rags/instruments.  There was a huge pool of blood on the floor and spray marks everywhere.  I was there when they spoke with the family.  It was the single most dramatic moment of my life.  Medical shows are usually BS, but when it comes to emergency situations, it's spot on. Running, screaming, blood everywhere, crying families.  Anyway, even though it was disturbing it helped solidify my desire to be a surgeon so there was an up-side.","1280627523"

""Today I will once more be a prophet: If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war, then the result will not be the Bolshevization of the earth, and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!""-Adolf Hitler

""Regarding the Jewish Question, the Führer is determined to clear the table. He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their own destruction. Those were not empty words. Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Jews. We should have sympathy rather with our own German people. If the German people have to sacrifice 160,000 victims in yet another campaign in the east, then those responsible for this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives.""-Joseph Goebbels

Europe was decimated.  Well, that's what happens when you invade/conquer Poland and France, attempt to conquer Russia, and bomb London to the ground.  once again, they DECLARED WAR on the united States.  Not the other way around.

Anyways,  in 1933, roughly 9.5 million Jews lived in Europe.  Over 60% of the world Jewish population today.  In 1950 only 3.5 million Jews lived in Europe.  And no, they didn't all just ""move away"".  I'd say that's quite the ""dip"".","1280627531"

William DeWayne Jones Sr. (May 28, 2000)
Officer William Jones was shot and killed while conducting a traffic stop at Zilker Park. Officer Jones was speaking with the driver of the vehicle when the driver opened fire, striking him in the chest twice and the neck once. Officer Jones, who was not wearing a vest, was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. More than 200 youth soccer teams were attending an international soccer tournament at the park at the time of the shooting. The suspect fled the scene, but was spotted several hours later near Houston, Texas, approximately 150 miles away. After a short chase the suspect committed suicide. He had already served time in prison and was currently wanted by another jurisdiction for sexual assault. Officer Jones had been employed with the Austin Park Police Department for three years, and is survived by his wife and three children. 

We were standing about 50 yards away in the sculpture garden at the time of the shooting and watched the officer hit the ground after the first shot. Then the assailant got out of the car, stood above him and fired again. At that point we ran for the car and left in fear for our lives. It still gives me the chills thinking about it.","1280627552"

There are so many things which can destroy your motivation, your mind, your body, your dreams.. All because of how settled we become in our subjective comprehension of the universe..

The universe is not fair, and many are where they are simply out of winning the biological lottery (born into status).

I then noticed that the three guys were also flying along with the debris - they were literally hurled up in the air as the car violently flipped, and were propelled at least 2-3 meters. One of them landed on their neck killing him what I assume to be instantly - the other two survived. One landed on the sidewalk, and the other fell into a construction site and got lucky.

USB 3.0 would be cool but is unnecessary.  I'd like 6 USB minimum on the MB, and 4 ram slots min.  4 gigs ram should be sufficient, right?  Maybe even three.  

A sata raid 0 on the MB would be spectacular, or some way to set it up with an internal card.  I'd like 2x500GB (or more) HD in RAID 0.

On my way there, I notice that she's a K9 officer and she just has her dog  (a BIG German Sheppard) smelling my car for bombs or something. Unfortunately I noticed the dog at about the same time the dog noticed me, jogging towards him. That dog starts running towards me and this petite cop woman has to pull on him as hard as possible. I swear I saw my life flash before my eyes when I saw that huge dog running towards me. 

tl;dr: German Sheppards will try to destroy you if you run towards them.   

EDIT:
I forgot the best part of the story. After she calms the dog down (I had my hands up and had chills from having the fear of god planted in me), she yells ""ARE YOU CRAZY?!"" at me, puts the dog away in her cop car, gets in herself, and leaves. ","1280627662"

As far as your problem's concerned, I have a friend who used to complain to me about this all the time. His theory was, since he thought acting 'a bit femme' (his words, not mine) was ridiculous, nobody went after him. He figured he was perceived as too hard of a target. Me, I've personally got no experience with this other than my friend's bitter ranting back in the day (he got over that eventually, not sure what he started doing different, I wasn't a wingman for him), so that's all the insight I can offer other than the standard - at bars talk to everyone, eventually you'll find one you 'click' with. No one expects to be approached by a straight man at a gay bar, if you put yourself out there, approach people, you'll find guys who are worth your while - and they won't assume you're straight (anyone that does in that situation is, perhaps, a bit dense).","1280627670"

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Try it out. You aren't going to know if you like it or can wear it well if you don't give it a try. It can and does look good on some people. Some people, it doesn't. What you don't want is a greasy look. When it looks bad, it's usually because someone isn't using the right product and their hair looks too shiny.

You will want to find and use some pomade, not gel. Some are waxier than others. Open up and look at what is inside of a container or can before you buy. Most decent pomades, though, are pretty cheap. I use Murray's Original, which can be found in most drug stores and salons. While it's not really work to get the look that you want with some pomades, you are better off following the instructions than just slopping it in your hair and hoping for the best. With Murray's, it's pretty thick, so you have to warm it up first to make it softer and more applicable. I spread a small amount in my hands and then run it under hot water until it softens, usually just a few seconds, and then apply it. After you get the product into your hair, you will most often have to warm it up again to really get it slicked back. I just warm a wet hand towel and put that over my hair for a few seconds and then style it. Sounds like a lot, but it's all really quick. 

I wouldn't suggest gel, as it won't allow for movement or adjustment. Say your hair gets disheveled, you aren't going to be able to restyle or fix much of your hair style with gel. It's too hard. With pomade, you can just use a comb or brush and fix what you need to. With most pomades though, unlike gels, you will start to get a build up of product after using it for a few days. It doesn't completely wash out with normal hair washing and will take a couple of washings to get most out if you need to. The good thing about that though, is that you can start to form a base for a consistent look, you don't have to use as much product on the second or third day as you do on the first. If I don't have the time or run out of product, I can usually get by for a day without having to put anything in and not have my hair look much different. It's not weird or gross, you don't wash all of most products out of your hair with normal washing, you just may not notice it. You shouldn't be trying that hard to wash your hair that much anyway.","1280627672"

I wasn't very active in AA for very long, and there are a lot of things about it that annoyed me, but it was a huge huge help when I first quit. ","1280627722"

I only got the call from the landlord four days later when he started smelling. The body was pretty wrecked - it swelled, burst in multiple places, was leaking rotting blood and fat, and the face was no longer recognizable. Also, the whole thing was green/brown, and the swelling made his arms stick up in the air, as if frozen in the very moment of his death.Oh and the smell... there is absolutely nothing that compares to the smell of decomposing flesh. When I found him, I stayed only long enough to take out my camera and snap a photo for my mother, whom I knew would want to see it eventually.

If enough real interest is shown I may be able to get a Mohawk Chief to do an IAMA.

I am white as white can be and have had a Mohawk name since before I was cognizant from a chief. That is verging on adoption into their tribe. If you or other redditors want that to happen let me know.

EDIT: I want 20 people at least to ask me to before I'd ask him. That's a really small gathering for him to address, and if he doesn't have that much sincere interest I'd be ashamed to ask him. Karma is irrelevant for this. Post or PM's only. He's been in the New Yorker.

I was unconscious during my seizures, but my girlfriend is usually coherent about what's going on even though she can not react. She said the times that someone put something in her mouth (someone once grabbed a stick off the ground) just made things worse. 

My typical routine if she has one is as follows:

* If I'm near her, I usually catch her and lower her to the ground gently as she typically passes out right before she has one.
* Once she's on the ground, I move the pointy things away from her.
* We don't have any dogs, but if you do, you should probably keep the dogs away from the person having the seizure. It makes dogs freak out and sometimes causes them to attack. 
* After that, I usually just wait it out. I'll try to have a damp cloth waiting for when she comes to (usually less than a minute, closer to 20 seconds or so, though it will seem like a long time while it is happening.) When she snaps out of a tonic-clonic seizure, she finds wiping her face with the damp cloth to be comforting and helps to restore some of her movement.

She experiences [Todd's Paralysis](http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/toddsparalysis/toddsparalysis.htm) after her seizures so I just sit with her and wait until she can walk again.  

There are a variety of different types of seizures. Tonic-clonic (also known as grand mal, though it's not really called that anymore) are the ones that most people think about when someone mentions a seizure.

There are also complex/simple partial seizures, absence seizures (formerly called petit mal), myoclonic seizures (these are like the thing that happens when you're falling asleep and your body jerks... except more frequent. Same basic idea, though.) ","1280627803"

I felt like there were so many areas inside of me that would try to destroy me and so I kept a very tight control on them. I was extremely strict and excessive with myself. It was exhausting, I had to keep it up all the time because at any moment something could sneak up on me. This was an intense burden. I could be completely fine and then suddenly fall into my thoughts and feel very unsocial and disconnected, with feelings I felt were unique since I felt that no one understood what I was going through when I began explaining. I felt I couldn’t explain, it didn’t make sense logically, it was fragmented. I felt like I got dragged out into the cold night and stabbed, not to die, but just to suffer for somehow being inadequate.

I watched myself performed tasks as an outsider while numb. Taking no joy in them at times. Sometimes  the only joy would be the pain that I felt performing these tasks. It wasn’t joy though, it was a silent hope that I could somehow become alive through this ‘work.’ And yet the more I tried the longer it lasted. Exhausting. On the outside I was fine. I had a good job, I was social and would go surfing with friends and play poker. I’d see girls. Things that I still do today. However at the time, all I really wanted to be was normal, to not be depressed.

Depression isn’t something that is easy to share. Most friends will become uncomfortable. Depression is very taboo because of the reasons you’ve mentioned. They try will genuinely try to help, but how do you help someone that thinks differently than you? It is a different paradigm, completely different mental model. Their words would alienate me and make me feel like a stranger. 
All this seemed normal to me, this was everything that I’ve known. This is the problem, how does someone from the inside know that things are different. How do you know what goes on inside the head of someone who isn’t depressed? It took me a long time, years, to even REALIZE that I had emotions behind that ‘feeling’ of ‘depression.’ That is the difficulty. First how can I explain what is going on with me and then how could I explain it to you? 

When I was in the hospital after the suicide attempt only one person said something like “I was afraid of this.” That was because I reached to them for help and told them everything. All my other friends came to visit and they were completely shocked. Even my own mother had no idea.

You mention “Think back to the worst moment of your life … Think about those times long and hard, the emptiness, the drag, the lack of energy, will and determination to do anything, or care about anything.” To me this sounds like the definition of depression. I don’t feel that I would act that way in those situations. Before I feel I would feel like that but because it would have been from the result of trying to prevent or being bothered by the thoughts. I would be bothered by these strong feelings and so worry that we will be overwhelmed by them. None of this would be conscious however, I would just slip into depression without thinking about, my mind would do all this for me. Only now, after I’ve become so aware of my feelings can I see that.

That is why I no longer feel that those feelings would creep up on me. I made that realization, my personality, my mental model is permanently changed. I discovered the ultimate cause of my depression, I felt how it lifted. It also helps that I was fortunate enough to be put back into the situations that were the hardest in my life and glide through them after knowing what I now know, this gave me confidence.

I haven’t felt the beginnings of depression for years. I’d be very surprised if they came back. However if they did, I’d imagine myself being very intrigued and determined to take on the challenge of discovering why. I’ve done it once when I had no knowledge about it, when it was the worse because I had no proof that I could do it, only faith that there was something better out there for me. Now seeing another side, which I really enjoy, I’d have the faith to do it again.

Depression for me was because I felt that I needed to be strong to ignore difficult emotions. Depression was how I ignored difficult emotions. It works great except that it clouds all emotions, not just the negative ones. Another thing is, it becomes automatic. Even when I consciously wanted to begin to feel emotions it didn’t happen. That is why I think of it as a personality. How do you change from a serious person to a funny person? Jokes won’t just spontaneously arrive as thoughts. You need to learn that essence. How do you do that? ","1280627804"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","I agree with most, but not all of that article. 

&gt; However, the proposition does not impose any new restriction against smoking where minors are present, it just leaves the current ones in place.

There is no ""current"" restriction against smoking in front of a minor except in a car. Prop 19 prohibits smoking in the same space as a minor. This includes a car, yes. But it also includes much more. What does space mean? I don't know. And neither does Richard Lee. He admits he intended it to mean room. But who knows what a judge will determine it means. According to Marc Emory, a very vocal Prop 19 proponent, ""cannabis is a psychoactive that travels through the air."" That sounds scary to a judge, especially one with kids. If it travels through the air with ease, space might come to mean building. If you live in a multi-residence building, I think you would consider it a new restriction that you would not be able to smoke in your own apartment. Not to mention, current smoking laws define a minor as someone under 18. Current alcohol laws define a minor as someone under 21. Prop 19 does not specify how old a minor is. But since the legal age is 21, it is likely that a ""minor"" under Prop 19 is someone under 21. Thus, if you have a 20 year old living with you (kid or roommate) this would be a new restriction on you.

Here is where it gets tricky, and I can understand why people may think there is a restriction against smoking cannabis right now. If you get caught smoking, you get in trouble. Therefore, there is a restriction on smoking it. That is incorrect. The law punishes possession, not the actual act of smoking. If you get caught smoking, you get in trouble for possession, not smoking. So...if a police officer comes to your house and you have just finished smoking a joint and your 20 year old room mate is present, no crime, since there is no more cannabis and therefore no more possession. Under Prop 19, this same situation would result in you having committed a crime, even though you were legally in possession of the cannabis. 


&gt; Yes, it would require the approval of the landlord to cultivate cannabis, but I don't really see the problem with this. 

Your landlord will. Especially if they vote no. And even more so if they understand that they will be subject to federal forfeiture if you are caught. And now, since they signed a piece of paper saying it was okay for you to grow in the house, the federal government will have absolute proof of their knowledge of the illegal activity, which is proof they have, thus far, had a hard time getting under the current rules. And the DEA loves to send out letters telling your landlord about this. We've seen them in LA and San Diego.


&gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but people are innocent unless proven guilty, are they not? This makes the explanation for Myth #5 complete bullshit it seems. 

There are parts of this proposition that put the burden on you. But yes, generally this is true. Myth #5 is incorrect in some respect. You are right that local governments (or the state when they ""clean up"" this proposition to put it into law if it passes) would have to punish illegal buying. And yes, the DA would have to prove to a jury that you purchased it illegally. But you might have issues getting it back without proof that it was purchased legally. And you might face issues with a jury if you cannot provide proof, since juries tend to misunderstand the burden of proof and the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. 

And the second paragraph of Myth #5 is accurate. It is likely that most recreational cannabis users will have to grow their own or travel to Oakland to get some, at least initially. 


&gt; How is requiring a license to sell cannabis any different than requiring a liquor license to sell alcohol?

I don't think anyone is arguing that. Except that maybe there aren't any counties/cities that have an all out ban on liquor licenses. And in most counties/cities there isn't a cap per say on liquor licenses. But other than that, it would completely infeasible to have legalization without some kind of regulation.


&gt; There are also no new restrictions placed on smoking in public, so while recreational smokers would not be allowed to smoke where tobacco smoking is permitted, medical smokers would.

Yes there are. As of right now, you can smoke anywhere you can smoke cigarettes, because smoking isn't criminalized, the possession of marijuana is (see above). Unless you are a patient, then there are different rules (but those will remain in place, hopefully). 


&gt; Also, if each county is allowed to regulate commercial activity, why can't counties whose economies rely on the current system just impose their regulation as appropriate?

No one is saying they ""can't."" We're saying they won't. The best example we can currently point to how cities treat cannabis is medical under Prop 215. There are 129 cities that ban any commercial (or barely so) aspects of Prop 215 and SB 420. There are many more than have moratoriums. And there are also several cities that have legislation that essentially gives a monopoly to a small number of retail shops. Now Oakland is even monopolizing the cultivation aspect of it. I'm positive Oakland will have open recreational retail stores (and they already do, actually). San Francisco probably will too. The Emerald triangle probably will (although, given recent events, maybe not). But other than that, I wouldn't hold your breath. 


While I think Dragon De La Luz gets dramatic at some points, I wouldn't say that she is fear-mongering nonsensically. Certainly not any more than the Prop 19 people are doing the opposite. (Is there such thing as happy-mongering?)","1280627935"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Best advice I can give is to lower your standards for what you think you need. It's amazing what you can convince yourself is a need if you aren't careful.

I lived in a space just a little bigger than a big walk in closet in a house with four other guys. They were good friends and my total expenses including utilities was $150/month.

If you are religious take advantage of all of the student groups giving out free food. Even if you are not it's not a bad way to get food. For the first several weeks of a new semester you eat free. I think Steve Jobs did this during his youth. The church I attended had families adopt students and offer to feed them and offer services like laundry.

Make friends with girls that like to cook. My brother had a deal in college where he cut the lawn for some girls house and they cooked him food and invited him to hang out. I used to setup wifi networks for sorority girls and charge $30-$50. Easy money worked when I wanted and studied when I needed.

That's all I got for now will share more if I remember anything big.

Edit: while I am all for Linux and free software look into what your school offers. Most computers you buy have cost of windows built in a way where it isn't a lot cheaper to go Linux. Some schools also offer free or almost free versions of OSs and Office Apps. My school does this plus anti virus. Not bad when you put it all together.","1280627947"

Apart from **firefly** and a couple of good mainstream shows that people have already suggested. Here's mine:

One season wonders:

**Freaks and Geeks:** (Based on 80's high school drama: A questionable cross between 'Between Beverly Hills 90210 and that 70s show //EDIT: That doesn't sound very good, but I did say questionable. ) Good cast/characters: It was interesting to see Jason Segel, James Franco and Seth Rogen play 17. Plus [Great OST](http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Freaks+and+Geeks+OST/26963518)

**Studio60 on the sunset strip:** (5 minutes into the pilot, the monologue by Wes Mendell, is enough to get you hooked on to the show) Stars Matthew Perry, Bradley Whitford and Amanda Peet, also Sarah Paulson (while we are on the firefly subject, she plays Dr. Caron in Serenity) I urge you to see atleast the first 5 episodes if you haven't seen it already.

*Else*
**Veronica Mars** is a good watch. V.Nice premise. Kristen Bell does a good job playing highschool detective. (I like how Logan's (main)character is developed over the 3 seasons.)","1280627962"

I've never used tomatoes, I like the vinegary sauces best, like tabasco, but not wimpy.  Use lime juice instead if you wish. The idea is the acidity and salt act as a preservative. I've had sauces in the fridge over a year old with no problems. I'm sorry I don't have specific measurements for you, as I don't cook like that - I tend to make things up as I go along, but basically...

I normally carmelize some onions and drain them of any excess oil. I'll fry up the peppers with the onions after that and add any fruit I might want (mangos go well for instance) add some garlic or ginger or whatever you have and cook until soft. Let cool, put in a blender and blend with some vinegar or lime juice until it is as thin/thick as you like and it has reached the acidity that you're looking for. You'll want to add some salt as well at this point, but just keep tasting until it's where you want it. 

That's about it really. I bottle in regular, cleaned out hot sauce bottles and have had some for at least a year if not more. Also, make your own funky labels in photoshop or whatever. ","1280627966"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; To those who are doing this finger-pointing at another generation: go fuck yourself.

How about you go fuck yourself. How many times have we heard the baby boomers complain about how shit Gen X or Gen Y is? 

&gt; As far as blaming the boomers for a lot of society's ills, let's keep in mind that as the baby-boomer bulge is finally pushing out all the other voting demographics, THAT'S when we're seeing things like creeping legalization of weed, recognition of gay marriage, and other liberal causes that are near and dear to the dirty hippies.

Do you know why your previous generation is called the greatest generation? 1. Huge chunks of them died giving your generation a huge amount of opportunity. 2. They sacrificed their future (savings) to pay for and build shit tonnes of infrastructure on the promise that later generations would support them in their old age. 

What did the baby boomer generation do? They sold everything the previous generation did and used it to by immediate material pleasures with no intention of paying back their debts, or improving the world for later generations. 

&gt; There are fuckheads in every generation, dear youngsters, and if you look about you, I'm sure you'll see them in yours.

Except the attitude of your generation is pervasive. It's the it shouldn't be the Baby Boomer generation, it should be called the ""GIVE IT TO ME RIGHT FUCKING NOW"" Generation. 

What did your generation do when it was young? Get supported by the previous generations while you smoked dope.

What did your generation do while gen-x was being born? You raped the infrastructure investment of the previous generation. 

What did your generation do while gen-y was being born? You complained that gen-x was lazy and didn't want to want to work as hard as you do, now. 

What did your generation do this decade? It signalled to us that the last 40 years of greed and excise is going to cost the next two, or three, generations their life, and their excess. 

&gt; Yeah, I did the same thing when I was young.

Your generation has spent their entire lives blaming everybody else but themselves. It's about time that someone pointed out how entirely fucking greedy and self centred your entire generation has been. 

&gt; As Vonnegut says, I just got here myself. And we're all in this together. Blaming age groups, of all things, for the state we're in is counter-productive.

No, it's not counter-productive. Arseholes who just go around stealing everything they want because they believe themselves special need to be told that they are selfish jerks. What is counter-productive is when it is pointed out to you that /your/ generation is full of selfish jerks that you get pissy and cry like some sort of teary child on the internet.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You can do this if you have a business, but it raises a lot of audit flags and can screw you in the end.  

For instance, if you have a house, you can deduct the percentage of it that you use for business.  So if you have a 2000 square foot house, and use 200 square feet as an office, you can deduct 10% of your house expenses, like the mortgage, electricity and other utilities, and so forth.  But then you also have to depreciate that part of the house as well.  When you go to sell the house, you have to 'recover' that depreciation and pay capital gains tax on it.  However, if you are married and sell a house you have lived in for 2 of the last 5 years then you can sell it tax free if you gain less than $500,000 on it (The biggest tax loophole there is for 99.99% of people).  

Business should pay taxes on profit and not revenue.  Otherwise everything you buy immediately get more expensive by the tax rate.  So a can of soup that a grocery store buys for 98 cents and sells for $1 (typical grocery store markup) would have to pay the 35% corporate tax rate and so the price would go up to $1.35.

Just popped into my head when I read your post

I've been subjected to the societal expectation of being a ""stoic, endless reservoir of strength"" and it's exhausting to try and follow it, and I have a hard time ignoring it. When your role model for how to be a man is your own father and he cries once in your life, it's very hard to realize that it's normal for humans to cry.

I've been a big crybaby since my first child was born. I started crying the moment I saw him emerge. Since then I've been prone to tearing up at anything sentimental.

Before my son was born, I hadn't cried since I was a kid. As an adult, I'm amazed at how much stress is relieved by crying. Men of all ages would do well to let down their guard now and then without worrying about being shamed.","1280628098"

"programming","t5_2fwo","I've realized a similar thing happens on the escalators coming out of the subway. In general, around Boston, people stand right, and walk left, and most people are happy to stick to this convention. But once the left hand ""lane"" on the escalator is filled with people standing still, there is pretty much *no chance* for it to start moving again. The reason is that even if people at the top of the escalator get out of the way real quickly, the ""wave"" of openness moves back down the steps less quickly than the steps move up.

I haven't tried it, but I assume you could fix the problem (pretty much analogously to the guy in the ""trafficwaves"" video linked in another comment) by standing at the bottom of the thing and blocking people from getting on the left side. Wait for a big enough opening to form so that you can walk to the top without catching up to the clump, and then everyone behind you will be able to walk and *I think* the average transit time up the stairs will then be much faster, and you will almost instantly wipe out the loss of time that people experienced as they were held up at the bottom.

While there are different definitions for insanity due to cross cultural issues, and the definitions for legal insanity and medical insanity differ for more obvious reasons, I suggest you look into the DSM and its multiple-axes system for classifying different mental disorders. You will find that while, by international standards, there are many ways to define different mental disorders depending on whether they are acute&amp;temporary, permanent, incurable facets of the personality, associated with a medical reason or caused by a genetic disorder or physical injury, none of these conditions are satisfied by any of the things you call insane.

We can go around calling anything we think is crazy: crazy, sure. But then again, we can go back to saying that the plague was caused by too much washing and that masturbation causes blindness as well.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The problem is not paranoia, it's arrogance.  The vast majority of humans believe that they know the ""important things"" in the world, and that the huge ocean of knowledge they are unaware of is irrelevant or unimportant.  Very few people take the time to recognize how little they truly know or understand.  For every tidbit of knowledge or wisdom or understanding we acquire, there are almost infinite things we do not know.  To quote a person of interest in the realm of conspiracies, Donald Rumsfeld, there are known unknowns and unknown unknowns.  That means there are things that haven't even occurred to us that we don't know.  The things we don't even think about.

So if you are convinced you are the only person who recognizes something BIG, first, step off the high horse of your own intelligence.  Second, think about the number of people you have ever had contact with.  This number is practically irrelevant compared to the total population of humanity.  You have not met most of humanity, any number of which could have perfectly valid understandings contradictory to your own supposedly rock solid thought process.

Frankly, it does not take much courage to discuss or discover conspiracies.  It takes the hubris of believing that your explanation is the only one, your view of events the only one, and your intelligence the only one capable of understanding.  On the flip side, I cannot speak to the cowardice of the ""deniers"".  Such an ""other"" identity is largely the result of a confirmation bias, not the reality of the world.  This is the same as the often observed belief that religion/atheism is constantly under attack because of the atheists/religious.  This stems from a continual reporting of clashing beliefs, and lack of stories or interest in harmonious existence.  If you think such a clash is prominent, your mind will key in on those examples that solidify your position, filtering out or forgetting things you don't necessarily agree with.  

Although it is certainly true that the vast numbers of humanity hold many, many people who would rather not ""rock the boat"", simply doubting or countering the assertions of conspiracy by an individual does not indicate cowardice or stupidity, merely a different thought process or approach to the data presented.

So no, conspiracy theorists aren't paranoid, at least not all of them.  And not all of them are wrong all the time either (numerous conspiracies have taken place throughout history - think Gaius Julius Caesar, or the assassination of President Arbenz in Guatemala in the 1950s as the result of a CIA effort to overthrow the left leaning government).  But most often, you encounter people who are so taken up with themselves that they cannot even broach the subject of their own errors.  ","1280628164"

You don't notice them because they have done a decent job of integrating, because for them, coming to Japan was a way of ""moving up"" in life -- having a better life due to living in a much wealthier country.

On the other hand, the people from rich countries that come here aren't moving from a poor country to a rich one; they're moving from a rich country to a different rich one.  These are people that, for the most part, are seeking some change in the ""kind"" of life they have, not the ""quality"".

That said, there are some suicides that come to mind that take the cake.  The first was caught live on tv during a press conference in the '60s - R. Budd Dwyer. [(still on the 'net)](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=860c9b9f3b)

The second was a 1980's suicide recorded by the guy himself.  Russian/Eastern-European dude in his late 40's/50's stammers about in his garage for about ten minutes in just his boxer shorts while waving a large 10 inch kitchen knife about in front of the camera.  He then lies face down on the floor, does a push-up, puts the tip of the blade to his sternum, then begins to slowly relax on it - it took a while, it wasn't pretty, but in the end he was quiet &amp; done. (never did figure out what his complaint was about)

The next would be ""how to commit suicide"".  At first, I thought, like most I suppose, that it was a joke or some kind of stunt.  It wasn't.  Long video from more than a decade ago - dude rattles off in front of cameras (2 - one near, one far) set-up outside for a while while chugging a nearly a litter of vodka while swallowing all sorts of pills, some kind of bottled poisons, and playing about with a pistol.  Good-n-drunk, he dowses himself in gas, puts a noose around his head, and steps over to a ledge, lights himself up, steps off in flames, part way down, pulls the trigger with the gun to his head, stops abruptly at the end of the rope, all-the-while burning, soon the rope snaps and his body falls another 80 or so feet onto some rough talus.

The last, is ""Asphyxia Suzha"".  This is a staged snuff film.  sort of.  Suzha is hanged by the neck until she stops moving.  her struggle lasts nearly 10 minutes.  This, being professionally done, is a BDSM stunt done at is most absolute extreme - Suzha most definitely dies/is dead - only moments later, off camera, does a professional medical team intervene.  Let's all hope she was paid well for that one! (still on the net: Asphyxia Suzha.mpg - download the torrent)

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I am an absolutely horrible person to give advice on losing weight (a quick look at my commenting history will reveal why) but exercise is, IMO, the best way to lose weight and keep it off.

Your diet could also use some work. I'm a big fan of having only two large meals each day, with some small snacks scattered throughout the work day. My typical day looks like this:
Breakfast: Large salad, no dressing, 750ml of water

During work day: Granola bar, celery with peanut butter (or hot sauce for some zest and less calories). If exercising, one tablespoon of malodextrin added to a water bottle, Clif bar or gel. If in weight loss mode, ice cubes or gum can help reduce feelings of hunger

Dinner: Salad again, few slices of chicken added for protein.

As well as eating less, just try and exercise as much as possible. I try and ride at least ten hours a week, ~200 miles, during the summer, and switch to running fifty or sixty miles/week during the winter.","1280628265"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I think Immortals lose their effectiveness after a while, unless your opponent is massing Thors/Tanks etc. They're good for a drop in the back of their base, and of course taking out the bigger units, but they have low mobility and a short range. Colossi are easier to move around and complement other units quite well. Plus their extended range is just awesome.

If you go for Templar, you can do fun things with them too, like warp a few near the enemy mineral line and then storm their workers (though I haven't tried this much.)

The foundation of my play, at least, is three Warp Gate, with a composition of mostly Stalkers and Zealots, and a few Sentries. If my first push doesn't work out, I try to see what they're building next. Then I can decide either Immortals + Colossi, or Phoenixes + VRs, in addition to that basic ground army. Getting info on your opponent's plans is important for deciding what tech path to go on, because any unit composition will have a weakness (and if you try building one that doesn't have a weakness, you start going down too many tech paths). Most games don't last long enough for it to be worthwhile to build a bunch of different unit types.","1280628283"

An infrared flash is sent out and then images are VERY rapidly sampled from the camera. This allows the camera to record when light hits any surface. This allows a nice 3D model of the scene to be built to which you can fairly rapidly fit a human model with an almost miniscule chance of failure. I would guess other commenters are right and that the rapid flashing is SUPER EFFECTIVE in KOing this approach. To explain away the other videos I'm guessing the model to scene matching isn't really efficient enough or robust enough to handle rapid movement....this should be an interesting product launch....","1280628301"

As a technical note, it is not necessary to address people on Reddit.  No one does it, since it is clear from the indented threading to whom you are replying.

&gt; You're being [*apprehensive*](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/apprehensive) about this.

[You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes)

It means [""Anxious or fearful about the future; uneasy.""](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/apprehensive)

But back to the point(s):

&gt; how bad men's lives are in third world countries

I don't see suffering as a men's rights issue.  People suffer everywhere.  To me, it becomes a men's rights issue when law or culture force a man to suffer unjustly or unnecessarily.

&gt; false dichotomy between men's rights vs. women's rights

Well, this is iffy.  In divorce and custody law, it is very much a zero-sum game.  The woman's gain comes directly at the expense of the man's well-being, his income, and his right to Father his child.

Similarly, in the area of legal accusations, women have gained the right to accuse with impunity (rape and domestic violence).  Securing men's rights in this area would mean curtailing women's rights.

I would like to see men's rights advance without asking women to cede ground, but I don't see it happening in the areas I mentioned.","1280628309"

And you are completely correct about the variance between states. The Georgia statute is a little scary; I could interpret forcibly as ""he does it"" and against her will as ""she testified she didn't want him too"" and then all of the fears about false accusations being grounds for conviction are justified.

This had to be done by a  particular private doctor sanctioned by the Canadian authorities; it could not be any other doctor. During the medical, while sticking needles into me and probing my various parts, the doctor (who was very chummy and started by chatting about my experiences at Oxford University, cricket, etc.) began asking more and more questions about my views on 9/11, the London Underground bombings, Al Qaeda and so on.

After starting out engaging in what I thought was casual conversation it gradually became clear to me that this was more than just a medical checkup, and I began to understand why only one doctor was licensed to do it.

The (now-poisonous) till-tape says ""SLGA"" which means ""Saskatchewan Liquor &amp; Gaming Authority"" (I think). They are open bank hours, for your drinking inconvenience. Then there's the private Cold Beer &amp; Wine stores, which, when they were first allowed to open, could ONLY sell 1. Cold Beer &amp; 2. Wine. Now they have hard alcohols and mixes and chips and nuts and a phone to call Batman. But the prices are high, because of the awesome privilege of shopping at a store that is 1. Open late (2 AM-ish) &amp; 2. Chills the beer/white wine (imagine that). So IF you buy the beer from the government in advance AND put it in the fridge also in advance, you could save a couple bucks.  
Cannabis is $10/gram so 1/8 oz = 3.5 grams = $35, but 'they' charge you $40 ""just because"" (in Saskatchewan). I have never asked how many grams are in my 60-bag (or weighed it out myself), but I assume it is 1/4 oz (7 grams)  (Based on a 28-gram oz). My ""guy"" likes me, I think he puts a little extra in there, plus it's always dried out, so no water weight. I'm always happy with what I get for $60.  
You can't buy tall cans at the LB anymore, not sure why. Also, they don't have ""everything,"" they way they do in Alberta, our neighbouring province to the west.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;This is some of the most convoluted logic that I have ever heard. Because the Democrats refused to make the Bush tax cuts permanent, the fact that these taxes are about to sunset means the Republicans will be responsible for raising taxes on working class Americans when the tax cuts expire at the end of this year according to Steny Hoyer. Good luck with that one.

It is pretty straight forward. The Republicans based a bill (with reconciliation, btw) that set up a tax increase in 2011. The Republican passed law set for taxes to go up significantly between this year and next. (Yes, they did this because reconciliation did not allow them to increase the deficit for more than 10 years.) And today the Repubicans refuse to vote for a tax cut for middle class Americans unless they can also get a tax cut for the rich. 

&gt;I thought the Bush tax cuts were only given to the wealthy Americans, isn’t that what Democrats have been claiming all these years?

No, the claim was that the vast benefit of the tax cuts were for the rich. And the Republicans want to give another big tax cut for the rich right now.

&gt;With Steny Hoyer’s assertion that working class Americans would face a tax increase if the Bush tax cuts are not made permanent he is finally admitting that the Bush tax cuts were not just for the richest Americans after all.

Primarily for the rich, overwhelmingly for the rich, not just for the rich.

"science","t5_mouw","You've got to remember, Wikipedia can (and is) edited by anyone who wants to.  It's very common for people to confuse temperature and heat.

Temperature is *average* heat over an area.  A thermometer measures that average because you can't actually see the fluid moving even when it appears to be holding steady (the higher the amount of heat within the fluid, the more rapidly the molecules spin, vibrate, crash into one another, etc.).  The rate of heat exchange to the liquid in a thermometer through the glass is equal to the rate that heat is lost from the fluid through the glass back to the environment while the meniscus stays at one level.

You've basically got to measure heat exchange with mathematics, once you can figure out how much energy there is within a system and external to it, since it's a rate.  It's a similar problem to for most people when they're trying to understand acceleration versus speed.  The car's speedometer is much like a thermometer in this analogy - it measures an average speed.  One calculates the acceleration by taking more than one sample of speed and using the appropriate mathematical formula to approximate the acceleration.

The foreposter has it right, you feel heat exchange, not temperature.  It's a fine distinction that is difficult to appreciate for those who haven't had a good general physics class under their belts yet.","1280628415"

I'm saying they're clearly not rounding up people and jailing them without due process in even .001% of the cases... and furthermore the patriot act has nothing to do with this because its such an extreme case. We can have a debate about how really we've had people be jailed for no reason other than for cops to fuck with someone or whatever over the weekend or ""incorrectly"" arresting someone even though they didn't miss their court date or something.. and the abuses of that sort of jailing without due process however is rare. As is the use of the patriot act... however in my opinion that doesn't make it a fair or constitutional.

I understand you think its an abuse of the constitution... I believe so as well. However would you then be against a bill that repeals the patriot act and/or also further enhances our right to due process and privacy? THAT is what we're arguing about. Just because there are more laws on the books doesn't mean that government is now has more power over us or that our rights are less protected. There are such things as good and bad laws and shades of grey in between just as there are politicians who stand up for our rights as citizens and other who do so far less often it seems.

If there are laws that allow people more power and/or protect or extend our constitutional rights then I'm confused why you wouldn't be FOR it. It really baffles me.

if republicans died/disbanded, democrats would have 40% of the pop vote and 60% would be generally undecided. democrats would win because a large proportion of the undecided will not vote.

when an artist dies, the balance of naysayers and defenders move in favour of the defenders because the naysayers generally shut up (aka typically, people typically don't trample on the graves of others unless it's hitler) leaving room for popularity in the artist to spike. with this, the general public moves in favour of the artist and those who decide to commemorate his life by seeking a physical essence of an artist.

and then the corporations take advantage of this and puts all their cds at the front of the store, which is the prime area to attract sales and profit. ads spring up regarding post-mortem albums and singles collections and bang, the star is reborn.

You think gay marriage and marijuana legalization would even be considered as political points if the Civil Rights movement didn't happen? 

That's perfectly true and important to remember. The OP is also right that ""stupid"" is in every generation.

That said, there's also no question that attitudes between generations are widely different right now. You can map out attitudes regarding (eg) gay marriage by age and the discrepancy is clear. 

It is equally wrong to pretend this doesn't exist or doesn't matter as it is to ""blame old people."" The correct attitude is to look at what we can learn: that our votes really do matter, and that if historically poor turnout for our demographic changed, politics would change as well. 

&gt; Hopefully by then, the generation that follows you will have the decency, intelligence, and good grace to put the blame where it belongs

I was too poor (rent/moving out for the first time all that shit) to really do anything and I was tired.

I'm crying, on my knees and he comes running into the room and starts to lick me in the face. He was just so damn happy. I went from crying to laughing really fast. Then I realized that if I did do myself in... he would be alone for a few days and the only thing to comfort him would be my rotting body. I didn't want to leave that way. So I didn't.

Dogs are awesome.

Edit: So I just realized that this was best of'ed on my main account and I figured this is a good time to have a little plug: If you are that depressed, you should get help. I guarandamntee you have someone that will listen. Hell, even reddit has /r/suicidewatch. Don't wait until it gets to the point that I did. Someone cares... and even if they are of the four legged and furry variety, they will miss the shit out of you.","1280628475"

"reddit.com","t5_6","I really wish I had something to add, but you've said it all and you've said it perfectly... So all I can do is give you my upvote and post some silly words of my own.

I'm also above the mean age of Reddittors (I'm not quite 40, but apparently that's considered quite old around these parts). It doesn't help that *technically* I've worked in the tech industry since I was 16 (first programing job writing a Pascal inventory management system for a regional warehouse supermarket chain in the rocky mountains in the late 1980s) so I have the career length of someone even older...

But I've noticed a decidedly anti-old-people bent lately that on the one hand I understand because *I* was like that not long ago, and on the other hand irritates me because I now know is more nuanced than just pure ageism.

The thing is, I would say there is truth to the ""[Know why we can't legalize filesharing, marijuana, gay marriage, etc. and then get on with our lives now? Because old people vote and YOU DON'T](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/cvv7t/know_why_we_cant_legalize_filesharing_marijuana/)"" mantra that is currently #4 on the front page. It's partly true, obviously, but more nuanced than just ""old people vote and are all idiots and that's why things suck"".

I'd say a more accurate description would be to say that right now in the older generation the above post is referring to you have a variety of factions. *Two* of the factions include **a)** those aging hippies which were *very* liberal and *I'd* argue *much* more progressive than a lot of this younger generation (there's a hell of a lot of nastiness that I've observed in youngin's these days that makes me stabby, see all the intolerance of fat people for one big example) and **b)** those aging squares who were freaked-the-fuck-out by the hippies 40 years ago and have made it their life's work to undo everything the hippies accomplished. The people that the above link is *really* referring to are these second types who are *very* vocal these days in polls and in elections.

So I guess what I'm trying to say is that while the ageist intolerance is completely wrong and misplaced, if it results in getting this younger generating *educated* about the problems and **into** the voting booths I can probably live with that.

I mean... after all... give it time, in a few years *they* will be in our shoes and see the next generation after them bitching about them being closed minded and backwards. Karma's a bitch...","1280628500"

Put some mud on the ground, plant some trees and seeds (maybe bring a bucket of water for farming?) and head out into the lower cave to explore and mine more metal.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My uncle once told me that when he was in his 20's he and his best friend were hanging out at the friends place. His best friend had a buddy come over. Now I can not speak to the character of all the people here but I know my uncle has been a pretty big drug addict since his teenage years So I will go out on a limb and say some drugs were being used when the buddy of my uncles best friend found the best friends gun. He began waving it all over the place and laughing. Then he pointed it at my uncles best friend and said bang. Little did this guy know, the gun was loaded and when he said bang, the gun also said bang. My uncle was instantly showered in his best friends brains. He just stood there while the shooter stared at the gun, dropped it, and ran out the door. I'm not really sure what happened next but I do know that my uncle was understandably never the same. I hope I am not down voted due to this not being something I saw. I think the job of sharing a fucked up first hand story was done non the less.","1280628559"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I spent many years as an ER nurse.  Once at a hospital in downtown Philly I received a patient who was found down after several days in her home.  She probably  had a stroke and since she was elderly , no one came to see her frequently enough to find out.
When she got to me, I and a nursing student set about our basic tasks, one of which was to clean her.  She had multiple stools caked in her underwear, I rolled her onto her back and cut off her clothes, to begin the cleaning. My student returned with a basin of soapy H2O and I jokingly told her to ""hang-on"" as I knew this was going to be distasteful.   
I then pulled her legs open and peeled away the lump of stool, which was caked up and into her vagina.
My student recoiled in horror as a  wave of galloping maggots crawled from her vagina and fanned out across the gurney,  I estimated them to number in the hundreds and they moved almost as a flock or a school, dripping like fat rain drops onto the floor.
I realized that night that I had really seen so much in my career that my mind had been permanently warped, and that I'd forever be set apart from all the ""civilians"". 
Still, I think if I racked my brain I could come up with an even worse story.

The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, **our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation**. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. **They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The senate, therefore, ought to be this body**; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions; but my opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered.

The intimacy involved in intercourse is an emotionally powerful experience for both partners, which helps to a large extent in forging and strengthening the bond between the two. In the end, this bond between man and women is stronger than family, friends, anyone else. 

Physical attraction is not only to propel one to reproduce, but it also helps you select a partner who has different genes, reducing the chances of mutations and other genetic issues in your children.

Finally, physical attraction is awesome. Sex is awesome. Having a girlfriend who is fuckin hot is awesome. 

In a way, I understand where you're coming from, but frankly the Halo effect has zero impact on how I pick a woman. Just cause she's hot doesn't mean I instantly become a retard and do shit-all dumb things, or come up with all kinds of wild, idiotic fantasies or assumptions based on her appearance.

OK, let's see.  Here is the actual text:

&gt; 'Ich will heute wieder ein Prophet sein: Wenn es dem internationalen Finanzjudentum in und außerhalb Europas gelingen sollte, die Völker noch einmal in einem Weltkrieg zu stürzen dann wird das Ergebnis nicht die Bolschewisierung der Erde und damit der Sieg der Judentums sein sondern die Vernichtung der Jüdischen Rasse in Europa.'

My shitty (but impartial) translation:

' I want to be prophet today : If the international Finanzjudentum [Jewish financial interest] in and outside of Europe should succeed again to plummet the world into war, the result will then separate the peoples, not the Bolschewisierung [Bolshevization] of the earth, and thus the victory of the Judentums, but the destruction of the Jewish race in Europe.'

This is not a statement of intention, in any situation, nor even close to proof that six million people died.  I am concerned with proof.  He words this statement as if the people will spontaneously rise up, not as if he will lead them.  He is actually piggybacking on top of public anger at communists (remember, the bombing of the Reichstag that prompted Hitler's rise to power was blamed on Joseph van der Lubbe, an alleged communist), as well, thus the mention of Bolshevization (Bolschewisierung).  Much like 9/11, as is often noted.

&gt; ""Regarding the Jewish Question, the Führer is determined to clear the table. He warned the Jews that if they were to cause another world war, it would lead to their own destruction. Those were not empty words. Now the world war has come. The destruction of the Jews must be its necessary consequence. We cannot be sentimental about it. It is not for us to feel sympathy for the Jews. We should have sympathy rather with our own German people. If the German people have to sacrifice 160,000 victims in yet another campaign in the east, then those responsible for this bloody conflict will have to pay for it with their lives.""-Joseph Goebbels

The same problems with this.  These are just quotes, accurate or not.  

&gt; Europe was decimated. Well, that's what happens when you invade/conquer Poland and France, attempt to conquer Russia, and bomb London to the ground. once again, they DECLARED WAR on the united States. Not the other way around.

Yes, and then we invented the nuclear weapon and killed probably upwards of a million people, many of them civilians.

&gt; Anyways, in 1933, roughly 9.5 million Jews lived in Europe. Over 60% of the world Jewish population today. In 1950 only 3.5 million Jews lived in Europe. And no, they didn't all just ""move away"". I'd say that's quite the ""dip"".

where you can still lower the price without suffering quality or performance is the case, you can take some for $15 instead of $40 but I would not skimp out on case it will stay with you for some years to come... and this one is cheapest from good ones I know of.

You can take only 2GB of ram(-40$)  it will still run OK, the game will still run relatively smoothly, but loading time and occasional waiting for the game will be there.

If you really lack the money you can also skimp out on PSU (power source unit) you can take some cheap one but its a lottery, you can take 500-600W for half the price, but theres a risk it will not live for long, but if you really, really want to cut costs its not the worst way you can go...

And from further up

&gt; Why are you holding them separate? Both together **can**

And more

&gt; Keep in mind: the Assertion isn't ""Dawkins approach WILL reinforce ALL believers' faiths"", it ""Dawkins approach CAN reinforce SOME believer's faiths

I was pretty steadfast in it.

Now, yes.  I did say ""I can actually go into the relative comparison, and I still hold that it is above the baseline."", which you apparently didn't understand as an aside.  ie, ""Notwithstanding the actual argument going on, I hold this position on the side..""  It was an aside.

Like when some folks argue that ""atheism means you believe gods don't exist"" and you say ""no, atheism just means you don't believe there is sufficient evidence that gods do exist, not the actual positive position that gods do actually not exist.  Now personally, I do believe that... but that's not part of the definition"".  The personal belief stated there was an ASIDE, not part of the main argument.

A second hint of that being an aside was that I said the conversation was too confrontation to get to that part of it. ""too confrontational to be productive"".  

Then I follow that explicitly with 

&gt; There simply isn't enough real data to support the notion that Dawkins actually is truly a net-benefit or a net-detriment for acceptance of atheism

That EXPLICITLY contradicts the notion of being to say on way or another.  Or to explain the mechanics of that part as well... ""I could go into this side track if you want, but I'm not.  So I'll repeat my position on the main argument to try to get us back on track""

I'm sorry my aside was too vague for you to follow.  I'm sorry my ""getting us back on track"" was too vague for you to catch.  I'm sorry you missed it and ended up arguing against a position I didn't intend to actually argue.  I'm sorry that you missed my several explicit statements of my actual position on this particular argument as quoted above.

In the future, if someone is making explicitly contradictory statements it's often helpful to point them out so the conversation can that can get clarified.  Contradictions are a sure sign that one side or the other isn't following along for one reason or another.","1280628669"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","This fallacy only applies to the private sector, and here's why:

Government, when properly conducted (as is NOT the case in America today, for various reasons) exists to provide services that the market fails to provide, like public works, police and fire services,﻿ enforcement of contracts, environmental protection, the rule of law, universal health insurance, and so on. 

Most, if not all, of these services underpin the private sector. The free market is only free and effective thanks to government support. Think about Hobbs' Leviathan. Without the rule of law, could you trust anybody to repay a loan, or follow through on a promise to purchase a good? How could a number of private firms even effectively enforce the rule of law? 

So government works DO create wealth. The only difference is that the wealth belongs to everybody, instead of a suit only the baker can wear. 

Government can be wasteful in practice, yes. But let's not forget that sometimes this is demanded by democracy. 'Red tape' is detrimental to pure efficiency but is essential to fairness and transparency, i.e. in the case of contracting out the building of a road. It may be less costly to hire a firm that has done previous work, but a review process and bids from multiple firms ensures fairness and transparency.","1280628756"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You were lucky to survive. Had a similar experience except with a guy on a bike who blew a stop light on a road that's speed limit was 55. It was just getting dark and this guy was riding without a light or helmet.

I saw him casually ride into the intersection without even looking. Traffic was heavy and he rode right in front of a car that had nowhere to go but hit him. Not even sure if the motorist had time to even see the cyclist until he was catapulted into the air on impact and came down loudly through the windshield.

I was so pissed at the cyclist. I couldn't stop to be a witness because I thought I'd kick his ass for doing something so stupid, if he had survived. I phoned later to be a witness.

As a life long cyclist it really irks me to see the way so many ride their bikes with no regard to their safety. I've ridden hundreds of thousands of miles in my life and feel lucky to not have been seriously injured by a motorist. But also credit my commitment to developing and following safe habits.

I always wear a helmet. Always ride with traffic along the safest distance to the right edge of the lane unless making a left turn. I look where I am going not only to see where I am going and be sure it's safe, but to telegraph my intention to others in addition to using hand signals.

I follow the rules that govern a car. I stop at all stop signs and stop lights. And ** never pass a car on the right **. 

When riding after dark, and I do a lot of miles after dark or before sunrise, I have my bike light up from all angles.

Making these ingrained habits have helped me a better driver and rider and avoid the accidents that are associated with making mistakes while spacing out / driving on auto-pilot.","1280628773"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I used to practice in bankruptcy.  I can't give legal advice here, but here are some ideas if this happens to you, and some general advice for dealing with collection agencies:

1.  If sued for a debt beyond the statute of limitations, contact a lawyer and you can usually get the judgment dismissed if the statute of limitations has passed.

2.  Never, ever, ever, ever give money to a collection agency after the statute has run.  That, generally, restarts the clock and you're screwed.

3.  It's best to avoid collections agencies altogether.  If they call (you usually know), tell them they have the wrong number.  Say that you recently got the number and have no idea who had it before.  Act clueless.

4.  If you get mail from collections agencies, slap a sticker or tape over your address, write ""not at address, return to sender"" on it and drop it into a mailbox.  They'll get it back and figure you have a new address.

5.  If you get sued for something past the statute of limitations, contact the bar association that licensed the lawyer who did so.  File a formal, written bar complaint against the fucker.  You're not supposed to do this sort of thing - it can be malpractice.  The various state bars take complaints seriously and will give the lawyer an anal probe that can result in suspension or disbarment.  This stuff is one of the few things that freaks out lawyers - be sure to use it.  It can help end this bullshit; no kne wants to lose their license to practice law.  This is the biggest stick you can put in their eye.

7.  Seriously consider filing a small claims suit under the FDCPA.  Lots of times, they'll default and not show up - you will win automatically.  Even if they respond, you have a good chance of winning or settling.

8.  If you do get stuck on the phone with a collections agency, tell them that you never had such an account.  They will usually ask you to confirm the last four digits of your Social Security number.  Make something up, then mention that you often get calls for someone else with your name.

9.  Never, ever be afraid to brazenly lie to collections agencies.  They are the scum of the earth and will lie to you.  No need to be honest with them.

10.  Default is usually the best way to handle bad debt.  Bankruptcy sucks for a variety of reasons and the various credit ""help"" agencies are either dirtbags or funded by the credit card industry.  Fuck them.  It's better to disappear and let the statute of limitations run out.  There are some drawbacks, of course, but you'll usually be better off in the end.

That being said, pay your debts if you can.  But never be afraid to default.  It is often the best choice when you can't pay, though you will never hear about it.  Everyone makes it seem like repayment and bankruptcy are the only options, while default is usually the best for you.","1280628777"

In general all cameras have about the same cost per shot, there are exceptions to the rule like the D3 if bought on sale. I am a pro, I beat the shit out of my gear. my first digi was a canon 1D, I sold it at 452K clicks still working flawlessly several years ago, ran into the guy I sold it to recently and he told me it was still working. I have had 2 D200's die after 75K clicks and my current D300/D700 are at 56K and 46K. both working fine.
Really you got a good amount of use out of that camera and now it's time to upgrade. I would suggest waiting a few months to see what photokina brings if you can be without a body for a few more weeks. my advice is, if you can live without video get a D700 as closeout stock at some ridiculously low price.

Suggestion: Dad should spend at least one full day playing with the baby.  Mom takes the other two kids away on a weekend, Dad and baby just sit around and do mellow non-scary baby things all day.  Eat, play, nap, repeat.  Nothing but Dad all day long.

In every generation there are those who are more forward thinking, and those who are stuck in the past. Statistics show that our generation is the one that will legalize marijuana and gay marriage. Yours had the chance and failed.

While many ""old"" people may agree with the legalization of marijuana and gay marriage, they were never able to overcome the over-riding entrenched attitudes that seem to define their generation. (I know that is a generalization and I have met many older people who seem to be very receptive to liberal social ideas. But conversely, I have met a great many more who seem to be illogically clinging to their staunch conservative agendas.)

To add to browneyedgal's comment: In the event of basic CRP with or without an AED absolutely do not stop. If you have to rotate compressions for an hour between a group of people, do what you have to do.

It sounds like many other people's experiences with Women's Studies program have been very negative. Those programs do a disservice to men and women alike. They turn people away from dealing with numerous real gender issues affecting both genders by focusing on farcical non-issues like whether or not skyscrapers are like giant penises keeping women down.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It's not just Assange who claims our intel system is faulty. Chinese government hackers regularly get into Defense Department computer systems. In which event, again, those names that everyone is talking about are directly exposed to prying eyes. 

*Clearly*, we don't care enough about our sources to bother protecting their names. 

Really what you seem to be arguing is that Julian Assange has an ethical responsibility to safeguard data that may lead to the death or injury of another party. To reduce his own ethical responsibility, Assange claimed (and I believe him) that he attempted to negotiate with the Obama administration to release a redacted version of the documents - he received no response, suggesting that the release of the 92,000 pages was possibly intentional.

The example of the FBI leaking informant data to the press isn't valid - what is missing from this picture is a moral dimension: Imagine if the FBI invaded Canada and then leaked an informant list that made its way to the Canadian underground. Now what do you think about that leak?

It feels like the real leaked story here is that the US is **not** protecting its sources. If I remember correctly, we circulate sensitive intel across a massive network of affiliate agencies. If the names of confidential sources are unprotected, many can intercept this data (via compromised system, security leak, word of mouth) and exploit it. Not just the Pakistanis but all rival nations.

The smoke screen is that Assange is not qualified to release this kind of data and that it directly endangers American and Afghani lives. Of fucking course he's not qualified to read or release such data. But the kind of information that Wikileaks has is largely already available to any wealthy and powerful party extending feelers for it. What Wikileaks is doing is democratizing data that previously had been privy to an elite few. I see nothing wrong with this idea, other than that it made loosen the stranglehold that the military industrial complex has on the throat of America.

In the event that Pakistan was not receiving and then leaking this data to the Taliban, and if it cost American or innocent lives, then it would seem imprudent to argue for complete and total freedom of information. Perhaps Mr. Assange should introduce an additional layer of censorship, if only to protect individuals whose lives are in jeopardy.

By the way, thank you for a well written and insightful post. I found the substance of your argument to be thought provoking and engaging on many different levels.","1280628959"

Socrates argued that in order for us to judge something as beautiful, true, or good (a mental state), we are forced to conclude that there is some Thing that exists which corresponds to beauty, truth, and goodness.

the [audio dharma](http://www.audiodharma.org/) website has a lot of free dharma talks. i've been listening to those by gil fronsdal for a couple months now and i think he's great. he's a theravadan buddhist who does a great job of conveying buddhist teachings to the western mind. ","1280629032"

Not primitivism. Primitivism calls for the murder of the vast majority of the world's population, barring a few lucky 'elite' folk who get to live hunter-gatherer lifestyles - and somehow I doubt that the primmos see themselves as among the die-outs. Primitivism is the single most disgusting idea humankind has ever advanced as a political ideology. If, through some philosophical accident, it came down to a choice between supporting primitivists and supporting fascists, I would have no hesitation in joining the fascists on the pro-humankind side of the barricades (and yes, it says a lot when the fascists are the pro-humankind good guys).","1280629035"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","No one here is being any real help.  First, keep it up and keep at it.  You're doing it for your kids at this point.  You need to stay strong for them first and foremost.

Without knowing specifics on the job, where you are and what other opportunities there are around you, no one will be able to give you sound advice.  That being said:

Just because you worked in retail doesn't mean that's all you can do.  Retail and managing is business and that type of business can be found anywhere.  You don't just work retail, you work in the retail business doing X, Y, and managing Z.  

You can do that in any business, and apply those skills elsewhere.  Maybe you need to be more confident in your abilities and start branching out in your searches.

Cutting back is also key.  Cell phones with extra charges and fluff?  Get rid of them.  The full blown cable TV?  High speed internet?  Cut them out.  

$50 for internet = $600 a year.
Home phone...  How much is that costing?  Please don't tell me you have a high priced home phone AND a cell phone.  Cut out your home phone all the way down to just dailing out local calls, make the long distance on cell.  If Mom is out of country how much are you spending on long distance?  Look everywhere to cut.

Credit cards, cut them up basically.  Don't use them.  Stay safe and careful with them.

Lastly, there is nothing wrong with being a single mother.  Keep at it, keep working hard and providing for your kids.  The right man will come along eventually, and while that will help your situation, that is secondary, and I repeat secondary to making sure you can provide for yourself by yourself.  Don't ever just grab on to anything that comes along just because a man is insterested.  You might well know this, but I can't believe how many times I've seen a woman do this, and end up in a worse position than before.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Your post is a hot fucking mess, man. Firstly, this debate has zero  to do with agnosticism vs. atheism, as Maher himself would tell you he's technically an agnostic atheist. Secondly, there are plenty of agnostic atheists who think that all (or most) believers are idiots.

What exactly is your point? Neither Bill Maher being an agnostic atheist nor many agnostic atheists thinking most believers are idiots implies that all agnostic atheists must necessarily think that believers are idiots.

&gt; Finally, if you believe that the existence of a god can't be definitively known, how can you say that you wouldn't consider someone claiming not only to know, but to know what the deity is thinking and desires, to be delusional?

This is a valid point, I acknowledge it and stand corrected. I think I might have painted myself into a corner above by using a too strong definition of agnosticism. If you go by the definition of agnosticism as I have stated above, then indeed, I would agree that you would necessarily have to think that religious people are deluded.

My comment above was written with the weaker form of the word agnosticism in mind, meaning that it is unknown whether gods exist as opposed to the stronger definition that says that it is unknowable whether gods exist.

If you merely claim that it is unknown whether gods exist, then you must recognize the possibility of other people genuinely experiencing the presence of a deity, because the unknown status of the existence of gods does not prevent either outcome (assuming there is a way to identify such an experience, i.e. to distinguish it from a stroke of crazy). You wouldn't be able to call such people delusional, because you make no assertion as to whether gods can be known to exist.

If you claim that it is unknowable whether gods exist, then indeed you would necessarily need to think that people that do claim to know god(s) exist are delusional, no matter whether it is through genuine personal experience or through indoctrination or whatever.

So today I learned that it's important to clearly define what you mean by the words you use, and then -- my apologies -- use them correctly.","1280629055"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Nice reply and thank you. If I could make a point here I would point out that recently there was talk that Obama was really born in Kenya and that they deliberately moved to Hawai forged a birth certificate so that he could run for President. Now, I accept that you and know how absolute impossible that series of events would have been...to orchestrate. Raising a son, moving him about, getting the right education, meeting the right people and of course...Winning an election for President of the U.S.. Now those who believed it, saw is as a ""plan"" and feasible. 
Now consider what you believe about the Protocol of the Learned Elders of Zion. How is it possible that they managed to stage all this and have all the pieces fall into place? How could they have controlled all the events and circumstances? And over such a long period of time. 
Reading History, you know of course that antisemitism has existed for a long long time. Even the very fact that Jews became Bankers was a result of antisemitism among early Christians. Usury was not acceptable to early Christians. Jews in other crafts were ""taking"" jobs that good Christians deserved. By forbidding Jews the right to practice crafts and trades, the Christians forced them into Banking.
Early Monarchs needing money for ""Wars and Whatnots"" soon found they could only raise big sums by borrowing money, their serfs and peasants had little to remit. They were forced to seek loans from those who had the money...and they too soon resented the power of bankers to make or break you. All in all, antisemitism was very common from a Religious viewpoint as the Killers of Christ, and from the view that they held too much power.
I think that this resentment was what led to the Protocols. I think it still exists today, though not nearly so openly. 
In my readings in History, I once looked into the rise of the KKK in America during the 1920's..a period when Jim Crow Laws had existed  long enough to have ""kept Blacks in their place"". I wondered Why the KKK made such a strong showing..controlling several States from the Governors to the Legislatures. Holding National Parades and even staging events in New York City. When I looked at what they feared, what caused them to Stand, Unite and Protest ..it wasn't racism ( but yes they were still racists )  It was a strong feeling against Jews and Catholics. America was just getting the ""wrong kind of immigrants"". 
Anyway...if you look back at History...and not some pamphlets still published by Antisemitic Groups or individuals you can follow how all this came about. 
Sorry I couldn't be briefer.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j"," &gt; and yet try to deny that there is a force mightier than the market that some how perverts it. Frankly, you seem to be hiding from the truth.

i'm not so sure you meant to use the word deny. I definitely think there is a force mightier than the market that perverts it. Abusive, violent, and manipulative states existed for thousands of years before the purported ""abuses"" of capitalism. Free market trade is a relatively new thing. States have always existed to squash it. Temples, Churches, Mosques, and more recently public schools have existed to make sure everyone learns at a young age that the state is good and necessary, and one of it's necessary functions is ""regulating trade so some businessman won't rob you dry."" As if people can't regulate their own trade. This why I laugh when people say ""private interests are taking control of the state."" I know they have never questioned why there is a state to begin with, and they probably never will. The problem isn't the power, it's who has it, apparently.  It's not as if I haven't examined this.  It's that its not interesting to argue what is the zero-sum-game and what isn't when the answer is glaringly obvious.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I would like to know where Jesus spoke in support of capital punishment

Jesus:

“But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition? For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.” Matthew 15:3-4

Paul:

“But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil” (Romans 13:4)

&gt;Because I am a libertarian/anarchist, I have people tell me all the time that the bible says we are to ""obey the laws of the land"" when the bible never says that

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Render_unto_Caesar...

&gt;However if they really believed that they would condemn the founding fathers for rebellion against England

The Enlightenment and French Revolution were condemned by the Church, so yes. It states that one should obey the laws of a country and focus on spirituality.

&gt;well, I don't believe anything just because ""Christianity"" teaches it (faith is a personal issue, not a group project) my beliefs are based on my own interpretation of scripture (of course i am influenced by teachings of others and my upbringing, but I try to discern scripture myself with wisdom and prayer)

I blame it on all sorts of factors; a strong resistance to peer pressure, never socialized outside of class at all in High School, and not much in college. I seldom drank, and NEVER did drugs. I never did sports, because the people who did that in school were the same people that would harass &amp; beat me up.

I'm sure if Twitter, Myspace, or Facebook were around when I graduated, I could have maintained contact with old friends, but that boat's long since sailed. But probably the biggest reason is that I thought a good woman would just come into my life naturally/accidentally, we'd be friends at first, then more than that, and everything would be cool.

She fell screaming to her death and her friend ran to me to scream at me or whatever, but i threw her on the ground and walked away. I ""woke up"" in my bed unable to even open my eyelids more than halfway and saw her sitting on my window sill, whispering to me these things about power and curses, dark lords and all that. Can't quite remember what it was, but that shit is surreal as fuck. Anyways, I willed myself to move because of how brutally scary it is to not be able to move at all and saw my fan in my window where I always keep it. I haven't quite looked at it the same, with the knowledge that there just might be a pissed off witch hiding in it's whirling blades.","1280629145"

That is the safest way, and clutches are built for this exact use. Using the BRAKES will cause roll-back in most drivers.

&gt;take your foot off the clutch when you are moving enough not to stall

That's like saying ""Use the gas pedal to increase speed."" Why would you think I would ride the clutch? I've already said *not* to ride the clutch.

That's what will happen if you ride the clutch, *not* if you use it *properly* to keep from rolling at a hill.

I did not have any expectations, good or bad, when coming into the movie, and when I was done watching I'm glad I did, simple as that.  

And let me clear something up.  I am not claiming this is a good movie.  I'm saying until I saw reviews, I thought it was, but I suppose it's not.
Something you cannot argue with is that I did enjoy, and I like it.  Whether it's good or not doesn't matter to me, I will not attempt to make my opinion fact.  I'm just saying if there is NOTHING to like about it, why would I or the very few others like it?","1280629209"

Country style ribs aren't really a rib...they usually come from the pork shoulder. They're big and meaty, and require special cooking to keep from being tough. So, I slow-cooked them first to get them melt-in-your-mouth tender, and then finished them on the grill to give them that awesome crispy grilled taste and texture on the outside. I topped them with hickory smoked barbecue sauce after the first turning to give the sauce a chance to glaze on top. The bowl for the salad is completely edible, made entirely of Parmesan cheese, and both the entree and salad are matched with a duo of grilled summer squash and zucchini.","1280629218"

Heat exchange with the environment is relatively easy when the environment is far colder than our own surface temperature (to the point where we may even have to protect ourselves from it by *shudder* wearing clothes), but as it gets closer to our surface temperature (which is lower than our core temperature that you're referring to, by the way) it gets harder to get rid of excess heat, and therefore feels warmer.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","EDIT: Downvote me if you want but I work in mens fashion and I see from the front lines the kind of guys wearing hats. I'm trying to explain to you why it doesn't work.

You're romanticizing something that was out of fashion in the early 1900s and then came back into fashion in varying styles over the following 5 decades. It's a useless affectation like wearing an ascot. A trend. If this generation started wearing hats the next generation would stop because they would realize this, just like our generation is trying to phase out ties in the workplace. 

Really though, you don't want to wear a hat, what you want is to be a man. Look at any movie or picture from 50/100 years ago, ""men were men"" then and they also wore hats. You're trying to acquire some personality and mystique by way of a fashion accessory but you need to realize that Humphrey Bogart could have intimidated you wearing a skirt and knee highs. 

Hats in 2010 don't work unless you're a model at a fashion event. People who can pull off wearing a hat don't wear it as part of an outfit, they don't say ""well I have my keys and my wallet and MY HAT, lets go."" The guy I'm thinking of buys a hat for $5 at a flea market, wears it like a $500 hat and never wears it again because tomorrow he'll be wearing a leather jacket and the next day an ascot and the next day purple jeans and the next day, you get the point. People who dress well don't dress like caricatures of a time period.

And guys if you're balding/bald, DO NOT WEAR A HAT, you're not fooling anyone. It's like turning your insecurity into a big blinking arrow that says ""LOOK HERE.""","1280629237"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I worked as an autopsy tech for a large medical examiner's office for a few years, so I've seen all types of decomposed shut-ins, abused kids, blown-off heads, burned bodies, stabbings, shootings, mangled bodies from car wrecks and hit-and-runs, industrial accidents, impossibly obese fuckers, colons impacted with 8 lbs of shit, 14L of fluid in the abdominal cavity, and various other things that would make the denizens of /r/gore absolutely jizz themselves. Sadly, I cannot pick out just ONE thing as the single most disturbing, so here are some of my greatest hits off the top of my head:

- The decomposed lower torsos of a mother and daughter that were all the remained after their pitbulls got hungry.

- 500lb decomposed post-op male-to-female transsexual

- An 8 year old that had been raped, beaten with a baseball bat and then set on fire by her mom's ex-boyfriend

- The floppy remains of a 1 year old after we removed pieces of his skull, most of his ribs, several long bones, eyes, and flayed the skin from head-to-toe on his back so we could see the bruises underneath

- Some girl who got hit by 3 or 4 cars as she was trying to run across a freeway.

- A guy who got pulled into an exposed turbine blade at work that split him from almost in half from his crotch to neck

- Wearing the epidermal layer of skin from a decomposed body's hand over my own, Buffalo Bill-style (Don't worry, I was wearing latex gloves for protection) so we could get fingerprints off it.

- A 15 year old kid who blew his head off with a shotgun because he got a coke bottle stuck up his ass and thought it would be less embarrassing to shoot himself than go to the ER.

- Ok, pretty much any [decomposed body](http://imgur.com/bpnDn) **WARNING** EXTREMELY NSFW. EDIT for context: That's what's left after we get done eviscerating a body. The head is to the right and the legs are to the left (you can see the pelvic floor on the left that formed by your femurs connecting to the pelvis. That's where your bladder and rectum sit.) The kind of pinkish think in the center is the aorta that's been opened up to look for atherosclerotic changes, meaning the big brown thing in the middle is the spine. The pleural space is filled with decomposition fluid and emulsified fat. On the bottom, you can just make out the back of the rib cage since the body is lying face up. The green/yellow bits are all fat that is decomposing and the large red patches are decomposing muscle. ","1280629243"

I personally believe it is more like 50-50.  Maybe that is a little optimistic but I'm sure it's closer to the reality than 100-0.  In every bill it seems to be a compromise.  Half of it appeases the voters the other half shells out to the corporations.  This sucks of course but there is no reason to despair and give up.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","A.

Well, the first thing is, the higher up you go in elected office, the more badness there seems to be.  I think we have an electoral and political system that, the higher up you go, selects more and more for bad qualities, and forces more and more good candidates out.  Some really good ones make it way up, get elected Governor or Senator or the like, but there's a lot stacked against them.  You see, on average, much better elected officials at lower levels like state rep.

However - and this is easy to miss if you're not actually actively participating in the democratic system (by which I mean running for office or volunteering on campaigns - IMO voting isn't quite ""participation"") - *that is the overwhelming majority*.  The few hundred elected officials we have at the very top levels are vastly outnumbered by the tens of thousands below them.  Most campaigns, by far, are at those lower levels.

B.

So, the second important thing is, find good candidates.  They're out there, at any level.  There are great people running for every kind of office.  And when you work on a campaign or volunteer heavily, you get to know them.  After a while doing that, it means there are a bunch of people in government who you personally know, and feel comfortable talking to.  That helps a lot.  When there's something happening in the state legislature, for example, I email a bunch of state reps and senators who know me to ask their opinion.  I try to also be a conduit between other people and the candidates, and foster more direct interaction.  In reality, you don't have to know your local and state elected officials to have a productive contact with them, the big problem is that most people don't even think of it, let alone believe it could happen, so they don't try, or don't try with any confidence.

C.

Make change.  Things to happen.  Many frustrations happen to, and good things are stymied, but after some time you can see what you've accomplished.  You can see tangible results - for example, I know that I participated in having our minimum wage raised, defending and expanding the legality of gay marriage in the northeast, vastly improved health insurance coverage in Massachusetts and now reform nationally, the availability of ""morning after"" contraceptives in MA, likely expansion of public transportation in my city, and many other things.  Seeing the tangible results of one's efforts is a great motivator that overcomes a lot of potential cynicism.  Sure, I can see plenty of brokenness, but I know that my continued work will partly fix some of those things.","1280629289"

* The menu bar (above the tabs) in Vista does not have enough contrast.  It is black text on a dark background.  Ideally the menu should be using the same background as the browser chrome behind the toolbar, address bar and search bar, and not the Window UI color.

* One of the concerns about the new tab placement is that they are so far away (more mouse movement and eye tracking required).  I have a bookmarks toolbar as well, which makes it even further.  Ideally, I think maybe it would be great if I could force the bookmarks toolbar above the tabs.

Then, draw his arm forward, while stepping into his closest ankle and he'll be falling onto the chair. Rip his arm towards you to create a roll away from you. This means he will impact the chair with his back.

If you sufficiently carefully sample so as to obtain a representative fraction of the population, you can estimate population proportions very accurately. Most professional survey companies know how to do this quite well.

The ""margin of error"" on this survey is roughly 2%; that is, *assuming* the survey has been carried out well, the population proportion responding as nonbelievers would be within 2% of the reported figure about 95% of the time.

[There are some further issues with these sorts of questions (self reports of nonbelief are unreliable in interviews if nonbelief is regarded as undesirable by society at large unless you take additional steps to reduce this effect), so part of the growth in numbers may represent it seeming ""safer"" to admit to nonbelief rather than a change in the actual proportion of nonbelief. This is not as much of a problem if we take care with what we claim to measure - reported belief in this case.]

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Nothin like Gandhi quotes:

Honest disagreement is often a good sign of progress.
I believe in equality for everyone, except reporters and photographers.
Hate the sin, love the sinner.
Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.
It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts, than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.
Whatever you do will be insignificant, but it is very important that you do it.
You must be the change you want to see in the world.

Crazy Ernie: If nobody comes down here and buys a car in the next hour, I'm gonna club this baby seal. That's right! I'm gonna club this seal to make a better deal. You know I'll do it, too, cause I'm crazy. 
George Newman: Lesbian Nazi Hookers Abducted by UFOs and Forced Into Weight Loss Programs... all next week on Town Talk. 
Kuni: Nothing! Absolutely nothing! STUPID! You're so STU-PIIIIIIIIIIID! 
Raul Hernandez: Badgers? Badgers? We don't need no stinking badgers. 

Or Burroughs:
A functioning police state needs no police. 
After one look at this planet any visitor from outer space would say 'I want to see the manager.' 
Anything that can be done chemically can be done by other means. 
Be just and if you can't be just, be arbitrary. 
Happiness is a byproduct of function, purpose, and conflict; those who seek happiness for itself seek victory without war.  (Interesting contrast to Gandhi)
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
The face of evil is always the face of total need. 

Of special mention is WSB's Words of Advice for Young People:

Never interfere in a boy and girl fight.
Beware of whores who say they don't want money. The hell they don't. What they mean is they want more money. Much more.
If you're doing business with a religious son of a bitch, get it in writing. His word isn't worth shit, not with the good Lord telling him how to fuck you on the deal.
Avoid fuckups. You all know the type. Anything they have anything to do with, no matter how good it sounds, turns into a disaster. 

Do not offer sympathy to the mentally ill. Tell them firmly, ""I am not paid to listen to this drivel. You are a terminal fool.""

Now some of you may encounter the devil's bargain if you get that far. Any old soul is worth saving at least to a priest, but not every soul is worth buying. So you can take the offer as a compliment. They charge the easy ones first, you know, like money, all the money there is. But who wants to be the richest guy in some cemetery? Not much to spend it on, eh, Gramps? Getting too old to cut the mustard. Have you forgotten something, Gramps? In order to feel something, you have to be there. You have to be 18. You're not 18, you are 78. Old fool sold his soul for a strap-on. 

How about an honorable bargain? ""You always wanted to become a doctor. Now's your chance. Why, you could have become a great healer and benefit humanity. What's wrong with that?"" Just about everything. There are no honorable bargains involving exchange of qualitative merchandise like souls. Just quantitative merchandise like time and money. So piss off, Satan, and don't take me for dumber than I look. As an old junk pusher told me, ""Watch whose money you pick up.""

In high school, some of our desks had chairs with two back legs attached to desks with two front legs.  There was a single bar that ran under the seat, along the right side and up, then under the desk to hold the whole thing together.  

So anyway, in physics class one day, a rather annoying fat girl was sitting there when the screw that held the bar in place broke.  It was still attached to the desk part, but could now freely rotate.  Her weight forced the chair down, causing the desk and chair to collapse inward on each other.  But she only dropped about 6 inches before she was pinned between the two.  She started almost running in place trying to push herself up to get out of this situation but she couldn't.  Our physics teacher was the closest to her, so he tried to lift her up and as he tugged on her arm it looked like he was trying to lift a truck.  He finally managed to get her up enough that she could roll out of the seat to her left, sorta tackling our teacher in the process.  

The rest of us in class were too paralyzed with trying (I think successfully) not to laugh to react, it felt like this went on for 10 minutes but it was probably a few seconds.  But man, we laughed our asses off about it for years after the fact.","1280629374"

This is absolutely possible, but the money has to come back to the issuing economy in order to grow through investment (and with any valuable currency it won't take very long until it falls into the hands of someone intent on growing its value).  That goes out the window, of course, should Vietnam decide that U.S. dollars are now their legal tender and are permitted to print them by our govt.

&gt;In the longer term, the likelihood of return approaches 1, but it's not inevitable.

I'd call it inevitable for all intents and purposes.  If it never returns to its issuing economy then more will be printed in order to replace it (the same as if quantities of currency are physically destroyed) and its value will go down, which will lead investors in other economies to exchange the currency for something tangible (or a more stable currency) if they suspect that any significant devaluation is imminent, which could further devalue currency circulating outside of the economy in foreign markets.","1280629408"

It was really frustrating, but I loved the premise so much, I figured I'd get it for Xbox, and lo and behold - no problems.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) is a bitmap image format that was introduced by CompuServe in 1987 and has since come into widespread usage on the World Wide Web due to its wide support and portability.

  The format supports up to 8 bits per pixel thus allowing a single image to reference a palette of up to 256 distinct colors. The colors are chosen from the 24-bit RGB color space. It also supports animations and allows a separate palette of 256 colors for each frame. The color limitation makes the GIF format unsuitable for reproducing color photographs and other images with continuous color, but it is well-suited for simpler images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color.

  GIF images are compressed using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) lossless data compression technique to reduce the file size without degrading the visual quality. This compression technique was patented in 1985. Controversy over the licensing agreement between the patent holder, Unisys, and CompuServe in 1994 spurred the development of the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) standard; since then all the relevant patents have expired.

  CompuServe introduced the GIF format in 1987 to provide a color image format for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier run-length encoding (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used LZW data compression, which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow modems.

  The original version of the GIF format was called 87a. In 1989, CompuServe devised an enhanced version, called 89a, that added support for animation delays (multiple images in a stream were already supported in 87a), transparent background colors, and storage of application-specific metadata. The 89a specification also supports incorporating text labels as text (not embedding them in the graphical data), but as there is little control over display fonts, this feature is not widely used. The two versions can be distinguished by looking at the first six bytes of the file (the ""magic number"" or ""signature""), which, when interpreted as ASCII, read ""GIF87a"" and ""GIF89a"", respectively.

  There are at least two rarely-used methods that can generate a GIF that, if decoded according to the GIF89a standard, will produce an animation that ends with a 24-bit RGB truecolor image.

GIF89a was designed based on the principle of rendering images (known as frames when used for animation) to a logical, fixed-size screen. Each image could optionally have no delay after it is rendered, and could have its own 256-color palette. Also, each image need not fill the entire logical screen, and the animation can cease after the last frame; it need not begin again. The multi-frame, zero-delay, and unique-palette features, optionally combined with transparency, allow for each image to replace only a portion of the previous image's pixel data. When used without looping, a more-than-256-color final result can be achieved.

For example, a GIF can be encoded to render as a series of overlapping full-screen images, each image filling in color that wasn't in the previous one. Transparent pixels can be used to preserve colors from previous images.","1280629490"

a: obsessed with a hatred of all things Apple.
b: trapped in the idea that the iPad should be a fully fledged computer that does everything your laptop does. The iPad is no more a computer than your television set, your radio, your newspaper, your games console, your iPod, the books on your bookshelf, your photo albums... etc.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The very concept of ""IP"" makes the difference.  It's a huge difference.  The whole reason that theft is illegal isn't that someone gets something, it's that another person is deprived of it.

You can see the difference when it comes to squatting laws.  In theory, if someone is squatting on your property, they're depriving you of the use of that property, effectively stealing it from you.  However, under [Adverse Possession](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_possession) rules, if you squat on the land for long enough and the owner doesn't evict you, the title of the land can pass to you.  What this is saying is that if you squat on land for years on end, and the owner of that land isn't deprived of its use enough to bother evicting you, you're not depriving him of anything, so the land can pass to you.

When it comes to copying something digital, there isn't even a hint that anybody is being deprived of the copyrighted item.  The only thing that's happening is that someone's control over the copyrighted item is weakened.  It's in the same category as if you had an exclusive deal to sell Cheerios in some city, and another store started selling them.  Nobody is stealing the Cheerios out of your store, and it would be very difficult to prove that you conclusively lost sales as a result of another person selling them.  All that you lose is potential sales.

You've been morphing your relationship with him from one based on the support you've provided him to a relationship based on your guilt.  The guilt that you feel responsible for not being completely open and honest with him.  From the sounds of it, he was set and ready to do what he felt he needed to do, regardless.  Even if you did tell him how much you cared for him, would you have still been there every day to give him support?  He remained in contact with you until the end.  That makes it perfectly clear that he cared about you, probably the same way that you cared about him.  The problems surrounding his life sound like they were external obstacles.  A victim of circumstances.  

I can understand the loneliness you are feeling nowadays, but it's only temporary.  He is resting more peacefully in the afterlife than he ever has before in this life.  Maybe helping a best friend of yours to understand what you are feeling may provide you the most benefit.  You have grown older and wiser without trying.  You could think of this as though he transferred his life to yours.  You shoulder the weight of both of you now.  The things he did have changed your life forever, and he should be remembered for it.  

That's all you need to do for the time being.  Survive to see the sun rise again, and so long as there are sunrises and sunsets, do not forget him.

I moved them to a different section (template) and something in that section was pulled into the 'contextual' part and made the ads fit perfectly.

I'm sure you'll still have to manually ban some b/s ads but it would be much easier since a lot less would show up.  The generic ads don't make much money anyhow where targeted ads might make you guys a pile of money.

The average teenager to mid twenties adult reads 8 minutes a day and sends over 2700 text messages a month.  That would be the definition of low elaboration thinking. You can't consider the facts behind a decision when you don't bother learning them. The extent of their acquisition of knowledge seems to be watching people hit each other in the nuts with soup cans on Youtube.

We didn't legalize drugs or gay marriage. We did, however, get segregation ended, elected a black president, (Yes, that was us. Young people were outnumbered at the polls by us old farts. 18 to 29 year olds accounted for [only 18% of the vote](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/11/05/exit-polls-young-voters/?fbid=d6b0LeR9nOn).) , passed legislation protecting people in the workplace, made it illegal to deny housing to people based on race or religion, and generally racked up a fairly impressive social agenda. In fact if you look for [civil rights leaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_rights_leaders) you won't find any born after 1960 listed on Wikipedia.

Today's youth, and I include you so please correct me if I'm wrong, tend to discount anyone who doesn't agree with them. The Reddit hive mind is the symptom of a generation that can't think for themselves. They take things they read on the internet at face value without questioning it too much and tend to react in a violent and radical manner when someone disagrees. After the damage is done they scramble to shift blame and in a curiously fascinating way generate another hive mind reaction against what they have just participated in.

The generation gap has existed as long as there have been generations, but those in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. My question to you would be ""What have you accomplished?"" My generation didn't let the older generation stop them. The social changes we engineered have been ongoing since the 1960s. Blaming another generation is a way of saying that you are either too dumb or too lazy to make a difference.

In other words, were God to love something, like us, more than himself he would be committing idolatry, just as we would be if we love something more than God.

&gt; To be honest with you, if the creator of all's sole purpose of our creation is to worship him, while at the same time limiting our sensory capabilities of confirmation/detection, I find that creator concept pretty twisted.

God did not limit our ability to see / detect him.  Romans 1, it is a fairly long passage, lays out how humanity turned from worshiping the creator to worshiping themselves and creation.

*For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. 
 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves, because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen. 
 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error. 
 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done. They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips, slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them. (Romans 1:18-32 ESV)*

God is clearly known to man, which I see as the explanation of the origin of religion, lookup original monotheism.  However, our sin has blinded us to being able to clearly see God in what he has revealed.  When Adam sinned in the garden it broke the fellowship which God and man enjoyed previously.

&gt; We have specific natures (the sin nature) and God created us with a predisposition to actually not worship him. God, ostensibly, has stacked the deck against us. He's provided an arbitrary set of rules with the only rule of real importance is worship. Interesting the arbitrary set of rules run counter to the characteristics we inherited through evolutionary process.

I think this is the heart of your question, but I was wondering if you could expand your thoughts before I try to answer.  I just want to make sure I understand what you are saying, especially the last two sentences.

Thanks.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Ultimately, I forgive her for it. It probably means we shouldn't be together or more directly that she doesn't really want to be together, but I forgive her.

People don't always do the right thing. God knows I don't.  We actually are both incredibly similar and I can empathize with her situation. We are both kinda stunted emotionally (I used to weigh 500 lbs and really didn't start having anything close to real relationships until I was 25-28 years old).  

I really don't feel like her stringing me along is necessarily being a bad friend. I do think it is selfish though. And I do often put myself in the shoes of her fiancee as well. I know I wouldn't want to be in his shoes.

But yeah.. You are right that she hasn't been a good friend to me in that regard.  I feel like I might have done the exact same thing if I were in her shoes.  We have a lot of the same weaknesses and hangups. It is part of why we can talk so well.

I think in the end this is the right choice. I think i've known it for a while. It is very hard to make the choice though because our relationship really gives me nothing but pleasure. I don't sit at home feeling sad pining over her. Monday morning will come and I'll want to joke around with her about something I thought of on the train.

It's hard to walk away from something that never really feels very dramatic or painful, even if you know it is really bad for you. For me at least.","1280629652"

This assertion is baseless. It materialized out of nowhere. Skeptics made it up. It would also be irrelevant even if it were true.

the Bible speaks consistently about being a servant unconditionally. It dictates one should accept the hardships extended to him by the world without seeking his own ends. Kinda like Jesus did. The only valid purpose the Bible even recognizes for seeking one's own ends is in order for his resources to be utilized in servitude to others. That's why you'll see the continuous instructions to sell your things and give the money to the poor, that sort of thing. That's why the disciples of Jesus were sent out with nothing but a staff and told they shouldn't even keep a change of clothes with them as they ministered. A worker is worth his wage.

the world of the flesh is worthless. Whether ""self-defense"" or ""revenge,"" seeking to impose one's own will is acquiescence to the world of the flesh. It is distinctly opposed by the Bible from all angles. The real Christian knows God provides. Not one's own actions in the middle of a heated firefight. Not one's artillery. Just God.

This result would clearly not be enough to close the book on the Lance+Steroids matter, so what good would it really provide?  I feel like the most this type of study can do is reaffirm the preconceived notions people already have about a particular athlete - if I feel confident that Lance took steroids, the result of this study will only affirm my (perhaps unfair) ideas.  

Bottom line is that the results can only point one of two ways - they can point to evidence that suggests someone did something (like Conseco providing steroids to his teammates) or the results can be inconclusive.  They cannot exonerate someone, they can only place blame.  This last fact is why this type of research/analysis has very little use in the professional sporting world.  ","1280629775"

One thing I'll never forget is a documentary about a group of nomadic farmers in Mongolia. These people had no education, were ""poor"" by our standards and lead an incredibly hard life of physical labor and battling the environment. But at the end of the movie, when one farmer was asked if he was happy, he smiled and said he lived a wonderful life.

To me, that really put some things in context, as I've often wondered if the endless pursuit of knowledge overshadows the ability to enjoy the happiness of simplicity.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in the 8th grade (probably age 12 or so) after just having moved to the area, and I ended up falling into a crowd of the trouble makers.

The first time that I went over to one of their houses (just him and I) we ended up getting bored and playing with matches in an old barn (dur hur hur). We accidentally ended up setting a couch on fire, and my friend ran out to get some water, leaving me inside (I don't know why I stayed in, but I did), shutting the door to the barn behind him. The flames moved quicker than I ever thought they could, and within moments I was trapped in a barn (with a second story and low ceiling) as it was burning. The entire back wall with the couch was on fire, and the walls were going. I remember staring at it, in terrified awe.

When I finally snapped out of it (after checking the front door and finding that it was so hot that it had melted shut), I jumped onto a counter and kicked out the window, jumping from what was essentially 2 stories (it was on a hill) and rolling when I hit the ground (thank you OOT).

The barn was almost entirely gone by the time the firefighters showed up. I remember going home, and just sitting on my bed for hours, staring at my hands, and smelling smoke. I came to the realization that I almost died in a fire, and barely did any of the risky stuff that most high schoolers do, for fear of dying. (I only even had my first drink at age 18, as a college freshman). 

For years, I told people it was an electrical fire.

**tl;dr** - I was trapped in a burning barn, kicked out a window, and jumped 2 stories.

Edit: I can't stop shaking now. I haven't thought about this in years.

An agorist approach supports capitalist relations. Agorists have no problem at all with hiring workers as long as it's in the black market. In fact, the Agorist approach, when not hilariously unworkable, is simply scary (think Mafia-like protection agencies).

&gt;How do you see it coming? I don't see them as mutually exclusive and if you have a better way, I'll come.

By all acts that are compatible with Anarchism and therefore destabilize the state. That is, all mutual aid that goes against capitalism and all direct action which goes against the state.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I live in one of the most violent cities in Mexico. This missinformation is not helping anyone, it is a criminal problem, and people are trying to take political advantage of it.

It is not a ""war on drugs"" It is mainly a war between rival cartels. The Sinaloa Cartel used be allied with the Juarez Cartel. Now they have a very violent war. The Beltran-Leyva was part of the Sinaloa Cartel, now they are also in war with them. The Zetas was the armed wing of the Cartel of el Golfo, now they are fighting. The rivalries also created new alliances. Now there are basically two sides: Sinaloa-Gulf-Familia Michoacana vs Juarez-Zetas-Beltran Leyva. Check wikipedia, there is a great deal of information explaining this. 90% of the deaths are civilians involved in the drug business. I can confirm this because, whenever somebody dies, people who knew them say they had reasons to believe the dead person was somehow involved.

There is an increase criminal activities. This has several reasons:

- The cartels have seen a reduction on their income . But they still have VERY high expenses. People usually focus on how much money they make. But they forget that they have to pay a lot of people a lot of money.

- The cartels have created new associations with street gangs. This gangs were only a problem in their neigborhoods but now that they are part of larger gangs have expanded their criminal activities. Furthermore, there is also an association between street gangs and prision gangs. The street gangs have to produce a lot of money for they prision gangs, but they receive shelter if they are ever caught.

- Other common criminals have increased their activities just because people are afraid and the perception that the policie is also afraid and won´t do anything.

The municipal and state police are doing what they can with very limited means. It is very difficult for them to do their jobs, they are risking their lifes and the lifes of their families. The federal police, the army and the marines are a big help too. Most people here are not complaining about them. The problem are the criminals.

Also, It is not true that the war on drugs is financed by the U.S. government. Most of the bill is picked up by the Mexican people. In any case the Cartels became strong and organized with the money from illegal drugs sold in the U.S.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'm not quite certain what that guy's concern was. He said the talk reminded him of logical positivism, to which I suppose he was talking about empirical verification of the truth of cognitive statements. How does this relate to utility functions? Is it more relevant to the problem of general intelligence in which the AI has to dynamically choose multiple mutually-consistent utility functions for solving many concurrent problems for which it is itself, as an actor in the system, an important part of the problems? Was the questioner saying that the AI would not be able to verify its own self-consistency because of something fundamental in the nature of intelligence -- that the AI would resort to merely rationalizing its actions after the fact by adjusting its set of goals, beliefs, and values? (I meant to do that; I never really thought that was a good idea; oh well, it doesn't matter.)

I think it's likely that if we created general AI that it would experience many of the same fundamental weaknesses that we have, stemming from limited knowledge and limited ability to calculate the  dynamics of variables in a chaotic system. However, I would hope we could make a more honest intelligence that's ready to say ""I don't know"" (but I'm doing everything I can to understand the problem) and ""I screwed up"" (and I'm already working to fix it) rather than rationalizing and avoiding responsibility.","1280629994"

"Metal","t5_2qhud","***Warning: long-winded disorganized blog-like post ahead***

I'm going through my metal crisis right now.  I cut all of my hair off a year ago, and have cut it once since then.  It's starting to grow out again, and I'm about to start a new job where I can get away with it long, but I'm considering keeping it (relatively) short.  

I can't wear metal shirts anymore.  I don't have metal friends (the few metal people I've met around here were pretty dull), so it's like there's no point in walking around or buying groceries wearing something that says ""INSULTERS OF JESUS CHRIST"" on the back.  I don't wear vests and all that crap either because it looks really tacky, but I don't mind people who do.  Mostly I dress in a fairly boring, casual, unexciting way, but that's mostly because I simply fail at clothes.

I find metal difficult to listen to lately.  It's hard to stay interested in bands, albums, etc. for long, even ones I think I really love.  I'm sure this is just a phase however, because other than classical, what else am I supposed to listen to?  Nothing ever hit me the way metal did.

I do read and write about metal.  I love buying CD's...  I tried getting into vinyl a while back but it wasn't for me.  Concerts are not really my thing either.  I go to between one and three a year, and maybe truly enjoy one of them.  Mostly I don't feel like I fit into the metal culture, or at least the current metal culture, probably because I'm just fucking weird in person (I'm an aspie, for sure).

I would say metal philosophy is definitely a part of myself (and yes, this philosophy is inherent to metal).  I'm not even going to claim to be some elite uber-person who lives and breathes metal, but I completely relate to all of the aggression, weirdness, and the frustrated antisocial attitude that it has, as well as the Romantic story-telling, the complex-but-still-popular songwriting, and all of it from Judas Priest to Nuclear Death.

I should clarify that despite some of what I said above metal is not a guilty pleasure for me, I think it's just right.  I love metal and I don't ever want to lose the ""inner teenager"" part of me that discovered metal in the first place, but I think the only way to truly love art is to here and there feel a need to seriously question it, because that's the only way for it to someday move ahead.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I hope I'm not missing the joke, but that's a circular argument.

The problem of induction is that past observations (like in a controlled scientific experiment) have no logical relationship to future events. If you observe 100 pencils falling after being released in midair, you don't have a logical warrant to assume that the 101st pencil you release in the air will also drop. Instead, you assume that this will happen because you believe in the central tenant of induction which is that past events predict future events. However, there is no logical reason to believe that past events in fact do predict future events. The fact that past events have, in the past, predicted future events does not provide any reason to believe in induction unless you posit, circularly, that past events predict future events.

So you're stuck. It may be rational to conclude things from observation evidence, but doing so requires an unsupportable belief in the validity of inductive reasoning.","1280630032"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Fat people are not inherently unhealthy.  If they were, then all skinny people would be healthy.  Anorexics and bulimics are horribly unhealthy.  You can be a thin couch potato and be a strong candidate for a heart attack.

The amount of fat you carry, in an of itself, is no indicator of health.  For instance, fat on newborns is an indicator of health.  There are also times when you want excess body fat in order to survive, such as you get older and are struck with more serious illness.  One of the first signs of serious disease is when your body starts losing weight.

The one single biggest predictor of ""health"" is your fitness level.  Do you think that NFL players are unhealthy?  How about the NBA?  They are by medical terms either overweight of even obese.  You wouldn't think of them as unhealthy because they are athletes.

Obesity is a complex issue and is dependent on many variables, such as hormones, the medication you take, genetics, in addition to lifestyle choices.  There are many different body types, just as there are hair, eye and skin color.  To say that a larger body type is more unhealthy than a smaller one is to discount so many other variables.  

What you really want is an external indicator of health.  There isn't one.  Even the guy at the gym with the bulging muscles may be harboring diabetes or cancer.  Just because he carries less of a certain tissue on his body, doesn't mean he's more virtuous.","1280630124"

The real issue is what to do with the millions of unemployed people. We could leave them to the market laissez faire style and possibly watch them starve (if the business tax breaks don't work). Or we could give them enough money to feed and house themselves while they try to look for more work.

We got along so well it blew me away and whenever we were around each other there was this intense connection that to this day (years later) I have not felt with anyone else. 

There was a lot holding us apart. Aside from living at a school where there wasn't much alone time with the opposite sex, we both were in long time on and off relationship situations. We liked each other so much but were afraid to leave the people we had been with for so long even though it wasn't really working.

It got to the point where I knew what I wanted and I took the risk of breaking it off with my boyfriend at the time. I didn't do this expecting him to do the same, I did it just to show him how much I cared and how badly I wanted to be with him. A day or two later he began to seem distant and I knew who he had chosen. :[

"reddit.com","t5_6","Frankly, I'm not going to watch a 40 minute video.  But, since you have, perhaps you can answer how it is that BP a company with a staff of lawyers that could probably populate a small city, and a rich one at that, still managed to create 10s of billions of dollars of liability for themselves with their unbelievable wanton and long term recklessness in the gulf that led to the Oil Spill.  All the information and knowledge was available to the company to know that the lack of a 500K acoustic blow out preventer, not to mention their myriad of other blatant dangerous acts, could cause a catastrophe (or should I say would eventually inevitably cause a catastrophe) and they would be liable for the clean up, the lost oil, and citizen law suits and yet they did it anyway.

The point I'm driving at here is that corporations, like people, do incredibly stupid and reckless things all the time for short term profit or just bad culture even when it's against the actual corporate interest.  So, it seems they need to be watched , i.e. regulated, before they create catastrophes and that would seem to need gov't.

Also, it seems that we can see how companies would pass laws by the ones that they bribe to the gov't to allow them to write now.  We can see how the Oil and other related industries have, with horrifying efficiency, stopped any effort to handle global warming in its tracks.","1280630153"

You don't know me. But I found your ignorant self on Reddit. http://i.imgur.com/3IxrK.png this is where I found you. You should be ashamed of yourself. People like you just make us ALL look bad. Look at that picture. Firstly, if it has been photoshopped in any way to make you look stupid; I apologize for the hell I am raining on you. But for now, I'm assuming that its not. The spelling mistakes. If you are going to disparage a whole people because of some rumor you've heard about what they're building on ground zero, PLEASE at least spell in a coherent fashion! Listen up, Jan. I have a truckload of learning with your name on it. Here's how you spelled these words and how they are correctly spelled:
ill-legal should be illegal
""all those who come here legal"" should be ""all those who come here legally""
""but if your"" should be ""but if you're""
loose should be lose
out should be our
muslin should be Muslim (also, it's a proper noun. Capitalize it.)
mausk should be mosque

Even those that aren't inbred? I didn't even get into the grammar of your little hate message. And I won't because I don't have all night.

One tip I have is that I usually try and find an extremely simplified version of what I am trying to learn, before delving into textbook type literature. Like going on to youtube and searching for videos on the subject, or reading forums on the subject, or going to sites like Khan Academy (awesome website btw). It is easier to grasp the technical, once you have a basic understanding.

As for learning french, maybe find someone who speaks fluent french, and try to converse with them.

Sometimes though, and this isn't probably what you are looking for, but I have taken a hit or 2 of some pot, and all of a sudden everything gets interesting, and I can plow through a textbook in no time. Some people will say ""doesn't it mess with your memory"", well yeah it does, if you get stoned. 

One to 2 hits just gives me a low buzz, helps be concentrate, and makes monotonous and tiring subjects, interesting again!

I saw about 400 people, including children, burned to death.

It was during anti- ethnic Chinese riots in Indonesia. There were Malays rioting and burning Chinese owned houses and stores all around our neighborhood.

There was a fairly big shopping mall nearby our house that was looted. During the looting, some fuckers set the building on fire, trapping everyone who was looting inside. The building burned for hours, during which time we could see and hear screams of women and children being burned alive. Most, if not all, of them were looters. Nobody could do anything, the police and firefighters were sent to protect the business district, leaving residential areas wide open for the rioters. There were almost 400 people burned in that building according to the news. Total deaths is in the thousands, including some reports of Chinese girls gang raped and killed.

shitty support. every bug I found was considered ""low priority"". I might think it's important, but maybe they didn't. It might be a way for Canonical to encourage us to pay-for-support (which is one of their alternatives), but thats like what Microsoft used to do and frankly that's against the morals of FOSS.


not having to see the CLI in any way keeps you from learning the ins and outs of linux and keeps us incompetent and at the distros mercy.



To be honest, I'm boycotting all ubuntu based distros. Anyone else I recommend linux to is going to hear about Fedora, Mandriva, and OpenSUSE. Frankly, these guys are dying on the vine because of Ubuntu's prevalence, and isn't it funny how the Failware makers always seem to win?

People there are glad to help out.

And now to answer your questions in order:

* The [Basic English word list](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Basic_English_word_list) is a good place to start. It's rather lacking in verbs though, so for those, you'll need to go [here.]http://www.acme2k.co.uk/Acme/3star%20verbs.htm

* Do you mean in natlangs or conlangs?

* It's entirely up to you. Some people find one way better, others another. I usually create basic grammar, then basic vocabulary. Then I translate things, making up new words and grammar rules as I need them / feel like.

* Again, up to you. Some people will translate things right away, to get off the ground. Others don't consider their languages ""ready"" for a long time. Languages aren't mature until you say they are.

* Read [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_universal) and [this](http://angli02.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Korean/Artikel02/) and [this](http://typo.uni-konstanz.de/archive/intro/). There's debate about how truly universal universals are, but if you stick to these rules, you'll do fine.

* I kind of answered this before, but I only start out with a basic framework. I'm sure there are those who set it out from the start.

Remember, though, that your language is never ""finished"". Like any work of art, there will always be one more thing you can add, or remove, or tweak, or test out, or whatever. Real languages evolve, and if you like, you can evolve your conlangs.

If you have any questions, PM me, or even better, come into the IRC channel.

* In line for drinks/snacks
* Playing pool or darts
* Leaving

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well let's get specific. By racist here, you mean specifically bigoted hateful racism, barebones racism is simply the belief that the construct of race is a substantive category with which to distinguish individuals. In so far as a simple racist does not actually go out of their way to offend others and discriminate against them, they've done nothing which warrants dismissing them out of hand, though they could stand to be enlightened as to how stereotyping is a poor means of assessing people's characters and that race is a fairly meaningless descriptor. 

 Indeed, bigoted, hateful religion entails that the individuals are being discriminatory and harmful to you, and you have every right to avoid such people, but not all religion is bigoted and hateful. By virtue of the fact that someone has a false or irrational belief, one shouldn't be roundly dismissed. I don't disown someone just because they're less intelligent or educated than I, nor because they are slightly irrational, because those things are not necessarily harmful to me on an individual basis and do not necessarily impact my relationships with those people. You can have religious friends whom you simply do not discuss religion with, if your positions are intractable. If in fact they are not intractable, then you *should* have discussions about religion so that through mutual enlightenment and elucidation we can all come closer to an understanding of truth.

Let me put it to you this way, if you could befriend FDR, JFK, Abraham Lincoln, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Renee Descartes, Geoffrey Chaucer, Thomas Aquinas, George Berkeley or John Milton, great minds undoubtedly, would you forgo the opportunity simply because they were avowed Christians? Especially if they had extended their hands in friendship to you despite their awareness of your avowed atheism? It's just not particularly helpful to you. It's myopic and egocentric to cut yourself off from others with different world views. It's just as pathetic for you to close yourself off from Christians as it is for Christians to close themselves off from you.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;1)...If you value the perception of reality then you would have to accept sentient life as part of that reality. If you choose to change reality by taking a sentient life- you are rejecting reality- because you have chosen to destroy the perception of reality.

I do not see how ""A is a part of B"" equates to ""destruction of A is destruction of B"".  I could see that correlation only if the premise was ""A equals B"", rather than ""is a part of B"".  

Destruction of sentient life does not destroy objective reality, because as you mention, sentience exists *within* reality; reality is greater than the sentience that dwells within it.  If you were to claim that destruction of sentient life destroys that being's subjective reality, then I might have to surrender the point - the reality held by the consciousness exists within the consciousness, and thus destroying the consciousness would destroy that reality.  However, if this were the case, your statement would be internally inconsistent with regards to the objective nature of reality.  

2) This is first dependent on item one, which I don't yet accept given the above.  Secondly, you have so many assumptions here, it makes the statements impossible to accept or reject on their own.  You are assuming an objective reality, you are begging the question of the rationality of killing, you are assuming a universal morality regarding the destruction of sentience, you are assuming incompatibility of emotion and rationality, and you are assuming that my existence is founded on upholding sentience.  None of those things can be assumed without their own justification, and with one exception, I don't think those things are inherently true.  

3) By making a distinction between killing and murder via its possible justification, you are requiring for a subjective value assessment in order for the action to then classified as justified or not.  You are bordering on circular reasoning here (murder is not justifiable as it is killing that isn't justifiable, killing is justifiable as it is killing that is justifiable)  

4) These statements belie a great amount of assumption regarding the superiority and universality of your own cultural values.  Your stance that a society that holds different values regarding killing than yours is not society would make a majority of the world today non-society, and the vast majority of human history (both pre- and modern)non-society as well.

Other than using appeals to modernity or popularity to justify your stance on the issue, how can you back your value assessment of a society's need to condemn ""unjustifiable killing"" and how might you objectively define such a thing?","1280630276"

First off, you sounded way too desperate and way too forward with the ""there's nothing I wouldn't give"" line.

Secondly, Comfort her. Be there. Be genuine about it though. Don't smother her either. Just let her know that you're there if she needs you to talk to. Please, for the love of everything good, ACTUALLY TRY TO COMFORT HER. She is a human being who feels like absolute shit right now and she needs someone to be there for her. She doesn't need some guy trying to weasel his way in while pretending to care and wearing his heart on his sleeve.

Ask her to hang out with you AND FRIENDS. Getting her out of the house to do stuff will make her feel way better and it won't make her feel like you're just trying to make a move.

You're going to have to count on her to make the first move or at least signal that shes into you and ready to move past her previous relationship.  ""But what if she doesn't?!"" Well then she really wasn't looking for something with you.

There is no such thing as some magical force that will put you in the friendzone for being there for her. If she likes you then she likes you. 

Your attitude should be about being there for her as a friend and a fellow human being. Anything that comes from that is just a bonus. If you set out on a mission to make her your girlfriend this will end horribly. And even if you actually believe that whole thing about the friendzone, you would take the chance of being put in there if thats what it takes to make her feel better.

They're involuntarily moving around, so they'll just randomly wail on you, and restricting them might actually cause them to hurt themselves (like pull a muscle, break a bone while being restricted). 

The seizures can range from quivers, to full out smacking and twisting. By putting yourself into it, you're just adding another object to get smacked. 
 
the only type of physical interaction you should do is cushioning their head with something.

If the seizure is  light enough (looks like you won't get hurt and you won't be a danger to them), try to roll them gently into the [recovery position](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recovery_position) avoid asphyxiation

Secondly, I try to be pleasant most of the time, and that means not making things awkward by talking about religion, politics, money, or anything else where people hold irrational beliefs.

As such, there really is no inherent quality to any action. Instead, the goals and ulterior motives define its value, and even then those goals and ulterior motives are designed for a purpose, which can be traced back and measured.

You should look at [Less Wrong](http://lesswrong.com), as there was a very good analogy for this in a story there.

It's live and let live, in my opinion.

The more you ""blaspheme"" a faith, the more hateful and righteous that faith will become (i.e., defense).

"StarcraftFeedback","t5_2rxes","Overall, you played a very solid game.  There were a lot of aspects of the map that you failed to manipulate/take advantage of where you could have, but your opponent also neglected those areas.  For example, you spent too much on Medivacs when you should have had a few more Vikings, because of the importance of air on Scrap Station.

Your build was much too marauder heavy (but it did work out for you), and some marines would have been a nice addition.  Just as a general rule, you should never go with a completely marauder army unless your opponent is going like 100% roaches or something that marauders directly counter.  And again, you'll absolutely need marines in your army against higher level players (when playing on Scrap Station) because a lot of players will have some sort of air presence.

Another factory for tanks would have been an enormous help to your contain.

Your contain was mostly well done, but you could have exploited that second entrance to the natural to do some economic harassment.

You took the gold too early.  You should have waited until you established map control, so you'd be guaranteed to hold it.

But really, that was a very good game on your part.  Your contain, although inefficient, did work out.  Your army composition needs work, and your game sense could be a little better, but you did a fair job.  I wouldn't be surprised if you hit Platinum pretty quickly.

 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f21QwdI2ElA&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=58D9A6E12F0BDDBA&amp;index=4 
before and after runs. 
I also did a lot similar to calf raise position, but instead of letting your heels down over a ledge you brace both (or one at a time) of the balls of your feet on a wall high enough to form a small triangle with your foot, the wall and the floor. Then lean in towards the wall, making sure the stretch is focused on the achille's. Do a couple sets of 15 or so with your legs straight. Then do the same thing, but with the knee of the leg that you are stretching bent almost touching the wall. This stretches both of the two muscles that make up your calf, which combined will stretch your tendon thoroughly.

On another note, Smckenzie23 is correct that some people can do fine with little to no stretching. And there will always be studies supporting both stretching and non-stretching, before vs. after workouts, etc. With injuries it is generally accepted that stretching is good, and there are many variables that affect how/what you stretch. I inherited a pair of achille's tendons from my father's side of the family, which has traditionally had weak tendons so I have to take special attention to make sure they are loose.","1280630505"

Evolutionarily, cooperative groups do better than competitive groups.  All the ""golden rule"" ""manners"" ""karma"" stuff you care to mention, in any culture you care to list, basically comes down to the fact that cooperative behavior works through subconscious reinforcement.  ""Karma"" follows this perfectly:  If there is an outlier in a community that believes that good deeds are cosmically rewarded and bad deeds are cosmically punished, the members of that society will align themselves with the cosmos and appropriately react to the outlier *even if they don't know they're doing it.*

Either evolution happened *without* God,

or God created everything and *deliberately made it look like evolution happened.*

The first two options both entail ""the theory of evolution is definitely correct,"" therefore Dawkins is saying that any creationist who acknowledges the facts is forced into the third position, which is an uncomfortable one. It's not impossible, God might legitimately want to hide his own existence, but it's an uncomfortable position for a creationist to take.

&gt;evolution doesn't pose a problem for creationism.

No. Evolution doesn't pose a problem for *theism*. Or even the notion that God is responsible for the creation and existence of the universe.

I am actually studying for the October LSAT and have been since May.  I think the best materials, if you are not taking a class, are the Powerscore Bibles (all 3).  If you are taking a class, Testmasters or Blueprint are the best.  I took Testmasters twice in the past couple years, and it was really good.

Study as far in advance as is possible...  I hope you started studying already!  Make sure to take lots of timed practice tests.  If you use the bibles, hopefully those would be finished up soon-ish...


I just got to this posting by chance, by wondering (a.k.a. distracting myself from studying...) if there were any other people on reddit that were studying for the October LSAT.  And if there were, what if there was a LSAT subreddit, where people could post and answer each others' questions?  Just a thought...


Maybe it isn't necessary, with there being [top-law-schools.com](http://www.top-law-schools.com), which has a lot of good info on studying strategies.  Maybe you've already found this site though.

Here is a fair summary of my position.

&gt;They accuse ""pirates"" of ""stealing""; when you point out that copying is not theft because the originator still has his copy, then they switch to some other argument, such as claims that the value of the original copy is diminished; when you point out that there are no property rights in value, but only in the physical integrity of property, they switch to arguments about incentives, even though they usually condemn utilitarian arguments. If you explain that every creator's work also built on the thought of others, they come up with a convenient public domain or ""fair use"" exception. When you point out obviously outrageous injustices of the current IP system, they say they are not in favor of the current IP system … yet they oppose the call to abolish it! And when you ask them what type of IP system they do favor, they have no answer, punting it to judges or Randian legislators to figure out, on the grounds that they are not patent lawyers or specialists!

*""Detractors have accused Death in June of engaging in dog-whistle politics, crypto-fascism, and harboring neo-Nazi  sympathies. Pearce said, ""At the start of the eighties, Tony and I were involved in radical left politics and beneath it history students. In search of a political view for the future we came across National Bolshevism which is closely connected with the Sturmabteilung hierarchy. People like Gregor Strasser and Ernst Röhm who were later known as 'second revolutionaries' attracted our attention."" The Sturmabteilung (Stormtroopers) were a paramilitary unit of the Nazi Party (NSDAP), and Strasser and Röhm were Nazi leaders who vyed for Adolf Hitler's power.*
 
*Protests have been staged and some performances have been cancelled due to these accusations. Justification for the cancellations stem from strong aversions to the symbolism of Death in June coupled with an interpretation of select lyrics as containing deliberate Third Reich-era imagery and tropes. When questioned about his interest in the Third Reich, Pearce responded:""I've an interest in all aspects of the Third Reich. It has had such a huge influence on the world, who could fail to be intrigued by it? However, I've still read more pages of Das Kapital than Mein Kampf!""*
 
*Pearce, who is openly homosexual, has collaborated with various ethnic Jews throughout his music career. The official Death in June website site featured the flag of Israel, and Death in June played a concert in Israel on June 18, 2004 for a predominantly Jewish audience.""*","1280630579"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was a nursing student I had a patient with a bad case of necrotizing fasciitis, aka flesh eating bacteria. This woman had (originally) weighed close to 400 pounds and the infection had eaten about 45 pounds of flesh from her hips and groin, all the way to the muscle and beyond. You could see the muscles contract as she moved.

She was on some heavy antibiotics, which made her stool loose and tarry. It was my job to help her clean up after she had a bowel movement, which involved me sticking my face *past* the boundary of what would have been her skin, had it still been there. With my face in this woman's enormous, gaping, rotting flesh wound, I had to do my best to clean the shit from her ass and the open flesh around it. After that was packing the wound with fresh gauze.

Another instance was with a corpse at work. After someone dies, we give them a final bed bath before we hand them over to the mortician. This man had died from an obstructed bowel. His stomach was severely distended. I would soon find out what was causing the distention. We cleaned up his front, then rolled him on his side to do his back. When we did this, he let out an otherworldly groan. ""EEEEAAAAUUUGGHHH!"" is what it sounded like. Following the noise was the contents of his bowels, out of his nose and mouth.

* Adults with no/very little support (aside from government provided services)
* Illiterate (at least in English) or barely literate
* Untrained in any skill that will provide them a decent living
* Unable to move up the socio-economic ladder 
* Send money back to Mexico (which is Mexico's 2nd largest GDP source)

&gt;You asked how are they similar and I ask how they are different. What is the difference between a thousand uneducated people coming over the border each day and 10,000 people being born to the uneducated every day? They will likely grow up to exist in the same socioeconomic background as their parents, so if we fear more poor uneducated unskilled people entering into our country, then we should fear the poor breeding.

Yes, the poor breeding is already a problem in this country. However, it is not a huge problem; tens of millions more of them is not beneficial to our country.","1280630608"

Ultimately, my conclusion was and still is that there is no excuse for not implementing a cheaper, more free, less bureaucratic, and health-driven system unless you are opposed to those things.

She said 'no', and when someone else assaulted her (uncovering her breasts), she promptly covered herself. GGW created the situation which resulted in the assault, and then used a transparent excuse to weasel out of culpability, and then, *profited off of it without her express consent*.

 I can't imagine that the law genuinely provides such an excuse for this; it would be as if I posted a sign on my property saying that entering my property is consent to any and all recordings I might make, and also, is consent to me having sex with you at any time, and then using that as an excuse to sexually assault the mail carrier, film it, and sell the video online.

4) Good question.  Short answer is that I don't know.  A potential guess is that most of the time God chooses to use the existing laws and patterns of the natural world to accomplish the continuance and sustenance of creation.  I see no reason why this would not be the case with the evolutionary process.  But I am nervous speculating about God's reasons when He has not specifically revealed it in the Bible.

&gt; By the way, why is evidence subjective, but not moral?

Good question.  I would say that morality is rooted in God's character which is objective and unchanging, yet I see no reason why our standards for evidence are rooted in anything.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","6'4""? That's large, regardless of BMI, mass, etc.

Consider the following:

1. At your size, you need alot of calories JUST to maintain your body. This includes but isn't limited to repairing your body, maintaining your organs, digestion and recovering from illness. NOW, we add in that you probably have a fast metabolism regardless of actual muscle mass and we're already at a deficit. Finally, your is to GAIN muscle and you should be hitting no LESS than 3k calories and I'd argue around 4k to GAIN. Even if you go over that a little an add some fat, more than 3/4 of each 1lb for your BEGINNER gains will be muscle.

Get: 1lb of protein per 1lb of body weight. Add carbs in AROUND your workouts and during. Mix a concoction of Gatorade + bcaas + glutamine. Someone in your position should NOT be in a calorie deficit and intense lifting gets there pretty quick if you aren't eating BIG. Each PROTEIN meal should be a min. of 50g of protein, easily. 4-5 meals. Carbs should be SIMPLE when its during and after w/o. Before, get slow carbs, but make sure you're digested by then. No one likes to work on a stomach that is partially 'full' feeling. 

Tons of water, all day. Muscles are 70% water.

If budget is an issue, then consider liquid egg whites from www.eggwhitesinternational.com. I personally use them and they're great. Cheapest easiest way to the best source of protein. Tuna. Chicken. I can 7 chicken breasts or more @ trader joe's for like $6. that's $1/breast and accounts for almost 30-50g of protein. CHEAPER than any subway sub, fast food joint or protein bar and MUCH better. 

*FACT: Eating WELL and HEALTHY is cheaper on a per unit/per meal COST. Trust me. A protein bar is not good for you. Most are loaded with sugar and other unnatural, probably indigestable compounds.*

Forget the creatine. That's only worthwhile if you are already doing well with your diet. 

Essential supps: (IMO)
- Multi Vitamin
- BCAA
- Powdered gatorade for during/after w/o
- Some form of whey that is all encompassing (has all of the whey kinds, fast and slow)
- Probiotic pill
- A super green food like GREENs+, this gets in your veggie/fruit nutrients without having to consume that many per day [I find it hard to get that many servings of veggie nutrients, esp if you're trying to GAIN weight, they'll fill you up.]
- Calcium supplement (they are practially a requirement, unless you get excess calcium from the GOMAD routine).

All the other supps like NO and Creatine are to be left to those with big budgets, those on the brink of perfection needing a 'boost' and for those who've been around. A lay person will get by just find overeating, getting loads of protein and working out HEAVY and HARD. No cardio - AT ALL - until you gain and see gains. If you want/need to cardio, then ADD back in the calories you burn, because you are robbing your body/muscles of those calories.

"funny","t5_2qh33","'inthekitchen' jokes have been intertwined with comment threads since their birth? Seriously? Since 1980 when usenet first started? And either way, your logic fails. Slavery has been a part of civilization since its inception but I don't see very many people advocating for that. Just because something is intertwined/tradition doesn't make it right. 

And it doesn't matter what group you pick for this joke? Would it make sense if you said ""That's because white people can't read.""? It wouldn't. It only makes sense because there's a pre-existing stereotype of women being dumb. ""Don't give women the vote, they're not capable of making sound decisions. Men are ruled by logic, women are ruled by emotion. A woman doctor? That'd never happen."" etc... By telling these jokes you're keeping this bullshit alive.

The filibuster and the Senate don't protect the rights of minorities any more than a monarch, though. They allow the minority to exact control over the majority, which is very different from protecting the rights of the majority.

&gt;Bringing up presidential elections does not make sense, as they do not get filibustered and as such is not germane to the conversation at hand.

So the mail-lady started seeing the dog on the porch and began giving my dog a treat everytime she delivered the mail. Eventually it turned into a Pavlov deal where everytime the mail was delivered my dog would run out to get a treat. One day the postwomen was sick and her husband delivered. When I walked outside to get the mail I saw my dog being dragged underneath a mailtruck for about 10 feet. My dog then got up limped over to me and layed down at my feet. The mailman didn't even ask if the dog was okay he just shrugged and kept driving. I had to pick my dog up and put him in the back of my car where I noticed my whole shirt was covered in blood and feces and fur with skin still attached to it. My dog died the next day at the vet.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Right.  Not with a penis, because we don't have them.  But women will get engorged with blood when seeing sex or highly sexual imagery.  The sparse research on this subject has shown that women in fact respond physically (i.e. clit becomes erect, vagina moistens) to a **wider variety of sexual imagery than males**.  So, in that sense, you are also correct.
The conflating factor is that many women get psychologically turned off by the fear or shame they associate with watching porn, or never seek it out for the same reason.

And for those women who are not sexually repressed or inhibited by shame, the other factor is that porn is usually made for a male audience, and isn't appealing to women, so it's a self-reinforcing stereotype.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Much agreement.  I am a male that has a difficult time crying.  I'm glad I don't cry much because otherwise I would be embarrassed.  However when I do cry I find it very enjoyable.  Especially since when you cry it means something very unenjoyable is going on.  I love to find a really good tear jerker.  I haven't cried in years outside of movies, tv and books.  I used to love ER just because on occasion it could make me cry.

In regards to suicide. I don't think this has anything to do with crying.  Most suicide can be prevented if the suicidal finds some way to connect to people and society.  For instance suicide in the US plummeted to near zero in the wake of 9/11 because everyone came together and reached out to each other. Same thing with Kennedy's assassination. 

So maybe the reason men commit more suicide is this.  Most women are taught more heavily to rely on others and seek connection between others.  Men on the other hand are taught to be self reliant and not to bother others with their problems.  

Also an intersting statistic is that women attempt suicide more frequently than men but men succeed in suicide more often.  Those attempts are however sometimes considered para-suicides meaning they didn't really try to kill themselves they just wanted to get attention to their problems.","1280630790"

The rules themselves are not easy for man to follow because God wills man to not follow them.  God has, ostensibly, stacked the deck against man, with the consequence of failure being an eternity of torment and suffering.

Let's put this into context.  The universe is billions of years old.  A lifetime is roughly 70-90 years now and was shorter later.  People will spend an eternity (billions of years times forever) suffering and tormented.  All of this because the person did not serve the divine ego-serving function of worship.

He was leading the hose with 3 guys behind him and they called the guys out and to notify them, they tugged on the hose from outside, well it ripped the hose out of his hands and when he turned around, everything was smoke.

He saw light, tried to get out but there were burglar bars.  He slammed and slammed into that window trying to get out and actually dislocated his shoulder.

He crawled behind a sofa, while the house is still in flames and smoke, and fell down in a 'turtle' position.  He tried to radio for help but when he grabbed his mic, it was so hot he let go then watched it melt on the ground under him.

Luckily a fireman found him and dragged him out but by this time his fire coat and clothes were completely burned on the back end.  He casually stripped off his clothes himself then proceeded to *walk* to the ambulance.  He had horrific burns and scarring.  He spent better part of a year going through therapy.

Though they are smart, they keep it trimmed by not allowing everyone to bot.

Religious beliefs are pretty arbitrary, so people can decide that atheists all get pies with Jesus or... you know, whatever they're willing to believe. Plenty of Christians have abandoned hell altogether.

I understand your general position though, it's like the creepy middle grounds they try to create like ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" in reference to homosexuality and then expect people to say ""aww, that kind Christian is willing to get along with me despite their irrational contempt for my choice in sexual partners."" ""I don't try to force my views on my atheist friends, that's so uncool, everyone can believe what they want and in judgment they will face the full just wrath of god and spend an eternity writhing in flames."" It's hard to imagine people being able to get away with this with no reaction were the cover of religion not there.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; If it's bothering you, I'll stop.

It's not bothering me.  It just marks you as someone not used to using Reddit.

Let me give you another Reddit pointer.  As someone coming from other forums, you are probably used to flat-file commenting, in which thread readers must read through *every* comment in a thread.

In Reddit, however, the comments are sorted by votes, and nested within their parent comments.

So our entire conversation has been enveloped as a series of [replies to inabook, here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvtkl/user_feedback_whats_your_opinion_on_the/c0vnu88)

The result is that few, if any, people will see our 
conversation.  If you'll [start back here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/cvtkl/user_feedback_whats_your_opinion_on_the/) you'll 
see the comments the way most readers of Reddit 
will see them.

And although it has been interesting speaking with you, most writers at Reddit, myself included, are at least partially aiming their points at an unseen audience.

When a conversation gets nested overly deep, or starts off as a reply to downvoted comments, few people will ever see it, thus cancelling the motivation of writing for an audience.

This also causes people to be less willing to 
comment within topics that are less popular.

Anyway, welcome to Reddit.  I hope you find what you're looking for.","1280631011"

Your quote was ""absence of proof of consent?"" This suggests a construct where, unless there is proof that consent was given, the sex act is presumed to be rape.

My construct was if the lack of consent was proven. So in a neutral situation with no proof of anything, I would interpret a ""absence of proof of consent"" standard with guilt, but an ""proven absence of consent"" as innocence.

I'm not sure how to explain that better.

&gt; If a couple willingly have sex, but never verbally agree to do so, that is an example of absence of verbal consent.

So in this example, if we had a video/audio record, then the guy would be eligible for rape charges. Why is this? Because a common response to rape is to do nothing. To lie there and retreat within oneself, trying to hold yourself together and not saying or doing a thing. While there is no ""non-consent,"" fucking someone who is lying still still counts as rape in my book.

The way for the guy to definitely avoid charges is to get a verbal yes from her.

So the issue here is that I (and I think the law) hold that rape can happen in situations where there is a simple absence of consent, but that that standard opens the door to lots of bad prosecutions for very normal situations where no one is talking.","1280631045"

If there isn't room then, of course, you have to eat a spoonful or two of what you've blended so far to make room.  By all means DON'T add sugar or any sweetener.

I don't even think they knew it was a rave when they got there, and the other staff that stayed with me were too shaky to leave any sort of meaningful statement (plus the guy who did it was right there). 

I never saw her again, though it's hard to remember faces and we always had a lot of people at gigs. The incident was used to push through an organisational ban on outside containers, and with that we began jacking up the price of water to meet new demand :P

I had a girl that was over 18 tell me about how her clit piercing feels awesome when she fingers herself, and how she lost her virginity to a guy with his dick pierced. She also explained that she gives amazing strip-teases and head. It was no doubt rough to just walk away from that.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","To use any Android device on Rogers network, you should first go buy a very expensive, top-of-the-line laptop. You know... 4GB RAM, solid-state hdd, graphics card, hires screen, whatever, you get the point. Be sure to get it on lease so you lock in a 3yr term... then install Windows 95 on it immediately.

There you go... Enjoy. For grins, call customer service of your new laptop manufacturer and ask, ""What is you-tube? I want internets! Tab... yes, I'll take one.""

Rogers really is enjoying their monopoly up here in the North. My friend in TO bought a Nexus One and is on Wind Mobile... if Wind can gain some traction, Rogers will have to change their asshat technical policies.

Anyway... to answer your question, I have a Magic. Pretty mediocre phone. Whenever I'm out with my wife, I just use her IPhone to do anything useful. Most I use my phone for is to refresh Reddit and Gmail while waiting in line somewhere. Magic has been rooted, but you need some extra steps using a ""Gold"" sd card to crack it. (If I can stop browsing reddits, I'll actually get my phone rooted.)

I was affected by that boondoggle block on data that Rogers foisted on to their Android customers in February. My wife and I were traveling in Montreal at the time. Really annoying to have bought a smartphone in December to use for that specific trip only to have it hobbled when I needed it the most. Again... IPhone was way more useful. I was using HTC Dream at the time. Rogers did offer a free upgrade to Magic. I'll admit, that was decent of them.

Rogers continued even after I received my Magic. My voice calls started being redirected to customer service! Outrageous! I'm making a call that should have been 30 seconds, instead I'm connected to an agent in India and have to explain repeatedly that I have upgraded my phone and to restore my data/voice plan as contracted. Crazy! I was a new customer, too! Complete garbage...

tldr... by any phone from rogers with as much ram/memory. Root it immediately. Never talk to Rogers for anything. Better yet, go to Wind Mobile, if they have coverage in your area.","1280631097"

But the stars were not in the right alignment for me. I was worried because I have Sun Conjunct Uranus, so unpredictable bullshit is supposedly likely. But I don't believe in that shit, until it happens. And it did happen. I am stuck behind a car full of out-of-towners driving 20 in a 35mph zone, they're afraid to pass a campus security guard car. I finally get around them and I blast up to 35mph (the speed limit) and take a quick right turn, go one block, and park in my favorite spot. I'm about 25 feet away from my car when the I hear a bullhorn shouting ""could you come here please?"" I turn around and there's a campus cop car parked behind me. 

Now here's where I should have kept walking, and the campus cop would have had no legal authority to chase me down. These guys are just glorified security guards for the local college, and not real police. If they wanted to arrest me, legally, they'd have to do a citizen's arrest and hold me until real cops arrived. So these guys have a real inferiority complex, and they just recently won the right to carry pistols, so this could be a very unpredictable situation. It is probably best not to fuck with a security guard with an inferiority complex and a gun. And I notice another campus cop car with markings ""K-9"" has stopped a half block away, and the security guard is getting a big German Shephard out of the car. So I stop. This is where The Game gets real. I am going to have to keep complete control of the frame here. I know I have a $110 speeding ticket (going 35 in a 25mph zone) that might have gone to warrant already, so I could end up in handcuffs and taken to jail. And I pretty sure my car insurance is up to date, but I know I don't have the right papers in my car, because the cops let me off with a warning for not having proof of insurance when I got my speeding ticket. I am in deep shit. I don't even realize I'm about to get into deeper shit.

Me: [I come up to his open car window, lean over it, and put my hand on the roof. This is definitely alpha body language.] What's the problem?

Cop: What was the deal back there? You were going pretty fast!

Me: Oh that. Well I got stuck behind a car full of tourists weaving around and going under the speed limit. When I got around, I accelerated up to the speed limit to get them behind me. My Driver's Ed teacher always said, the best way to deal with a traffic hazard is to put it in your rear view mirror.

Cop: Ha ha. [He smiles.] But why are your license tags expired?

Me: Oh shit, really? Let me go look. [I go over and look, then come back and resume my alpha position, hovering over his window] Oh hell, you're right. I didn't get any renewal notice in the mail. They only expired in May, don't I have a grace period?

Cop: Your grace period is over.

Me: But this is a fix-it ticket.

Cop: What's that?

Me: If I get my tags renewed immediately, a Judge will usually waive the ticket. This is a pretty minor infraction. 

Cop: Can I see your license, registration, and proof of insurance?

Me: [Oh shit, he's going to write me up. I give him my license.] Here, notice I just renewed this in May, I would have renewed my tags too if I'd have known they were expired. I do temp work at [local government agency] and I go right past the renewal desk several times a week. 

Cop: Well that's a worthy job. 

Me: Yeah, I'm not doing it for the money, it's a public service. 

Wow, I am keeping total control of the frame here. It is important to make sure cops know you are a respectable citizen. My experience with cops is that they decide whether you are a ""civilian"" or a ""criminal"" and then treat you accordingly. Now I'm not just a civilian, I am an underpaid public servant like him.

Cop: Your registration and insurance? 

Me: Hang on, I'll go to my car. [fish around in glove compartment, come back with papers] Here's my registration, and it appears I don't have my current insurance papers in the car. These are from last year, but my insurance is still current. I renew annually, I just forgot to put the new papers in my car.

Cop: Well can you get your insurance agent on the phone to verify it's current?

Me: On a saturday? You're kidding, right?

Cop: Ha ha. Well give it a try.

I take the papers back and make the call on my cell phone. It is a dead number.

Me: Well, that number has been disconnected. They moved their offices to (suburb) and to get the new number, I would need to get it off my current insurance papers, which are sitting on my desk at home.

As I am standing there next to the cop car, a guy drives up and gets out of his car. I should mention, this is a college parking lot and it is patrolled and only permit holders can park there, *except* on saturday and sunday, when it's free. So I am kind of parking here illegally, *and* legally. It is time to reassert control of the frame again.

Guy: [to cop] Hey, is it OK if I park here?

Cop: Umm..

Me: [interrupting] Yeah, look at the sign [pointing, cop is positioned so he can't see the sign] it's permit-only except on weekends. So it's legal to park here today. But if *he* gives you a ticket, don't blame me!

Cop: Um.. yeah, go ahead and park, I guess. [wow, cop is deferring to me!]

Me: Yeah, I park here every weekend, I have a weekly noon meeting with (civic group) where I help (pathetic people) with their (pathetic problem). And I'm already late. This really is a minor infraction, and it's a fix-it ticket, can't you just give me a warning? I'm going to get my tags renewed when I go into the office Monday. I would have renewed them already if I had known they were expired. [wow, I'm really pushing it here]

Cop: Well I'm sorry about your meeting [wow, an apology!] but this is *not* a minor infraction. I'm going to write you up for the tags, but I'm going to let you off of the proof of insurance ticket. That's a $350 ticket. 

Me: I bet the judge will waive the ticket, but that's not your problem, I guess.

OK, the cop starts typing on his computer terminal. I am worried that he's going to pull up a warrant on me, or that maybe he will see the previous speeding ticket and decide I'm a scofflaw and write me up for everything he can. But I can't let him see I'm nervous. Suddenly a hot blast of exhaust comes from under the cop car and burns my legs, and I shudder for a second.

Me: Ow! That hot car exhaust is burning me! 

Cop: You could wait over there in the shade.

I didn't move. I'm keeping control of the frame, being nonreactive to him. So eventually he writes me up, it's taking damn forever, I'm standing in the hot sun, sweating. He prints out the ticket, he gets out of the car (so I have to finally move from my position hovering over the window) then he places the ticket on the trunk lid, holding it down, sort of crouching over it, he motions for me to sign it. I am standing ramrod straight, towering over him. He gives me a little bit of legal bullshit about the charges, as he's required to do, blah blah blah.

Me: So am I free to go?

Cop: You can go, and I'm sorry about making you late for your meeting.

Holy crap. The cop is apologizing to *me* for making me late. I have held control of the frame, narrowly averting being held at bay by a K-9 Cop, being handcuffed, and taken to jail. And I probably will get off the expired tags ticket.. but I better pay my outstanding speeding ticket first, or the judge won't be so lenient!

**THIS IS WHY WE PLAY THE GAME.** Who gives a fuck about women, when your life is on the line? When you are poor and scraping up money to pay your overdue fines, some angry cop can turn your life to shit in a moment. But if you keep control, maybe you can escape disaster.

I've had many ""Mr. Fix-It"" type clients who, at first, couldn't fathom why they needed my expertise,  because they've been ""pretty successful so far"" on their MS Paint ads and logos and neighborhood strategies. Some were beyond convincing, and went back to what they were proud of, mumbling about high priced con jobs. Some though, had vision, and realized the value of a good designer's skill set in their marketing efforts. These people went places they only dreamed of.

The school obliged and all was good. A couple days later, a few of us players went out to the field and saw 3 baby rabbits pinned to the cork board in our dugout that we put the roster up on.

It works both ways though. For instance: I honestly don't know what evidence would be sufficient to convince me of the existence of a god.

Edit: I should have said ""I honestly don't know what the *minimum volume of* evidence would be sufficient to convince me of the existence of a god.""

Another female grabs the cloth that is holding a child to the mothers back, seems fair you would stop her. They're hitting, kicking and biting(?) the police and really, the only force they're using is to pull them apart. I didn't see any police using their bat things or hitting/kicking. 

At 2:17  I was horrified that woman was laying on her baby while kicking the police, as soon as you see the child they stop dragging her and scoop it up. And they walk away with the child and mother near each other.

There are idiots of all ages, in all nationalities and all races. Just because there are a few idiots in one particular group doesn't mean the rest of them are. 

I rode with a guy the other day I picked up off the street, the guy was 61 years old and was by far the biggest hippy I've ever met. He was backpacking across the nation, and was soaking wet, so he was glad to have a ride. 

We talked about all kinds of shit, and you know what? He was right on par with my own beliefs. I like to think of myself as a 21st century hippy, but this guy was the real deal. 

He supported all of these issues and was generally a very insightful and intelligent man. 

So I agree with Stumo here. While other people of that age might be closed minded stumps, there are plenty of others who are open minded and welcome change. 

The same in my generation. I remember when I was in high school, they had a ""Republicans Club"", but no real mention of anything liberal. So myself, and my like minded classmates had no group of our own, and had to deal with the bile being spewed out from 16 year olds about how abortion is wrong yada yada. Mind you I lived in the Bible Belt at that point, so that probably has some impact on it.

"graphic_design","t5_2qmtk","Please note that before you read my suggestion, I'm a successful freelance designer with a few years of experience and I charge well into the double digits per hour for my work. And yes, I have enough clients that pay me to make it my full time job.  

I have worked with clients on similar scales to you- they often do have tight budgets, and what money does come through is often earmarked toward a variety of things needed to keep the business operational. So, it's understandable that you might think $100 isn't such a bad offer. But I want you to know how designers interpret this:  

I don't know exactly what your business does, but let's say for the sake of argument that you charge $100/hr for your services. This rate is what pays you, puts a roof over your head and keeps the lights on. You know that if you can't make at least that much, you're losing money and you won't have a business for long. I'm sure at some point, you'll find a client who doesn't put much value into computer consulting and offers you $100 as a flat fee to provide your service, of which you know will most likely take you 20-30 hours of work to provide a quality service, which I'm sure is your #1 goal to your customers. How do you react?  

I'm not here to say graphic designers are the only ones who have to put up with this, as I have friends in a variety of other fields with very similar stories. What you should know about a logo though, is that you *are* creating a corporate image: this is going to be every potential customer's first image of who you are. If you pay someone $50 to put a clipart logo next to your name, will they take you as serious as if you paid as little as $500 to have something a step-up created? These are things that I, as a designer must take into consideration if I'm expected to produce something professional. I need to know more about you, your company, your industry, what makes you stand apart from your competitors, and so forth. On my salary, you may have already spent $100 before I even sent you a sketch.  

But the bottom line, when I do finally deliver your artwork, I hope that my time and effort yields something you're proud to use; something that is professionally created so you can print your logo on anything from a car, to a billboard, or the letterheads on your desk without having to pay extra to your printer to properly format the file.  

I really do wish you the best of luck with your search for a designer to work with. My post above is not a personal attack, but with my experience in the field, I do hope you can take a few points from it while you move forward on your project. If budget is still an issue, you might be able to find a freelancer or small studio that's willing to put together a small payment plan to get you the quality of work you need without immediately breaking the bank. I've seen it done in the past, and if a studio knows that you can be a good repeat customer, it might not really be something they scoff at. You'll never know until you ask!","1280631325"

So I went off to my meeting, and I sat there fuming the whole time, I didn't open my mouth. I was trying to shake it off, but I am in a really foul mood. I decided I need another cigarette, I don't have any, I smoked one hand-rolled cig at the coffee shop. I decided to head back there and have another. Maybe that will calm my nerves. And that's when it things got *even worse*.

I head in, pick up the tobacco and pay, it is too busy to chat up Coffee Girl. So I take a table and start rolling. And then *The Woman* walks in the door. Oh shit. My heart is in my throat instantly. She turns and mutters ""hi"" as she walks past, this is the first time she's spontaneously talked to me in months. And this is the first time I've seen her in maybe 2 months, I figured she moved away, I have been trying to forget about her. 

This is *The Woman* that I have Oneitis over. When I met her and fell in love, I thought I hit the trifecta. You know the old saying, ""Beautiful, Intelligent, Emotionally Stable: pick any two."" She was beautiful, only 5 years younger than me, but never married, no kids, a university professor. But I did not know she was manic-depressive, she concealed it well. As I was pushing and pushing on her for a romantic relationship, she was going more and more insane. It's a long, tragic story, but the short version is, her most compassionate instincts, combined with her innate gullibility, left her open to exploitation by some evil people that she thought she was helping. She started trying to help the local homeless, and they started exploiting her, she gave them all her money. Her bipolar condition went totally manic, she started taking homeless creeps to her house, and they stole her roommates' stuff, so she got kicked out of her apartment. She became homeless and started living in her car, and started doing crack with the local homeless scumbags. And here I am, trying to help this stupid woman, offering her a place to live, and my love, and she picks a scumbag homeless crack dealer instead of an upright guy like me. It was crushing. My beloved friend became a crack whore. She became emaciated and her mental state was often incoherent, she stopped bathing and wore dirty clothes. So her friends and I formed an intervention, we filed legal papers and had her involuntarily committed to the psych ward. I figured she'd be really pissed at me for throwing her in the psych ward, but when she got about 30 days of lithium pills into her system and she became more rational, she'd figure out what a favor we'd done for her.

But there was a big risk. It is almost impossible to reach someone in such deep denial. She might blame us for her problems, she might blame the intervention for her problems, rather than realizing she'd fucked up her own life all by herself. And that's exactly what happened. Somehow (we haven't figured out how, the legal records are sealed) she escaped from the psych ward and ran away. She came back 6 months later and I have bumped into her in public occasionally, but she has rarely ever spoken to me, except to blame me for all her problems, problems she is still in denial about. The best I've been able to get out of her is that she understands I was trying to help her but I didn't understand what was happening, so I destroyed her life. So I say, if she doesn't tell me what happened, how am I supposed to understand? 

But back to today, and I am sitting in the front of the coffee shop, finishing a cigarette that was supposed to calm my nerves after a shitty morning. And it looks like I'm going to have a shittier afternoon. She is sitting at a table alone in the back. I go to the back on the pretense of asking Coffee Girl for a glass of water, and she gives it to me. I walk back past her table, facing her for the first time in maybe 2 months, my hand is shaking, I am trying to suppress my feelings. Hell, I'm trying not to spill my glass of water, I'm shaking so bad. I am trying to open up a conversation like everything is perfectly normal, while we both know things are absolutely *not* normal.

Me: [Smile] Hello, how are you doing?

Her: I'm doing fine. [She is smiling, in a rictus-like smile that she always gives me, half smile, half grimace. I decide to ask her for *the talk* that we both badly need to have. So I tell her the exact same words I told her the first time I saw her on the street after she got out of the psych ward, the same words I have repeatedly used to open conversations with her]

Me: It would be nice if we could have a talk sometime.

Her: Well why don't you sit down and we'll talk. [I am shocked, she agreed. for the first time ever]

Me: So what have you been doing lately?

Her: I've been in (nearby state capitol) for a while, helping a friend with a new baby. What have you been up to? 

Me: Oh the usual. [let's try a DHV, a true one] Oh hey, my job hit the front page of the New York Times, there's a situation.. [blah blah blah, I can't describe as it would reveal my identity]

At this point, a creepy butch lesbian with short gray hair and a gaunt, craggy, crack-user face, wearing shabby homeless clothes, comes up to the table, she has obviously been sitting here, her bag and coffee cup are there. There is an awkward pause..

Me: Why don't you introduce me to your friend? [ooh, I'm being cheeky here, I know she absolutely does not want me to meet her friends, but that's a social dynamic trick to control a set that I learned from Mystery's books]

Her: This is (her name) [I say hello and shake her hand] Let me walk you back to your table and we can talk for a moment. [uh oh, she's taking control of the frame, she obviously does not want to talk to me in front of her weird homeless lesbo crack user friend, but I consent and we walk to the front of the room and sit down]

Her: I wish you wouldn't try to talk to me. What I want from you is as little contact as possible. It is traumatic for me to talk with you.

Me: And yet, here we are, talking in the most civil tone we've used in months. I think we might be able to talk about things, if you feel like it.

Her: [time for the ultimate shit test, she has an angry look and has ""crazy eyes.""] You know I shouldn't be talking to you at all. Our friendship is irreparable. I've been given legal advice that I should sue you for slander.

Me: Then you should sue me. [she is stunned for a moment. Shit test passed]

Her: I decided not to because I'm convinced you weren't intentionally malicious.   

Me: Well a few months ago, you said you were convinced I was trying to help you and that I believed I was acting in your best interests. There's a big difference between ""not malicious' and ""acting in your best interests.""

Her: But you used an unconstitutional law and made false statements to a judge to illegally kidnap me. You destroyed my life.

Me: [treading carefully, this is always where this conversation goes astray] This is the difference in our perceptions. You believe I destroyed your life, I believe I saved your life. I don't want to rehash the constitutionality of what a Judge decided was legal, or go point by point through my legal affidavit, like you apparently want to. I don't even have a copy of the affidavit, it's under judicial seal now. I don't think we can work this out without help, and I think we both need to resolve this. I've already offered to talk to you with the help of a counsellor, and my offer still stands.

Her: But what you don't realize is that I have post traumatic stress syndrome over this. You don't realize what it was like being taken away by a Sheriff.

Me: Well of course I don't know if you don't tell me. For months, I've been asking you to tell me what happened.

Her: And I got stuck with a $600 hospital bill.

Me: Would you like me to pay it? I am totally broke, but if you want me to pay it, I will do what I can.

Her: I appreciate the offer, and I may consider it at some later point. [WTF did that mean?]

Me: Well, if you had just stayed in the hospital and asked for help, you wouldn't have gotten stuck with the hospital bill and you would have had a way out of your problems. We wouldn't have done it if we hadn't arranged that up front.

Her: I'm so traumatized by that, I can't even talk about it. [She's getting angry, I am getting perilously close to pushing her ""denial"" button] And besides, my mother got into a car accident driving through ice storm on the way home from here and she almost got killed! [She always says this when she gets angry]

Me: Is that my fault?

Her: Yes, indirectly.

Me: No it isn't. She was already here in town and would have gone home anyway. Did I make the ice storm happen? She chose to drive home in that storm.

Her: But it's indirectly your fault. She was upset over what you did.

Me: No it isn't. I wasn't my hand on her steering wheel. You know, I talked to your mother for like 3 hours, she's more manic than you are [oops, shouldn't have said that]

Her: You see, now your agenda comes out, you still think I'm crazy. I just can't talk about this anymore, it is too traumatic.

Me: Well what about me? I am pretty traumatized over this too. I deserve some answers. Maybe we should talk about this with a counsellor, but if I could only have one question that you'd give an honest answer to, I know what it would be.

Her: What's that?

Me: You remember that date we were on, when I gave you chocolates, and you gave me a pack of tarot cards.

Her: We *never* went on a date.

Me: Well, that's another difference in our perceptions, I clearly understood this to be a date. When I asked you out, I made it clear this was a date. I gave you chocolates, and told you I loved you, that's what a guy does on a date. But anyway, you remember that night you gave me the cards, right? [she nods] OK, all that night, we were bouncing from place to place, and you were trying to contact X [I'll call him X, the scumbag homeless crack dealer half her age that she was obsessed with and that I think she was sleeping with]. First we went to ABC Club to see him, then he wasn't there, and then we went to DEF Club, and he wasn't there and you gave up. So we ended up at GHI Club, where we sat down for a couple of hours and had drinks and I read your tarot cards with the new deck you bought. And then you got a text message, and you told me you had to go give someone a lift, and if you weren't back in 20 minutes, I should phone you. So I phoned you in 20 minutes, 30, 45, 60, an hour and 15 minutes, then finally 90 minutes later you showed back up, agitated and your hands were shaking, and when you sat down, you were tapping your toes uncontrollably. I asked you what was wrong and you snapped at me.

Her: That was months ago, how am I supposed to remember? And besides, I always get edgy after drinking coffee.

Me: Well you weren't drinking coffee, you were drinking wine.

Now she is getting a faraway look in her eyes. She is looking upwards to the right, away from me, which I know from some NLP body language books means that she's concocting a lie. She looks down to the left, the ""internal dialogue"" glance, like people do when talking to themselves. She has given up on inventing a good lie. 

Her: Well I just don't remember. 

Now this is the crux of our problem. I believe I know what happened. She was trying to hook up with her crack dealer, X. She was frantically trying to contact him all night. She thought the crack run would be 20 minutes, but it took 90 minutes. I thought we were on a date. I might as well not have been in the room at all.

Me: Well I remember. I sat there for an hour and a half, doing what you asked, sitting there watching your bags full of stuff, and when you came back, you were agitated and paranoid. [I prod her] All that night, we stopped at place after place because you were trying to get ahold of X. [Pause] So, by the way, how much time was he sentenced to? 

I know that X got arrested in another state and she was trying to raise bail, and she was trying to get him released. He got arrested for possession of 10 kilos of pot, and went to trial last week, but I don't know how it turned out. Hey, I like pot as well as anyone, but if you've got 10 kilos, you're part of a major criminal enterprise, and X is a career criminal. He claimed it wasn't his pot, but he wont narc on his friend. Yeah right. The jails are full of innocent people. And I bet she was not really out of town ""helping a friend with her baby,"" she was attending X's trial. And the reason she doesn't remember is because she was so high. I know she is in denial about this, and here I am, trying to get her to admit she skipped out in the middle of our date to get high on crack.

Her: *That's none of your business!*

Me: It's a matter of public record.

Her: *Well then go look it up!* [yeah I would if I knew what his real name was]

Me: Well maybe you can explain to me about you and X.

Her: *That's none of your business either!*

Me: Surely you must see the parallels here. I was trying to save you from yourself, just like you are trying to save a career criminal from himself.

Her: *And neither of those things are any of your business!* [this conversation is going down the toilet]

Me: Alright, dear, if you say so. 

Her: This whole conversation is too traumatic to deal with.

Me: That's why I suggested we have a counsellor to help us talk it out. 

Her: I don't think that's going to happen. I am right now looking for work in another city, I'm going to move away and try to put everything that happened in this town behind me.

Me: That's what you always do, run away from your problems. Maybe one day you will discover that I am your true friend, someone who would risk your eternal hatred if it might save your life.

Her: In the meantime, I want you to stay away from me and not talk to me. I do not want to talk to you.

Me: That's what you said 30 minutes ago before we spent the last 30 minutes talking.

Her: Our friendship is irreparable.

Me: And yet, I have been and always shall be your friend. [I have to suppress the urge to close with ""Live Long and Prosper."" I hope she didn't recognize that quote, it just slipped out. And she walks off.]

Oh what a fucking chump I am. Or should I say, WAS. I give up on her. She is going to run away from her problems again, that's what everyone said she'd do. But wherever you go, there you are. There's no escaping her problems, when the problem is herself. I am now more convinced than ever that this woman was crazy, and I was a fool to love her. I followed her around like a puppy dog, letting her control my life, my reactions, and she ended up caring more for a homeless crack dealer than me. I deserve better. Many other people have said I deserve better. People know about her and her life is a public spectacle. I have to keep my distance, it is no positive reflection on me that I am in love with a woman who threw away her career and became a crack whore. I may not have much life left, and I'm sure as hell not going to spend one second more of it mooning around after some crack whore. I can't control how I feel, but with time, the wounds will fade.

So I have to forget about that. Or better yet, *never* forget what a chump I was, and use it to remind me how miserable life can be when you let women run roughshod over you. I will never get into this position again. And you know what they say is the remedy for this problem: FTOW.

So now, I am dressed up well, and headed out, I will hit the clubs at about 10PM. I am trying to use some PUA material, constructing a ""sexualized stereotype."" I'm dressed in black from head to toe. I don't look like a Goth, but I do present a mysterious figure, this is how I dress when I go read tarot cards. This is not how 52 year old men dress, and that is the point. My mission tonight is the same, openers, build comfort, then attraction. Who knows what will happen? Surely not anything as traumatic as has already happened today. But you never know, the Sun is conjunct my Uranus, so anything could happen; the Moon is conjunct Venus, so love may come my way from the most unexpected direction. I'm not expecting anything. But you should expect another Field Report soon.","1280631374"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Believe it or not, even though I am a scientist, I have done a fair amount of coding in my life.  Poor time estimation is always the manager's fault, and I'll tell you why.

A well trained engineer should be able to determine the amount of time it takes to perform a particular job.  A manager should be able to determine if that estimate is correct.  For these two statements to be correct, the manager must have the skills of an engineer to fall back upon, in order to assess the duty time as well as the strengths and weaknesses of his reports.  If he or she relies purely upon the estimates of his subordinates without direct evidence of their subordinate's reliability, then it is only a matter of time before they will get embarrassed or fired.  If the engineer is willing to learn, then task them to take some refresher courses on time estimation, and if you feel generous offer to foot the bill out of your budget.  If they refuse, either through direct action or passive aggressively, then fire them with cause.  Most HR departments will support you if you keep good records and counsel the employee or student enough times before the action.

I have paid out of my own budget such training many times and it has paid off in spades.  I have only had to dismiss two people over the last thirty years because they were unwilling to comply.  Most universities offer classes in time estimation which you would be surprised to know are general enough to be applied to programming just like any other occupation.

If you know the capabilities of every engineer under you, then you should also know that their estimates should be different.  Some are better at coding some thing than others.  As a manager, you need to break tasks up into manageable chunks and pass them out to the people who are strongest in those areas.  Finally, you or somebody with the skills need to glue it all together and *manage* the project.

I have a young lady who is a genius at U(3) and higher branes, but frankly she stinks at applied physics.  If I asked her to estimate the time it would take to calculate fluid flow in the metallic hydrogen ocean of a gas giant, she might tell me something random because she doesn't have a clue, but that is unlikely.  Fortunately, she isn't afraid of me, so she'll tell me she doesn't have the skills without hesitation -- she'll even point me to somebody who does.

A good manager learns who to ask and how to ask it.  They learn to prevent confrontation without avoiding it.  Finally they don't make general assessments, such as ""the whole team is a bunch of slackers who won't work without me"", without taking at least some of the blame.

If, as you stated in another post, *all* of your engineers would slack off the moment you were gone, then you have a more serious problem.  Look at the common element, which is you.  No organization should rely on one individual to perform or motivate, period.  If I were to keel over tomorrow, I know with certainty, that some young buck in my department would take over without a hitch because I've trained them to do so.  You should be prepared to train your replacement, not because you will be leaving, but to make your organization more cohesive in a crisis.

What happens when you get promoted or move to another company?  Will there be somebody among your subordinates with the skills to move up, or will your company have to bring somebody from outside?  I can tell you what the better option would be.","1280631382"

Dear, HellFire_Red. Thank you for writing so much and I deeply touched by your advices.
Here is the thing though. When I was with Brooke, I thought she was a virgin. ( I was quiet surprised.) However, I must tell you that she had been with one guy before me. Is just that her hymen is still intact because she didn't sleep with the guy all but once. And it short sex according to her.
When I had intercourse with Brooke, she always insisted on condom and check on the condition of condom every ten minutes or so. I must admit, I seldom last more than ten minutes. 
She was accepted to the University of Virgina but her dad decided it was best she attend and Christian university some where close to her home. I go to the state university in my home state but I drop out due to financial difficulties.
Indeed, which is why I think the kid is most likely to be mine because even though we are no longer together, I still trust her.
It has seemed she had not date a boy since me, and her friends has confirm this.
As for her Dad, although I am afraid of his scold, I am much more terrified for his law actions.
Money is not an issue for her, I know this much.

A: No, they are equal in number.

Q: That was a fun little exercise.  So what does this concept of infinity have to do with unicorns and reincarnation?
A: Fuck-all.  Infinity is a mathematical concept that is useful for dealing with situations where every component cannot be enumerated.  The above example shows that just because an infinite quantity of something exists (i.e. numbers between 0 and 1), doesn't mean that that the overall object itself is infinite (the difference between 0 and 1 is still just 1).

So the philosophical implications of the concept of infinity doesn't mean that everything has to exist.

2. You'll have a solid relationship with her.  People often ask another person out on a date from only knowing them a little bit and do it all wrong.

So I'm a small 13 year old girl trying to hold my horses head down so he doesn't get traumatized by watching his balls get cut off... unfortunately I can't help myself and look over as the vet cuts the skin, pulls out the balls, chops them off, and throws them to my dog who immediately eats them right up.  It was disturbing.  ","1280631457"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I job shadowed at a veterinary hospital in a small town in Oklahoma for a middle school assignment. I walk in the back room and there is a veterinarian bent over an operating table. The lady that brought me back there told him that i was there and he said ""Ah perfect timing, want to see what a cat testicle looks like?"" as he turns around holding it in his palm. I then saw them euthanize an old dog, perform an abortion on a dog ( which had nine puppies, and then he put three in a jar of formaldehyde and told me to keep them even though i refused), and clip a dog's toenails. The toenail clipping was one of the worst things I saw that day. The lady that was clipping the dog's toe nails was new so every single toenail she clipped was too close to the dog's toes. This caused blood to squirt from the dog's toes, just like a water spray bottle on laser mode, every single time the toenails were clipped. By the end of the clippings the new vet in training was covered in blood and there were bloody paw-prints all over the ground as well as blood splatters. It was indeed disgusting.","1280631457"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I'm sorry to hear of your loss with in the past three years. I hope you stayed with your lab during its last moments, they were lucky to have a family that cared so much.

In the beginning I had a hard time with it. I started off as a receptionist, where I found it tough to deal with families crying and being upset. I then switched jobs within the hospital, and became an animal attendant. I then was able to see dealing with the families wasn't as bad as being in the back with the animals...or I don't think anyways.  

My doctor/boss made everything a little better. Since I am someone who I think has a huge respect for life, no matter what it is(I do not kill spiders or bugs, I avoid ants when walking and such). I thought I would surely not be able to deal with animals whose time was up.  She told me, that she believed that once she had injected the animal, freed it from all its pain, past hardships, and its small confining body(each animal has a larger heart then could ever fit in its body, and their soul is so much bigger). Its soul is gone, that body is just a shell of a once (hopefully) dearly loved pet. and all we could do is show it the respect it deserved.
that is what we do, and with that explanation it made it better. Putting the animals into their body bags(which yes in actuality are garbage bags, but once a body is in their, its transformed), making paw print impressions(you have to press pretty hard to make them look decent) and bringing them to cold storage seemed like the least we could do for something that brought so many smiles to someone at one point.

The animals that are ready to go are the easiest. they are old and frail, and generally actually sick. Its when the animal is young, and not severely sick, but the owners cannot afford what needs to be done, those are the once that are rough. 

Two year old cat, a little fat, happy, and energetic. He was blocked, owners couldn't afford to fix it... he was put down, the owners didn't even stay. Those are the ones that break my heart...

I apologize for rambling... thanks to anyone who cared to read my thoughts.","1280631496"
"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I wanted to join the military every since high school. It was too late for me to do JROTC by then and get the benefits from it. I wanted to do ROTC in college but was debating between Army and Air Force. A little research into the Air Force revealed stuff about CyberWarfare, and I always wanted to do that sort of thing being a Computer Science major. Haha sadly things didn't work out completely as I wanted to in the end. I ended up getting a slot as an Operations Research Analyst instead of Cyber Ops. Funny because I'm doing my summer internship as a sysadmin over at my university's research facility. So in short, I joined the Air Force because it was much more technical than the other branches.

The initial application process isn't really hard. At my university's AFROTC detachment, all you need to do is talk with the admissions officer, put Air Force Science and Leadership Laboratory on your course schedule for next semester, and fill out some paperwork. Yes, you do have to do a DoDMERB physical (which is perhaps the most bullcrap thing in the world because people get medically disqualified for the most stupidest reasons). GPA for retention is 2.5 for scholarship cadets, and 2.0 for non-scholarship cadets. 

The training you receive in ROTC is all geared towards leadership and being an officer in the Air Force. Initial classroom instruction involves basic lessons involving the military and how it functions. Then, classwork progresses towards military history. Before you get to be an upper-classman and get officially contracted into the military, you must attend 4 weeks of ""Field Training""  at Maxwell Air Force Base, which is kinda-sorta like boot camp. After that, you sign a contract with the Air Force saying you'll commit to the Air Force (4 years active, 4 years reserve) after getting your commission. Should you fail to meet retention standards before graduating/commissioning (e.g failing classes), you may get dropped from the program and enlisted instead, which would really really suck.","1280631496"

After several months of coaxing him out of hiding after getting him inside... he finally started sleeping on the rack in the bathroom behind the toilet. Last month, I heard a loud thump. I thought nothing of it. I have two other cats who are evil little turds and knock shit over all the time. I finally ended up going to the bathroom at some point, to see the stray cat curled up in a little ball in the toilet. My first thoughts were, ""Oh that's weird. Why would a cat curl up in a toilet bowel?"" There was blood EVERYWHERE. I have a passionate love for cats and animals in general, so this was extremely disturbing for me.

What breaks my heart even more is that I think he knew he was going to die soon. I should have taken him to a vet. I've been beating myself up over it pretty bad. He had started acting strange 2-3 days before it happened. He slept on my lap (which was the first time to ever happen), loved on me, lots of little signs that I needed to get off my ass and call a vet. Every time I go to the bathroom I tear up now. I still can't get the sight of all of that blood... everywhere... out of my head. I remember grabbing his little body out of the toilet and screaming. His wet face is sort of burned into my memory. *Sigh*... Your story reminded me of the stray I was taking care of. I could see it in his eyes that he knew he was going to die.

"Metal","t5_2qhud","I think what you're getting at can be applied to any genre.

In pretty much any genre of music you will have ""people who like the music"" and the die hard fans.

Then there's a guy I used to work with. HUGE Slayer fan! Loves the mainstream heavy stuff .. Megadeth, Metallica, etc. One day he came by my desk while I had headphones on. ""What are you listening to?"" he asks.

""It's a black metal band from Italy called Mortuary Drape. Check them out."" as I passed my headphones to him.

""Naw I'm cool."" he said.

No matter how much I pressed the issue he wouldn't take a listen. He had his bands he liked and didn't deviate from that.

Or take my sister .. she's a big Barenaked Ladies fan. They were playing a concert here and I offered to take her. She said she had no interest seeing them live because they wouldn't sound like the CD. And why waste money on a ticket when you can just play the CD.

Edit:  Reread and saw I skipped over the Vibrams.  FiveFingers?  I wear FiveFingers.  What kind?  I have Bikilas and KSOs.  They are nice.  But the trick with those isn't breaking a new shoe in, you're breaking your foot and calf in.  It's a style different than what you're used to and will take some adjusting.  Start doing some walking barefoot, then some real light running.  If you live right by a track you're in a good position, say, a quarter mile or half a mile tops for a little bit.  It kind of works for because if you're completely new to running then you can get incrementally into running at the same rate you get used to FiveFingers.

We aren't connecting symbolism to the 9th degree. McVeight had a truck bomb because of the Waco bombing because of Branch Davidians because of firearms. 9/11, on the other hand, happened because of religion. See the correlation and how it is ten times more direct?

I have utmost respect for them and in most cases they are treated poorly by the public and city.  Here in my home town the city has been waging war against the fire department because they want to be paid according to a national standard and because they are asking for more money to hire more guys to make sure all engines are fully manned, etc, etc.  Safety precautions.  Things that should make common sense to everyone.  But the city has spun this into money hungry firemen that sit on their ass all day doing nothing.  They have also campaigned to close the training grounds, one of only a handful in the state, as well as urge people to retire and has lowered the number of staff on a few stations.  They made my dad, who had worked at the same station for +20 years, up and hop between stations every shift. 

My dad just got forced into retiring because of health problems, only six months in advance, but he was one of the leading voices in the fight for the city.  They won a small victory a few months ago in getting a raise, but they had to take a huge loss.  The city actually owed them money for previous raises as well...  but they received no retroactive pay.

It seems to me that competition of the form I described does not depend on money; nor even on a conscious desire to outdo the other group (although that may certainly exist between two educational collectives teaching rival schools of thought, e.g. biology vs. creationism). It may happen simply as a result of the diversity, and variable success, of collective endeavors.

So long as there are multiple distinct groups/firms/collectives within society, those groups may have variable success at meeting their chosen goals. Some may choose goals that are more risky or difficult, or may fall victim to misfortune. Some may succeed and some fail. And if the successful groups retain the accumulated capital of their success so long as they continue to use it, some level of material inequality will result -- although this may not be as severe nor as deliberate as in a statist society, since there will exist no party that benefits politically from maintaining inequality for its own sake.","1280631732"

Take the set of natural numbers which doesn't include 0 or negative numbers, but they are still infinite. So it doesn't mean everything.

It goes to the whole ""Cowboy American"" thing.  Americans like to intervene early, with minimal force, so they are called ""cowboys"".  But other nations want to hold meetings until the situation is so far out of hand that the only alternative left is to use nuclear weapons.

Penny wise and pound foolish.  War happens when diplomacy fails.  But at times, diplomacy *does* fail, and there is nothing that can be done about it.  Holding more meetings at that point just makes the bloodshed worse.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Not really. The overwhelming majority of American babies have parents who are: Citizens

How is this a point in a discussion about the usefulness of poor immigrants vs. poor natural citizens? So what if they are citizens? Like I've been saying, poor people are (supposed) drains on the economy regardless of origin.

&gt;Adults with no/very little support (aside from government provided services)

Actually, the cool thing about illegal immigrants is that many of them pay into social security while not being able to benefit from it. In pure ability to reap public assistance, illegals are superior to impoverished citizens.

&gt;Untrained in any skill that will provide them a decent living

How is this different from citizens that are poor? Unskilled labor is unskilled labor. Again, the point I'm making is that unskilled workers that are natural citizens, and make up the majority of the population, are no different in regards to burden as an immigrant.

&gt;Unable to move up the socio-economic ladder

The discussion is about the fears of making illegal immigrants into citizens. What would make an immigrant less able to accomplish social mobility than a born and raised citizen? Keep in mind that social mobility is not that high to begin with.

"Waaah","t5_2rz1j","Well I guess you have the meaning to human life figured out, either that or I don't really have time to keep arguing... I wonder which is more likely....hmmm...

Your arguments were interesting, and very much in lock-step, but as I said before very unimaginative and rigid. Existence, is if anything, always more complex than you think it is. Claims as broad as yours are invariably found to be false as time goes by, and honestly I'm sure better minds than mine have wiped the floor with previous similar arguments. One of the nice things about philosophy is that someone has already had whatever argument you are likely to have, and done so much better than you ever could. 

You really did give me a tautology. To live (that is to be alive, or to have life) is defined by you choosing to live (to be alive or to have life). A is defined as choosing A. *This makes no sense*.

&gt;Is that where your mind wanders when it is not presented with reasoned philosophy? You are depraved. You can't value others if you don't first choose to value your own life. You need your life in order to value other's lives.

Hahaha, What If I decide I wish for death, but after realizing I want to die, I suddenly decide instead the I will continue living for the sake of others and to do things for others. In this instance I've broken your life-choice chain by choosing death, but then I've decided to live for the purposes of other people. As depraved as this (or whatever haha) how is this not reasonable? Keep in mind someone must already be alive to be able to choose, which means at some point someone was alive without having choose to be alive (which then presumably they choose to keep on living).

&gt;The universe is not probabilistic. Probability is merely a mental tool that humans use to make judgments about an uncertain future in order to make better plans in the present.

Quantum physics would argue otherwise. You also misinterpreted what I meant by ""probabilistic"". Take a look at Quantum mechanics. 

&gt;Not at all. The presence of choice does not refute determinism, nor does determinism refute the presence of choice.

If things are deterministic, you aren't actually choosing anything. It's been chosen for you. Choice would mean you had the ability to choose between two things. You do not have that ability in a deterministic universe. To choose something, you must have had free will to do so. You do not have free will in a deterministic universe.  Compatibilism is bullshit. Either the universe is deterministic and casual (or probabilistic in the quantum sense), or it is not. Compatibilism is the grand wish of philosophers to have their cake and eat it to. Wishful thinking at its best. It plays fast and loose with the definition of free will to avoid having to give up free will in a deterministic universe. 

I'm in the process of moving which is why I haven't really bothered arguing very much with you, but I will be back in a few days, and I will respond again then.

By your argument it's perfectly acceptable to reproduce the book and distribute it en masse so that everyone and anyone can download ""a copy"" of it even though the author still has an original copy of the book. And by your copying &amp; distributing the book so it can be easily downloaded for free so that 100s, 1000s or millions of people can download and read the book, and not pay the author for his/her work, that is perfectly justifiable.

"Metal","t5_2qhud","I am not a ""metalhead"".  If you saw me on the street, you would see a guy in a suit going to work, listening to Burzum. 

I have always had short hair and I never owned any of those bands shirts either.  I just couldn't identify with metalheads.  Most of them were unbelievably stupid and even more  -- didn't know anything metal except superficial knowledge about the genre (and I lived in a very dense area of metalheads).  Some were intelligent, but decided to smoke pot all day and listen to Slayer.  Fuck that.

However, I do support metal.  I was a death metal/black metal DJ at my university and I met A COUPLE  of very intelligent, (almost genius level) metalheads who actually changed my understanding and my whole view of metal.  To be honest, they probably changed my life.
I promoted local underground metal, concerts and just spread the word, intelligently, to my classmates.  I took my gf at the time to see [""Until the Light Takes Us""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Metal/comments/abc9x/hey_r_metal_i_just_came_back_from_the_nyc/), and she was amazed by it... I have converted many non-listeners, hipsters and friends to metal and shown them how magical it can be.

Nowadays, I work as a research scientist at a biotech company. I have shown many colleagues what metal is all about and they are at the minimum, very intrigued.   I don't go to shows anymore , but I love reading about metal, metal history and I will forever be subscribed to the philosophical aspects of metal.

Yes it does, it allows the minority to prevent the majority from striking down a law or preventing a practice which serves the minority over the majority, or serves the minority at the cost of the majority.

Even so, I'm not just arguing that the filibuster is undemocratic, and should be abolished, but that the Senate itself is undemocratic and should be abolished. The Senate allows a minority of the population to control a majority of the seats, allowing the minority to actually pass law which serves the minority at the detriment of the majority, and *that* is aristocracy. The filibuster simply extends the power of the minority.

EDIT:

&gt;As to the question of the president, no. He or she should not be ""filibusterable.""

I like BudhaCronX's idea of using an old army base, but I think we can build a version of our own. Why not start from scratch? Let's start with a clubhouse with a couple dorms, full kitchen/restaurant, rec rooms, and bathroom/shower facilities. If we can find somewhere secluded from cities, but close to a major highway, we can use the clubhouse to raise money from passersby's. Once enough money is raised, we can start building outhouses for more redditers. I propose the first wave of outhouses be somewhat primitive- built more like hotel rooms than single family homes. Once we acquire a large enough population, then we can begin to build a more relaxing atmosphere with ponds, pools, bars, or whatever it is people want around a vacation spot.

Money will come from donations up front for the land and clubhouse. Hopefully with continued donations and some revenue from passerby's, a few dorms can be constructed. At that point, rent can begin to be collected from the dorms.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My dog was hit by a car about this time last year.

I was in the process of moving, so there were limited options for housing him.  I wanted him to be close to where I was, thinking that this would keep him calm and help me with the stress of moving.  Unfortunately, I didn't take into account the fact that I'd be away from my temporary digs most of the day, and he would be left entertaining himself.  He was tethered throughout the day, and I thought pretty secure without being uncomfortable, he had easy access to shade, water, food, etc.

I came back the trailer after buying food for him the night before.  I woke up early the next morning and went out to feed him when I saw his collar on the ground.  I immediately panicked, forcing myself to believe he'd just run off (though honestly that would almost be worse, because that area had lots of coyotes that went after dumped unclaimed dogs that wandered off into the woods; where we were staying was along a road with lots of human traffic so no coyotes).  I ran around calling his name, and then got in my car and drove a little ways down the road hoping he had gotten loose just recently and I'd see him and be able to get him.  I turned around on the road and got back to the intersection, and happened to look in my side mirror.  In a patch of grass I saw a white and brown shape and immediately I knew what it was.

RIP Eli.","1280631927"

Usually I didn't pay much attention to what was on the TV when legos were involved, but for whatever reason I started watching.  Ever since I've had a recurring dream that I was being abducted by aliens.  The setting of the dream would change depending on which town we were living in (we moved about once a year), but the sequence of events was always the same.  The sky would turn black, and the clouds would get all psychedelic like when you see oil floating ontop of a puddle in a parking lot.  Then a huge ship drops out of the sky and the terror would set in because I *knew* they were coming for me.  I'd start to run but eventually I'd inexplicably lose my ability to run, like they had some sort of invisible paralyzing ray.  I'd start to float up into the sky, still trying to run away the whole time.  Eventually they'd get me into their ship and then the experiments started.  For whatever reason when I was 7 years old my subconscious thought alien experiments would involve terrifying slime and being cut dozens of times with razorblades.  Oh and needles.  Eventually I'd wake up and a wave of relief would wash over me.  Those dreams finally stopped occurring regularly a few years back but every so often I have the same dream... only now that my mind is polluted with the horrors of the internet, the dream's terrifying nature has increased tenfold... and the worst part of the dream is always when I'm trying DESPERATELY to run away, but just... can't.

"running","t5_2qlit","I second scott_beowulf's advice. Running race pace every day is not productive, as after a while you can't keep up the intensity (as you are experiencing). My workouts usually consist of a tempo day (3 or 4 miles to start for you, at close but not quite your race pace). You should try and focus on keeping a hard but steady pace throughout, and if you find yourself with a lot of energy at the end make your next tempo a little faster. Add a mile while keeping the tough pace every 2-3 weeks.

Then 2 easy recovery days a week, just your normal runs. Moving along well but nothing too strenuous. These are also good for adding extra mileage when you need it. 

You need a speed day, as others have said. Fartleks, sprinting intervals, whatever speedwork you like to do. Hard workouts, but not killer. Focus on keeping speed and short easy jogging in between sets.

A longer run of 6/7 miles a week is also good for getting solid mileage in. For all of these try to limit the amount of road running you do in order to avoid injuries.

If you keep hitting the wall on these, try running with an upbeat music playlist going. Some people are distracted from discomfort enough that music really helps, but if you go this route you have to be sure your pace stays where you want it and you don't slow down when you focus on the music. Good luck!","1280632064"
"math","t5_2qh0n","A laplace transform is taken from 0-infinity, not from -infinity to infinity.

This is important.  A reverse laplace transform is a complex contour integral, and the laplace contour is a line parallel with the imaginary axis, encompassing everything to the right of it.  Consequentially, what this means is that events can only happen to things after it, or that events can only travel forward in time, and not backwards in time.  This is why a laplace transform is so useful for dealing with time, as opposed to space.

A fourier transform can be described as a bilateral, or ""two-way"" laplace transform directly over the imaginary axis.","1280632065"

&gt;Proudhon distinguished between what he considered to be two distinct forms of property often bound up in the single label. To the mutualist, this is the distinction between property created by coercion and property created by labor. Property is theft ""when it is related to a landowner or capitalist whose ownership is derived from conquest or exploitation and is only maintained through the state, property laws, police, and an army"". Property is freedom for ""the peasant or artisan family who have a natural right to a home, land they may cultivate, to tools of a trade"", and the fruits of that cultivation — but not to ownership or control of the lands and lives of others. The former is considered illegitimate property, the latter legitimate property.

&gt;However, Proudhon warned that a society with private 'property' without equality would lead to statist-like relations between people.

&gt;&gt;""The purchaser draws boundaries, fences himself in, and says, 'This is mine; each one by himself, each one for himself.' Here, then, is a piece of land upon which, henceforth, no one has right to step, save the proprietor and his friends; which can benefit nobody, save the proprietor and his servants. Let these multiply, and soon the people will have nowhere to rest, no place of shelter, no ground to till. They will die of hunger at the proprietor's door, on the edge of that property which was their birth-right; and the proprietor, watching them die, will exclaim, 'So perish idlers and vagrants.'""

In particular, if you are running from an attacker or any danger, then it suggests that you are not facing and confronting your fears.  
&gt;   
&gt; To dream that you are trying to run but cannot make your feet move as fast as you want them to, signifies lack of self-esteem and self-confidence. It may also reflect your actual state of REM paralysis during the dream state.

Your story reminds me of a neighbor of mine's dog. My brothers were friends with the neighbor boys across the street, and they had a dog, so they all went and took it walking one day. Normally the dog was behind an invisible fence, but for some reason, they were bored enough to take it out rather than play video games inside. They didn't walk it too long before a truck with a trailer full of pine needles ran over the dog. I can't remember if the dog ran out to it or he was just too close. Anyway, the truck was going full speed at the time and ran over the dog like a speed bump, twice. The truck kept going and never stopped. One of the boys held the agonized dog in his arms and brought him home; all of the boys were sobbing hysterically. Mind, they were hardly older than ten. Luckily, after a lot of vet visits and bills, the dog survived extensive bruises, internal bleeding, and broken bones. He's still across the street, howling at every car that passes by.

Should we ignore absurdities for the sake of them being absurdities? Even when these absurdities are useful to those committing atrocities?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I'm only 17, and only settled on old-earth creationism a few years ago, so I'm still working through the details. 

The defining characteristic of old earth creationism is the belief that the universe is old on similar timescales to mainstream scientists. This is based on back-calculating using our current knowledge of physics, so it's pretty hard to ignore that. Also, the relevant verses in the Bible fit this interpretation just fine, thanks.

From there on out it's different. Some believe that macroevolution was God's method for generating new kinds (God as awesomest programmer ever, hence the spoke into existence stuff); some believe that he, quite literally, spoke them into existence out of nothing. Dr. Hugh Ross (one of the Big Men of Christian old earth creationism) suggests that perhaps the early humanoids were God's way of getting everything set up for *Homo Sapiens*, while others think that they were merely either funky apes or funky people, not half-and-half. Etc.

As you can see, there is a lot of variation, so it's not particularly clear-cut. As I stated, I'm still working out my own opinions (and therefore not much good for an IAmA, but the Most Important Thing is this: I believe that God created the earth, and stars and galaxies and all that cool stuff, then fish and animals and bugs etc., and it was all good. Then he made people, and they were excellent; and people and God were pretty chill. Then people succeeded in not only screwing themselves up (and over), but their children too, and the rest of the universe. And finally, and most important of all, that God the Son came to take our just punishment upon himself, and thereby allow anyone who accepts that and follows him to become righteous in God's eyes, and therefore get into Heaven.

Clarity edit: I, personally: do not believe in macroevolution, and have not yet formed an opinion regarding early humanoids.","1280632152"

So? How does that play into the emotions felt by those after a terrorist action?

&gt; He didn't even USE a gun. He blew up a truck.

Don't be obtuse, the 9/11 hijackers didn't use a mosque either, they used planes. The point is that firearms, and the control thereof, was one of the main motivating factors in his crime, much like Islam was one of the main motivating factors for the hijackers.

&gt;McVeight had a truck bomb because of the Waco bombing because of Branch Davidians because of firearms. 9/11, on the other hand, happened because of religion. See the correlation and how it is ten times more direct? 

No, because one of your steps in that is the method McVeigh used, which you conveniently left out for 9/11. Here you go for accuracy:

McVeigh: 1. Used truck bomb. 2. Because of Waco. 3. Because he felt that Waco was the government violating the 2nd amendment.

9/11: 1. Used airplanes. 2. Because of first gulf war. 3. Because they felt that America was violating Islam by being in the country of two of the most important holy cities in Islam.

Same exact number of steps. Method, event that motivated terrorist act, principle that aforementioned event violated.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think it kind of stems from the concept that it's difficult to replicate a chair (although Ikea does a pretty good job and packs things efficiently) where as with digital bits it's a whole other matter, where you can replicate trillions of them within minutes using a few modern drives or transmit them at a given bitrate that's then sent at nearly the speed of light.

So on one hand you have a clean initiative like the [free software foundation](http://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software) and on the other perhaps a separate concept where if you copy some proprietary bullshit that at best you perhaps limit yourself with what you can do with the content and at worst you maybe give the company some free advertising and mind share, by propagating the thing. Similar to how a record label might be able to sell more concert tickets because the sharing of the music ends up promoting the thing, since it's not a case of lost revenue since those people would never had bought it but rather only the people that are interested will download it (and share it to friends.)

It might also shock you to find that, with the exception of racism, which has pretty much always been with us, but is now firmly de-institutionalized, unlike the situation the boomers were born into, much of what you may be interpreting as stodgy old conservative agendas are actually radical new ""Neo-conservative"" ideas that didn't really take hold until the 80's and 90's - but you have heard them all your life, so it seems to you that they must have been a holdover from the past.

The boomer generation has not ""had their chance and failed"". Political power takes thirty years or more to consolidate from the time that a group starts running candidates in local elections until they gain control of national and state-level political bodies. Did you even notice that Barack Obama was described as a ""young"" president? He's a boomer, one of the people you are claiming have already had their shot.  The boomers are just coming into their prime with respect to political power.","1280632181"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;It seems to me that competition of the form I described does not depend on money; nor even on a conscious desire to outdo the other group 

If it does not depends on money, then there's no possible way for one of those schools to die out due to lack of funds or by being outcompeted by the other school for students. That is notwithstanding that a creationist school would have it hands full trying to deny reality.

&gt;So long as there are multiple distinct groups/firms/collectives within society, those groups may have variable success at meeting their chosen goals.

As long as you have a cooperative society, then there's no risk involved. When there's no money or investment to speak of, a group endeavor will go on until it's successful since it's socially necessary. Misfortune is also combated with cooperation. And again, without a competitive society, and without money, saying something like : 

&gt;And if the successful groups retain the accumulated capital of their success so long as they continue to use it, some level of material inequality will result

Another thing, just looking at excerpts from An Empire of Their Own shows me this 
&gt;s: ""The most striking similarity among the Hollywood Jews, however, was not their Eastern European origins. What united them in deep spiritual kinship was their utter and absolute rejection of their pasts and their equally absolute devotion to their new country. ... something drove the young Hollywood Jews to a ferocious, even pathological, embrace of America. Something drove them to deny whatever they had been before settling here.""

For a while, we were just hanging out on the porch, but then they got all restless and wanted to go for a walk.  Being the resident, I suggested clothing a number of times, but was fully out voted.

Okay, [here it is](http://secure.newegg.com/WishList/PublicWishDetail.aspx?WishListNumber=13568665).

If you want a better monitor theres this [one](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236049).

Replace the OCZ Vertex 2 50gb with the [Vertex 2 60gb](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227550), its sold out atm, so I added the 50gb to roughly show the price. 

Now I'll tell you my reasoning behind each part.
(The order is just what the wishlist is in, at least atm)

**DVD drive:** *Cheap and reliable, not much else.*
****Case:** *Great air flow, tool-less design, lots of features, liquid cooling ready, nice price.*
**HDD:** *Fastest HDD and 1tb for an amazing price, along with great reliability.*
**Monitor:** *Good size, 75hz refresh rate, HDMI, 1080p, and cheap.*
**Motherboard:** *Fully loaded, 890fx, USB3, SATA3, DDR3 2000 support, 2x pci-e x16 slots, sub $200.*
**Video card:** *Great performance for the price and low power consumption, eyefinity support.*
**PSU:** *Gold certified (90% eff), SLI/CF ready, good company, modular, amazing price, 3 year warranty and its nice looking, but that is just a bonus.*
**Keyboard:** *Excellent price, reliable company, limited edition.*
**Mouse:** *Its the MX518, whats there to say :)*
**RAM:** *Very good RAM company, fast speed, low timings.*
**Mousepad:** *$20 SteelSeries mousepad, not much to it.*
**CPU:** *Went with the 1090t instead of the 1055t because if you ever decide to overclock, it will be a godsend. It is faster at stock. Went with AMD over Intel for several reasons. AM3 allows for upgrade to at least another generation (bulldozer, which is a game changer), less power consumption, Intel motherboards cost much more for all the features this AMD board has. 6 cores, but thats more of a bonus. The 1090t tends to see better FPS in games as well.*
**SSD:** *Fastest SSD for the 100-200 market, 60gb, uses a special SandForce controller*

Even still I'll occasionally smell it on someone else on the bus and it instantly causes a sinus headache, and when we had lunch the other day I had to ask her not to wear it around me because it's so strong in giving me these horrible headaches.

Apparently it's got something to do with waking up before this paralysis is lifted, so you are conscious but unable to move.

Additionally, if even one cop is deterred from skirting the law or using his/her racial bigotry from getting in the way of the line of duty, this is worth it.

2000 was still a Gate's OS. Ballmer is no Gates. Windows market share on all fronts, that's OS, web(IE), and Office are **all declining**. By some estimates IE is no longer the majority browser. By most estimates Windows has fallen to below 90% market share. Open Office is being downloaded like crazy.

XP is ""vastly different"". It's the first Windows with activation(digital restriction management). This is a huge philosophical difference. It's **defective by design**, as is Vista and 7. Less importantly, it also doubles(or better) every single system requirement over 2000(whereas from previous 98SE/ME, 2000 actually **lowered system requirements**! This is monumental progress on all fronts!). XP introduced Geolocation API, which can pinpoint your exact latitude and longitude.

2000 was relatively 'free' software. You could install it on another machine, install it on multiple machines, whatever. It was yours, basically. XP is not. Each registration code is tied to a machine's hardware fingerprint, and upon activation Microsoft stores and associates that hardware fingerprint for evermore. Try to install it with the same code on another machine and you get an error! Apparently, as far as Microsoft is concerned the computer owns the license to run Windows XP or beyond, not me.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I normally don't try to reason with conspiracy theorists, but I can't tell how genuine you are, so I'll bend my rule just this once.

According to BOA's 2009 annual report, they made a total of $8B off of all service fees.  This includes OD fees, but they're a small portion of that.  Most of the service fee income comes from fees charged for other services, especially business customers.

Also from their 2009 annual report BoA made $120B last year.  Which means all of their fees make up a small percentage of that.  The truth is that BoA could stop charging OD fees and not miss the income at all.

The reason that they do charge such high OD fees is because it is a disincentive to over-drawing your account.  If they didn't charge fees, you would have an interest free credit card.  Banks make money by lending out the money that you deposit to other customers.  Which means you have to have money deposited.  Customers that get upset and leave because of OD fees are upset because they don't have any money, and therefore aren't profitable.

If you ever complain to you bank about their OD fees and then get the impression that they really don't care.  It is probably because they don't.  Over drawing your account and then complaining about the fees is equivalent to going to an all you can buffet, not paying, and then complaining about the quality of the food.","1280632369"

One of our friends was having a party and my emo friend was getting pretty drunk and whinny about his ex and went off to go drink by himself.  The rest of the people there realized he was missing and figured he was off crying somewhere.  I started looking for him to see if he wanted to play some drinking games, but I couldn't find him.  I walked into one of the bedrooms and heard crying and sniffling from the closet, so I opened it.  He was in there with a PLASTIC hanger around his neck and his feet were touching the ground.  I looked at him and asked what the fuck he was doing, and he sobbingly replied ""I'm trying to hang myself.""  I know it was wrong but at that point I burst out laughing and told him what a moron he was for trying to hang himself with a plastic hanger while his feet were on the ground.

I agree with the need for more marines in my army, I've gotten caught with my pants down against mutas /banshees/voids i didn't scout and found myself with an only marrauder army. I'm trying to introduce more units in my army with abilities such as the tank with siege/unsiege or ghosts with their abilities. I'm still learning the hotkeys enough to memorize them and make it seem natural to make them do what I want them to do. 

Another problem I have is the 1-ctrl group army effect. When using abilities on the units I want I end up fumbling trying to tab over the units I want but missing them.

The gold, I got this sense that my opponent wasn't scouting around the map for expansions because I had units around his exits.

"programming","t5_2fwo","By properties, I meant methods that act as properties (get/set, etc.).

As far as prefixing the class with C, I'm not really sure. I'm still pretty new to C++ so as far as naming conventions go, I'm not really sure the best way to do it.

I noticed MFC prefixes their classes with C (I think? Never use it), like CWindow, etc. so that's what I did.

Also, not sure what you mean by storing multiple sets of the same data. I wanted it so I could set either RGB values or HSV. When setting RGB, it would automatically calculate the HSV so conversion between the two is done within the class. This makes it so the user (or application) can set either and not have to worry about conversion, ie:

    CColor Background;
    Background.Red = 128;
    Background.Green = 128;
    Background.Blue = 128;
    printf ( ""HSV: %i, %i, %i"", Background.Hue (), Background.Saturation (), Background.Value () );

Train packed?  You can guarantee the car you're on may have as many as 10 empty seats.  Sometimes two empty next to each other.  Why?  Sitting down is hard.  And these people will not move out of the way of people who want to sit down.

Part of the reason is some people -- usually men -- are spreading their legs, making it difficult for some people to sit down.  Women especially seem to avoid sitting near men.  Especially the guys who are trying to ventilate their balls, or whatever reason they have their legs spread apart.

But don't worry, morbidly obese people will always try to sit down, especially if there's no room.

Then they'll stand in front of the doors.  Even when people are trying to get on and off the car.  They won't move for anyone.  Especially wheelchairs and the blind.

Car is full?  No problem.  I'll just shove people out of my way.  And make life more obnoxious for everyone else, even though there is a train held up by this train at the next station.

Car is full?  No problem.  I'll just open up that stupid rag, the Metro, as wide as possible.  Elbows out (and into your eye)!

On the other hand, ordinary evaporation occurs when the vapor pressure of water exceeds the partial pressure of water vapor in the atmosphere, and increases as this difference increases (conversely, if the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere is higher, condensation occurs). 
The vapor pressure of water is an increasing function of temperature. It is equal to the partial pressure of water vapor at the given temperature and at 100% relative humidity. ","1280632483"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Bear in mind that the eight year repeating vote isn't law yet, but I do think that it'll pass, as it hits a good balance between competing interests.  I think that the majority of Americans residing in states have nothing against adding a new state, and would actually welcome it, as the biggest concern I've heard has been over the issue of flag design.  Lots of strong feelings about the arrangement of 51 stars.  
The issues arise with the conflict of our strong desire to support the self determination of Puerto Rican residents, and our longstanding strong precedent of congressional supremacy in matters of territory.   Our civil war, as well as multiple judicial cases, have strongly highlighted the point that congress has the sole authority to authorize the induction of a new state, or the emancipation of territory, which is expressly stated in the constitution.  So Puerto Rico can't just say ""We're out of here"", as only congress has the authority to release them, but at the same time, we have no interest in holding them as a territory without their consent (see the history of US interaction in the Philippines).  
That's why I think that a solution consisting of congressionally mandated binding self determination will pass through the senate.

Muscle relaxants, things that keep us from shifting in sleep so much, something like that. The idea was that when trying to run in a dream we activate the same area in our brain that we use to actually do it. And the inhibition caused by sleep carries into the dream.

No idea if there's anything to back this up. I do have a piece of anecdotal evidence: My dad has running dreams and actually makes running motions in his sleep, meanwhile I have running dreams where I cannot run quickly, and I do not make running motions in my sleep. In my dreams I try to run as fast as I can, but it's like running through jello. ): I have the unable-to-punch issue too.","1280632574"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","The Kinect method is actually a combination of ""traditional"" image recognition, but in consort with an IR depth sensor that can pretty much see volume. 

(You can get a very good idea how it actually works by looking at the debug video they show a bit in this Kinect PR video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVYR75lIkK0 )

However the IR sensor does not use Time Of Flight in order to detect depth. I haven't looked up the relevant patents in depth but from what I have read it sends out IR signals encoded at various frequencies/wavelengths and uses the measure of their interference as they come back to the sensor instead.

I'm working on a project currently that is thinking of using the same technology except we deal with the chips manufacturer Prime Sense, and you can find their base reference design on their website:

http://www.primesense.com/

Also here is the quote on their LightCoding tech itself off the website FAQ:

&gt; PrimeSense technology for acquiring the depth image is based on Light Coding™. Light Coding works by coding the scene volume with near-IR light. The IR Light Coding is invisible to the human eye. The solution then utilizes a standard off-the-shelf CMOS image sensor to read the coded light back from the scene. PrimeSense’s SoC chip is connected to the CMOS image sensor, and executes a sophisticated parallel computational algorithm to decipher the received light coding and produce a depth image of the scene. The solution is immune to ambient light, and works in any indoor environment. 


From what I've read on the technology, it seems very close to what is being described for Coded Aperture in this wikipedia article : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Range_imaging","1280632635"

But if he puts some effort into it and learns a very specialized set of skills to achieve his goals, it can work, as long as he can at least tell totally shit work from something good (like the OP says he can). 

The same thing goes for programming even. I know a lot of people who should not be doing very complex apps but if they have a very specific problem to solve, then they can learn enough to do it, and it works for them.

Some fucked up things include seeing a bloodied car at a crash site on the Autobahn in Germany, and I'll always remember the sheer fucking horror of the blown-up photograph on The Courier's front page of the car accident one of my best friends was killed in a few hours after the incident - there wasn't anything particularly violent about it, just disturbing, because the bicycle was still embedded in the front of the car.

Apart from that, I've seen wolves tear up lambs in the countryside and a lot of dead pets. I've also seen my dad bleed heavily from the arm in the hospital after he punctured himself accidentally following a dose of blood thinner and I had to run to find a nurse.

Also once saw an old man have a heart attack - he was walking down the pavement normally about a metre in front of me then suddenly collapsed and hit the ground, smacked his head off it. There was immediately a crowd of four or five people trying to help. I would have volunteered but I was in a hurry, and it looked like they had it under control, even though he was bleeding profusely from the head. Turns out he died a few weeks later.","1280632653"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was little, just after we moved to the suburbs, I got my first bike. My house was at the bottom of a hill, and I thought it would be cool to ride from the top of the hill down to our house. My father and brother were out front watching me. As I'm racing down the hill, my brother evidently thought it would be ""cool"" to sort of step out into my path and make me swerve out of the way. What he didn't realize was that, because I was 5, my eyes were closed for most of the trip down because I was a bit scared. I hit him, the bike spun, and I was thrown off right into a tree. I remember the feeling of kicking myself in the face, as I was wrapped around the tree. The bike came back at me and hit me in the back of the head, knocking me out cold. I came to, lying in the grass next to the tree, with incredible pain all over. Except, oddly enough, my leg. I looked down, and I assumed was pus oozing out of a deep cut on my thigh. I looked closer, and realized it was my femur, and a whole mess of arteries and veins. I passed out. And that's all I remember until I went home from the hospital, a week-ish later. I ended up with stitches in the back of my head, a few broken bones in my leg, and enough trauma not to ride a bike for the next 5 or 6 years. And my brother walked away, nearly scot-free. Only needed 2 or 3 stitches on his head. Lucky bastard.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If I recall correctly, it was storming something awful here (I live in Florida and we get daily thunderstorms during the summer). This was a little more than a year ago (May 2009, I think). I was having an all right day, having woken up fairly early to go to campus for chem lab followed by a few hours of lectures. One of my friends had just gotten in a car accident, so I was a bit preoccupied during the day, but my car was back at my apartment. So after the lectures were over (I nearly fell asleep in the last one), I rode the bus back to my apartment in a kind of agitated anxiety.

You know how sometimes you're just bouncing your leg, you're annoyed, but you know you can't make things go faster at all? It's a truly powerless feeling and knowing you have somewhere more important, more pressing to be just compounds it.

So I got back to my apartment to find out my two roommates were moving out. This was an upside to the day- I hated those two motherfuckers more than words can convey. You see, I'm an absolute neat freak- I sweep, I mop, I clean the counters, and I like to keep an empty sink. They would cook and leave out the pans with the half-eaten food in them for days on the stove-top. It was fucking disgusting.

So they're nearly finished packing and I figured, what the hell? I'll just wait until they've moved out completely and given their keys back to the front office. So it turns out before they leave, but after they've packed, they're going to drink in celebration of moving to a new apartment.

I went to my room and sat down at my computer to kill time before they left because I didn't want to drink with them at all. Knowing the hatred I have for them, I'd probably have tried to drop kick them in their faces had I been drunk. I ended up playing some 360 and getting bored with that, so I went to my bookshelf and started a Neil Gaiman book I hadn't read in a few years.

Eventually the two of them finished up and threw the bottles in the trash then left. I haven't seen either of them since, by the grace of... well... the fact that those assholes moved out.

"science","t5_mouw","TL;DR: Yes, ""recommended"" limit definitely pulled out of someone's ass.

I've been to talks recently by a couple of impressive BPA researchers ([Fred Vom Saal](http://endocrinedisruptors.missouri.edu/vomsaal/vomsaal.html) and [Patricia Hunt](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=just-how-harmful-are-bisphenol-a-plastics)).  

They both say that the graph of dosage vs. effect for hormonal stuff like this is U shaped, not linear.  Any amount of BPA is going to alter overall estrogenic effects from where they should be.  How much it matters for a given dose depends on how steep the effect curve is at that point.  For male embryos in particular it's very steep.

Both researchers say that endocrinologists immediately recognize this U-shaped curve business is true, but that toxicologists won't listen.  They say that all of toxicology is based on the dogma that dosage effects increase monotonically: more is always worse.  To accept that this (largely untested) assumption is flawed would be so much of a threat to the toxicology card house that everyone in that world (including EPA, OSHA, etc.) just go ""la la la"" and pretend they didn't hear.","1280632702"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've told this one before in a few different threads, but I think this one is the most appropriate.

Last year, my boyfriend, who I'd been with for about a year and a half, slept over in my bed. He'd always been a twitchy sleeper, but I remember around 7:00 or so he flung his arm out in his sleep pretty violently. It startled me, so I asked him if he was all right. He mumbled something incoherent, which was kind of funny, and I thought nothing more of it and fell asleep.

About 10 minutes later I woke up and something felt strange. It was a sort of half-sleep confusion; I had no idea what was going on, but there was a lot of motion next to me. I groggily said his name and asked if he was okay, since he was moving around so much. No response. I turned over, a little more awake, and he was fully convulsing, his arms bent grotesquely up against his chest, every muscle sort of contracting and flexing so he was thrashing violently next to me. I started to scream his name. His eyes were rolled back in his head, and his face was turning purple. Weird noises were coming out of him, this sort of low, creaking, gurgling noise. I was screaming like crazy, screaming down the hallway of the dorms (no response anywhere), and finally got the sense to call 911. I had no idea what was going on. As the responder was talking to me, I was hysterical, unable to speak clearly. His thrashing started to subside, and eventually he lay completely still, the only sound an occasional snort/grunt.

I really went apeshit when I noticed that there was a big stream of blood pouring out of his mouth onto my pillow. I was sure he was dead. This man had had changed my whole life, was my all and everything, and I had just woken up to watch him die right in front of me. The responder did her best to calm me, but I had totally lost my mind. At one moment, a bit later, he sat BOLT UPRIGHT, looked me dead in the eye, and went, ""What's wrong? Are you okay?"" as I was sobbing and screaming. I couldn't even speak. I was just glad he was alive. I started blubbering an explanation at him, but then he suddenly faded back and fell back onto the pillow, not responding. This happened a few times until the paramedics arrived. He'd had a grand mal seizure and was put on meds. The blood was from him biting his tongue. He's fine now... it'll be 3 years together on Monday... but definitely the single most terrifying experience of my life.","1280632706"

With only a few exceptions people who produce ideas worth buying, including in the form of books, music, software, medicine etc. have done so at considerable expense and risk. Either in years of training, backing and development of 100s of competing ideas of which most fail, or simply just the expense of producing thing in the first place. The people or companies that do this want to get rich off it, otherwise why would they even bother in the first place. There is a point in most people's lives where sadly you stop doing things out of love and start doing things to feed the kids, put them through college and buy them a car on their 18th birthday.

All young people will become these people eventually and on this matter their views will change considerable. So no on the filesharing thing that will never change, the older generation will just be replaced by people with exactly the same vested interests in the next generation.

Sure sensible companies may use filesharing in some way to increase sales if they can, but that is debatable and it is a matter of commerce and nothing to do with the law.","1280632716"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Nice AMA. I'm a chemist and have always wondered some things about pools:

Do the chemicals added to the pool ever 'accumulate' to the point where the water must be drained? I know there is a equilibrium between things like chlorine additives, whereby the chlorine eventually escapes into the atmosphere or reacts with something (probably bad like a bacteria) and becomes a free chloride ion. 

So my question sort-of-is, does pool water ever reach the point where the water just has to be drained? Is the typical splashing-of-water-out-of-the-pool and having to top it up occasionally all that is needed to keep things in order?

If you use substances to precipitate built-up chemicals out of the water, how do you collect the precipitate? Do they just get stuck in the filter? 

I have seen bottles of 'Liquid Chlorine for Pools' at some hardware stores that contains 125g/L of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), have you ever used this? I image its quite dangerous to handle and extremely smelly. It is basically super-concentrated household bleach without sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in it.

What is your opinion on the hypothesis that chlorinated pools may be a responsible for childhood asthma, especially for the high levels of asthma in developed countries (like Australia, for one)? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pool_chlorine_hypothesis

Do you prefer 'salt water' pools or 'chlorinated' pools? Which do you have at home (if you have a pool of your own)?","1280632748"

It's not that I'm concerned so much that others might find out the results of the test (though with a national health registry type thing, who knows?lol), it's that I simply don't think the government belongs in our private affairs (excuse the pun). 

It seems to me you're saying the government should require testing even of those men who don't want to be tested or have no interest in being tested because some men don't have the guts to ask for it?Really?

Finally, it doesn't matter the cost, I still don't see why the tests should be free (or rather why the hospital should eat the cost of the tests, which we know they won't... someone --probably all of us-- will end up paying for them).

Edit -- This is my stance on most matters when we start talking about the government getting involved; it has nothing to do with the fact that some cheating bitches might get caught.

You're right that it's a combination of factors that need to be addressed. By and large, crime is caused by four things, poverty, bad education, punitive and non rehabilitative prison systems, and harsh punishment of drug crime. Attack these causes, and crime dissipates. 

However, even if the other causes aren't addressed, don't think this means the US' current prison system is the best one for them, it absolutely isn't.

It would be crazy if they could set up a one on one death battle between the GGB and this mountain place in Japan I'm thinking about.

"science","t5_mouw","As a warm-blooded animal, you generate heat. When it is ""comfortable"" outside, heat is leaving your body at the same rate it is generated. This requires an outside temperature significantly colder then your body. 

Other factors improve your body's ability to radiate heat into the environment. Low humidity makes sweat work better, and wind exchanges the already-slightly-heated air next to your skin for ""room temperature"" air.

Some things reduce your ability to radiate heat. Like clothing. Others actually add heat, like direct exposure to sunlight.

This is also why you can get hypothermia in a 70 degree pool - water is a much better conductor of heat then air, so you lose heat faster. It also explains why water the same temperature as the air feels much colder.

Anyway, under normal circumstances, 95 degrees is above the ideal temperature for balancing the heat you generate with the heat you radiate. (I couldn't tell you what the ideal temperature **is**, but it's lower then your body temperature by more then 3 or 4 degrees. You can make an educated guess by what feels comfortable.)

Science has proven that there's a cell that contains the DNA of two parents. But you're delusional or lying if you think that ""science"" claims this constitutes a human being.

&gt;I don't think I've made excuses for them.

I quoted you doing just that. 

&gt;you haven't proven that it does, except by saying that because of the way the Republican platform reads it proves that there's a big demand that women be allowed to die.

There's only 2 parties worth talking about in this country. One of them represents about 45 million people. I'd say that's a ""big demand."" Bobby Jindal ran and was elected on his demands that women die if direct abortion is the only way to save her life, and the Bush administration demanded that hospitals allow their medical professionals to let the woman die along with the child, with no consequences.

&gt;Maybe, but no matter what the apologists say, the abortion will have been done.

Not true at all. Before Roe v. Wade, 1 in 3 women with an ectopic pregnancy died, because therapeutic abortion was illegal. Even today, women die in Catholic hospitals (which often are the only hospitals in their community) because the Catholic bishops forbid direct abortion to save a woman's life.

Are their deaths really so meaningless to you?

&gt;and those are the ones I'm against

I have no problem with you being against that. But what I resent is you providing political cover for the people indirectly causing those abortions and deaths by pretending that they are pro-life.

The honest thing for you to do would be to admit that you personally are pro-life but that for political reasons you are allying yourself with a movement that is pro-abortion/anti-choice/pro-death. And stop with the excuses.

My guess is that your brain is expecting feedback to properly guide fast movements (like running) - but because the signal going out to your arms and legs to punch/run is blocked by the brainstem, your limbs never move and no feedback is returned to your motor cortex (for example, knowing that your right foot has successfully hit the ground and now it is safe for the left foot and leg to swing up, forward, and land).  Because there is no feedback, your brain ""trips up"" and thinks something is wrong (maybe your brain thinks you are stumbling?  If that's the case, it might be a good idea for your body to stop trying to run so fast without sure footing..).  Again, just a guess but it seems to make sense to me.

And as an added note, it can take YEARS to add a good amount of muscle. You'll gain a little more near the start (especially underweight), but 1-2 lbs of muscle mass a month is what you should expect realistically. And it's really easy to shed excess fat, so try and gain a pound a week while you're bulking for maximum muscle growth. Newbie gains are awesome. Good luck!","1280632928"

Are you referring Allah wants ""B""  to accept whatever ""A"" brings on the table? Without going through any kind of ""scientific decision making process""? And Allah ""wants"" people to accept Islam on a face value?Like whenever any ""warner"" comes to Alaska/Siberia/Antarctica, people are suppose to accept that version of religion?

For example, people who have sun or heat intolerance still can't be out there for hours in those lines, they have to wait elsewhere.  

Other parks have solved this in a perfectly acceptable manner.  The people with handicapped ride passes go up to the ride they want to ride and get a ""time stamp"" for the beginning of the line.  If the line is 2 hours long, they're told to return in 2 hours, at which point they can ride at the same time as others who would have started the line at the same time as they got there.  They also can't go get more time stamps in the intervening 2 hours while they're waiting (so it really is like they're waiting in the line), but they can go wait somewhere inside where it's air conditioned, get a beverage, use the restroom, whatever like that.  

The thing that sucks (from my perspective as a handicapped rider) is that non-handicapped riders (i.e. everyone else in the park) isn't informed that this is how the system works so they still think I'm ""line jumping.""  Come to think of it, I haven't been to Disney in eons so for all I know, Disney may use this ""fair"" system as well and you all may just not be aware of it and it may seem as though the disabled people are cutting in line when in fact they've been patiently waiting elsewhere for the same length of time that you stood in line.

2. He comments at the end that being a critic is a ""skill"" yet seems to imply that it can't be learned by a non-critic.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay no need to be so condescending about it. I would first point out that your article is from 1978, not that that makes it wrong, but perhaps more questionable. When I did a google scholar search for the phrase ""Is happiness relative"" the second result was for your link, however the first result was a counterclaim to this idea.

This paper states:

&gt;It is argued that the theory happiness-is-relative mixes up overall happiness with contentment. Contentment is indeed largely a matter of comparing life-as-it-is to standards of how-life-should-be. Yet overall hapiness does not entirely depend on comparison.

The most important concept that counterclaims the happiness is relative theory is the idea of need-gratification.

Sticking simply to common sense, say someone has the desire to do lots of crazy shit in their life and they want to travel the world and go skydiving and drive a ferrari and fuck a famous actress. Being able to do these things make them happy so if you win the lottery you would be happy. In fact, this makes me think that an interesting study could analyze the rate of depression in people who won the lottery, suffered a debilitating injury, and the average person.

Either way, by definition what you proposed was an idea, true, false, or debatable, it's still an idea. And true or false, I don't totally buy it.","1280633060"

"WebGames","t5_2qhoa","**Quick Notes**

* Here's the regular direct link if you do not wish to use my referral [link](http://www.kongregate.com/games/Tacticsoft/battle-dawn)

* Yes that's a referral link and I get 50 boost credits for every person that gets to a certain rank. No real money though don't worry.

* I would love to start a Reddit alliance on one of the new servers starting up and would be happy to help with resources to anyone that comes, would require a good following and organization.

**Quick Points about the Game**

* Basically its similar to one of those turn based strategy games that are usually fully text with no visuals except this one has one gigantic map with visuals and usually 2000 players per server all on the same map. 

* Think risk with more rules and complications.

* Games usually last 3000 ticks (turns) and go until ended or all areas are captured by one alliance. Nothing is permanent.

* Different speeds, I'm playing on 6 tick server which is 6 turns per hour or one turn every 10 minutes. I prefer this as its fast paced. The range goes all the way down to 1 tick per hour. 

* Three themes: Mars Colonization, Earth theme, and Fantasy. All three have unique huge world maps.

* I recommend starting on a 6 tick server that has only just started out aka its only in the early turns so that you don't have to fight fully established mega alliances.

* This game is totally able to be ""Goon Swarmed"" like Eve. If we can get enough players and maybe make a subreddit we could completely own a server. New players can harass big alliances through a ""jihad"" or free fighter strategy that I've been using.

* There's nukes on the real world themes and dragons for the fantasy theme. 

**Downsides**

* Boosting for cash. You can buy supporter tokens which allow you to boost some of your resources not by much and it does have a pretty long cool down but it can make a difference. I've bought about $17 dollars worth of support tokens just because I like it and want to see it succeed. The good thing is no match lasts forever and you don't keep getting supporter tokens each time. Plus they are completely unnecessary if you start on the server from the beginning, you'll be able to build up enough resources.

* Still in beta there's a few features I'd like to see added like a way to attack already conquered places before they rebel and stop attacks already in progress besides the one spell.

* If you start on a server in the later turns it can be extremely hard to start yourself up without having to play catch me up all the time. However you can do what I've been doing and just do some guerrilla warfare.

Here are some screenshots from my game, its on tick 1212 on a 6 tick per hour fantasy server...

Here's one of the entire world map each dot you see is a player/conquered player and other items. You can zoom in all the way on any area.
[World Map](http://imgur.com/dXiCD.jpg)

Here it is zoomed in all the way as I'm harassing the number one alliance on my server just by attacking their undefended holdings. They are way too big right now so I'm conquering their goldmines, lumber mills, dragon lairs, outposts and destroying them for resources as soon as I can.
[Zoomed In](http://imgur.com/Dvftx.jpg)

I'm not usually addicted to games like these but I can't stop playing this one. The visual aspect really helped me out a lot.

Feel free to ask me any questions, I'm new to the game but I'll try to answer any I can.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First : 

Please define objective how you mean it within the context of this conversation.  I may be taking a much stricter view of objective than you are and this may be the primary source for the difference of opinion.  When you say objective, do you mean completely out of the mind or are you referring to as close to objective as a human mind can be (which I still consider subjective).

Second:
Your two observations are based upon one another.  You can only compare two variables with the equipment you have (your brain) and can only compare them within the subjective context.  Only with impartial measurement tools can you make an objective measurement. You can empirically observe but you're still using subjective means to gather that evidence.  You're still using subjective means to parse the data collected and compare it.  It sounds to me like you consider your conjectures sufficient in establishing ""objective"" truth.  I disagree.  Conjecture only establishes subjective truth or even shared subjective truth. 

&gt;A society that does not engage in deception is better than a society that does. They function better; they achieve more; they react better to new circumstances; they are capable of engaging in longer-term planning, etc..

I can play the conjecture game too!! A society that does not engage in deception will fall prey to a society that does.  I can prove this empirically because there are not societies that do not engage in deception.

&gt;Ahem. Objective != Absolute.

I understand objective and absolute perfectly. I think we are using different definitions.

&gt;No, objective measurement of subjective political philosophy.

Anything that requires social measuring is at the mercy of how it is measured and cannot be measured objectively.  It isn't as simple as watching mercury rise and recording the results.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Running tracert from the command prompt to Google (any site will work), we see the different paths it has to take.

C:\Users\User&gt;tracert google.com

    Tracing route to google.com [74.125.95.106]
    over a maximum of 30 hops:

      1   108 ms     1 ms     1 ms  192.168.2.1
      2     1 ms     1 ms     1 ms  192.168.1.254
      3    11 ms    11 ms    11 ms  ppp-**REMOVED**-swbell.net [**REMOVED**]
    ^C
    C:\Users\User&gt;

In this case, the first line, 192.168.2.1, is the router. From there, it then hits another 192.xxx block which means we're still inside a LAN on that hop. The next one is no longer inside the local network. Since he's likely an average Joe with basic internet service and we know he has a router, we can safely assume that the last device the information is traveling to is the router as it is the last IP address before we exit the LAN.

So, just point your browser to whatever the last LAN IP address is and see if you can get into the router. Depending on his ISP, it may or may not have an easy password. Some modem are setup so the passwords are randomly generated and pasted onto a sticker at the bottom. Others will let any device on the LAN have access to the basic functions and require the user's e-mail address and e-mail password to access the more advanced functions.

Skim the control panel and see if it has his home address or phone number. Even if all you have is his ISP e-mail address, you could easily do some social engineering and find out his real information. Call his ISP, claim to be him or something and say you moved recently and want to see what address is on file still and if you're paying for someone else to have internet access. Hell, if you can work your social engineering skills well enough, all you need is his e-mail address.

Best of luck, let me know how it goes and if you need more tips.

EDIT: Ctrl+C will stop tracert after you get the information you need. Chance are you'll only need the first two or three lines.

The most likely explanations of these, aside from human error, are that either a remarkable new catalyst has been discovered that operates at 95 K, or a methane-based form of life exists on the surface of the moon.

We used to sneak out in the night to run around the suburbs in the dark and meet up with friends. I was supposed to meet Chris, my boyfriend, at the preschool park I had grown up in and he had hung himself from the swingset. I walked up, seeing the outline of his dangling form, and called his name in a voice that quaked. I had no idea that the pressure of the rope on the neck causes the tongue to protrude, like in a cartoon. I tried to lift him out of the noose for a feeble moment before running to the nearest neighbor, bashing on the door and screaming for help.  The most disturbing aspect was that he never left any note, no final farewell, no indication as to why his thirteen year old girlfriend was meant to discover his corpse. The police and the ambulance came, but he had been dead for an hour at least. My mum and her boyfriend had to come and pick me up in the preschool where I had spent the sunny days of my childhood, where I was sitting on the ground, hugging my knees, watching the paramedics zip up the body bag with my eyes brimming over.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; people are rational. 

Actually a majority aren't. They are swayed by emotion, group think, and usually fail at rational decisions. If some wacko says ""panic!"" on the ""news"" - they do it - in droves. 

&gt; The debate should be about whether or not the government allocates capital more efficiently than the free market or not.

But 

1) that's not what the OP was doing. He started with one analogy and switched horses mid-leading them to drink (if you get my meaning). 

2) The problem with generic ""the free market"" vs ""the government"" debates is that usually neither are well defined and so those who want to prove their point just pick and chose their straw-man scenarios that make their point. 

Look. There are some cases where ""the government"" works better. There are some cases where the ""free market"" works better. There are some cases where local government works better than the free market which works better than the fed. And there are some cases where ""the free market"" and ""the government"" work well in partnership, etc., etc. 

Case in point: 
The cash for clunkers was designed to get older, smoggy, low-value ($4500 or below), gas guzzling (18 mpg or below) replaced with newer fuel-efficient (must be at least 4+ mpg better), cleaner cars. The goal was to increase the overall fuel efficiency, lower pollution, and at the same time help stimulate the auto makers which were looking at bankruptcy. 

If you want to make a real window-to-window analogy, it's no different than credits for replacing old leaky windows with well insulated ones. &lt;sarcasm&gt;Destroying perfectly good windows! Harumph!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

You have to look at the entire picture because for every example  where government was not as good as the free market, there are examples where the free market was much worse than government. 

TLDR; People who say ""the government bad! Free market good!"" are over-simplifying and making fools of themselves. ","1280633282"

This is because the economy is walking a narrow path, on one side dangerous deflation, and on the other dangerous inflation.

Importantly, nobody really knows what should be done.  The European governments are leaning towards austerity, and the USG is still in stimulus mode.  What everybody could probably agree is that forceful shoves could be disastrous.

It's probably something around 80-90% in corporate and special interest favor vs. the public. You still get to make some small decisions, but when it comes to the big issues, well, just look at the results.

As for naivete, firstly, I sincerely meant it as a descriptive, and in no way derogatory. Secondly, here are some definitions from Dictionary.com:

Naivete:

1. the quality or state of being naive; natural or artless simplicity. 

Naive:

1. having or showing unaffected simplicity of nature or absence of artificiality; unsophisticated; ingenuous.

2. having or showing a lack of experience, judgment, or information; credulous: She's so naive she believes everything she reads. He has a very naive attitude toward politics.

3. having or marked by a simple, unaffectedly direct style reflecting little or no formal training or technique: valuable naive 19th-century American portrait paintings.

4. not having previously been the subject of a scientific experiment, as an animal.

What I perceive as your naivete is closely related to number 2 above. To me it seems like you innocently believe in at least some of the lies designed to make us feel we have control over the political system, and my guess is this comes from a lack of experience, or information, or from the simple and understandable need to believe things aren't the way they are. Or it could be a combination of the above. Or i could be totally wrong.

Either way, I don't see where I fit in the above definition of naivete.","1280633374"

To be more like inception you would have to find the person who conceptualized how to make an HD CCD chip or if you're using a dslr, the guy who first realized how to get live play on a full frame censor using CMOS and show him the guts of the thing and explain how it worked, on top of that you'd have to show him how a debayering algorithm works. If he's using a CCD you'd have to explain to him how the Colorsampling works and understanding how to sample at the resolution in a 4:2:0 coloring space.

You see inception starts with an idea, but generating something like this is more than an idea, one man can't simply invent an HD cam corder, he can set it into work.

Also the idea of filming the invention negates the idea of inception as the process has allready been thrown deep into motion and the camcorder is BEING invented. And really it was just a logical step forward from SD camcorders.","1280633388"

&gt;Law enforcement agents have easier, faster and more efficient access to claims data for identifying fraudulent billing patterns quickly;
penalties for fraud have increased; and more resources are available for ‘on-the-ground’ support, specifically $600 million over the next 10 years. And these resources are well worth the investment, as Attorney General Eric Holder pointed out that for every $1 invested into anti-fraud efforts, $4 are returned to our U.S. Treasury.

&gt;Also, the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program 2009 Annual Report recently submitted to Congress, outlines last year’s unprecedented successes in fraud prevention and enforcement efforts. In summary, last year:

&gt;Over $2.5 billion were deposited back into the Medicare Trust Fund (29% more than the previous year);

&gt;The federal government won or negotiated over $1.6 billion in judgments and settlements;
U.S. attorneys offices opened 1,014 new criminal health care fraud investigations with 1,786 potential defendants in 2009; and

&gt;There were over 600 convictions and 250 imprisonments with terms ranging from 2 months to 30 years.

"piano","t5_2qnw8","A lot of double jointedness is due to relatively weak muscles. Even if the bone structure and ligature is unusual, building up muscle tone helps remedy it.

First of all...avoid displaying your double jointedness. It's cool looking, but is indicative of something detrimental to your playing

I used to have very double jointed thumbs and forefingers. After practicing with them in a natural curved position on violin and piano, they are no longer double jointed. 

This doesn't take particularly long to do, just some discipline and exercises focused on strength and independence of fingers. Scales, Hanon etudes, etc... probably better that it's not difficult stuff you practice with at first. 

Just focus on using finger strength only to depress the keys. Make sure most finger movement is coming from the base joint of each finger It's difficult to play with the double jointedness because, well, the muscles are weak so it seems to take more effort. After you build more strength, it seems less difficult, and the unusual hand shape won't be necessary hopefully helping the pain.

I suspect a lot of the force you are using comes from your forearm/wrists, rather than finger strength? That's where the wrist pain is coming from most likely. Don't get me wrong though, there are times where using your forearm is ideal... avoid it for a little while though methinks.

Hope this helps :)

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","It's not just ""pee"" -- it's **everything** on your skin, in your hair (everywhere), and on your swimsuit.

You (and every other swimmer) have loads of different chemicals and ""dirt"" that you are adding to the pool -- everything from aftershave to shampoo, to bug spray, to makeup and lotions, to various molds, bacteria, viruses, and ... well just about anything that people have put on their bodies (or which have ended up there) since they last took a bath.

THAT is the reason that pools want you to take a thorough shower BEFORE you get in (it helps reduce the amount of junk you are bringing into the pool).

**Basically there is no difference between taking a bath and swimming in a pool -- and you know how dirty the bath water gets, right?** -- only difference is that the pool is many times larger so all of that ""stuff"" get's dispersed into a larger volume of water (then ""killed"" by the chlorine if it is present in the proper amounts, and then filtered out {over a course of a few hours} by the pool's filtration system).

BTW, if you are interested, here's [a chart on how long it takes to ""kill"" certain bugs (like MRSA) via ""normal"" 1-3 PPM concentrations of free chlorine in pool water](http://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/pools/chlorine-disinfection-timetable.html) (Note, most pools are required to have at least 1 PPM of free chlorine, and no more than 10 PPM -- spas typically have a higher concentrations required because a) there is a lot LESS water, b) there are typically a lot MORE ""users"", and c) the higher water temperature complicates it {takes more junk off of skin, grows bacteria faster, reduced chlorine faster, etc}).","1280633399"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was 12, I went to sleep over at a friend's house. I'd never been there before and didn't know her family well. Her older brother was a sullen kind of kid who seemed to give his parents a lot of grief. Her mom was quiet and timid, and I soon found out why. My friend's brother was trying to study, and his dad was watching t.v. rather loudly. He came downstairs and shut off the t.v. and then went back up to his room, I think. I didn't see it. But I saw what happened next. The dad came running up the stairs and lit into the boy with his wide leather belt. I've never seen anyone hit anyone like that before. It scared the crap out of me. He was shouting and swearing and just whaling the kid. My friend and I both burst into tears and begged him to stop. He eventually did, and went back downstairs. I ended up going back home; I was too freaked out to want to spend the night anywhere near that guy. I felt so bad for my friend and her mom. I didn't understand why they wouldn't call the cops and get his arse arrested. 

Anyway, it stuck with me for years. It was really disturbing. 

The other, and far more disturbing, thing I've ever seen was my stillborn daughter. Seeing her heart, still and unmoving, on the ultrasound was bad enough. Holding her, feeling her little hands and seeing her purplish lips and faintly blue fingernails, was far worse. It's been nearly two years and I still have a hard time thinking about it for more than a few minutes at a time.","1280633474"

When we parked the car, there were three or four guys getting off a van with two large bags, but we didn't make anything of it, since there were other businesses around and my dad was in a hurry. After 5 minutes being inside the bank, my dad notices the robbers pointing their guns at the two security guards that worked for the bank. From there they advanced to the manager, who was an old, stubborn man who decided to not comply with the robbers. My dad sat with me on a small bench, placed my head on his lap and covered my eyes, but he was nervous too and did not cover my eyes well, so I peaked through his fingers. The manager took them to the safe and there he was shot for the first time. After gathering the money, they headed to the main area where the old man continue to resist and started throwing trash cans and whatever else he could find at them. So, there, right in front of me, he was shot again and died. There was blood all over the floor and on my jeans. I couldn't sleep for days and every time I see a gun I freak out. ","1280633478"

The main difference between the 2 is the screen size and processing power. The Captivate has a larger screen (gorgeous display) and is definitely more powerful (1Ghz processor compared to 600 MHz) so it might last longer. The Aria is smaller and has a different built-in UI. I got the Captivate, since the specs make it look like it'll last longer until it's outdated, and it's great. I'd go play around with them at an AT&amp;T store if possible, or go try out the Vibrant at the T-Mobile shops (since it's similar to the Captivate) and see if it's what you are looking for.","1280633516"

Edit: For all you downvoters misconstruing my comment, I'm talking about the VM between the language and the OS. I thought this was /r/programming...I'm talking contextually here. fabzter is saying that it runs on Windows and Linux, I'm clarifying it as needing a .NET virtual machine, as the binary would use .NET framework or Mono to run it on a compatible virtual machine.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Anyway, having extra income will lower the unhealthy population by having less overworked people, less consumption of cheap foods and less people living in poor conditions.

Possibly.  I'm fairly certain that nutrition is behavioral/cultural (the south tends to eat very unhealthy foods).  Once these are learned in the first two decades of life, they're pretty much set.  It might begin to change after a generation or two, but I don't know of any studies that measure change in diet vs income over multiple generations.

&gt; The $15k/yr can be used to pay for commercial health insurance and to get a loan.

I don't think you understand; they're in medicare and medicade because commercial health care insurance is unavailable at any cost (they actively hurt profits no matter what they're charged for insurance).  The only way the $15k is going to be usable towards health care is if they get on a plane and fly to India for treatment.

&gt; [...] I can't be sure [...] probably won't happen [...] Maybe the 103 billion left over can help  [...] I still think income [...]

Assuredly all of this is idle speculation.  I think the feed back questioning how you would force this to happen is particularly relevant.  Most of the status quo is the result of decades and decades of work toward regulatory capture.  It's a finely tuned systems for those who ""represent"" and the others who herd the ""representatives"".  Finally, on the wildly hypothetical  assumption that you are able to facilitate these changes without the barrel of a gun, there's the issue of essentially bribing the populous to get what you want (essentially what the Nazi party did in WWII Germany) and what the implications are for a democracy (I've got a sneaking suspicion that, while it might actually make disaster politics harder, it would also rapidly devalue money to the point where the benefit would become meaningless).

&gt; Thanks for the reply.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Any theories on how existence came to be? How about God? Is there anything else you can say on the fundamental nature of existence?

No theories at all. All I can do is guess because there isn't much evidence to go by. 

&gt;how existence came to be?

That question implies that there was a beginning but what if the universe was always there? That might be a possibility worth of consideration.

&gt;How about God? 

There isn't evidence of a God. The idea to me seems to be too anthropomorphic. I seriously doubt that the universe was made for us or that it was ""made"" or ""designed"" ( it  is anthropomorphic because  man intelligently makes and designs things).

&gt;Is there anything else you can say on the fundamental nature of existence?

Yes, it seems that there is a fundamental truth about the nature of existence. Causality. Action, reaction. Cause and effect. But that comes in direct contradiction with the idea of the universe always been there. Maybe it is always true for us but not for the things that are outside of our own perspective, since we experience time as linear we can always go back to a previous cause. But something tells me that that doesn't seen right outside of our own perception. Even religious people will just tell you if you ask then what was before God, and they will answer God's always been there. It seems that to make it reasonable you always hit the is always been there wall. 

Bottom line, somethings are and somethings are not. You can't have nothing isn't, something is, because then nothing wouldn't be.

The building was the SRP, which is basically where everyone goes pre-deployment to make sure you are qualified - medically, psychologically, financially - for deployment.  There were dentist chairs where they had laid people out and they were covered in blood.  The first responders had dragged some of the wounded across the floor and there were red streaks everywhere.  Piles of bloody clothes/boots were stacked up against the wall.  Most of the floor was covered in blood, actually.  It looked like a scene out of a zombie movie.

Possibilities:
- Successful landing, nothing to see here.
- NASA very adeptly faked it, Russia was fooled as well
- Faked, Russia is wise to the scam, but lacks adequate proof.
- Faked, Russia has the proof.  Makes a sweet deal in exchange for silence.
-Faked, Russia can prove, but diplomacy prevails and Russia avoids any tit-for-tat publicity.

Religion is still very important in many important parts of the society, especially in politics and the media. We can't forget that the country is also a monarchy, and it has strong bonds with the Catholic Church.

This year, the Pope is coming to visit the north, and in 2011, he's visiting for the World Youth thing.

I have also noticed that many people become more conservative in some ways as they age.  

I think part of why a lot of change is hindered is because we rely on a two party system.  I would love to elect someone who is socially liberal and fiscally conservative, but it seems impossible.  Often times parties will take advantage of one another when it comes to passing legislation.  It just seems to me that both parties are a lump of many ideals and traditions, and there is little wiggle room.  I think more varied party options would detract from voting ""along party lines"", and give voters a more encompassing platform for choosing their leaders.  IMO a two party system is one party away from a dictatorship.   ","1280633692"

Current law

""Most of the lawsuits have been filed under the post-Valdez Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Although that statute caps a company's liability to a total of $75 million, it holds the firm responsible for paying unlimited cleanup and environmental restoration costs. However, if victims' attorneys can prove that BP and the others were willfully negligent, the liability cap comes off and the companies have to pay what the court orders.""

BP already knows it is going to have to pay out a ton of money is law suits outside the initial $75 million liability. This doesn't include the cleanup costs BP is going to end up paying.

""Filing of lawsuits has tapered off since last month's announcement of an out-of-court program for settling claims from a $20-billion fund established by BP. But if claimants despair of that process, they could abandon it and turn to the courts.""","1280633716"

Screw Jefferson. The amount of people who ""quote"" Jefferson in a biblical manner is mind boggling.

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's the thing -- we shouldn't be subscribing to ""today's Republican standards,"" because todays so-called Republican standards aren't even really Republican in the true sense of the word. You have to dig a bit into history (back when Republican meant Republican) to find the good old boys -- Roosevelt, and Grant and Ike as you mentioned. It's just extremely frustrating that the retard talking heads of the Republican Party dissuade so much of the intelligent portion of the country (particularly young people) into thinking that all of their whack-job ideas are Republican. It makes people dismissive of what could be some great ideas. Small government can mean a lot of things that we younger folk would like to see -- legalized marijuana (both for governmental profit and personal enjoyment), net neutrality passed (old school Republicans for the most part subscribed to the idea that if you're not hurting anyone, you should have the freedom to do it). Ignore the Sarah Palins and Glenn Becks, and look back at what REAL republicans have to say (TJ, the aforementioned presidents, etc.). I guess in my mind a true Republican is one that follows the ideals of the Republican party from its inception, not this bullshit being thrown around today. I totally agree that this ""new crop"" of today needs a total overhaul -- let's get back to the principles of real Republicanism so that the party can earn some of the respect and dignity back that the Sarah Palins have helped destroy.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I emphatically implore you to check out Lee Burridge. He leans more to the minimal side of techno but he is an absolute legend. If you enjoy that there is a treasure chest full of quality minimal tech signed to Richie Hawtin's Min-s label - highlights include Magda, Richie himself, Troy Pierce and Heartthrob. 

If minimal isn't doing it for you, check out Sven Vath - he is probably a more rounded techno DJ that tends to appeal to a housier crowd as well as the tech-heads. Carl Craig, Adam Beyer, Luke Slater and Derrick Carter are all safe bets as well. All of the aforementioned  DJs tour fairly regularly so if you enjoy what you hear you should be able to see them live. 

One last recommendation would be Jeff Mills - truth be told he is becoming a little less relevant as of late, but for an absolute monster night out with some proper classics he is almost without equal.

Hope you enjoy your discovery of techno, if you want anymore recommendations give me a shout.

"Metal","t5_2qhud","I'm an out of shape middle-class white teenage male with long hair and a closet full of black band tees.  I am of above-average intellect (not to sound like a pompous douche, but it's the truth), but people occasionally this less of me because of my appearance.  I openly call myself a metalhead, despite the fact that I listen to electronic music, country, blues, classical, and even some rap.  I go to every concert I can, make it a point to buy at least a shirt from one band while there, and I have forgotten more about metal history than a person should ever know.

As far as a spiritual/philosophical connection to the music, I do feel a strong bond to metal.  It helped turn my life around, pulled me out of a crippling depression, and has given me the confidence I needed to be the person I always wanted (but was too scared) to be.  I've pulled a lot of who I am from this music, but not in the stereotypical way- I'm a productive member of society, well educated in politics (thanks Megadeth for sparking an interest), religion (thanks, every metal band ever), and human nature in general, and I'm not afraid to speak my mind when it needs to be spoken.

The point is, I see a lot of people going both ways in here, some meeting somewhere in the middle.  No answer is wrong or detrimental, so long as you're not taking it to *either* extreme.  If you're so proud of your music that you won't cut your hair, shave your beard, and otherwise make yourself presentable to potential employers, you're doing it wrong.  Conversely, if you're too ashamed/afraid to admit you like metal to people- employers, friends, family, etc.- you're missing the point of the music.

Live it to the extent you wish to live it; just don't live it because you think you *should*.  Do it because it's who you are and how you wish to be viewed.","1280633817"

* Pay bills on time

She had no aspirations beyond these simple goals. She would say funny things all the time. Things that showed she didn't really know how some of the more complex things worked.

As an example, one time we were watching a rented video and at the beginning of the video it said ""This film has been edited to fit your TV screen.""

Of course, I agree the dog is able to bring the man down, but I don't think that is where our fight ends.  If you've ever watched a MMA fight, the large majority of those fights end up on the ground at some point.  That's just a position from which we can still fight and continue to inflict a great amount of damage.  From there I think a fight could go either way, with neither party walking away without some injury.

So to answer the OP's question, as any good law student would say, it depends.  But I would also like to mention that I think a 140 kg man, could beat a trained attack dog if he really felt his life depended on it.

Consider going twilight council or stargate instead of robotics in some games depending on what your opponent is going (blink stalkers or phoenix/warprays can be good), or just go 4 gateways instead of a higher tier tech. Make sure you're only going one of the 4 options though.
You can get your first gas later and your 2nd gas earlier than you mentioned, and you should for the 2nd gas.
Get warpgate research as soon as possible (including chrono boosting the research). A good time to push is right when it is finished because if you went for example 4 gatesways thats 4 units being instantly produced and if you proxy a pylon thats 4 more by the time you get there.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","People change how they speak to fit in, and people change how they speak to add a layer of abstraction to what they say. When in character, a person can say anything he wants, and it will never feel as if ""he"" has revealed anything truly candid, or exposed any weaknesses. Emotions (which can be weaknesses or weaknesses to social strategy), in particular, are easily masked by the way one speaks.

For example, I used a formal tone to write that last paragraph, to show how I can hide behind a certain kind of words. It doesn't mean you were fooled by it, but I didn't have to directly reveal anything about myself, or the fact that *I* have used vocal affectations as a crutch. I just tried to sound like I had some authority without telling you how I could know that. This is writing, so it's not the exact phenomenon, but the affectations I use in writing *feel* like the ones I use in speech, so I guess that other writers are doing the same thing.

When I was younger I spoke like whatever people I hung around, and it was always a convenient, comfortable act. I used the appropriate subcultural slang or mannerisms so that I would fit in and feel comfortable enough to espouse my real opinions. In other words, talking about the kinds of thoughts I had seemed too weird, so I masked it by acting like I was a grunge rocker or a pretentious indie snob or artist or whatever we were doing in the 90s. I needed that crutch to feel comfortable enough to speak my mind.

I still do it here on reddit, where I sometimes fall into the habit of talking like I wandered over from 4chan, because that's a popular way to talk here. My opinions don't change, and my viewpoints are all still firmly mine, but I can mask all the emotional biases and failures of reasoning that have come to make up my sometimes great and sometimes not so great world view.

Practically everyone I know who's 50-70 right now talks about pretty much the same thing: ""My taxes are too high, my house should be worth more, my gas costs too much, my neighborhood is being overrun with brown people, and the government that gave me everything when I was a kid can now do nothing right and should be disbanded, except for social security. By the way, did you hear about that lawsuit that they're filing against Obamacare? Excuse me, I have to pay my absurdly low premium for my healthcare which is either unavailable to younger workers or is subsidized by the government.""

I don't think we should fool ourselves into thinking that Millenials are per se morally superior to their parents. It's really about economics. The Boomers were easily able to attain a level of nuclear family autonomy that Millenials cannot attain. In fact, in states like California they've basically voted themselves into a kind of aristocracy through regressive tax policies and the wanton gutting of the local schools and communities. Therefore, Millenials must rely more on their communities and peers.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Buy things that fit you well, and try everything on before purchasing. Often places have sales, by that I don't mean buying something just because its on sale, but actually look for things that you like and fits you well. You can still buy t-shirts and jeans, but maybe upgrade a little spend a bit more money on plain well fitted t-shits, and the same for jeans. I suggest american apparel or alternative apparel. Build off of that. Start small and start gradually adding things that are a little different, and things that you find stylish. One tip I wish everyone would follow is DON'T BUY ON THE SAME DAY. What I do is I go sort of window shopping trying things on at various different stores, and I sleep on it. I let a few days pass, and if I still remember an item of clothing I'll go back and look at it and re-try it on. If then I'm satisfied I will make a purchase. Another thing I do is wait for things to go on sale, but that's just me being frugal. ","1280633975"

Madison's Virginia Plan involved proportional representation, which would have favored large states such as his. Smaller states protested when they (rightfully, IMO) foresaw the potential of tyranny, resulting in the compromise. 

The states are sovereign and joined together under the federal government, and *the states themselves have rights* as guaranteed by the Constitution. The state governments need a way to interact with the federal government, just like the people have a way via the House. (Also, the states are not people, but they represent the people who live there, right?) Thus, the senate was created to represent the states, and it was not meant to represent the people equally. This also creates a check between the two congressional houses, and both houses must approve in order for legislation to be passed.","1280633994"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Longer breaths help because of the ""dead air"" space in the regulator - if your breaths are overly short, too much oxygen gets drawn into the regulator and then expelled when you breath out, without you getting a chance to absorb it. At the same time, a lot of the air you breathe in will be air which you just breathed out but didn't get past the regulator. This is actually a bigger problem with snorkels, although there it is just a matter of getting enough fresh air into your lungs with each breath, rather than depleting a tank.

The only other thing is remaining calm and avoiding unnecessary exertion. Note that the breaths should be deep but slow, which hopefully helps you relax. The shark trying to bite your leg off can interfere with the relaxation though. ","1280634034"

Or secondly, much later:

Waking up to answer the phone early one morning, to find it was my dad calling me on his mobile phone, telling me to come into the kitchen, where I found him lying in a pool of blood after he lost consciousness and massively cut his head open (read: ripped skin off skull) due to a metastasized tumor in his neck cutting off circulation. He had terminal lung cancer and knew going to the hospital would be a one-way trip and all down hill from there onwards.

I called the ambulance and propped him up against the kitchen wall, gave him ""the last cigarette he would ever have"" (his words) as we waited for them to arrive.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Here's how I see this, and BTW, I agree with both your premises above.
Imagine a big jet up in the air. This jet is designed only to fly, never to land. Every 4 months there are elections for captain. There are two political factions vying for control. Mr. Obama gets elected on a platform of change. People don't want to be flying anymore, they want to be traveling underwater. Obama promises a big nice submarine. Change and hope!

He wins in a landslide, gets sworn in, and enters the cockpit. The first mate (or whatever the title is of the person actually flying the god damn jet) asks ""where do you want us to fly captain?"".

You see, it's a jet, not a submarine. You can't make a submarine out of it, and since it isn't designed to land, you can't get out and build a submarine. The closest he can get to fulfilling his promises is to crash the jet into the ocean, and if he tries that, the people actually flying the jet would declare him crazy, and stop him one way or another.

What we have is a system that is designed to do certain things. You can't make it do what it isn't designed to do, and our system isn't designed for peace. It isn't designed for power to the people. It isn't designed for transparency. These very things would destroy the system, and therefore Obama, despite all the good will he may have had simply cannot do them.","1280634107"
