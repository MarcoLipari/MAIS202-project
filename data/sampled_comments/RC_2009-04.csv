The only difference between a cult and a religion is that the majority consider that particular brand of religious belief to be 'nuts' and the majority's own brand of religion to be acceptable. 

To an atheist/agnostic, believing that god had sex with a virgin who then gave birth to his son so he could die so god could forgive us and then god could resurrect his son might seem a bit nutty, and therefore a cult instead of a religion.

Dont get me wrong - i think the people in this cult/religion are nut jobs/sadistic/stupid beyond belief and something should be done with them. But their beliefs are as valid or invalid as any of the more mainstream religions since you can not prove they are wrong, or right.

1) In that case you were either going too fast for conditions, and should have been proceeding at a pace that would have allowed you to react to the lane change, or were not properly aware of the flow of traffic to know that granny was there and the need to prepare for her to be stupid was a real one.

2) The fact that you were negligent does not, in and of itself, absolve the other driver of blame in the situation. Granny clearly failed to check her mirrors and blind spots before moving over, which shifts some of the blame off you and onto her. Not all of it, since you're still supposed to be paying attention to weird conditions and responding to them (and, presuming you weren't speeding, this condition is definitely weird) in a way that allows you to react to prevent a crash.","1238544034"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","That is a valuable question, thank you. 

It is, like all good questions, hard to answer. 

If one seeks no criticism and provides no criticism, perhaps merely proffering an alternative for discussion, or answering a direct question, then there seems to no call to make fun of them. 

 If someone is providing an explanation, or continuing a discussion in a civil manner, then there seems to be little reason to downmod them, and less still to attack them. 

 A degree of civility is all that is required, indeed it is such a small measure of respect that its consistent abscence is all the more glaring. 

 These things are often about basic etiquette and reddiquette, rather than some complex inter-belief-system code of behaviour. 

 
 Often I see questions submitted to this subreddit, asking for the best way to counter some argument, this is of course a good way for younger members to obtain valuable insight, however all too often it descends into a self congratulatory contest to see who can most completely dismiss an opposing viewpoint in the most condescending and aggressive manner.  

 I suppose that in large part I am questioning the motivation of many of these arguments. Are the arguments meant to convince a fellow human with a differing viewpoint, or are they to reproach, discredit and deride and *opponent*?","1238544040"

Superior is also a difficult word to put to good use. I am definitely more logical and more moral in my beliefs than any Christian (by definition). 

There is no evidence at all for Christ's existence, and the teachings of the bible are stationary and very out of date. 

I can accept reality for what it is and logically assess any situation without the supernatural involving itself. I can also adjust my morals to the situation they are to be applied in and endeavor to improve them as I learn and grow.

&gt;Kennedy was, according to unproven rumours, an importer of alcoholic drinks from Canada into the USA during Prohibition. After Prohibition ended, Kennedy consolidated an even larger fortune when his company, Somerset Importers, became the exclusive American agent for Gordon's Dry Gin and Dewar's Scotch. Anticipating the end of Prohibition, he assembled a large inventory of stock, which he later sold for a profit of millions of dollars when Prohibition was repealed in 1933. He invested this money in residential and commercial real estate in New York, and Hialeah Race Track in Hialeah, Florida. His most important purchase was the largest office building in the country, Chicago's Merchandise Mart, which gave his family an important base in that city and an alliance with the Irish-American political leadership there.

In your example:

    * Therefore it has rained a lot.

This just isn't how science works. It would be more like:

    * When it rains a lot, the street floods.
    * I walk out of my house this morning and the street is flooded.
    * Therefore it MAY HAVE rained a lot. Seek more evidence. (Oh, the trees are dripping water and all the roofs are wet too? Or, the trees and roof are both dry...maybe someones sprinkler head broke?) 

In your example, you put the hypothesis LAST, not FIRST, so of course you ended up with a logical fallacy. So I am willing to admit that your ignorant misunderstanding of the scientific method is a logical fallacy.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Shall we review the definitions of Communism and Socialism? It would seem such a venture would be in order, especially in such baseless claims as ""socialism = loss of liberty""

First lets begin with communism, the big baddie. From the definition of Mr. Marx, undiluted by later power hungry autocrats hammering it to justify their rule:

* Communism is a socioeconomic structure and political ideology that promotes the establishment of an egalitarian, classless, stateless society based on common ownership and control of the means of production and property in general.

Communism is best characterized as the high minded ideal while socialism (see the following) is the attempt to create a practical application of said ideal. Socialism is much less well defined, representing various approaches and idealogical attempts to reach or create communism.

* Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating public or state ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and a society characterized by equality for all individuals, with a fair or egalitarian method of compensation.

We must also not forget that under pure capitalism slavery would be an easily accepted practice, the pursuit of profit would rule all else. Elevating those blessed by fortune to high status and casting everyone else before the grindstone of industry. 

What is worse, To be told you are free at every opportunity, but to be denied a descent life for want of gold or to live a good life, lacking a few freedoms only desired by those who would oppress you?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","German inflation was caused by WW1 fallout.

American arrogance is caused by our status as the single superpower and by far richest nation. All our global dominance and prosperity actually makes us lazy and dumb. Things like outsourcing eventually means your outsourcing innovation also. Germans were desperate and crushed after WW1.

American are in a completely different state of mind. A major change is corporate power and consolidation of that power. We used to have seperations of media and financial markets. We allowed them to consolidate for profit and in doing so they lost their integrity.

Think about it, a consolidated media is a weapon of mass control all in itself. We've gone from 80 major TV networks to 6. Capitalism and democracy both rely on the informed citizen. If media can lie to the masses they can bypass both of these core principles. The core problem is the rich using corporations to take power and money from the lower classes. They are sidestepping the democratic process using powers given to them by that very process because they make so much more money than politicians.  

The growing wealth gap will prove to have many nasty faces. Individual wealth is going down as it is consolidated into the hands of fewer and fewer people. That is the core problem and it will destabilize the nation without a doubt. History shows wealth gaps cause class warfare just about every time. We cannot be the land of freedom and opportunity with an out of control wealth gap. We are becoming surfs and indentured servants again as the aristocracy shows off it's new brand names. 

That, my friend, is the problem. 

I believe the boom and bust cycle obviously applies to basic mentality and culture. If you reward a dumb animal over and over for doing less and less, it becomes lazier and lazier. Mankind is little more than a dumb animal. Long periods of prosperity are followed by fiscal and commonly intellectual busts. War and periods of hardship commonly mark the fastest progress and highest productivity. People don't merely come together, rather the basic core goal of the brain, survivability, reacts most efficiently to negative stimulus. We like bad news, we learn from our mistakes, and history is filled with horrific events followed by bursts of enlightenment. At the core the earth itself and all it's organisms (most of which are extinct) were shaped by a series of disasters. Had earth been a paradise of positive stimulus evolution would probably not have created as complex life. You need to basically wipe out the planet a few times and each time you get more complex life with more survivability.  If food is plentiful you don't learn how to hunt or needs tools. It's hardship that builds nations and minds, not living the high life. We've lived the high life basically since the end of ww2 and it's time to pay for our arrogance. People need bad times every so often to kick them in their ass and make them remember why you don't blindly hand more and more power over to less and less people. They learn efficiency and minimalism again. They learn community and harder work ethics. All the lessons of hardship make us stronger while endless money markets posting pseudo-profits drain real industry, work ethic and innovation. People are now far more aware and want heads to roll, that in itself is a huge improvement. I've been watching the home market with dread since 99 because.. does it take a lot of economic expertise to see rent and mortgage rates outpacing salary like mad. You don't need reasoning at that point, you are observing a sure sign of a coming bust when real estate is doubling while wage is stagnant. But homeowners liked the new found equity and had little protest, thousands of other industries boomed also and the psedo-money came rolling in making the economy look invincible, unless of course the impossible happens... deflation. Then the house of debt cards collapses. If you have a 30:1 debt ration like some of these banks and the market deflates 10% you just lost 3 times more money than you actually have. You are triple bankrupt with margins like that. It leads back to an arrogant belief that these markets were too solid to post major losses and real estate always goes up.. even when you are artificially inflating it with low interest rates for a decade.

The Web should function perfectly normally in response to 98 or 99% of HTTP requests. Only one or two percent of requests should actually trigger one of your ""special effects"", and then the proxy should decide at random which special effect it's going to apply. With luck, it's going to take quite a while before people cop on to things; especially since if they load a page and it weirdly looks ever so subtly blurry, the blurriness will be gone as soon as they reload the page. 

For added hijinx (but decreased productivity), make the ""special effects"" become increasingly frequent as the end of the workday draws closer... 

If you want to be really clever you could set up your proxy so that on the dot at closing time all the other shenanigans will stop -- except now there's a 50% probability that HTTP GET requests get redirected to this thread...","1238544652"
"environment","t5_2qh1n","I was thinking about all the little changes I had made - and even though they were pretty minor, I realized that if I multiplied that by a few million other people it would be pretty significant.

Anyway -

1. Reduced my commute from 1 hour to 30 min by moving closer to work (this was in 2006). Started carpooling a few times a week as well. So I figure I cut my fuel consumption by more than half.

2. Recycle at least 30 percent of all household waste. We have a once a week ""single source"" pickup. Usually put a tall trash can of recyclables and one large ""kitchen bag"" of non-recyclables (diapers, etc)

3. Compost all of my kitchen waste (except for meat/dairy). I do this religiously. I am actually very proud of my compost pile. Started this a year ago - so I have a a 4X4 bin full to use as a base for this years garden.

4. In the middle of winter we were able to reduce our power bill by at least 20% by keeping the thermostat at 68 degrees Fahrenheit. It was chilly in the house sometimes but nothing a sweater/sweat pants couldn't handle. In the summer we did the same with AC. Mostly not using it at all. When we did use it - we had it set for 72.

5. Have been pretty religious about keeping lights/appliances off when not in use. All lightbulbs are compact florescents. This has been for a few years now.

6. Have had a very small garden for a few years now (live in a townhouse with a pretty small backyard). This year hope to have a bumper crop with my hard earned compost. Bought a bunch of heirloom seeds - tomatoes, cucumbers, squash, zucchini, sweet and hot peppers and some peas. And some herbs (unfortunately not the THC type).

7. We have always washed our clothes in cold water for as long as I can remember - so I'm not sure if it is a ""change"" - but I'll include it.

8. Last year started the recycling program at work. ~50 people, lots of meetings - we recycle literally tons of glass, cans, and paper.

9. We try to buy organic when possible - it's actually more of a taste thing. I try to avoid organics if they come from halfway around the world. We started going to the farmers market last year - just a few times and didn't do any major shopping though. Hope to do a lot more of that this year.


So those are some of the things that immediately come to mind. Almost seems pointless when you think about it at the individual level - but if 20% of Americans made similar changes that would be very significant. And these changes have been pretty painless and some are actually fun (gardening and composting ftw!)

By the way, a central tenet of Catholicism is the transfiguration of the Eucharist - this is where the communion host actually becomes the flesh of Jesus during the mass. Let me repeat that - Catholics believe that the communion host changes to the flesh of Jesus during mass. I was brought up Catholic and somehow missed this point in Sunday school. When I got married my wife brought this up and I nearly shit my pants when I found out it was true. After that I couldn't go to mass anymore - all the incense, sprinkling magic water and chanting seemed just a little too silly. And to top it all off we were practicing cannibalism (and according to the teaching of the church REAL cannibalism) while worshiping a zombie god. During the few masses I was able to sit through I can remember watching the priest thinking ""Come on man, you have a university degree...you don't really believe this stuff.""

So long as you don't have an inferiority complex and know how a computer works, there is no disadvantage to saving money and buying a perfectly functional, high-powered PC over the more expensive Mac version of the same hardware.

If, on the other hand, you're buying a first computer for your rich grandma and don't want to teach her how to avoid viruses and spyware and how to use AdBlock, then sure, go ahead and get her the Mac and feel no shame about it.  It *is* harder to break, and I'll freely give you that.

But the tool comparison doesn't quite hold up.  In this case, the person buying the tool in question has absolutely no idea how to use, let's say, jackhammers.  The cheap jackhammer is a big, noisy powerhorse with no stability control, a long and difficult to understand manual, and a small On/Off button.  The expensive jackhammer is svelte and pretty, does all of the jackhammering for you, has sensors to make sure it isn't trying to pound through something that will break it, doesn't require a manual at all, and has a big shiny button that does everything.

Anyone who knows a damned thing about using a jackhammer will pick up the cheap one and use it properly and safely for the rest of their life with no problems.

However, someone who has no business jackhammering at all can pick up the more expensive one, try to plow through titanium and get a warning not to.  Their jackhammer will then pounce off and knock through some concrete while whistling a pretty tune.

Clearer on the real differences yet?  If you're a grown up and can take care of your electronics, there's no downside to Windows.  If you need your hand held, buy the Mac, pay the tax, and don't complain when snooty Unix sysadmins call you a retard for not wanting to spend your whole time writing bash scripts and compiling Linux by hand using nothing but notepad++ and a stick of gum.","1238544807"

It's like eating too much and getting fat and then realizing your fat rather than apply some common sense and stop eating before you reach obese status. Why do humans do that to themselves? We don't naturally show too much inhibition especially as a herd. When times are good people live high and when times are bad they cut back. I suppose we mimic our environment like that. When your tribe finds ripe hunting areas, they camp until it's gone. You don't just take what you need and keep moving, you opportunistically horde and engorge. So.. mans natural state given surplus product is to burn through it as fast as possible. Money, food, woman, drugs, tv whatever you got in a 24/7 cycle until lack of sustainability catches up. Given a surplus supply we waste until our partying catches up to us. All in all we were taught this behavior by things like seasonal changes which forced us to horde during the good seasons, get fat, store food and wait out the deadly winter.

Firstly I would like to point out that 

a) communism is the redistribution of all wealth to all people equally. 

b) capitalism is wealth concentrated in the hands of those who produce it or can otherwise obtain it.

c) socialism is a mixture of the two. 

As such, there has never been a true communist state and there has never been a true capitalist state. If you pay any tax whatsoever, then you are not in a true capitalist society.

 It should also be pointed out that while communism results in a loss of potential reward for those who would benefit in capitalism, conversely capitalism results in a loss of potential reward for those who would benefit from communism. If you wish to discuss the relative loss of liberty in both cases then we would need to examine the quantity of people benefiting and losing in each case. Given that the majority of people earn less than the average, in communism less people stand to lose potential reward or ""Liberty"" as you put it, all though those few that do lose out will lose out by a massive degree.  

 Furthermore, as you currently exist in a capitalistic socialist society, do you see the ridiculousness of claiming to have ""defeated socialism""?","1238545004"

I manage a small team in a fast-paced environment. One of my guys has General Anxiety Disorder which has been well under control by medication until recently. I'm not sure what the trigger was (I don't think work related), but recently he's been having a lot of trouble. His work quality has gone way down, he often says things he shouldn't (e.g. a joke that goes too far), he's constantly shaking his leg, and his voice often quivers.

I was wondering: as this person's boss, what can I do to help him get through this? I'd like him to stay working and productive, obviously, but first I want to be sure he does what he needs to do for himself. Is there anything I can say, any technique I can use, to help him out?

Because you know how to beat other people into making you money or otherwise being subservient, it doesn't actually mean that you're doing well. For all of someone like Limbaugh's talk of ""achievers"", ""freedom"", and ""true Americans"", what they ultimately laud is the what they feel is the righful place of some in dominion over others.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt;    Q : Why is the TCK useful?
&gt;    A : It allows independent implementations to demonstrate that they
&gt;        are compatible with the specification, and as a result,
&gt;        receive all the ""necessary IP"" from expert group members.
&gt;
&gt;    Q : What is ""necessary IP"" and why is this important that
&gt;        compatible implementations receive it?
&gt;    A : ""Necessary IP"" is the IP - usually patents - that cannot be
&gt;        technically avoided when implementing the specification.  This
&gt;        is important because it prevents anyone from joining an expert
&gt;        group and gaining the ability to demand royalties from
&gt;        implementors or users of the specification.  This is one of
&gt;        the main features of the JCP that makes the specs the JCP

"religion","t5_2qh39","The first thing that I would say is that MOST of the horrible things in the world are the result of man being inhumane to man.  It's not something you can lay at the feet of God.  Even the horrible things that we do ""in the name of God"" cannot be blamed on him, but only on the infallible humans who perpetrate the acts.

We are moral agents, created with free will - as where there is no free will, where there is no choice to obey or disobey, there is no true option to love - and therefore we are responsible for the evil that we do.

Insofar as God allows evil to occur, I'd say that we do look at it through a necessarily limited point of view.  We do not see the end, we do not see outside of the situation.  There are several theological ideas that flow out of the recognition of this fact.

The first is that as we cannot see outside of our situation, we don't always see the redemptive aspect of suffering - being diagnosed with an illness is a chance for us to suffer well - to show others the sustenance that we receive from God.  There is gain to be found in seeing someone suffer through an illness well.

The second thing to be found in this fact is that as we do not see the end, we necessarily do not see the end.  Many ask, why is there evil?  Why doesn't God put a boot on the head of Satan (or destroy evil, or however you want to put it)?  My response, and the response that I think many pastors and theologians would give is that ""God will.""  There is a promise, found all throughout the Bible, that at some point in the future, God will return to put an end to evil, to put an end to sickness, and shame, and death, and war, and all the evil of this world.

The thing about this though, is that if God came to destroy evil tonight, none of us would live to see the dawn.  If God destroyed evil right now, you and I and everyone we know would also be destroyed, because at our root, we are evil.  The line between good and evil does not run between states, and nations and individuals, but rather through the middle of every man's heart.

So, by God not destroying evil now, he allows more and more people to come to repentance.  Look at the narrative of Noah.  God told Noah to build an ark so that those who had been redeemed, those who had repented of their evil, could be saved.  How long did it take between God's command to build the ark and the flood actually occurring?  Hundreds of years.  God allowed that time to pass so that men could repent of their evil and also be saved.

I hope this at least gives you a starting point to see the response - I've obviously not been exhaustive in describing the Christian view of evil and suffering, but I assure you, if you read and listen to the better thinkers - authors like Lewis, Packer, Grudam, Kline, and Stott, and preachers and teachers like Piper, Driscoll, Chandler, Keller, and countless others, you'll hear very compelling reasons to see that a just God can still allow suffering, FOR A TIME.","1238545266"

If a person encounters something they have no experience with - something they have never seen before - they may not see it at all. This phenomenon was experienced by Native Americans who did not see foreign ships coming towards them - as they had no frame of reference for it. 

Sight is all about neural connections to the brain - we only 'see' what we believe to be true, then turn these patterns into imagery based on a common frame of reference. So, even in a physical sense, reality is just perception. One person's experience/reality can be completely different than another's. 

Likewise, some people can hear different frequencies than others - those that cannot hear the sounds believe there is nothing. So, yes, reality is subjective based on your experience, frame of reference, culture, and natural abilities.

That people give up, sell out and compromise their principles when they become ""adult"" today is no argument against her ideals.

Her non-fiction works presents the philosophy behind her fiction. Among other things, she advocates selfishness as a virtue and defends it with logical arguments that anyone can understand. This ethic is so far from the culturally dominant ethic it necessarily gets (intentionally and unintentionally) distorted, denounced and misconstrued.  She once commmented that a book called *The Ayn Rand Lexicon* would be a good thing because then people could look up ""babies"" and see she does not advocate eating them for breakfast.

Why create ""supplemental"" synonym site?

1. I couldn't find ANY synonym site that showed synonyms for ""GPU"", ""quad core"", etc.. whereas in Synons.com  you can find 43(!) synonyms (from Wikipedia) for that word. http://synons.com/gpu
2. All those synonym sites show a lot of 'ye old English' words like ""lewd"", which nobody uses, Wikipedia's editors don't seem to have this problem.
3. For PPC: This is good for pay-per-click and seo, just look at how much meanings ""solar panel"" has and you have millions more variations of ""diy solar panel"" phrase to promote some famous ClickBank program. http://synons.com/solar_power
4. For SEO: Obviously can be used to ""spinoff"" your keyphrases.
5. It also shows all the meanings this word can take, like ""bikini"" - 2 meanings (atoll and clothing). 3rd one is a duplicate (due to redirect on Wikipedia). http://synons.com/bikini
6. It's based on Wikipedia (which is awesome place to dig for information!) Wikipedia is evergrowing, this can be too (assuming they update the xml dump). 
7. -- Here's a question: WHY? -- Because I can! (Paraphrased from ""The Big Bang Theory"")

No. I said they weren't the same, but that doesn't automatically make them antonyms. Minds can be intelligent.

OK. Re reading your comment a bit, I think I know where you are going (though I would have preferred you to either be more clear in your questions or to have stated it outright). I can say this- I agree that ""the mind"" doesn't exist if ""mind"" means something with no biological basis. 

But I don't think the mind and ""intelligence"" are synonymous- I think we can have a biological basis for intelligence, and that what people typically call ""the mind"" does exist, is intelligent, but nothing about it runs contrary to, or outside of, the known laws of physics or biology. And it that respect its not what people generally think of as a ""mind"".

Yes, a year is like a day in God's eyes, but wouldn't it be more fair, more just, to see time through our eyes? Say I had a son, and a 1 second to me was like 10 years for him. I would never allow him to be hurt, even for just a second, because I know it's longer and more excruciating for him. Why doesn't God see it this way?

&gt; If God destroyed evil right now, you and I and everyone we know would also be destroyed, because at our root, we are evil.
If I am really evil, God can by all means destroy me. The less evil in the world, the better. I'd think that someone who is supposed to be even more fair and more loving than I am would agree.

&gt; God allowed that time to pass so that men could repent of their evil and also be saved.

Doesn't God know whether or not someone is going to repent? And besides, if Hitler or Stalin were alive today and apologized, it wouldn't be at all just to let them off the hook and let them enjoy an eternity of paradise. 

The rest of what you said doesn't really answer my question. You haven't been able to justify God sitting on his butt for the past 5,000 years, and I still see no reason to. And he doesn't even have to destroy anyone, just help people. Why can't he throw a loaf of bread to starving kids in Africa every once in a while?","1238546078"

Secondly, the cartels will not be out of business.  NEWSFLASH!! cartels are smugglers, period.   They smuggle whatever is most profitable for them, whether it's drugs, humans, sex-slaves, weapons, or fake commercial goods.  Even if drugs were legal they would STILL be smuggled in to avoid the taxes.  

Lastly, the legalization of marijuana would REALLY help the tobacco industry get back on their feet after all this negativity due to lung cancer.  I mean they already have the manufacturing and distribution networks in place to capitalize immediately.  So home-grow operators with get rich quick schemes of immediate wealth floating through their heads should pull them out of their asses and accept the reality of what drug legalization would actually entail and accomplish.","1238546330"

The way companies like Sony work, it's not like they decide to put a certain amount of money into a project like Home and choose not to fund something else. Sony is clearly dedicated to the Playstation brand and are pushing hard to make it more popular. They're thinking longterm and not worrying about making a profit in the coming year. The last thing you should be worrying about is how much money they're spending.

All Littlebigplanet was at the start was a physics based platformer centered around creation. It was a make or break project, if the community didn't create levels it was going to die very quickly. Sony made sure it worked and was a polished product and launched a huge marketing campaign so that everyone knew about it. There was a story recently about how Lionhead Games gave up on Littlebigplanet. Good thing Sony poured money into it, and it's not our money so why not just sit back and wait to reap the rewards when they appear.","1238546339"

Also, the hypothesis is never proven...only not falsified.

I only discovered House MD existed less than two years ago. Thankfully they've been running the crap out of House reruns on various cable channels, so that now I think I've seen almost every episode ever made (I might still be missing one or two, maybe).


All that saturation has left me somewhat sated now, and so not so 'hungry' for more House episodes as I once was. So I'm becoming 'jaded' on the series. Maybe you are too. I can't honestly say the show's quality has changed-- I think I've just reached an equilibrium of satisfaction, and wouldn't mind seeing some fresh new series start up somewhere instead.


BUT...even in my present state, if you force me to surf TV channels to find alternatives to House MD that are anywhere near as good, I can't. Because they just aren't there. In my opinion, even LOST is a distant second to House in terms of the entertainment value of average House to average LOST episode.

Why? If John is never born, skynet will never have to send a terminator to kill him.

If skynet never sends a terminator to kill him, the t-800 will never be destroyed. If it is never destroyed, its chip will never be discovered by cyberdine.

If its chip is never discovered, they won't base a system that becomes skynet off of it.

There will never be a time-loop of destruction because syknet simply won't exist to continue it. The loop would simply end.

All this for the life of John Connor's mother before he's born.

If skynet succeeded in the first moive, it would cease to be in all future timelines.","1238546574"

J: But nay, their tongues, for speech and taste alike
   Are strange to ours, with their own history:
   Gaul knoweth not a cottage from a house.

V: What say they then, pray?

J: Hachis Parmentier.

You are not required to understand.  Your opinion of their choice of vehicle is irrelevant.

Apologies if I came off overly harsh in my earlier post.  At the end of the day, my point was this - there needs to be a balance between personal choice and the collective good of society.  

I completely agree with you that most hummers are bought because it's a status symbol.  Of course, that's also a huge reason why people buy Priuses (prii?) - they're more interested in the image the vehicle projects than the actual benefit of the vehicle.  It happens that a prius is better for the collective society than a hummer is, but don't be so quick to deride the value of brand status when it doesn't go your way.

People will always be able to make choices that benefit them personally but are not good for the greater society.  People will always have the option of being selfish, to a certain degree.  I'm not sure any of us would enjoy living in a community where every single decision was dictated by the greater good of society.  Not trying to sound like an ass here, I just wonder how much of us would really enjoy an environment like that...

While many people, including many ""Randites"" have apparently misinterpreted her idea of Rational-self-interest as Hedonistic self-indulgence, it does not change Her philosophy or her intentions. 

In fact Rand herself feared that her Philosophy would be undone by exactly such ""rotters"" as she called them: Those people who claimed to support Objectivism but who had in fact fundamentally misunderstood it and continue to act in direct contradiction to what it stands for.

Rational self interest leads the Wise to the conclusion that helping others is in most cases a very selfish act. Not only does it feel good, it increases your chances of receiving help in your own time of need and increases your positive reputation to others, who are then more likely to trust you, befriend you, trade with you and so on. Also, when enough people adopt this strategy we can significantly reduce the number of hungry, angry, desperate people on the streets. This decreases our chances of being directly harmed by such unfortunate people while at the same time increases the number of happy, satisfied, motivated people who are more likely to invent a better lightbulb, or perhaps provide a better repair service to our homes, or at least pass on such benevolence to another who in turn could provide the kind of resources I have mentioned.

I agree that English is more important, I was just pointing out that coming the situation to being Chinese more important than English, we would pick it up as well. There are some loonies doing so right now when it doesn't make sense (defending it's because of financial reasons and future prosperity of their offsprings, I'm not talking about personal curiosity of circumstances).

I have no idea what's going on in Valencia, frankly. I had no idea the government planned so much really! that's huge, because it's official and public schools in Spain carry a lot of weight.

There is reasoning behind this. A long time ago a few of my friends discussed this subject, and we came up with a general context as to what the call of ""shotgun"" meant. 

The idea behind the original definition of the side seat was because the person sitting there would defend the carriage or whatever with a shotgun. So it seems reasonable to define the shotgun as, instead of the adjacent location, the position most capable of defending the group using a shotgun (normally against zombies). I think you can see where it goes from there.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Actually 'technically' you're wrong. When it comes to defining and naming chords, two frequencies separated by an octave (x and 2x) are considered for all intents and purposes to be the same. This is because when analyzing chords we look at their function and two notes in a given chord in the same octave are always occupying the same function. In fact, it would be logically inconsistent with the way music is written now if this is how we did it. For instance, for instance with a sus4 chord with the suspension in the top voice would you call it a sus4 chord or an 11 chord?. Jazz is similarly consistent in its nomenclature. The ""wookie chord"" would be better called the ""wookie interval"" but to be honest an out of tune minor second produces a lot of beats and therefore sounds unpleasant and has therefore been used by sound designers in literally COUNTLESS others of applications.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Well, there's a saying around Dead circles dating back to the Bill Graham Winterland days...

""They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones who do what they do.""

The thing that really made the Dead's live shows great was that they never went for the easy solution, they always took chances and put themselves out on the plank.  Sometimes they were fantastic and created something wonderful people hadn't heard before; sometimes they fell flat on their face.  It's the nature of improvisational live music.

And I'd argue your opinion that they coasted for a *long* time.  There's a few uninspired periods, mainly after Mickey left the band in the early '70s, and in the period after '78 before Brent Mydland joined the group.  The '80s were a metamorphoses of their sound and created some of the best pieces of music they'd done since 1968.

edit:  To further add to that point...

The 90s were certainly a weak point in their musical history, but you have to understand the circumstances.  At that time, GDM was a $50m a year industry.  There were a lot of mouths to feed, a lot of office and road staff that relied on the Dead touring to make their living.  Jerry was sick and still addicted to drugs, so it was hard for the band to reconcile both situations.  Their solution was to hammer out compacted tours between rehab/hospitalizations and the only time the band ever really played together was when they were on stage.","1238547105"

The Twentieth Amendment repealing prohibition passed Congress in February 1933. It was ratified by the requisite number of states in less than ten months.

The Twenty-first Amendment returned to individual states the power to retain statewide alcohol prohibition, and made it a federal offense to ship alcoholic beverages into a dry state. But the states, too, had learned how impossible it was to keep citizens from drinking. One by one, each repealed its local anti-alcohol legislation, with Mississippi the last state to surrender -- in 1966.""

"obama","t5_1a8ah","Mac N Jacks is a local, small-scale operation, which would result in a higher price even if it were the same quality as Budweiser. But how much would a Budweiser be in a similar restaurant? I'm guessing around $4.50 - so the high quality, small-scale beer is double the cost of the piss water, which doesn't sound outrageous. I've had good beer and bad beer. The good beer is easily worth double the price.

How much is that $9 beer if you bought it in a liquor store instead of a restaurant? High quality beer actually varies a lot in price, so I shouldn't have made it seem so uniform. But your argument seems to be that if beer were criminalized, your $9 beer would be *cheaper*. I can't accept this.

If marijuana were legalized, it would no doubt be cheaper than it currently is. If it weren't cheaper, people would just keep buying the black market stuff. It's relatively easy to grow, so eradicating the black market would be incredibly difficult (just like it is now). The way to get rid of the black market is through competition. People will stop buying from street dealers only when they can go to the local shop and pay less for it. And the local shops will be competing amongst each other for business. People aren't that irrational. They'll buy what's easier and cheaper: the legal stuff.","1238547255"

Almost all communication services are re-sold. For example at my previous job, we sold T1's (that we didn't own) we got the service from Global Crossing, so thats one example of services being ""re sold""

On top of that, we would have customers buy our T1s (which we resold from global crossing at a higher rate) they would run a company, and sell our T1 services to other companies! .

The labels warned that it was strictly for medicinal purposes and any other uses were illegal.

But even so doctors freely wrote these prescriptions and druggists filled them without question, and the number of ""patients"" increased dramatically.

Authorities never really tried to restrict this practice, which was the way many people got their daily dose:

Over a million gallons were consumed per year through these freely given prescriptions.

Because Prohibition banned only the manufacture, sale, and transport--but not possession or consumption--of alcohol, some people and institutions who had bought or made liquor prior to the passage of the 18th Amendment were able to continue to serve it throughout the prohibition period legally.

Even some prominent citizens and politicians later admitted to having used alcohol during Prohibition. ","1238547518"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;OK, now back to abductive reasoning which, you'll recall, is the form of reasoning by which one reasons from observations to statements, theories, et cetera, that explain these observations.

&gt;In case you're inclined to doubt that abductive reasoning plays an essential role in scientific explanation, run the following example statements by professors in the disciplines listed and ask if they're typical of the kinds of arguments made in these disciplines:3

&gt;Physics:
If the universe is expanding, then the electromagnetic waves produced by starlight will be redshifted; the electromagnetic waves produced by starlight are redshifted; therefore, the universe is expanding.

&gt;Geology:
&gt;If a valley was formed by a glacier, then it will probably exhibit lateral and terminal moraines, and an overall U shape; many of the valleys in Colorado's Ten Mile Range are U-shaped and exhibit lateral and terminal moraines; therefore, glaciers formed many of the valleys in Colorado's Ten Mile Range.

&gt;Biology:
&gt;If two species share a recent evolutionary ancestor, then, upon examining them, we should observe many morphological similarities; we observe many morphological similarities between gibbons and orangutans; therefore, gibbons and orangutans share a recent evolutionary ancestor. 

&gt;Chemistry:
&gt;If a composite contains boron, its spectral signature will contain a red spectral line, an orange spectral line and a yellow spectral line; the spectral signature of this composite contains a red spectral line, an orange spectral line and a yellow spectral line; therefore, this composite contains boron.

&gt;In each of these examples, the conclusion explains the observation, and does so either by rendering the observation likely or rendering it necessary. Also, in each of these examples the reasoning proceeds from the observation to the conclusion — i.e., from the observation to a statement that explains the observation. But abductive reasoning is that form of reasoning in which one reasons from an observation to a statement that explains that observation. (This is why it's often referred to as inference to the best explanation.) Hence the arguments in the examples above are all instances of abductive reasoning.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","As far as 'get along' throughout history, there are a number of examples of people not getting along, before and after Christ.  In the modern U.S. society, plenty of people do not 'get along.'

There are instincts towards peace, those of paternal instincts, where one wants a safe world to raise one's children.  That is common through eastern, western, middle eastern, and African cultures.  In the U.S., those morals have come directly or indirectly from the Judeo-Christian moral ethic.

How often are morals betrayed though?  

Is not the history of the world a majority of violence and oppression?

And with what is going on in the U.S. and the world right now, has there been any real moral progression?  No.

You have to understand, the Homo Sapien has been around for approximately 200,000 years.  Civilization has been around for a little over 3,000 years.  Compare those numbers.

It is not just scarcity that leads individuals towards violence, as many idealists would have us believe.  The vikings did not rape and pillage because they were starving.

Man before civilization was very violent, only the most aggressive survived, the less aggressive perished.   

So if you are born outside of civilization, you would need to be told not to kill your neighbor.  And even if you were born within society, you could still kill your neighbor, it will happen several times today across that United States.

And this country is still a majority Christian nation.  The history of Christianity in this country is quite remarkable, and to deny its influence on atheists' moral code is ignorant.","1238547616"

You also are only arguing that *there exists* some form of neglect that the government should legally prohibit, not that 'not stopping them from trying cigarettes' is such a form. 

Even further, the original position you took was that the government should stop people from *trying* to cause other people to commit that kind of neglect.

This part of your post is what lead me to use the word ""editing."" Apologies if I misunderstood you. Further, it was TGMais, not me, that suggested omitting the entire Old Testament from the Christian Bible. All I am suggesting is that if Christians are going to accept the Old Testament as the word of God, then they need to have some sort of explanation for the inconsistencies found within it. 

There are times in the Old Testament were the character of God, or Yahweh, is explicitly recorded as commanding the murder of men, women, and children. He also explicitly established the rules about the Israelites owning slaves. Those rules were not ""Don't own slaves,"" as the New Testament would lead one to expect.

A distinct possibility for explaining those passages is that they were attributed to Yahweh by men as justification for their own horrific actions. I strongly encourage Christians to pursue such a possibility and come to some conclusion on the matter, as it is very difficult for anyone to take the Bible seriously with such glaring inconsistencies in the character of God. This isn't just a matter of bad interpretation. It is direct quoting of God. If the God of the Bible exists, either some portions of the Old Testament are there against the will of God, or God is a cruel master, content to kill his own creations, who he supposedly loves, in order to enrich one segment of his created people, who he apparently loves more, just because that was the plan from the beginning.","1238547802"

carbon atoms are not 'fungible'--they come in sundry forms--sometimes as 'free' carbon, other times covalently bonded to all sorts of stuff.  

you're basically arguing that one particular 'killer nanobot' will have the chemical know-how at its disposal to harvest all sorts of carbon to sustain its replication.

chemistry doesn't work that way.  anything that self replicates will eventually become nutrient limited.

I would also propose that there's an *interesting 'sweet spot'* with respect to the size of a Nanobot (or any other life form).  

If the organism is too small (i.e. on the order of the size that you're talking about), it's actually **more difficult** to replicate because you can only take advantage of a limited # of chemical reactions to fuel your growth/replication.  viruses fall into this category too.

If the organism is too big, replication will take much longer (e.g., humans).

Bacterial size is probably at the global maximum of this function of size/ease of reproduction.","1238547856"

"reddit.com","t5_6","If you are familiar with Catholicism then I'm sure that you are also somewhat familiar with Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation. I may be wrong, but I believe it came about because of some of the stuff above that you mentioned about Catholicism. 

It's also (at least partially) why I am not Catholic. But before you get the wrong idea, I'm not writing this to attack Catholicism.

And I agree with you that Smith, Muhammed, Hubbard et al were not ""god"",but I do believe that they (like all humans) were touched by God.

I also agree with you that the priest probably ""didn't believe all that stuff"". (Let me caution that I used the word ""probably"" since there is really no way for me to know what he believes in his heart). But also consider that a priest is part of an orthodoxy. In fact, he has little control over the church--or at least, the bureacracy the church has become. Yes, he could simply choose to leave the priesthood, but perhaps he feels like he can accomplish more by staying on. Again, I have no way of knowing what he really thinks. 

Some preists are pedophiles but I'm pretty sure it says somewhere in the Bible that pedophilia is wrong. Okay, I'm finished attacking the Catholics. (mild sarcasm)

And OF COURSE Bruce Lee was cool! I mean he WAS Bruce Lee and I believe, the only man on Earth ever to kick Chuck Norris' ass!

And as for pissing off the fundies-- maybe you should give them a little bit of a break-- pissing them off is sort of like shooting fish in a barrel-- it's way too easy!

Seriously, though, in my opinion the main difference between Christ and all the other religious leaders that you mentioned is that Christ was, for lack of a better word, a better 'teacher'. 

If you consider reading some of the things that Jesus said--the Sermon on the Mount, for example-- I believe you will agree that He was indeed an enlightened individual with an amazing insight into human nature as well as the nature of being 'human'. Does this make him the Son of God? That is something you and everyone else gets to decide for yourself and my opinion doesn't really matter.

Also, for better or worse, the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence were written by men who (for the most part) believed in God and were guided by Christian principles. I'm not pointing this out to 'wave the flag' or declare the USA to be ""the best damn country ever"", but instead to point out that democracy and social justice have fared way better under our system of government than many, many (and I might point out, 'intentionally godless') systems, such as the Soviet Union. Is the USA perfect? Of course not, and I don't mean to imply that it is.

And, before you point it out, I'm aware that many, many atrocities have been perpetrated by man against his fellow man in the name of God or Christianity, but, again, if you read the things Christ said you'll probably see that he doesn't actually condone this type of behaviour.

Ok! I'm done with my sermon. And, really, I'm not down on the Catholics, in spite of all those things I said about them. :)

So in a few months when the processors cost 600 instead of 900, will Apple reduce prices by 600 dollars, or increase their profit from $600 a machine to $1200 a machne.

Once you know what the homo spien is and not what it wants itself to be, it becomes more apparent that the humans that made it today are decedents of extreme violence, going back to pre-civilization.

To deny the influence of Juedo-christian moral ethics on our cultural is foolish and straight out of liberal idealism.  There are instincts towards peace, as I said in that other post, but the instincts towards violence will always overpower those when push comes to shove, hence just about everything that is going on this world.

I'm not concerned with the goal of 'peace,' it will never be realized unless one is medicated by the state to the point of living in a sleep walk, similar to the prospect of the Brave New World by Huxley.

The problem, as the article points out, is that GM agreed to pay extremely lucrative retirement benefits to employees who worked there back in the day when GM was profitable.  Those workers expected and planned for those benefits (i.e., many had no minimal additional retirement funds in place).  If the current workers just cut those guys off...yeah, the company would be more profitable, but I'm not sure that isn't evil.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Walk Calhoun at night or hit up Lake Street and let me know what you think of those neighborhoods

I walk Calhoun at night regularly.  It's constantly patrolled by police.  It is surrounded by million dollar condos and mansions.  That is what gentrification does.  Money brings in the law.

I live in North East.  More law enforcement in that area as well do to money moving into the neighborhood throughout the past decade.

&gt;I live in South Minneapolis so I just have to look out the window to realize that it's not as sanitized as you would like to believe.

Hence my comment:

&gt;Do you mean North and parts of South Minneapolis?

North.  Straight up North is where the vast majority of violent crime occurs.  Same thing with certain areas of South.  Uptown, specifically the areas around Lyndale and Hennepin where additional multi-million dollar condos have been tossed up have seen a staunch increase in patrol cars and an equal decrease in violent crimes.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Yawn. You keep posting this like I've never heard of abductive reasoning. The whole point is that is not the type of reasoning that scientists use. In fact, they never PROVE anything...only DISPROVE IT.

&gt;run the following example statements by professors in the disciplines listed and ask if they're typical of the kinds of arguments made in these disciplines

I can already tell you they AREN'T, because positive claims are never made the way you suggest they are. Scientists never make the 'Q therefore P' claims that you state. They do it more like this:

* If P -&gt; Q
* Q
* P is not disproven.

For example:

&gt;therefore, the universe is expanding.

&gt;therefore, glaciers formed many of the valleys in Colorado's Ten Mile Range

&gt;therefore, gibbons and orangutans share a recent evolutionary ancestor.

&gt;therefore, this composite contains boron

These would all be rewritten as:

&gt;therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that universe is expanding.

&gt;therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that glaciers formed many of the valleys in Colorado's Ten Mile Range

&gt;therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that gibbons and orangutans share a recent evolutionary ancestor.

&gt;therefore the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that this composite contains boron

The reason you think the scientific method is a logical fallacy is that YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. Of course your perverted version of it is a logical fallacy, but it is not the version that scientists follow so your argument is shit. Come back when you grow a brain.

Or, everything. I'm lucky, do I deserve that? It's not really about whether I think anyone's deserving or not, I think most everybody deserves to live a happy and comfortable life, but that's not life, is it? That's not going to happen. 

What I'm saying is that many people who are successful have the opinion that they *do* deserve it more than others, that they are *entitled* to what they have (again, this is generalizing), without acknowledging or realizing that often it's not just their badass skillz that got them where they are, but their position of privilege from the beginning, or their exploitation of the baser elements of human nature.

Sympathy for the favorite nation, facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels and wars of the latter without adequate inducement or justification.

 It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of privileges denied to others which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the concessions; by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a disposition to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. 

And it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or sacrifice the interests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with popularity; gilding, with the appearances of a virtuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.

It was the hardest computer fix I can ever remember doing. I scoured the internet for every clue I could get to try diagnosing the dead laptop. Absolutely nothing worked. I was on my own.


In the end though, I DID fix it. And the fix would have been pretty simple if only I could have diagnosed the problem more easily. But this was one WEIRD problem.


Apparently a nearby lightning strike had WIRELESSLY killed the Airport card inside the laptop (because it was NOT connected to the internet or AC when it happened). Then when OS X next tried to boot, it queried the Airport, went into a kernal panic, and killed the whole laptop.


After that, you could only boot in Safe Mode, as that kept the Airport extensions from activating.


But even getting the thing to boot in safe mode the first time took an amazingly long time, and lots of research and trial and error.


Apple's testing software actually LIED to me during all this, and told me the Airport hardware was fine, when it wasn't, and so wasted huge gobs of my time.


And yes, I even ended up erasing the disk and restoring it to original factory config during my desperation, after nothing else had worked. But the reconfig didn't fix it either.


I also took the damn thing apart and disconnected the PRAM battery, to see if that would do it. But no.


Finally, utterly exhausted from fiddling with it on and off for weeks, I wondered what if the Apple testing software was wrong about the Airport? Because I'd had oodles of problems with Airport on other Macs over the years. So I removed all the Airport software from where X accessed it, and eureka! The laptop lived again.

&gt; King was one of the original members of the AFL-CIO Elected Leader Task Force on Organizing. He also founded the region-wide International Labor Solidarity Network. A 1968 graduate of the University of Michigan, King received his law degree in 1973 from the University of Detroit. He served in the U.S. Army from 1968-1970. King is a life member of the NAACP, a Michigan Democratic Party precinct delegate, and a member of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.

The problem with too many of us is that we accept the notion that if any little piece of an argument or an idea or any concept that has to be communicated is wrong, then the bigger idea is a fail, e.g.:

* A cop who detains a person who sped to the hospital in a hospital parking lot after the speeder indicated his mother was dying because he broke the law.

* A state which instructs teachers that they cannot fail students for refusing to accept Darwinian principles.

* A pothead who immediately calls anyone against medical marijuana a fascist.

* An atheist who refuses to consider the possibility that events with a scientific cause might have a spiritual effect.

The list goes on and on. Different people cling to different ethos. Reasonable people will see where ethos and reason clash and will side with reason more often than ethos. Less reasonable people will do the opposite.

The overall problem I have with the above is that reasonable people cannot turn popular ""reason"" into an ethos of their own where the attack on one's idea is also an attack on one's self.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Obligatory [link](http://www.illusionary.com/GNOMEvKDE.html) to my favourite GNOME vs KDE comparison.

&gt;**KDE**

&gt;A big room somewhere in Europe with lots of chrome and glass and a great big whiteboard in the front with lots of tiny, neat writing on it. There are about 50 desks, each with headphones and pristine workstations, also with a lot of chrome and glass. The faint sound of classical music permeates the room, accompanying the clicky-click of 50 programmers typing or quietly talking in one of the appropriately assigned meeting areas. (Which of course consist of elegant contemporary white pine coffee tables surrounded by contemporary white pine and fine leather meeting chairs.) Coffee, tea, mineral water and fruit juices are available in the break area.

&gt;At the end of the day, *everyone* checks in their code and the project leader does a ""make"" just to make sure it all compiles cleanly, but it's mostly only done from tradition anymore since it always compiles cleanly and works flawlessly. When all milestones have been met, and everything has been QA'd, (usually within a day or two of the roadmap that was written up 18 months previous) a new KDE release is packaged up and released to the mirror sites with the appropriate 24-hour delay for distribution before being announced.

&gt;KDE developers are generally between the ages of 16 and 25, like art made of lines and squares and the colors white and black. When/if they finally stop taking government subsidies and get around to getting ""real jobs,"" most of their salary will be taken in taxes so the socialist government can subsidize the care and feeding of the next generation of KDE developers, just like it did for them. A high percentage of KDE developers, during their mandatory 5 years of government military service, crack from their years of cultural dullness and flee Europe to become terrorists for the sheer joy to be found in killing random strangers for no discernible reason.

&gt;**GNOME**

&gt;An abandoned warehouse in San Francisco, kitted up as for a rave, electronica playing at 15db louder than ""my ears are bleeding and I'm developing an aneurism"" volumes and the windows all painted over black so that the strobe and spotlights and lasers can be seen better. Computers, mainly made of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs, are scattered around on whatever furniture is available, which also consists of whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs. There's no break area, but you may be able to bum a beer (or more likely something harder) off of one of the developers hanging around, and they will probably be too jacked up on X, coke, acid, heroin, ether or all of the above to notice that you've taken anything.

&gt;Development strategies are generally determined by whatever light show happens to be going on at the moment, when one of the developers will leap up and scream ""I WANT IT TO LOOK JUST LIKE THAT"" and then straight-arm his laptop against the wall in an hallucinogenic frenzy before vomiting copiously, passing out and falling face-down in the middle of the dance floor. There's no whiteboard, so developers diagram things out in the puddles of spilt beer, urine and vomit on the floor.

&gt;At the end of the day - whenever that is since an equal number of programmers will be passed out at any given time - or really whenever someone happens to think of it (which is rarely), someone might type ""make"" on some machine somewhere, with mixed results. Generally nothing happens, so he/she shrugs his/her shoulders and wanders off to look for someone who might have more pink/black-striped pills. Once in a great while, generally in the unpleasant time between the come-down from the last thing they took and before whatever it was they took just now comes on fully, someone will tar up a bunch of random files and post it on a website someplace it as the next GNOME release, usually with a reference to some kind of monkey.

&gt;GNOME developers rarely live past 25 and prefer ""alternative"" art - generally stuff made of feces that's ""too edgy"" for most people to ""understand"" or ""like."" Core GNOME developers are heavy Ketamine users. The bodies of GNOME developers can often be found in dumpsters or floating face-down in any sufficiently large body of water.","1238548673"

1) postion hand on tuner knob, glancing briefly (if at all) at radio

2) scan traffic ahead, check for brake lights, or anything reasonably close - if not a good time wait and return to step 1

3) tune radio, don't take all day, a second or two at most and then a quick glance up for a road check before continuing search for music of your choice.

4) repeat step three, bailing if traffic gets hairy, otherwise once station found sit back, enjoy the music, but do a complete traffic scan to make sure nothing major changed in your position on the road or around you. 18 wheeler on your tail, teen texting in the lane next to yours etc...

The second part of my above post tried to show that there are physical limits to how far you can scale down a nanomachine. If you manage to make one smaller than a virus, it won't have a lot of power to do its work and will be vulnerable to an unfriendly environment. (A large part of the energy budget of a cell goes to 'pumping entropy out,' by which I mean cell repair.)

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","First off, sorry for the delay.  I've been distracted lately.  Anyway, on to it.

&gt;But your god would know the defects in his plan and yet he still made it come to fruition.

I don't see any defects.  If you mean that great and unutterable evils would be done on the earth, yes, he knew ahead of time to finite detail.  But those are the choices of humanity.  We have augmented this world to be what it is.  

I see all of creation, from beginning to end, as one big Opera.  Operas are often sad, often filled with terrible deeds, but nonetheless full of beauty.  Beauty is not always pretty, or approachable.  

But I see no defects that are not our own.  Did God inherit these defects as our Creator?  No.  He made us independent, capable of free will.  If we follow him, no matter whether life or death, greatness or agony, follows us - it will be beautiful.  Life is beauty.  Profound beauty.

&gt;So if the most important thing is to seek god do you deny them their path?

If a person who is wholly dedicated to God has found himself wearing a bomb into a group of people...I pray that he/she finds GOd.  The one who misleads will be judged by far more harshly than the one who is mislead.  Therefore it is entirely conceivable then that a suicide bomber would enter Heaven.  God is wondrous, bigger than my understanding.  Life is beauty.  Even in the midst of destruction and irrepairable loss.

&gt;but how does anyone give control to god?

Because we are all in possession of self-will, giving this will over to God, that is yoking it to put it in the power of God, is how one gives control to God.  God can turn me into a potato right now if he wants, and in that way yes he already has control.  But to take something like free will, harness it, and make yourself a vessel of the will of God - is what I mean by giving control to GOd.  Does he control our actions if we yoke ourselves?  No.  We are still in control, we pull the yoke - but we have allowed God to guide us.  

&gt;But water is vital to life....It is not the same way with your god.

Oh, but it is.  This water, if you drink it, will ensure that you never thirst again.  You have described perfectly the nature of this water.  

&gt;I am not thirsty for what you say. I dont feel the need to worship some greater being. And contrary to some people's beliefs I am not a hollow shell of a human being.

I'm sure that you don't feel hollow, or thirsty, or that you lead an empty life without God.  It's hard to explain the difference.  Plato's Allegory of the Cave touched upon it pretty well. 

&gt;Its just that I can hardly believe that believing in a god, or seeking god, will make my day brighter

You're right - on the contrary your life will become harder.

I will promise, in fact, that if you were to even consider this path as viable - and pursue it even slightly - that a number of occasions will arrive to waylay, divert, and distract you from this course.  Whether you would allow them to is another question.  And if you were to work beyond these diversions to seek God you would find hardship, chaosi, confusion, and pain.  That is the way of the cross.  Not happiness and good times - but pain and suffering.  

That said, all pain, hardship, even unto death - becomes meaningless.  You can transcend this meaninglessness.  Pain is only a signal, and death is only a cocoon.  On a secular level, to learn more you might read The Hagakure - a secular text that comes closer to the Way than any book I've encountered.  Instead of happiness and sadness, you will find contentedness and joy.  The love you have previously felt for your parents, siblings, friends, loves, children can show you a hint of the vast ocean of love that comes with the worship of God.

&gt;Do you not see the sheer arrogance in this statement?

Absolutely.  It is arrogant.  Hypocritical, though, it isn't.  On a secular level, I'll support anything you want to do as long as it doesn't infringe upon the rights of others.  My personal beliefs though are that we are not complete without our creator.  It's just my opinion.  Please do not take offense.

&gt;And how does your god make this arbitrary decision? This seems an awful lot like messing with free will.

Yeah.  We have free will.  Mostly, God is pretty subtle.  Sometimes he decides to really pull out the stops and lay some overt stuff on one of us.  Why, I don't know.  But I'll tell you that those he calls to do this or that are usually more imperfect than others.  He chooses those who are less capable to do what he wants them to do than others so that he can reveal himself more fully.  For example, he called upon Moses - a stutterer and awkward speaker - to deliver his message to Egypt.  Those he chooses are broken, imperfect beings so that it is clear it is God behind them - that they are not doing it on their own.  Beyond this, I do not know.

&gt;But what has your god done for me?

He's not selling you insurance.  He's not your business partner.  He's the Lord of Hosts.  And if you ever come to understand this, you will react the same way every single man woman and child has reacted from the beginning - on your knees, tears in your eyes, beauty exploding in your heart, in absolute naked worship of the Holy One.  

&gt;Especially if I get nothing out of the deal.

Love and Beauty are their own reward.

&gt;You say those that reject christ knowingly go to hell, yet ""There isn't a way of telling if someone went to heaven or hell.""

I mean, unless someone says ""I hearby reject Christ...unnnnnghh....dead"" would we have any real idea what their last seconds were like.

&gt;And I definitely would not worship a god that would do what you say yours would do.

Please explain.

&gt;A good way to get someone obsessing over something is to say you will either have eternal happiness or eternal torture.

The evangelicals focus on the eternal paradise/eternal torture.  Surprisingly little in the Bible is related to the afterlife.  The reason you hear about it so much is because it's what people are interested in.  Also, evangelicals try to scare people into conversion, sadly.

&gt;Very, very few.

Above all else you have seen done or said in the name of Christ, this is the one outward thing that is most Christlike.

&gt;So how does excommunicating someone loving those that hate?

Excommunication isn't hate.  It's like this.  If you say you're a member of the Catholic church, and you aggressively reject a core tenet of the faith, it's ok to say ""You're no longer one of us.""  The Bible talks about rejecting those within the church that, after warnings and several opportunities to change, do not do so.  It isn't judgment or hate.  It can always be reversed, and excommunication is pretty rare.

&gt;So what does being right with god entail? Just believing in him? Or what?

Being right with God, to the very best of my understanding is simply a matter of accepting Jesus Christ as your savior.  Here is a sample prayer of conversion:

&gt;Lord Jesus, I realize that I have rebelled against you and I'm not worthy to get into heaven on my own merit. I believe you died for me and that your death paid for my sins and restores my relationship with God. I acknowledge you as my Lord, Savior, and Friend. Thank you for your gift of eternal life, which I accept by faith. I pray this through Jesus. Amen.

After that, reading the Bible (initially the Gospels are most important - John's a good one), regular prayer (just talking to God), and eventually finding believers who are truly living for God to help you.  

&gt;Please explain this key difference...

Grace is this: that nothing we can do can get us to the point where we are clean, where we are right with God.  But God loved us so much that he became flesh, taught us the way, and died for our sins - that is he took it upon himself to be judged and executed in our place.  It is the love of a parent for a child on a level that is hard to conceive of.  Every single religion will tell you that if you do this thing or don't do that thing that you will be right with God.  Christianity teaches that works are not enough.  But God's overflowing love has set us free from our chains.

Don't get lost in the details as many do, including and maybe especially Christians.  Just seek God.  He loves you and if you ask for him you will receive him.  

Please tell me if I'm not stating things clearly.  Again, sorry for the delay.  Thanks.","1238548969"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","These prisoners of prohibition are overwhelmingly people of color.

The ""War on Marajuana"" ca.1969 morphed into ""the ""War on Drugs"" which had gone from interdicting primarily cannabis, to ostensibly  pursuing the 
cocaine and marijuana ""dealers"" when in reality, most of the cocaine coming into the country was via CIA flights.

Regular flights were coming into Arkansas in the late eighties.


Then it turned into the ""War on People of Color"", as our jail population will indicate.

 ""We're incarcerating an entire generation of people.""

WASHINGTON - Come the new millennium, the number of African American adults behind bars will hit the million mark for the first time, according to an analysis of Justice Department statistics. That represents nearly an eightfold increase from three decades ago, when there were only 133,226 blacks in prison.

By 2000, roughly one in 10 black men will be in prison - a statistic with major social implications because prisoners don't have jobs, pay taxes or care for their children at home. And because many states bar felons from voting, at least one in seven black men will have lost the right to vote.

""These numbers are staggering,"" said Laurie Levensen, a former federal prosecutor and associate dean of Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. ""We're incarcerating an entire generation of people.""

Why blacks contribute about half of all prison inmates when they are only 13 percent of the U.S. population is subject to much speculation. Some specialists blame poverty or lack of opportunity. Others say police concentrate in poor urban areas because street crimes such as drug dealing and armed robbery are more visible, and residents there demand more police protection.

The bottom line is that crime policy has become a substitute for public policy, said Jerome Miller, president of the National Center on Institutions and Alternatives, an Arlington, VA. legal reform group that analyzed the Justice Department data.","1238548984"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Yeah, I agree that trucks and SUVs have a higher incidence of rollover, but rollover deaths make up a minority of vehicle fatalities.  I'm not saying it's not a big deal, but it is *less* of a big deal.  Add to that the introduction of stability control, and some of the safest vehicles on the road are big SUVs.

Big vehicles most definitely add safety (in part) due to brute force (to the detriment of the other driver) but that's not the only way they achieve safety.

Look at a very recent (2007) report by the IIHS:

http://www.iihs.org/externaldata/srdata/docs/sr4204.pdf

SUVs make up half of the top 15 safest vehicles, with the others being vans and large cars.  Rollover rates for SUVs aren't really all that worse than small cars (better in some cases) and fatalities are much better for SUVs than smaller cars.

I'm just saying that if you're looking for a vehicle to keep you safe, an SUV is going to be one of your best options.

Also, these statistics are just now starting to take into account stability control in SUVs.  As the IIHS indicates, this trend should continue as crash data begins to include the dramatically increased percentage of SUVs with stability control in recent years.","1238549003"

 Mono was never designed to port windows apps to linux, though it can be done. Its designed for creating cross platform apps. 

If you write a program using Mono, it will run in either environment...if you write a program using MS .NET, you risk making a native call that will have to replaced when you port it.

The points themselves are not actually that contentious.  (1) MSFT lost a lot of money on the xbox endeavor as a whole.  (2) MSFT was convicted of anti-trust in the past.  (3) This conviction entirely different than Google's involvement with the Yahoo Acquisition.

Really, you're so used to seeing MSFT fanboys and hatred that you instinctively view strong conclusions as evidence of one or the other.

As for the predatory pricing issue, I was referring to Microsoft's xbox division as a whole.  Yes, everyone knows that these companies use the hw as a loss leader.  However, other companies plan to turn a profit after sw is factored in.  MSFT in earlier conference calls had stated that they never intended to make a profit on xbox.  Now, perhaps they just have a really long term (10-year plus) plan to turn a profit, but if that entails edging out competition by losing money until then, it would be an anti-competitive move.

You're also mixing up terminology.  Don't get mixed up with the hardware-as-a-loss-leader

As I pointed out in an earlier post, I was referring to Microsoft's entire xbox hw/sw operations.  The division has been burned through an immense amount of  money over the years.  Sony's videogame business funds the rest of the company.  MSFT uses its other divisions to fund its videogame business.

Oh yea... because atheists are everywhere, with their churches, with their bumper stickers, and saying ""there is no god"" every time someone sneezes, and atheists are lobbying the government to restrict the rights of people because of their ideology, and atheists are running around in peoples' neighborhoods knocking on doors and telling people to stop believing in god, and collecting all this money in tax-exempt organizations... yea, atheists are everywhere and they're hated...

Atheists are not hated.  They're feared by ignorant people.  Such as yourself.  My job isn't to be liked by you or anybody else.  I like to make people think, and sometimes to do that you have to be blunt.  You won't get it now but you'll get it later.  You've already been infected by my ideas, which is why you have to attack me.  It's part of your emotional defense mechanism because there's at least some part of you that knows what I'm saying makes sense, so you distract yourself by engaging in shallow, ad hominem arguments.  But it won't matter.  You've been infected with an idea that won't go away no matter how much you demonize me.  Because it has nothing to do with me, my attitude or personality.

Eventually, China has to borrow excessively to support the system, until an idiot President arrives and tries to distract the attention with unsustainable wars that pushes the system to the edge and it goes bankrupt.

We've never seen this happen before, of course, so we don't know if it will ever get that bad. I guess China would have to replicate the model in most countries in the world.

Whatever your answers may be (esp. in light of this contrived situation), recognize that human nature is exceptionally subjective. Most people would go farther to ""save 33%"" on the cans of fruit than they would to save $25 on the couch. 

The same thing happens in relationships - things that are okay for you to do chafe when your partner does it. There are two ways to deal with this - the better way is to talk it out. If she refuses to talk about it, you can just swallow it. But the problem is that if she's not talking, she's probably stewing about things you do, and it's going to blow up.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","&gt; Your question still assumes that no other solution was possible

We may be arguing two different points, but I'll grant that any number of other solutions were possible.  The US could have dropped Little Boy 10 miles out from Tokyo Bay and left a threatening note warning about ""next time"", just as the Japanese could have surrendered after Okinawa.

The US could have sent the Japanese film footage of Trinity, just as the Japanese could have surrendered after Leyte Gulf.

The US could have surrounded the island and waited, while the Japanese continued to send wave after wave of kamikazes at the fleet.

With the regards to ""bombing the crap out of a couple of military bases"", we did that. A lot. They still didn't surrender.  Are you sure you've got a good grasp of the events as they unfolded?

&gt; The reasoning and thought processes behind dropping the bombs are not clear cut.  Many books have been written on the subject.

Just because someone writes a book that parses and dissects the motivations of people in the past doesn't mean that their version of things is even anywhere near true or even noteworthy.

Based on the objective facts alone, it is not difficult to conclude that the bombs were used to minimize US casualties, bring Japan to the surrender table, and show the Russians that they'd better watch their step.  What about those reasons do you not find clear cut?  What fanciful notions do you attribute to Harry S. Truman?  

The US had been at war since late 1941 and was sick of it.  The US had spent hundreds of billions of dollars and lost hundreds of thousands of lives and wanted the war over and done with.


&gt; unless you're the sort of person who believes governments, presidents, prime ministers, congressmen, and senators, when they tell you things about evil doers and rent boys.

I don't particularly believe anything the government says to be true or false.  I make up my mind on things based on as many different sources of information that I can manage.

After a time, though, the dust settles and a more concrete version of historical events becomes visible.

With regards to ""evil"", I define it as any intelligent thing that intentionally causes me harm.  I also think that the definition can be applied in terms of tribes and nations.

How do you define it?

"religion","t5_2qh39","Your concept of the 'Rational' is a mysterious invention of the lower dregs of the atheist population that does not map on to anything in the real world.

'Rationality' - on the standard conception that actually links up with reality - is no more than a person's ability to reason well (e.g. according to the rules of deductive and inductive logic).  And *that* ability is one component of intelligence - specifically, one of the many capabilities with a tremendously high correlation to *g* or ""general intelligence factor"" (which is measured by IQ tests).

Francis Collins, you cannot reasonably deny, is very intelligent.  Almost certainly moreso than you, but that isn't especially relevant.  Unless you deny nearly unanimously accepted principles of cognitive science and psychology, you must admit that his intelligence entails that he is also astoundingly rational.

It is frankly *idiotic*, a product of magical thinking about the human mind, to think that you can differentiate Intelligence and Rationality.  The cause of this idiocy is that certain atheists of middling intelligence are threatened by the undeniable fact that there exist theists far more intelligent than they.  At relatively lower levels of intelligence, it is difficult for a person to conceive of intellectual differences - it becomes necessary to come up with excuses to dismiss people with different beliefs.  Thus the invention of an alternative (entirely fanciful) conception of 'rationality' as something that is separate from intelligence, and the idea that a person may not be exceedingly intelligent but may still be far 'more rational' than those of greater intelligence.  It is of course ironic that an atheist purporting to champion reason would come up such an unreasonable, completely unscientific outlook.  But then, this only arises in the case of relatively unintelligent atheists.  The more intelligent atheists realize, as do most people of relatively greater intelligence, that intelligent and reasonable people can have good reasons for holding differing views about many matters including atheism vs. theism without anyone being 'impaired' in their judgment.","1238549777"

I think that's learned.  If you tell little girls they're beautiful as they are and model healthy self confidence for them, they usually turn out fine.

counterfeiting is a fraud. it should be prosecuted as such if the policy makers print too many notes for their finance guy buddies. if there is too much counterfeiting going on, people can redeem their notes for gold and cause bank runs - making excessive counterfeiting short-lived anyway for any bank that either counterfeits or accepts counterfeit notes.

"obama","t5_1a8ah","&gt;Every store in my area charges the same price for beer, since the price is set by the same distributor which all the stores get it from.

Well, prices differ where I live. I don't know where you live, but I've never heard if identical pricing, unless it's in a very small town (and if prices got too high, people would buy less beer - it's in the interest of the companies to move their products, which requires a desirable price). Regardless, the prices of different brands differ. If I could make a beer equivalent to Heineken for cheaper, I'd sell it to the distributor for cheaper and you'd get it for cheaper. Either Heineken would lower its price or lose sales to me. Btw, I can get 6 bottles of Heineken for $7-10. I can get Stella Artois, which I prefer, for the same price. I don't mind paying $1.15 for a bottle of beer. In other words, I like legalization just fine.

&gt;Making your own involves considerable labor on top of materials which make it considerably more than store bought. 

This strengthens the claim that legalization will make it cheaper.

&gt;if you want to grow your own I would think it very realistic that just a 1000w halide bulb would cost around $750

You're saying if marijuana is legalized, the price of halide bulbs will increase 1500%? You're out of your mind. Besides, I could grow my own marijuana outside if it were legal, so who needs artificial light?

&gt;dirt would become the new gasoline market.

Right, because we don't need to buy dirt for all the things we currently grow. Nor do we have dirt on our own property. How often do people buy dirt to plant trees in their back yard? Get real.

&gt;Why don't people grow their own tobacco? 

Because it's a pain in the ass and a pack of smokes only costs $5 (and an overwhelming amount of this is tax). Try making your own cigarette for 25 cents. Legalization is the best deal available.

&gt;lega.. would open the doors for half a million hedge fund managers to capitalize on a new found boom to bubble and burst.

Because the alcohol industry after prohibition ended bubbled and bursted? Give me a break.","1238550018"

Sorry, but you are not free from the Judeo-Christian moral ethic, it's everywhere, it has a major influence on the ideals of the framers of the constitution.  I don't understand why that isn't obvious to you.

Oh, and that's also straight gibberish to propose secular societies are more moral, anyone who has read anything about Mao's secular China or Stalin's secular Soviet Union laughs in your face.

Also, understand morality does not always connote peaceful morality.  You can have a morality, like say the Romans, where peace is not the purpose of the moral code.  Once again, you are lost within the Judeo-Christian moral ethic.

A 'peaceful' society can very likely be a psychologically oppressed society, like much of the United States.

With what is going on right now with the financial collapse in the U.S., and the rampant greed, and the insolvent government with it's new puppet Obama constantly lying just like Bush did, maybe being moral has a major downside, maybe morality is used to oppress and misinform people from seeing what is right in front of their face.

I know it's only an anecdote, but when I was in high school, we had to jump through more hoops to get alcohol (i.e. drive down to a really bad section of Newark and find to a bar that wouldn't card a bunch of dorky white high school kids) than to get pot, because one out of ten kids in my high school could hook you up by the end of the day/week if you asked nice and tossed them a few bucks extra.

http://www.militaryfactory.com/american_war_deaths.asp

If you just purchased all the slaves and set them free no one would have died, we would have effectively cut in half all US war deaths.

&gt; Why shouldn't slave holders have been forced to relinquish the people they were holding as property without being compensated?

The south succeeded, they were a separate country. Why would they feel obligated to follow a law that a completely different country passed? If however we never went to war with the south, we could have purchased all the slaves for less than the cost of the entire war. And like Ron Paul said in the video, the US is the only country that had a civil war to end slavery.

(Yes, yes, there are some applications like producing Hollywood movies where image editors could use the power of multiple machines ... personal editors don't fit in that domain).

imagine if Photoshop spawned off 3 or 4 processes each time you wanted applied an effect -- a blur, edge detect, saturation adjustment, etc....  Photoshop would have to spawn multiple process (not all that cheap in CPU terms), split the picture into different chunks of data, send that data to the processes using something like pipes or sockets, wait for the processes to complete, and then reconstruct the data.  Threads are clearly nicer for this situation -- memory doesn't have to copied -- the main thread only has to communicate which areas the worker threads are responsible for generating the new data.  No mutexes or other synchronization mechanism is required (other than waiting for the worker threads to complete their operation).  There is no need to copy the data of the image to different processes nor to reconstruct the data from different processes.

Threads are useful for some problem domains.  They may be frequently used today in applications where other methods may be better, but the same thing could be said about many other programming constructs.  The key is to know when is the best time to use a given construct.","1238550406"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","This is sort of long, so, fair warning. Random facts and quotes from my chapter on cults/religions. If you'd like me to clarify or expand on anything, let me know. Full disclosure, I was raised a Lutheran, and have spent time involved in a baptist church. I am currently not religious, college graduate, in my 20's. I spent time undercover in a cult doing firsthand research on the specific cult.


-Many scholars prefer the term ""new religious movement"" instead of cult because of the overwhelmingly negative connotation of the word cult. They claim that many of these groups are not generally any more destructive than major religions and they (me included) don't view major religions as overly destructive.

-If these scholars are right about NRMs (or cults), then people who leave the cults/NRM's should at least resemble people who leave major religions. (more on this later)

-there are problems defining cults, most dictionary definitions, if twisted hard enough, could include major religions. However, most people agree that there's a pretty big leap from Jim Jones and the People's Temple or Marshall Applegate and Heaven's Gate to mainstream Christianity/Islam/Judaism.

-The AFF defines cults as ""“A group or movement exhibiting great or excessive devotion or dedication to some person, idea, or thing, and employing unethical manipulative or coercive techniques of persuasion and control, designed to advance the goals of the groups leaders, to the actual or possible detriment of members, their families, or the community."" Now, I understand you have a pretty hostile opinion of religion, and that's fine, but ask yourself whether this applies to the majority or Christianity or Judaism or Islam. Could it apply to some minorities? Sure. Interestingly, this definition doesn't include a religious aspect, which is something I feel must be included. 

Some random facts

-of college students who join groups generally classified as cults or NRMs, 40% drop out (of college). This doesnt seem to happen with the big faiths.

-there's the whole brainwashing thing. This is kind of a complicated topic, and as it is with everything I've mentioned here, if you'd like to know more about this specifically just ask.

-My definition of a cult:
	As one can see, figuring out what a cult is can get complicated. I've left out a number of criteria, mostly because if everything was included, we'd likely be discussing a list roughly 100 items long. Below is my modified list that, in my opinion, offers a better and clearer definition that separates harmless, if unusual groups, from those that seem to display very problematic behavior.

1.Physical and mental separation of almost all members from society.
2.Coercive persuasion with hidden and/or devious motives used more than sparingly.
3.Intentionally deceptive recruitment.
4.Forced or strongly coerced labor for tasks that only benefit those towards the top of the group. This benefit must be non-spiritual.
5.The group often behaves as it is above the law. Actions do not attempt to change law, but rather simply step around or through the law.
6.Members are threatened with expulsion (or worse) for contact with objectionable outsiders.
7.Members access to objective information is controlled and micromanaged.

I say a cult should possess at least 3 of these traits. Obviously this is not scientific, but it's the best I can do. Using this system their will be groups that are extremely cultish and groups that are only moderately cultish. So you could say Heaven's Gate, for example, was extremely cultish.

-Who joins? People who join cults seem to have a higher prevalence of dependence, gullibility, assertiveness, cultural disillusionment, idealism, a desire for spiritual meaning, and have a low tolerance for ambiguity. People are also of above average intelligence. They are more often middle class, female and often are from families in which the father isn't involved. Those who join cults don't seem to exhibit much more mental illness than the general public.

-The biggest difference in people who leave so-called cults and those who leave large traditional faiths is, well, their stories! People who leave cults often tell tales of abuse, coercion and likely mentally ill leaders. People who leave religion sometimes have stories like these, but not anywhere near as often as those that leave cults. 

-(a study on cults) found that former members showed higher levels of neuroticism, possessed a need to please others, and had a high level of dependence. Neuroticism seemed to decrease the longer the person had been away from the cult, and those who had been involved with a support group showed lover levels of all three traits than those who weren’t. This led them to conclude that these traits likely were a product of their cult involvement. These things are not typically observed in people who leave major religions.

-Very few studies on ex-cult members use comparison groups. One of the few that has compared former members of the International Churches of Christ (commonly called a cult), former Catholics, and graduates of Intervarsity Christian Fellowship. While former Catholics had more negative views than former ICF members, they were significantly less negative than former members of ICC.

One of the big reasons we haven't seen any progress is because Bush completely slashed the fusion research funding, sending all the action overseas to the EU.

I'm not above taking someone's derision and doing them one better, insulting myself worse than they can.  For one thing it tends to undermine their attacks, and for another thing I get to show off my indomitable wit.

There's a place for serious, sober discussion and there's a place for sarcasm.  Usually I engage in the former when it seems like my counterpart is capable of being reasonable, but I'll still indulge in derision if I think it'll make my point better.

Stephen Colbert is an excellent example of using sarcasm to make your point.  He does it so well that conservatives didn't realize he was deriding them.  It's the only reason he was invited to the White House Press dinner, and once they realized what he was actually saying they never invited him back.  The rest of the nation got the point, though.

Buses, particularly empty buses, can stop very quickly.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; that's the aspect of American culture I could never really understand

At what point does popular myth become fact?  There are very many powerful families in the US.  Nepotism is alive and well.

But both left and right do give lip service to strength of the individual, and America is still home to the ""self-made man.""  Individuals here do rise in society by their own merits and little else.  One just became President.

You would have less difficulty understanding the appeal of this notion if you were born into more humble beginnings.  Also, the monarchy from which we rebelled was essentially a family system of government, so the roots of rugged individualism come from that experience, also.

With regards to inheritances, we had something called ""the estate tax"" years ago.  Clever Republicans renamed it ""the death tax"" and ended up getting it greatly reduced.  The children of the wealthy are still well-cared for, regardless.

A strong argument against the type of oligarchy you espouse can be seen in the Bush Family.  The father was president, he passed his genes and his brand name to his son, and his son became president, the worst our country has ever had IMHO and in the opinion of many people brighter than I.

Our new president is the very model of rugged individualism.  It will take some time to know whether he succeeds or not.  Certainly, he will be more successful than our last leader.","1238550759"

Midwives are medically trained to be able to recognize when a women has moved outside the bounds of a safe out-of-hospital birth.  Those limits are very clear and are written into the laws in each state.  For example, in Washington state, home birth midwives do NOT accept clients who have had a prior c-section, are currently pregnant with twins, have diabetes requiring insulin injections, have a diagnosis of liver or kidney disease, plus a handful of other conditions.  

If, during the pregnancy, a women shows signs or certain conditions, including high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia, a referral and transfer of care to a hospital based doctor is undertaken immediately.  Midwives do not deliver babies who are younger than 37 weeks gestation or older than 42 weeks, or babies that are pointed the wrong way (butt down instead of head down).  

During all aspects of care a midwife is constantly evaluating if a woman is still considered ""low-risk"" of if conditions are arising that have changed this.  They often consult with medical doctors such as OBs and perinatologists if they have any concerns.

Actually most hedge funds did know this, they just thought Porsche wouldn't buy at current prices.   They sold short not realizing that Porsche was buying those shorts.   Classic short squeeze - you might be surprised, but you should have been worried about this situation and taken steps to make sure it didn't get you.","1238551196"

Sorry to hear that you have not had contact with rabbis that you could respect.  That is not all of them.

If you have a better reddit-ready, nine-word explanation of the mesorah's basic premise than ""there's more to reality than what we see,"" I'd be glad to hear it.  The long answer is 73 volumes, as I mentioned, although that is only the Babylonian Talmud - Zohar, Midrashim, etc. would be much longer.

You misunderstand Hillel and Shammai - material must be taught in a way that your particular audience can understand. ""Then go study it"" will cover the rest of the material.  Don't forget the second part of the story, when Shammai chased away the student with a builder's stick.  There is a lot more to these stories than that - Manis Friedman has a very nice lecture on this (I think at www.jewishaudio.org).

A second basic premise of Judaism is that two contradictory ideas can both be right (Schrödinger's Cat?).  Hillel and Shammai (or rather, the school of Hillel and Shammai) had many disagreements, but there are ways to allow for both of them being right (again, WAY outside the scope of reddit).

The ""Oral Law"" is not separate from the written law, and they fit nicely together.  They were given at the same time.  The Talmud is fiercely individual, which each person should study to make their own.  It is not the case of anyone pulling a ""fast one.""

If you ask most people, they will say that there is an ""evolutionary"" process, where one generation knows more than the previous - Judaism does not agree with this.  Accumulation of facts and technology is not the same as wisdom.

Regarding Judaism being about ""faith"" (a bad translation of the word ""emunah""), you might be interested to hear Rabbi Dr. Tatz, MD, on this, I believe it's called ""A thinking Jew's guide to life - faith.""

http://www.simpletoremember.com/authors/a/rabbi-akiva-tatz/

Otherwise, maybe www.askmoses.com might also be of interest.

OSX is no more stable than a patched up XP or Vista

OSX is (out of the box) more secure) than Windows. With a little configuring that advantage goes away.

Windows supports a *shitload* of applications ranging from amazing to shitty.

OSX has some good application, but the range of options you have is quite limited.

Windows will play 99.99% of games in existence.

OSX can only play a fraction of a %. If a Mac user wishes to play games, he has to boot up Windows anyways, and then he is limited by the overpriced and underpowered hardware in his machine.

So where is this ethereal ""quality"" that you speak of?","1238551702"

For me (the times I've done it).. the big hump was regaining my belief that I'm strong and capable enough to do anything I want on my own. (In other words = I dont need anyone else.) Society has a way of making us believe that we are ""incomplete"" unless we are in a relationship. Thats bullshit. (god I hate that phrase ""you complete me"" - utter tripe). 

Take your time. Relax and Rediscover you. Find (or recreate) that list of things you've always wanted to do - and do them (on your own).

Bits 45, 0, 35, 3, 5 mod 9: index into a function pointer table
Bits ... mod ...: accumulate every game turn in a variable beginning at zero. When reaching a random number crash the game as this value should have been zero.
etc. be creative.
of course this only makes it harder to detect whether any key is correct or not. Employ some techniques to make it non obvious you are referring to the key stored in memory.

I am not asserting that transsexuals, hermaphrodites, cross-dressers, or anyone else who blurs gender &amp; sex boundaries has any less right to equal treatment and dignity in society.

I am saying that merely saying ""I'm a woman"" or ""I'm a man"" doesn't make it so. ""Woman"" and ""man"" is not merely a social construct, as some gender theorists, pushing a particular agenda, like to assert. It's also a description of biological sex, and so in turn, speaks to someone's suitability as a mate for those of particular genders &amp; orientations.

Most of the sects that don't accept evolution are far removed from mainstream Christianity, and generally represent the far right fringe of the faith.

Original sin was something that occurred to man specifically, according to Western tradition (it is important to note that the concept never developed in the churches of the East--the Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, and Persian Church have different beliefs about the nature of what happened at the Fall).  Therefore, it would be reasonable to assume that it happened to modern man.  I would posit that should the doctrine of original sin hold, that the most likely place for it to come into play is the most recent common ancestor of all mankind.  ","1238551947"

For example, I drive a 1996 Lexus ES 300. I've got 110k miles, and can probably get a good 250k out of the car. Someone driving a Ford Taurus can maybe get half of that.

I find their discussion about energy used during a life cycle kind of misleading as well. All of the studies they cite, the ones that say most of the energy is consumed during use and not manufacture, say nothing about hybrids. Surely constructing a hybrid is more energy intensive than other cars?

They might have something to their third example, except if they made the same mistake when calculating energy costs for hummers, which they probably did.

A choice like I'd imagine I'd choose religion if I felt like I had a soul or somesuch or that someone out there had a plan for some of the universe, if not all.

Reason doesn't have much to do with being Atheist.  I think it's a feeling (or lack there of).  I also think religion serves an important purpose.

"obama","t5_1a8ah","&gt;here in Seattle the state controls ALL liquor sales, and it is the same price at any liquor store you go to, however, it IS illegal to distill your own spirits, you can brew beer if you want, but distilling will get ya 5 to 10 in a fed penitentiary.

The purpose behind not being able to distill your own liquor is the reliability/safety of the liquor, right? Growing marijuana doesn't run the same risks. While I don't trust the state to perfectly (or sometimes reasonably) legislate, I'm not too worried about cops busting down someone's door and searching their garden.

&gt;Do you honestly believe if the legalize weed, they will let you grow whatever you want thereby losing their grip on revenue?

No, but I believe it would be very difficult for them to control it. Besides, I can go to the store. I don't find liquor to be horribly expensive. I'm perfectly fine buying my vodka from a store, even if some people profit from it. $30 for 750ml of Grey Goose is not horribly expensive. I'm sure good marijuana would be priced accordingly.

&gt;If you are growing weed in the dirt in your back yard, the quality would be very poor.

People currently buy dirt for all sorts of purposes. What makes you think the demand for dirt will jump so high that the price will skyrocket? Not everyone's going to start growing marijuana. Most people will be happy as hell to go to the store and buy a gram of amazing marijuana for less than a bottle of tequila.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Speaking of ambiguous statements...

Seriously, though, what I should have said was ""feeling superior"" is the opposite of what Christ taught (i.e., ""Love thy neighbor as thyself"").

Leaving aside the so-called 'supernatural' for a moment, I believe that if you actually read what Jesus said (or at the very least, has been quoted as saying) you will find little to disagree with. You won't find a passge in the Bible where Christ says, ""God hates Fags"", for example. If you do run across something that Christ said and disagree with it, I would be glad to hear your opinion.

Saying there's ""no evidence"" of Christ's existence is ignoring evidentiary material such as the Bible which, even if you do not believe to be inspired by a God, is, at the very least, a transcription of letters and oral traditions.
Also, Jesus Christ was cited by Jocephus(sp?), a non-Christian historian.

As for morality being an 'accident', I don't believe that you are giving credit where credit is due. Just as Henry Ford has had an influence on the way we travel and Bill Gates has had an influence on the way we surf for internet porn, Christ has had a huge influence on the whole of Western Culture. 

If you are a citizen of the USA, you know that this country was settled, in the beginning, for almost completely religious reasons. The Pilgrims didn't come here to strike it rich. Life was hard in the new world.

Furthermore, the US Constitution was written (for the most part) by Christians who used Christian principles as their guide.

If you are a US citizen (and of course you may not be-- I'm not trying to put any other countries down) it's a little naive to assume that Jesus Christ has had little or no influence on the society in which we live.

There is also a chance that some of your ancestors were religious. (And by religious I do not neccesarily Christian). Did your parents and grandparents have an influence on your life? Was it just ""an accident""?

Anyway, I was sort of just kidding when I implied you thought you were superior-- I didn't mean it literally and I apologize if I gave that impression.

As for the Bible being ""out of date"" I'll have to concede that some parts of it are a little ""out there"" compared to the modern world but, once again, if you focus mainly on what Christ taught, I think you'll find it very relevant to today.

Thanks!

&gt; The AFF

Google search, while amusing, wasn't very helpful on that one.

&gt; employing unethical manipulative or coercive techniques of persuasion and control, designed to advance the goals of the groups leaders, to the actual or possible detriment of members, their families, or the community

Yep, you're right, I'm hostile.  That sounds like a fairly accurate description of the Catholic Church which not only abused thousands of children, but had billions of dollars available to help settle those abuse charges.

The college dropout stat is very interesting (and a bit depressing), and is clearly a separator between cult/religion.  Didn't know that one.

I like your definition of what is a cult, but I do think that many religions can fall into that if you look at it loosely.

""Who joins"" - I found that part particularly interesting, and would love to hear more (particularly the intelligence, female, and mental illness aspects).

The psychological aspects at the end, make a lot of sense.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Long Rambling Post:

I'm not sure what to do with myself. I've always been by myself and haven't ever really known very many people throughout my life. At the present moment, I don't really have ""friends"" per se, but just acquaintances from work and the like. There is nobody I know that I can call up and ask to go for beer or go bowling or do something that people do amongst themselves. Well, that's a lie -- there are people whom I can call up, and I'm sure they would go, but once we get there -- then what? I long for company, but once I have it, I can't stand it anymore. I grow bored of people in an instant and then rush off to do something solitary like reading a book or indulging in any one of my hobbies -- all solitary things.

I can almost bear it if I'm in a group and don't have to engage in one-on-one conversation with anyone else and just zone out to the sound of other people's voices, but in one-on-one conversations I am absolutely lost. I don't mind listening to other people talk and making polite noises and comments once in a while to show that I'm paying attention to them, but I just can never talk about myself. There is very little that I find interesting enough about myself to vocalize to anyone else and even if something unimaginably exciting happened to me, I doubt I would share it with anyone else. Overall, conversations seem like a waste to me.

Segueing into dating, I can say that I can get a date or two with another person, but after that, I get both bored of that person but also slightly clingy -- there may be nothing about them that I particularly like, but then again, this is a person who has devoted some time and spent it with me. In the end, relationships don't work out since I'm not ""there"" for that other person -- I am both too selfish in that I keep my time and experiences to myself, but I am also mechanically altruistic in that I do things for other people that they may not have wanted done.

I wouldn't say that I'm depressed - 97.3% of my time is spent being happily alone, but the other 2.7% I spend in melancholy at being alone. People say that I'm nice, sociable, and not bad looking, but I just know the right things to do at the right time and find no joy at in doing that.","1238552576"

You cannot always take a program compiled using .NET and run it on the mono runtime.

However, compiling it via Mono, and removing any native calls to windows makes the app run under Linux, Windows, or Mac using the Mono runtime.

So in other words, if you write an app in Linux using Mono, porting it to windows and mac is usually just a matter of packaging your app up with the right dependencies.

If you wrote an app in Windows using Mono, porting it is again the same.

If you wrote an app in Windows using .NET, you have a bit more work cutout for you...but again, that was not the intent of Mono.

While import makers were striving for options and amenities and better reliability, GM and others were still cranking out large trucks with plastic dashes and few options. Meanwhile making bone headed comments like ""nobody wants a coupe"" and killing off major lines for lack of sales due to low popularity which was caused by poor marketing and an inability to compete with the bang for the buck and options that import makers were pushing.

Only in the last 5-6 years has GM shown some glimmers of understanding around these factors and started to put out some well built cars with 1/2 way decent styling and somewhat better options. However it was too little to late.","1238552621"

ECC would be secure in ~200 bits, but every single sane ECC scheme requires transmission of *two* numbers, and ECC *isn't* secure at the 80 or 100-bit level. I came up with a couple of neat schemes involving Highly Composite Numbers, but all of those would be broken if you knew the HCN used, and HCNs are a lot rarer than primes, so that couldn't work either.

If you didn't actually read the article, then go the fuck away, for not even reading what you post. 

The article states:

""This area was one of the worst affected during Israel's ground offensive -- hundreds of houses and greenhouses were completely destroyed in Salateen, thousands of trees were uprooted, and there are still 100 families living in a tent camp just a few meters away. This predominantly fishing community has sustained many Israeli incursions over the years but the scars of the latest one are all pervasive and have made the area almost unrecognizable to its residents. Even the cemetery with its cracked gravestones and deep tank tracks, was not spared.""  

And: ""The high civilian death toll and the extensive destruction to public and private property indicate that one of the objectives of the Israeli political and military establishments was to cause the maximum possible damage in Gaza.""   How does that sit with you?

Ok, I am the judge and you have the pic from this story’s header... there is a capital trial underway, you are asked to tell the court just why you say, ""it looks like a plane did get shot down.""

Details of the plane are presented to the court, the landing trucks consist of hydraulic ram type assemblages and the wingspan is forty meters, the engines turbo fans are made from an alloy that melts only at very high temperatures, and does not burn at all, so what makes you say that you believe a plane crashed.

At this point, you are reminded that you are giving evidence in a case involving capital treason against the United States of America, and that you have agreed to appear as a witness, defending the assertion a plane crashed into that hole… similarly you are reminded that perjury in a capital case is a capital offense …Well Mr Bnglsfan!!

**They went to war and bombed and blasted Afghanistan** ...they reckon some dood in that land caused a plane to go off course and eventually crash, cos a Jew passenger rallied the rest of the passengers, and hollerin ""lets roll,"" attacked the hijackers… gimme a break!!

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","""externalities"" like environmental destruction are solved by including them in liability. The problem now is that liabilities are dodged by businesses. You just have to come up with a coherent and rational system whereby people's ""stakes"" in the ecosystem are measured.

This would probably take the form of treating the ecosystem itself as a commons (meaning usage restrictions insofar as usage may cause harm.) This incentivizes people who may do something damaging to the ecosystem into ensuring adequate protections are made for its basis (protected nature preserves, tree farms, etc) since they would only be allowed to do what they're doing if it doesn't cause the whole system to become fubar'd. The free rider problem is solved through a combination of ignoring small time users and the users of the commons having an incentive to having the larger users chip into the common efforts to preserve the order everyone's depending on. By the time you get larger, you're already ""establishment"" anyways, and have a stake in making sure the forest you depend on for your income doesn't get clear cut and scare off the animals or insects, or whatever you were using in the forest to make money.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Disclaimer: I work for the company which originally developed Django, and I'm the release manager for the project and author of a book on Django. Take my opinions with much salt.

So, there are a couple potential axes on which to evaluate this.

One is ""what type of Python developer are you?"" If you've done Python web stuff before, or if you have experience with particular libraries that you like and want to keep using, you may be happier with Pylons -- it's more geared toward ""I know which components I want, give me integration tools to plug them together"".

On the other hand, if you're new to Python or don't have particularly strong attachments to specific tools, you may be happier with Django. I'll explain why in a moment.

Then there's the ""what level do you want to think about"" axis. If you see yourself doing one-off site development projects, or projects where the only reused components are bits of middleware, then Pylons is good stuff.

If, on the other hand, you're looking to develop pluggable bits of code to let you build lots of sites which need to reuse similar functionality over and over, Django's probably a better choice.

What this comes down to, really, is a trade-off:

1. Pylons wants to make it as easy as possible for you to pick components -- URL router, ORM, template system, etc. -- and plug them together. But this means you don't have as much flexibility to reuse applications, because there's no guarantee they'll use the same or compatible component sets. If Application A is Routes, SQLAlchemy and Genshi while Application B is Werkzeug routing, Storm and Jinja, well, getting them talk to each other and share code/data will be tricky (WSGI middleware simply can't handle these types of concerns).
2. Django wants to make it as easy as possible for you to write tightly-focused bits which implement particular features, and then wire them together and share/reuse them over and over. But this means it's not as easy to swap out components in the stack; getting everything to play nice at this level really requires some assumptions about common libraries and APIs in use.

Neither one of these approaches is objectively superior, but typically -- for a given developer in a given situation -- one or the other will be subjectively better. Which one that'll be is up to you.","1238553077"

Your post contains nonsense.

The word ""Capitalism"" merely means an economic system in which wealth, and the means of producing wealth, are privately owned and controlled rather than state-owned and controlled. 

And Wealth occurs whenever people consume less than they produce, which in the majority of cases is as a result of hard work and thrift.

One might argue theft, fraud and corruption also affect the distribution of wealth but these are problems of all economic systems.

Free people (defined as people who interact voluntarily with others and who do not have to ask the permission of unaffected parties or the state before they act) will trade their surplus production with others, thereby making both parties to the trade happier.

There is no ""pursuit of profit before all else"" in a free country, as you claimed. Everyone is free to do whatever they want, including forming socialist communes if they desire.

What I spoke of is the personal journey we are all making toward enlightenment. It is about my personal freedom to not even consider religious concepts in my personal world.

If you must have a them you can be against rather than a cause you can be for, your energy will be spent by others for their needs. Regarding the control of society, I assume you mean the US, which is a plutocratic kleptocracy with an active prison/slavery system of low cost corporate labor. Religion is only tangentially related in as much as it can manipulate the gullible for the state's needs.

You'll also enjoy how antiquated and quaint much of the book is. Rand didn't understand technology or science, so she resorts to anachronistic technologies, made up technologies, and then condemns forms of science she doesn't understand (i.e. research into cosmic rays and particle accelerators is seen as useless and a waste of time in the book.) Some of her anachronistic technologies include the railway. If the railways don't run, people can't get places and they starve. Forget about trucks and ships. The idea that railways would stop providing dining cars on their trains is shocking to Rand. The radio is a prime instrument in the book, culminating with the three hour radio speech, Rand barely mentions TV (compare to Orwell's 1984, written at the same time, where everyone has a ""telescreen,"" it's ubiquitous technology.)

Prepare for highly idealized heroes, uncommonly good looking, smart, capable, well grounded. Especially weaselly and pathetic bad guys.

Prepare for the idea that industry is right and good, the culmination of human civilization. To Rand, a factory belching smoke is a beautiful thing.

There are a few things Rand gets right, but mostly the book is trash. On one hand, it felt like a complete waste of time to read it, on the other hand, I'm glad I can bash Randriods and their stupid little ""bible.""","1238553314"

The global community’s objective is to convince North Korea to open up and accept democratic and economic reforms, and they wonder why North Korea continuously reneges on their deals. Kim Jong Il doesn't want to grow his economy, he doesn't to reduce the abject poverty of his people, its counter to his motives. He just wants to maintain status quo, and wasting everyone’s time does this.

Also counter to his motives is war. War means the end of his rule. No matter what deterrent he has in his arsenal, whether it is long-range artillery or tactical Nukes, he cannot win a war with the US, South Korea, and Japan.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;Yawn. You keep posting this like I've never heard of abductive reasoning. The whole point is that is not the type of reasoning that scientists use. In fact, they never PROVE anything...only DISPROVE IT.

You have *never* heard of abductive reasoning before. We all know it here, cut the crap. You also know nothing about science or its methods. Scientists absolutely do rely on abductive reasoning. I know this because I happen to study it and witness it being used almost daily. I suggest you also look up the problem of auxiliary hypotheses and the theory-laden nature of all observation described here which poses an intractable problem for your falsificationism- http://www.trueu.org/Academics/NerdsCorner/A000000621.cfm (I won’t hold my breath). More about your trite Popperian crap later. 


&gt;therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that universe is expanding. therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that glaciers formed many of the valleys in Colorado's Ten Mile Range therefore, the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that gibbons and orangutans share a recent evolutionary ancestor. therefore the evidence does not nullify the hypothesis that this composite contains boron 

Lol. Unfortunately for you scientists don’t think like that and they make positive claims all the time! Scientists don't defend evolution because the evidence doesn’t merely ""nullify"" it, they defend it because they strongly believe its TRUE. Physicists don't defend the big bang theory because the evidence doesn't nullify it, they defend it because they think its TRUE. Geologists don’t defend the old age theory of the earth because the evidence doesn’t nullify it, they defend it because they think its fucking true. Nobody in scientific practice takes your precious Popperian hypothetico deductivism falsifiability excrement seriously as it doesn't allow scientists to take a firm positive stance on anything. Here’s how it is decribed by Alan Sokal:

&gt;In their book Fashionable Nonsense (published in the UK as Intellectual Impostures) the physicists Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticized falsifiability on the grounds that it does not accurately describe the way science really works. They argue that theories are used because of their successes, not because of the failures of other theories. Their discussion of Popper, falsifiability and the philosophy of science comes in a chapter entitled ""Intermezzo,"" which contains an attempt to make clear their own views of what constitutes truth, in contrast with the extreme epistemological relativism of postmodernism.

&gt;Sokal and Bricmont write, ""When a theory successfully withstands an attempt at falsification, a scientist will, quite naturally, consider the theory to be partially confirmed and will accord it a greater likelihood or a higher subjective probability. ... But Popper will have none of this: throughout his life he was a stubborn opponent of any idea of 'confirmation' of a theory, or even of its 'probability'. ... [but] the history of science teaches us that scientific theories come to be accepted above all because of their successes."" (Sokal and Bricmont 1997, 62f)

&gt; ** They further argue that falsifiability cannot distinguish between astrology and astronomy, as both make technical predictions that are sometimes incorrect. **

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability#Criticisms

The other critiques are also significant.

&gt;The reason you think the scientific method is a logical fallacy is that YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD. 

Unfortunately for you I understand it very well. After all I happen to study it at a high level. The fact that you are completely oblivious of is that your *version * of the “scientific method” is not the one scientists use in practice as it is completely impotent. It rubbishes the concept of scientific knowledge.  Scientists commonly use the abductive scientific method that I illustrated to you earlier. You know absolutely nothing about how Science is actually practiced you ignorant simpleton. Your fundamentalist falsificationism can never allow scientists to take a remotely positive stance that their theories are correct. Their theories merely become hypotheses that haven’t been falsified yet, nothing more. 

And in case you’re going to make the argument that theories are true because they haven’t been falsified you would be committing the argument from ignorance.

AFF= American Family Foundation. Anti-Cult group, basically. Now the ICS (international cultic studies), I believe. NOT affiliated with the current American Family Foundation, which is a Christian Group. I think.


Re the Catholic Church. Yes, I too am critical of aspects of the Catholic Church. The difference is that nobody at the top was ordering the abuse of the children. Many times in cults you'll have different kinds of abuses as written into the rules, etc. Plus, Catholicism is just one part of Christianity. I assure you, my Lutheran upbringing was pretty damn far removed from that.

Yes, the college dropout stat is interesting and I use it to explain the whole 'we must protect the children' reaction to cults in the 70s/80s.

Who joins. Ok, for the cult I'm writing about, who joins is a little different because of recruitment factors. If you'd actually like to know about this, give me your e-mail or an instant messenger name and I'll tell you all about it, I just don't want a public record of the specifics. I'm sure you understand.

Women, more likely to joint possibly because they are more likely to seek psychological help in general. That's just me putting two and two together.

Intelligence. Smart people are more likely to be inquisitive? More likely to be seeking some explanation? I dunno. It's an important fact to remember, though, that these people are not just dumbasses who joined something awful.

mental illnesses. There needs to be more research on this. I've only found a handful of studies talking about this, but basically cults apply a large amount of pressure that their answer is the only answer, you must be 100% involved, etc. I know your response will be ""but so does Christianity, etc"" and my response is not like this. Within Christianity there is room for (some) disagreement. Different churches have different stances on abortion, gay marriage, hell, etc. In Ba'hai, I believe, you are encouraged to ask questions of your faith. I guess it's hard to explain the difference without just saying trust me, it's way more intense in cults, but the prevalence of mental illness, etc should tell you that there's definitely a difference.

The play is preceded by the most austere of all preludes: the infinite void, and matter restlessly moving to bring forth it knows not what. Then, by the millionth millionth chance - what tragic irony - the conditions at one point of space and time bubble up into that tiny fermentation which is the beginning of life. Everything seems to be against the infant hero of our drama - just as everything seems against the youngest son or ill-used stepdaughter at the opening of a fairy-tale. But life somehow wins through. With infinite suffering, against all but insuperable obstacles, it spreads, it breeds, it complicates itself: from the amoeba up to the plant, up to the reptile, up to the mammal. We glance briefly at the age of monsters. Dragons prowl the earth, devour one another and die. Then comes the theme of the younger son and the ugly duckling once more. As the weak, tiny spark of life began amidst the huge hostilities of the inanimate, so now again, amidst the beasts that are far larger and stronger than he, there comes forth a little naked, shivering, cowering creature, shuffling, not yet erect, promising nothing: the product of another millionth millionth chance. Yet somehow he thrives. He becomes the Cave Man with his club and his flints, muttering and growling over his enemies' bones, dragging his screaming mate by her hair (I could never quite make out why), tearing his children to pieces in fierce jealousy till one of them is old enough to tear him, cowering before the terrible gods whom he has created in his own image. But these are only growing pains. Wait till the next Act. There he is becoming true Man. He learns to master nature. Science comes and dissipates the superstitions of his infancy. More and more he becomes the controller of his own fate. Passing hastily over the present (for it is a mere nothing by the time-scale we are using), you follow him on into the future. See him in the last Act, though not the last scene, of this great mystery. A race of demigods now rule the planet - and perhaps more than the planet - for eugenics have made certain that only demigods will be born, and psycho-analysis that none of them shall lose or smirch his divinity, and communism that all which divinity requires shall be ready to their hands. Man has ascended his throne. Hence forward he has nothing to do but to practice virtue, to grow in wisdom, to be happy. And now, mark the final stroke of genius. If the myth stopped at that point, it might be a little pathetic (sic). It would lack the highest grandeur of which human imagination is capable. The last scene reverses all. We have the Twilight of the Gods. All this time, silently, unceasingly, out of all reach of human power, Nature, the old enemy, has been steadily gnawing away. The sun will cool - all suns will cool - the whole universe will run down. Life (every form of life) will be banished, without hope of return, from every inch of infinite space. All ends in nothingness, and ""universal darkness covers all."" The pattern of myth thus becomes one of the noblest we can conceive. It is the pattern of many Elizabethan tragedies, where the protagonist's career can be represented by a slowly ascending and then rapidly falling curve, with its highest point in Act IV. You see him climbing up and up, then blazing in his bright meridian, then finally overwhelmed in ruin.","1238553597"

Frankly, I think this illustrates my point perfectly. Eritrea has incredibly strict controls on outflow of information, so very few people are aware of how bad things are there. Israel, on the other hand, has a spotlight on everything it does, thanks its freedom of the press and reluctance to imprison and execute journalists.

If Israel wanted to starve Gaza to death, or commit genocide, it would have killed far more than it actually has. I'm not defending the economic blockade, it is unjust and inhumane. But it is patently *not* intended to wipe out the Palestinian people.","1238553705"

GM carried a lot of US sales on fleet deals, particularly for it's sedans. Granted GM made a killing in the light truck and SUV market but at the expense of ignoring many of it's brands for coupes and sedans particularly Chevy and Pontaic. 

If you went out to buy a car in the last 10-15 years it became increasingly difficult to for GM coupes and sedans to compete with the import makers on multiple levels. This became most stark in the first part of this decade with regards to options and build quality for the money spent. 

Don't get me wrong, I have been a GM fan or many years, have 4 GM products in my driveway right now and have followed the company quite closely. It has been sad to watch the company foul up it business in a drive for short term SUV sales with only minimally looking toward the next 10-15 years and what the market needed. Not to mention numerous missteps in technology and platforms since the late 80s.

I can only hope that the recent changes will not see GM fold but emerge a changed company that will have hopefully learned it lessons as well as found someway to shed the legacy costs it still has to deal with.","1238553812"

Figures indicate Colin McRae Rally did 2.79 million on PlayStation alone. Did DiRT reach that with PS3, Xbox 360 and PC combined?

I think those are false alternatives. Personally I work to a very simple moral code - that which is beneficial to conciousness is good, and that which is detrimental to conciousness is bad. 

This seems potentially universal to me, but the actual application of it will vary in different situations. The goodness or badness of an action is dependent on the effects of that action.  

To ignore the effects of one's actions in favour of following outmoded scripture is likely to result in bad actions. In everything you do, you should be mindful of the consequences and strive to benefit conciousness. This to me is moral behaviour.","1238553947"

As well, 109-bit keys have been broken before; sure, it took a tremendous effort, but from a cryptographer's point of view, that means a 110-bit key is simply Not Good Enough.

I have to say, most of my time thinking about ECC schemes was devoted to trying to transmit only a single curve point as the key (using tricks like hardcoding or otherwise embedding a second point, among other possibilities).

Point is, with regard to climate change, we shan't believe all we're told by the friendly man in the movie with a PowerPoint presentation. There's a lot of science out there that draws into question the validity of the most prevalent theories of climate change. I don't have a link on me, alas, but there was a study out from UW-Milwaukee just the other day that suggested that starting around 1970, the climate was on what ended up being about a thirty-year warming trend, and that that trend is now reversing into a cooling trend.

I was raised under morality taught to me by my parents at a very young age.  If, let's say I was born into Ghengis Kahn's mongolian empire, I wouldn't care at all to kill my neighbor, I would be killing all of the time.  

Morality is a very complicated subject. The human being is highly impressionable at a very young age.  Also, next time you're around little children whose parents don't care to much to discipline them, notice how violent they are towards one another.

With a debit card, the authorization is the completion from the bank's perspective.  The money is removed from your account.  If the communication prevents the merchant from receiving acknowledgment of this, it creates a situation where the bank thinks they sent the money, and the merchant thinking they didn't.  The authorization will not fall off on it's own, and depending on the merchant, retrieving your money will be either a small headache or a massive migraine.

Sure, I had the preachy period in there somewhere, but what kid hasn't (at least ""preaching"" Objectivism gives a vastly different perspective from the standard fundamentalist Christian and far leftie).

A Mac has a custom-designed logic board and other internal components

OSX is much easier and more enjoyable to use than XP or Vista

Windows supports a shitload of applications.  And a load of shit is what 95% of them are.

OSX Macs some with what most reviewers agree are the best applications available for photos, video, music, etc.

Windows can play a lot of games.  If I had time to play games, I'd get one of the PCs I built out of the closet.


So where is the value to me of a cheap ass PC?


Multiple studies have shown that Macs last longer, are cheaper to maintain, and retain their value better than Windows PCs.  And when a Mac user has a problem, Apple's service and support has been rated the best in the industry by Consumer Reports EVERY YEAR for the past decade.  You can ignore these obvious signs of quality if you want, though.  I expect you will.

In one of my geology classes in college (in Houston), the professor was friends with a guy who owned a famously crooked house (apparently geologists loved to stop by this house during conventions and such; no accounting for what some folks call ""fun"") in the area.  The house was built on a fault line (as most houses in Texas are, it seems), and over time one side of the house had risen while the other sank.  There was about a 2 foot differential from one end to the other, that had developed over the life of the house, and it was still changing about an inch or two every year.  Every couple of years, the guy would reset the doors that wouldn't close any more and repair cracks in the walls.  He had actually bought the house knowing about all these problems because he couldn't afford to live in the neighborhood (a very nice one) any other way, and had gotten the house for about half the going price in the area.  He just accepted that as the cost of sending his kids to a great school and living in a really nice neighborhood.

The engine and transmission actually break free from their mounts and are directed **downward**, so they slide *underneath* the car in a head on collision.

You don't seem to understand the fact that one division of a company may actually have many subdivisions and departments.

AIGFP not only had some legally separate sub-entities (Banque AIG, AIG Matched Funding, and I forget what else), but it also had a whole lot of different departments within AIGFP.

So yes, most AIGFP employees worked on products that made money, in departments that made money.  Believing that makes you intelligent and capable of basic understanding, not a lemming.

That said, it's pretty clear you aren't actually interested in understanding anything.  I can only assume that if GE Power went down because of their nuclear products, that you'd blame the wind turbine employees as well... after all, your mistake in this matter is *THAT* far off.","1238554875"

I've been single since late October.

I'm a pretty independent person, I just miss the companionship and emotional intimacy I guess. It's also a little bit hard that most of my friends are in long-term relationships, so I sometimes feel like a fifth wheel. The last time I managed the happily single thing, most of my friends were also single. It makes it easier to hit the town and have some fun I guess.

I've been on online dating sites since the start of the year and have met some lovely guys (and have made 3 good friends). I just want to make sure I'm not entering something new for the wrong reasons.

Then again cops might become over confident in the use of their guns like they have taseres. There must be a solution. 

Instead of rubber bullets how about lower power bullets? I saw on the history channel a lot of old timey prisons would give their guards bullets with less gun powder because they would be staying up long shifts. So if they accidently shot some one in their grogginess there would be a slightly better chance they would survive. Still extremely lethal, but less than a normal bullet.

"obama","t5_1a8ah","&gt;everyone charges the same for it, there is no competition for price

They charge the same price for the same quality? That makes sense. They keep each other in check. The test whether competition keeps prices low isn't to say ""everyone charges the same,"" but to get rid of all the sellers except for one (or a small group). The price would go up. The more people are in the game, the more everyone has to make sure their price is competitive.

There could be a price-fix scheme going on, of course, but I haven't seen any evidence for that. A gram costs $20, ok. So that's what people will sell it for...round number, easy enough. But look at alcohol. Smirnoff isn't always the same price as Absolut. But if Smirnoff was the *only* vodka available, you can bet your ass the price would go up.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Well, first, as I said, I apologize for the overly hostile tone, I did not intend to come across that way, though (as from the edit) I realized after that I did.

I will say though that the eleh-veh-eleh-nechonim principle is one that, near as I can tell, is basically a ""hrm, how can we come up with an excuse to avoid having to say one of the 'great wise ancient ones' were wrong about anything...""

Now, I don't necessaraly think anyone went and said ""hee hee, how can I trick people so as to maintain the authority of the 'ancient wise ones'"" but rather ""they clearly cannot be wrong about anything! they just can't. but... they contradict each other. um.. um... aha! All seeming contradictions they utter must actually be, in a mystical transcendent way, not contradictions.""

Incidentally, as far as Schrodinger's cat, the short version is that it seems that what reality really operates on is configurations, rather than individual particles. ie, imagine the space of all possible arrangements of particles. (well, can be viewed instead as configurations of waves, but no matter) Anyways, then associate with each of those configurations a quantum amplitude. That is a complex number. The rules of QM basically say how that field of quantum amplitudes over configuration space flow and change. So part of configuration space corresponds to live cat, other parts to dead cat, and both of those will have peaks. The big remaining mystery, as I understand it, is the born statistics, which can be stated as ""and for some reason, we subjectively experience chunks/blobs of reality with probability proportional to the square of the absolute value of the quantum amplitude associated with that blob."" That's the key to actually extracting specific predictions of what we'll actually observe out of QM, and also, for various reasons, the mystery piece that doesn't seem to fit, though some are working on the problem. Whoops, digressed again. I tend to babble. :D

And it is faith itself that I fundamentally reject. You might say I happen to incidentally thing god doesn't exist, but faith is what I consider truly toxic.

I'm listening to the ""faith"" thingie now. ugh... so far not impressed. Probabilities _DO_ count. (Arguably _NOTHING_ can be known with infinite certainty) Listening to more of it. So far not too much I haven't heard before, to be honest. Says it's not actually faith, but some of his arguments are... shaky. (for instance: ""the world is a random chaotic mess or someone designed it."" Nope, those are not the only two options. There's also ""something about the natural laws give rise to an organizing principle that is _NOT_ a mental entity, that is not a willful entity that takes deliberate planned action"", for instance.) Not exactly up to the same standards of argument as some more scientific enterprises. ie, when one weighs the evidence, well, the scales don't, near as I can tell, tilt in favor of this.

How about this:

What is a set of beliefs? It is a map of reality. I believe there is a computer in front of me. I believe that to the extent time can be meaningfully said to exist (there're some interesting bits of physics speculation that suggest we can completely remove time from the equations, but I digress) the earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, etc etc etc...

Some of my beliefs may me right, some may be wrong.

I desire to believe true things and disbelieve false things. I desire my map of reality to be as accurate as possible, that is, for my map of reality to reflect the territory as much as possible.

This is not my only desire, but it is one of them, for I am curious.

Actually, hang on. Instead of more or less rewriting all of this, lemme give you a link to something I wrote a while back: http://psy-kosh.livejournal.com/949.html (it's a bit long, partway through though it switches to replies to specific things that were said on the phone)

Oh, as far as Shamai chasing the guy away with the stick... uh, what's your point? All I was doing was saying ""The wise ancients, who you explicitly stated that if, by nothing else, by virtue of coming before us automatically had better wisdom, seemed to give rather different summaries of what they considered the core of Judaism, that is, different than what you claimed was the core"".

"technology","t5_2qh16","Google has launched a number of initiatives to improve their voice recognition technology (ie: speech to text). Goog411 and voice search on the iPhone are just a couple examples of ways Google gathers test data to feed their hungry speech recognition algorithms.

I was watching tv tonight and I saw an ad for court recorder vocational school. It went something like this. Train to become part of exciting court cases as a court recorder (the person who writes down what everybody says in court). It’s the perfect example of a job that could and should be done at least partly by a computer because computers are destined for jobs that are dangerous, dirty, BORING or any combination thereof.  Let’s face facts. Being in a court room when you are not personally involved in the case is a boring, boring job. Now imagine having to pay attention to every detail and type it up.


So where does Google come in? Well, it could record the entire proceeding from a microphone on each active member and several other microphones around the room. It could then run speech recognition on the individual microphones and provide the text to the court reporter. The algorithms could receive feedback from the court reporter on its accuracy. This could improve the speed of record keeping and cause fewer court interruptions. For extra points the microphones around the room could improve speech recognition technology’s ability to filter out background noises by comparing results from on-person microphone data to results from around-the-room microphone data. 
This will not help record nonverbal cues, but it could be a good thing for everyone.

I thought we did already.  I remember in high school being taught about some of the more interesting effects of pcp and lsd... they told us about what cocaine triggers in your brain and why it feels so good.  It was beyond the ""you will try to fly off buildings"" and coke was more than just something to make your heart explode.  Though they did put Marijuana on par with cigarettes...

I didn't realize Biden was actually formally against telling people about the real effects of drugs.  I didn't realize that was part of the legislation he pushed through, and that he supported.

Palin, on the other hand, actively wants to keep good information out.  If Biden is actively or has actively pushed legislation to stop education about different kinds of drugs and their actual effect, then yeah, I'll throw the hypocrite flag out there.  I just haven't seen that evidence yet.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I HATE to play devil's advocate, especially in favor of the banks. That being said, remember those papers you signed when you opened your account? With your signature, you acknowledged those policies(overdraft ""protection"", 24 hour+ turn around on your deposits)YES, THEY ARE BULLSHIT. But you agreed to them, and if you don't want to put up with them anymore then close your account and take it to a different bank. There are plenty of smaller banks and credit unions that credit your account for deposits right away, and tend to be more understanding if you do overdraft your account. 					*Also, in reply to the article, they fail to mention that even with an opt-in program your bank account won't necessarily decline a charge if you don't have the funds in your account. The whole idea of 'actual' vs. 'available' balances work out very well for banks and credit unions alike. When things are run as credit (rather than debit) and the amount they are 'pended' for is available, the institution will not decline the charge. Say for example you have $50 in your account, and you go to a restaurant and your bill is $18; hopefully you're tipping on top of that and it comes out to $23. Then you go to the gas station and pump $10 worth of gas. Then you goto restaurant #2 and charge another $20 (25 with tip) tab. Your card would not get declined for any of these transactions because 18+20+10 is 48. But, when the 'pending' charges go through and hit your account as the full amounts with tips added in, you will have overdrafted your account and accrue one of those $35 dollar fees. But of course, that's not something that your bank will tell you unless you ask point-blank.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Long story short: Dude, forest from the trees. Look around.

Because I'm bored, I'll explain why it's relevant to the topic:

* You link to a site. Others are allowed to comment on that site. I noted I could pretty much pick off most of the comments that site used. You do not dispute this, so I assume you also accept that their arguments are pretty much ""fail boat"" criteria. Discussing that site would be on topic, since this topic is about hummers and/or big SUV's/trucks.

* This topic has a lot of big car bashing. So much so, that there is usually no logical basis for them and whatever logic *is* there, if applied to anything else, would fall apart. Take, for example, the arguments about how bigger cars are more dangerous to small cars. What about motocycles? Mopeds? Pedestrians? Bicycles? Should we be allowed small tanks if they fit on the road? (taxes come from *gas consumption*, so SUV's *do* pay more for taxes as well as for the roads *you* drive on) Banning them or applying outrageous prices is just plain stupid. Might as well apply ""unhealthy"" fee of 10,000% for Taco Bell since it's not very healthy. Just doesn't apply.

* I'm also talking about your attitude, which directly corresponds to this topic and how you posted it. It serves the community added benefit when others say ""uhh, that's bullshit and I think you're trolling"". That is NOT off topic. Going off topic would be further discussing his trolling techniques and then how your grandfather passed a kidney stone. THAT would be off topic. I'm merely discussing your attitude about *this* topic.

These are the three key points in what I wrote. In your response, you wrote nothing to dispute /any/ of those but instead decided to apply the little bit of authority you have (down vote / up vote) in an attempt to feel better about yourself (this is a guess, I may be wrong) because you took it personal.","1238555262"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","This is just so charmingly naive. Do you honestly believe that you could form this 'perfect society' if you were free from government intervention?

As James Madison said ""If men were angels, no government would be necessary.""

As men are never angels, government is fundamentally necessary. And, as men are more frequently demons than angels, or at the least the demons have far more impact, it is necessary for government to adjust the inequality inherent  in our flawed systems. 

It is human nature to exploit each other and to break the rules. So, it falls on government to correct this, as best it can. We create institutions with the purpose creating a more perfect system. And if an institution is properly constructed it is self correcting and will eventually overcome its shortcomings.

I know you likely have a deep seated mistrust of government and you do have a bizarre faith in the ability of markets to prevent monopolies and concentrations of power, but when the facts are in a 'free' system as you advocate would last until the first man struck another for his posessions, then it would descend into total anarchy.

This is why pure capitalism is bad, and why pure ""socialism"" is bad, and why you must have a mix of both in order to have a sound, functioning, postmodern economy.

That being said, I was never explicitly told not to kill my neighbor, yet I don't. I have empathy. I have a grasp on the fact that if I kill, others may want to kill me; if I steal, others may want to steal from me, etc., etc.

""Facts support that there is currently a rise in STDs and pregnancy rates among adolescents. Condom distribution can greatly reduce these rising numbers and is the most cost-effective means of protecting oneself (Minch, 2003). Did you know “AIDS is the sixth leading cause of death among those 15-to-24 years old” and that syphilis is on the rise? In today’s society the idea of condoms and contraceptives is a taboo topic. Children are encouraged to have ‘safe sex’ but have no access to condoms and contraceptives (Dodd, 1998). For example, many stores have the condoms located behind the counter. For some, they believe that condom distribution will encourage children to have sex. But, there is no current correlation with an increase in sexual activity rate in youth and condom availability (Dodd, 1998). This is supported by a study done in a Los Angeles High school, where 1,945 students in grades 9-12 completed an anonymous survey related to sex behavior and related knowledge (Schuster, 1998). The results from the study concluded that there was no significant rise in the overall percentage of males or females that had ever had vaginal intercourse or who had intercourse during the year prior to the survey (Schuster, 1998)."" - http://209.85.173.132/search?q=cache:HoKf_VWcK_EJ:www.plu.edu/~applebkj/doc/issues-paper.doc+condom+distribution+lower+pregnancy+std&amp;cd=2&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a","1238555582"

"reddit.com","t5_6","It's all about the fear from the parents. If a parent gives their kid a condom and threatens punishment, what happens when the kid runs out? The parent knows they are using them... do you punish the kid?

If a parent does give out condoms and does not punish the kid, then you lose the fear of ""I shouldn't have sex or my parents would kill me"".

If the parents don't give out condoms and threaten punishment, the it's one more obstacle for the kid to get by before they will have sex.

What a better question would be is: Is it ok to use fear to get kids to stop doing things above a cerain age and instead guide them and allow them to make their own decisions? (let's say, 16 -- the age where, I argue, we should be guiding them instead of making them be stealthy; having a trusful relationship is *very* important).

One would have to be a fool to assume the age of 18 is when you lose guardianship and then the kid makes all their own decisions and parents instantly walk away. That's throwing the kid to the wolves. They need to be guided and taught from their mistakes. I argue any and all mistakes should be accompanied with a well thought out reason for not doing it other than ""God says so"" (otherwise, we would still have slaves and would be stoning people to death) and other than ""because I said so"".

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","This is one of the most off the mark criticisms of a work of fiction I've ever read.

&gt; *entire second paragraph*

First, it's a fictional book, and like many others, it includes some made up technologies and concepts (keep in mind the context of the conversation here, comparing to LOTR).  Second, even if it was *claiming* to be realistic, is there something that led you to believe it was supposed to take place in a time where televisions, cargo shipments by truck, and particle accelerators are commonplace?  No, the setting is left unspecified as in many books; I assumed early 20th century when I read it.

I guess by your logic if I write a novel tomorrow that takes place in the early 1990s, and paint a less-than-venomous picture of AOL to fit with this setting, it must mean that I, as an author, know jack shit about science and technology.

&gt; Prepare for highly idealized heroes, uncommonly good looking, smart, capable, well grounded. Especially weaselly and pathetic bad guys.

Many, many authors across all time periods and genres of fiction use idealized heroes and weaselly bad guys.  Not sure what your point is here.  Perhaps you're trying to say she did it poorly but it wasn't really clear.

&gt; Prepare for the idea that industry is right and good, the culmination of human civilization. To Rand, a factory belching smoke is a beautiful thing.

The factory is obviously symbolic of production and creation of wealth.  Now you may disagree it's a good symbol for this, or that production is something to be idealized.  But in that case go after the idea and not this red herring.

And if you're taking issue with the smog thing, a bit of historical context would do some good here.  In the 1950s, very few people had the foresight to see that pollution and global warming would be major consequences of heavy industrial production, and Rand was obviously not one of them.

Full seat belts (as opposed to lap belts) reduce the capacity of buses so the increase in price goes beyond the cost of the special seats and their impact on survivability in accidents is lower than most people think.  School bus seats are designed so that each seating area is like a compartment.  They are designed and rigorously tested so that a child is unlikely to suffer major injures during a forward impact which are the impacts that usually result in the highest accelerations.  Having said that, seat belts (not lap  belts) are a good thing but if a school has X dollars to spend on buses and adding seat belts reduces the number of buses they can afford (and therefore bus to school) then it's better to do without because even without the belts, buses are MUCH safer than cars.","1238555905"

Also, that reminds me - if you are using C#, sign your assemblies, and make the hackers have to patch the security of the user's PC to skip the digital signature checks.

Drinking a mild poison, then breastfeeding for example; or painting the nursery with lead paint prior to giving birth, and then years later the child develops severe disabilities.

Generally, if a woman doesn't want to be pregnant, then she has a right to end the pregnancy. If she does want to have the child, then she has a duty of care to take reasonable measures to ensure its future health and safety.

and oh yes, if you beg for it, I will blackmail you...get some compromising photos of you in your sissy clothes and then laugh as you find yourself weeping, exposed, publicly displayed like some sort of circus sideshow freak...and indeed, a freak you are. I will beat you and have you eating my scraps from the floor, scrubbing my toilets... I will cover you in syrup and pillow feathers, and then tarred and feathered you will dance for me...I am a cruel and merciless being, a Domme and humiliatrix... 

to get a sense of My wicked ways, go to you-tube, and search for ""yourruinawaits"".... you'll catch a glimpse of a bit of my recent handiwork, as I spank, sissify, and expose a couple of local fool. evil: it's the sort of thing you should expect from Mistress! you'll see some footsucking, a bit of forced sissification, an untender spanking, and a particularly vile ""clown"" (here I use this term literally!) getting tarred and feathered. 

if you like what you see, if you tremble at the thought of becoming My next victim, well...contact me. but be warned: this Domme is NOT for the faint of heart.

"science","t5_mouw","Yeah, I guess your definition of a ""working"" fusion reaction could be quite a bit different.

It is a viable method, don't get me wrong. But feasible on a large, power generation scale? I don't think it ever will be, because of the level of refinement and sophistication that lasers must achieve just to provide consistent inertia on the fuel pellet.

Although magnetic/plasma confinement hasn't been much more successful, but at least in those cases there seem to be less nitpicky things that can go wrong.

And slashing to fusion budgets has been a problem ever since the test-ban treaties and the failure of the big laser and tokamak projects time and time again. But I really do think we should be putting some serious cash into these projects because I think fusion is going to be the end-game as far as energy generation goes. Look at nature and our universe. Where does our planet get its energy from? The sun, a massive fusion reaction.

But we're having a hard enough time convincing the public to fund relatively short-term projects like the restructuring of NASA, there's no way we're going to see any increase in funding to fusion in the near future, especially with the environmental concerns surrounding nuclear energy as it is.","1238556503"

Two weeks ago I was driving on the freeway. A white van two cars ahead of me started to slow, then stopped *hard*. The woman in front of me screeched to a halt, I nearly hit her and veered to the shoulder, and the person behind me smacked into her car. 

We all pulled over. The driver in front of me explained that the guy in the van said she was following him too closely, so he slowed down. I saw what happened - he didn't ""slow down,"" he *stopped* on a fucking freeway. 

She didn't hit him, I didn't hit her. I know exactly what happened to the driver behind me - she ate up time slowing as I slowed, then I pulled over to the side and she was looking at a stopped car. It's happened to me before - it's *very* hard to avoid hitting that stopped car. 

And say what you want about following distance - with today's USAian drivers, leaving six car lengths just means someone's going to cut in front of you. 

The cop that finally showed up let the guy in front go. He came up to me, asked which car was mine. He asked ""did your car strike another car?"" I said no, and he said ""you can go"" and walked away. 

I'm positive he ticketed the poor kid behind me for ""following too closely"" - fucking moron. I gave her my card; I hope she fights it and calls me as a witness. ","1238556527"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Use a key file instead of a serial number. Our key file contained contained information about which features were enabled instead of a simple yes/no like a serial number. The software also allowed multiple key files to be installed to enable additional features. We would encrypt and sign the file, but used MUCH larger numbers than your sample program.

Our software fit a slightly different audience, but when somebody purchased our software we would add a license to their online account. They would sign on and generate a key file that could be downloaded or emailed. Something similar could be done within the application itself, but our software was typically run on machines that didn't have internet access.

At trade shows we would hand out branded USB disks with our software and a key file. And yes I am fully aware that a majority of the disks were immediately erased. They cost us next to nothing so it was worth it.

The problem you are going to run into is that it becomes a lot easier to crack the software than to create a keygen. You can put all the safety checks into the software that you want but if somebody has the executable and a bit of skill then there is nothing you can do.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So, the other night, I was planting some lettuce on the patio and my roommate comes out and hands me a small container with something in it and he says, ""For you!""  I asked, ""What is it?"" He says that its some custard he just made.  So, I finished planting, went inside, washed my hands and then proceeded to eat the lemon custard.  It did not taste perfect, but really everything that my roommate makes does not taste perfect, so I just put it down.  For whatever reason, I had another bite and that was the bit that has mortified me since....

I noticed that there was something not even with the consistency of the custard and almost like a gelatenous strand of bio-material. (cum)  Obviously, I thought the worst of my roommate and it grossed me out so much that I almost started puking and threw it out.  Looking back, that was not the best move if I really thought he might have done that.

So, not to be totally gross, but, uh, we all masturbate, so I have seen my own cum plenty of times, and from time to time, if I don't masturbate for a while (which is rare..haha) I'll have a little build up and it will come out regular looking, but have a few small ""gelatenous strands"" that look like they were in the ejaculatory duct or seminal vesicle for a while.  Ya know what I mean guys?  Have you ever experienced that before?  Well, anyways, I just thought it was just me being weird and would never really think he'd do that to me until yesterday evening....  

I was cooking in the kitchen and telling him about a friend and I cooking.  It basically went like this, ""She(the friend) said to me that she couldn't believe that I didn't watch her make me dinner.  I asked why and she said because she could have poisoned me.""  I looked at my roommate and said, ""Can you believe that?  Who doesn't trust people to make food for them?  My roommate responded, ""Ya never know....I could have put something in your custard the other night.""  I put the two events together, my heart stopped, I almost vomited again, and I just left the house.

There is still custard in the fridge.  My roommate is not home until tomorrow night.  I need to find out how I can tell if there is cum in this custard.  I thought about using a black light, but I don't have one.  Any suggestions on what I should do?  I'm really grossed out about all of this and the worst part is, I don't know if I can even prove something like this....","1238556550"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Differentials definitely provide insight :) The usual proof of the chain rule is heavily guided by considering small changes in the variables. But separation of variables is just a heuristic, in the same way the Leibniz notation suggests (but does not prove!) the chain rule, by canceling the du:

      dy   dy du
      -- = -- --
      dx   du dx.

(Again, we can make all of this formal, but it difficult, and (though very beautiful) holds little advantage over the classical limit notion for these purposes.) 

Differentials *have* been completely eliminated. Separation of variables follows from: if y'(x)f(y(x))=g(x), then y satisfies F(y(x))=G(x)+c, where F,G are antiderivates of f,g and c is an arbitrary constant (with nice assumptions probably). The differential notation suggests this, which is why we use it. This is just the chain rule again. If you write y' as dy/dx, you can see why separation of variables like you suggested works. The dy/dx notation is awesome mostly for the chain rule :)

IMHO I tend to think of calculus as based on approximation. Derivatives approximate by straight lines, integrals, by piecewise constant (simple) functions, we approximate continuous functions by smooth functions, &amp;c. The tools we use, (the limit, differentials, sheaves, etc.) are somewhat secondary. So don't worry too much.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I would think the definition of capitalism is rather: *the private ownership of the means of production (capital)*.

Furthermore, I do not quite think that Marxian communism, in the sense of *the final stage of development of human society*, would require the redistribution of wealth. Merely, the means of production (capital) would be owned communally and the fruits of one's labor would be one's own (unlike capitalism where a part of it goes to the capitalist). 

I think the economic egalitarianism you are talking about is more a quality of socialism, where the redistribution of wealth takes place in order to make economic society more equitable.

Taxation *can* and *does* theoretically exist in capitalist states, because there are public goods that will not be provided by free market capitalism (do not confuse the idea of free markets with the idea of capitalism), and negative externalities that must be curbed.

Lastly, although I would say that a minimum level of income is necessary in order for liberty, that is not the sole factor of liberty: if, in a ""communist"" state (and like you say, there have been no true communist states in the world) I am not able to express any political opinion, because the transcendence of politics has taken place, and I am under the dictatorship of the Communist Party, then I am not really free; I do not have civil liberties. However, and I think this is what you are getting at, I may be better off under it than under an economic system where I would be in a desperate economic situation; as long as I am fed and sheltered and relatively worry-free about the future, then I am doing better. This still does not necessarily mean that I have more liberty, merely that I have more of a fundamental of life that is more important than liberty.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Now consider the tortoise and the eagle.

The tortoise is a ground-living creature. It is impossible to live nearer the ground without being under it. Its horizons are a few inches away. It has about as good a turn of speed as you need to hunt down a lettuce. It has survived while the rest of evolution flowed past it by being, on the whole, no threat to anyone and too much trouble to eat.

And then there is the eagle. A creature of the air and high places, whose horizons go all the way to the edge of the world. Eyesight keen enough to spot the rustle of some small and squeaky creature half a mile away. All power, all control. Lightning death on wings. Talons and claws enough to make a meal of anything smaller than it is and at least take a hurried snack out of anything bigger.

And yet the eagle will sit for hours on the crag and survey the kingdoms of the world until it spots a distant movement and then it will focus, focus, focus on the small shell wobbling among the bushes down there on the desert. And it will leap . . .

And a minute later the tortoise finds the world dropping away from it. And it sees the world for the first time, no longer one inch from the ground but five hundred feet above it, and it thinks: what a great friend I have in the eagle.

And then the eagle lets go.

And almost always the tortoise plunges to its death. Everyone knows why the tortoise does this. Gravity is a habit that is hard to shake off. No one knows why the eagle does this. There's good eating on a tortoise but, considering the effort involved, there's much better eating on practically anything else. It's simply the delight of eagles to torment tortoises.

But of course, what the eagle does not realize is that it is participating in a very crude form of natural selection.

One day a tortoise will learn how to fly.

You mention that neither approach is objectively superior, but I would argue that with Pylons you can have your cake and eat it too.  Just because it's very easy to swap out different components with Pylons, doesn't mean that you have to.   You can easily standardize on a set of tools that you use across all projects, which will allow you to ""write tightly-focused bits which implement particular features, and then wire them together and share/reuse them over and over"". You can even create your own template for new projects.

I'm sure the counter argument to this is that with Django you have an entire community using the same basic tools so you can reuse code created by that community.  I can see this being a good argument to those new to python and/or web development, but I've personally found it very easy to ""glue"" together different tools from many other projects into my pylons apps.

However, people like you would value the local grower just like other people prefer to buy locally grown organic produce from a family farm, handmade jewelry, or micro-brewed beer. Of course, it's more expensive, but why not allow a cheaper product to exist, too? I'll buy my 2 Buck Chuck and you'll buy your fancy pants organic local wine. Or, since micro-breweries still exist, I'd wager the skilled local growers would, too. People who know what's good will provide the demand for the skilled growers. 

I just can't believe that a large company would make it so cheap that the local growers are out of the game, although it is *possible*. I'd prefer more expensive good stuff than cheaper moderate stuff, and so would many, many people. And we'd keep those guys in business.

Of course, if the regulations are horrible, that's another story. With legalization, people have to fight for fair policy, but that's no different than having to fight for fair policy with respect to decriminalization, or any other industry or field of policy. But I think the micro-brewery point is the most sound and gives me the most faith that small operations of high quality marijuana wouldn't be lost. You didn't have to buy that $9 beer, but you did.

This is exactly what I mean by stating: irrespective of any one redditors personal point of view, actions like this harm everyone and demean the entire site.

By all means, down vote every post or comment I make. Dislike or even hate me because of the positions I take on a topic. Better still answer back, I'm certainly not averse to an open honest discussion on any topic I take the time to post or comment on. 

In fact it was an exchange with this vile cretin posing under the name of 0cin yesterday that started this whole issue. Because of his inability to engage me, he instead deleted his appropriated name for yesterday, then assumed mine.

I understand that emotions on any side of an issue can get to the best of us, however, I never expected someone would stoop this low.

I used to get angry at the child like actions of the serial down voters who would down vote every comment a poster made, because they're utterly incapable of anything other than childlike moves like these.

This vile fuck has taken it to a new level...sunshine on his pathological actions is the only curative to keep him from spoofing other redditors names.

Clearly, this whackjob is consumed by his hate, compounded by his inability to present his positions in a concise manner.

He's the only one who should be made to suffer his numerous shortcomings. Someone as uncomfortable as this bastard is in his own skin should be called out for his lack of originality and imagination rather than dismissed as part of posting on reddit.

Isn't there a dis-connect in thinking that what is best for yourself is always best for society? Are there not times when it is better to sacrifice for a greater good? Or is it just relabeling sacrifice as self-interest?

Among other things the book is credited with the first appearance of truth tables as we know them.  He derived probability from logic. and demonstrates how numbers and mathematics arise naturally from propositional logic.
A lot of it always reminds me of object oriented programming too.

The book is also free and really short ~70 pages.  It's usually ranked as one of the most important logic books of the 20th century.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Okay so besides your mythical definition of better lets try to quantify things, in the interest of time I'm just gonna compare OpenSUSE to Arch in 3 tiers, packages, userbase, and stability.

1 Packages: In total Arch supports only about 5000 packages both i686, and x64. This is found by their online repo browser.

OpenSuSE supports 7.5k packages on x64 alone. As done by

zypper search| grep "" package""| grep -v debuginfo | grep -v debugsource| grep -v -- '-doc'| grep -v 32bit| wc -l

While Arch has the AUR, OpenSUSE has the Packman Repository which is like the RPMFusion repo for Fedora, providing stable 3rd party constantly tested support for about 3000 packages not found on the default system that might be of interest. OpenSUSE also has tons of 3rd party repos, as well as the OpenSUSE build service which builds software for all versions of OpenSUSE, as well as other popular distros.

According to Distro watch OpenSUSE has historically had 3x the userbase of Arch according to their HPI measurement, over the last year, and OpenSUSE currently has the second largest community according to distrowatch.

Lastly Arch is a bleeding edge distro, it's not focused much on stability but it does happen sometimes. It's impossible to have a stable system on ARch that is several months old and easily upgrade unlike OpenSUSE which is not a rolling release. OpenSUSE is focused on being a stabled hardened testbed for SEL, with a rigorous package testing and bug reporting, unlike Arch whose team sometimes rolls out 3 updates of the same package in a day because there were enough bug reports on it being built wrong. In some cases it's been a show stopper (see Arch Forums).

"technology","t5_2qh16","Ok, there are many things wrong with this article.  There are lots of details left out.  I suspect as this case plays out you will find insiders in Comcast in that local branch because a lot does not compute.

First off, I worked in the Cable industry in a smaller market.  I deployed cable modem systems to Cable operators and ran one myself.

This guy either had 35 different accounts or a single account with 35 different deployments.  Either is possible.  Many landlords own multiple properties and some choose to include cable as part of the rent.  Sometimes this extends to Internet too.  Pricing schemes for the landlord can either be a full blown ""commercial package"" costing hundreds per month per drop (this can be bulk-package pricing) or each drop could be considered ""residential"" if the premise is to be leased to a consumer.  A lot of this depends on local county, city, and state laws because cable companies are monopolies in their respective districts.  The law will vary.  In my area the landlord gets to setup a residential rate per drop to incorporate into his rental price.  If the renter wants HBO, the renter purchases that themselves from the local cable operator, they either get a special filter or a different set top box to decode the signal for that channel (with todays digital age they usually just provide the MAC address of the converter and then they get that channel.)

What really gets my attention in this case is that he was able to simply call Comcast and instead of scheduling an ""install"" they just blindly took his word for it and asked for the MAC address of the modem.  This guy did all the work at each address, splicing into their cables and putting in his own splitters to serve his modem.   That right there is an FCC violation.  He will serve time for that, or a really large fine paid to the US Government, then whatever the judge rules that he owes Comcast.

That is pretty much it.  Discuss as much as you want about reselling commercial bandwidth on consumer lines.  Whatever.  That doesn't matter.  He will be brought down on the FCC charges of tampering with infrastructure of a major communications provider and will spend at least 1 year minimum in prison.

"science","t5_mouw","I'll tell all you twenty-somethings a little secret: I'm 43 years old, and I like everyone else my age, I received about 9 vaccines, and children weren't dying in the streets.  In fact, one could argue that the increased number of vaccines is causing more deaths in the present simply because of the nutjobs, few that they are, who are now avoiding vaccines altogether.  Why are they doing this?  Because like me, they were just fine with their 9 or 10 vaccines.

Big pharma over the past 35 years has successfully lobbied congress mandate one of the biggest payola scams ever: increasing that 9 to over 60 vaccines, and all required if you want your children to be able to get their ""free"" education.

I'm not saying vaccines are all bad.  But things have gotten pretty out of control when nurses take a freshly-delivered baby and scare the shit out of the mother saying she is endangering her baby's life unless they are allowed to administer a Hepatitis B vaccine.  I can understand taking this position if the mother is an I.V. drug user, but to try to force it on every child when they are minutes old is just preposterous, unless of course, you stand to profit from selling the vaccine.  My GF and I (our baby is due in a month) discussed this with our OB, who said the Hep B vaccine is totally optional and unnecessary, but also warned us that the staff at her own hospital would try to force it on us, and told me I had to be prepared to intervene and defend my baby.  That's some bullshit if you ask me.  Why would I want to expose my child to a vaccine before she even got the immunity-building benefits or her mother's milk?  Sure, if the mom has a Hep B risk, then OK, it's better for the child.  But where is the science in putting an unnecessary load on a fledgling immune system?

I also think mandating a chicken pox vaccine or immunity is way over the line too.  What's the worst thing that happens?  ""20 School Children miss a half week of school in Chicken Pox Outbreak"".  In my day, parents had ""Chicken Pox Parties"", where they would bring uninfected children over to play with the kid who had it.

Make no mistake, the ""science"" side of this argument has a strong profit motive.","1238557529"

Were you ever told by your parents not to be rude to others?

Were you afraid of what might happen to you if you acted out and hit another child at school?

Morality is instilled by one method and one method only: fear. I'm not saying that is wrong, it's just a fact of life.  Fear of your parent's punishment, fear of popular opinion of those around you, fear of the Federal Government throwing you in jail, etc., etc. etc.

And people have and will kill their neighbor in cultures all around the world as they have for thousands of years, regardless of their moral code. That includes the Mongols and Christians.  

As for Christianity being imposed on many people all over the world, that should be no surprise to anyone, Christianity uses the method of breaking the individual down after they have 'sinned,' and then using fear of God and punishment to make them obedient. There's fear again, the only way morals will ever be instilled.

So maybe you're special - (you're not) - but don't think for one second someone will not kill their neighbor, Christian, Jew, atheist, or Muslim.  You are a descendant of a killer if you back far enough in lineage, that is undeniable.","1238557551"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;First, it's a fictional book, and like many others, it includes some made up technologies and concepts

Except that most books written by people who understand technology have make-believe technologies that *could* actually exist.

Orwell's telescreen does exist. My laptop has a webcam just above the monitor, I'd never be able to tell if the government was using it to spy on me.

Rand's motor that runs on static electricity is so entirely off-base that only the most bone-headed person could ever believe it to exist. Why not call it a perpetual motion machine and get it over with?

Mithril, as found in the Lord of the Rings, makes sense in its internal universe. Mined by dwarves and found deep underground, it is a rare metal with the properties of gold and steel.

Rearden Metal is a metal alloy that's never once called an alloy in the book. In fact, the only time Rand uses the term ""alloy"" is in a metaphorical context. It's as if she never knew what an alloy was, or that the all important Rearden Metal was an alloy to begin with. Nowadays, the idea of Rearden Metal is quite quaint in the context of aluminum, titanium, and carbon composites.

&gt;Second, even if it was claiming to be realistic, is there something that led you to believe it was supposed to take place in a time where televisions, cargo shipments by truck, and particle accelerators are commonplace? No, the setting is left unspecified as in many books; I assumed early 20th century when I read it.

Yet, the book is embarrassingly trapped in the era it was written in. The entire book screams ""*1940s*!"" No one would assume it was meant to be the future, as such the message seems dated by the very fabric of the story. It certainly doesn't help that the book sings the praises of industrialists, a profession that doesn't really exist anymore.

&gt;Many, many authors across all time periods and genres of fiction use idealized heroes and weaselly bad guys. Not sure what your point is here. Perhaps you're trying to say she did it poorly but it wasn't really clear.

Sure, even Tolkien does it. However, Rand is attempting to present the thesis of her philosophy to the reader through this novel. By making what are essentially ""Mary Sue"" characters, Rand blunts the impact of her philosophy and makes it seem like it wouldn't work in the real world. The characters aren't genuine and the philosophy isn't either.

&gt;The factory is obviously symbolic of production and creation of wealth. Now you may disagree it's a good symbol for this, or that production is something to be idealized. But in that case go after the idea and not this red herring.

No, Rand does a pretty good job of singing the praises of industry, industrialists and factories. She gives very few examples of artistic endeavours as objectivism, and she outright dismisses theoretical sciences.

&gt;And if you're taking issue with the smog thing, a bit of historical context would do some good here. In the 1950s, very few people had the foresight to see that pollution and global warming would be major consequences of heavy industrial production, and Rand was obviously not one of them.

She also saw world resources as unlimited. Drill for as much oil and gas as you can, it'll never dry up. Mine as much metal as you can, those mines will always be full. ll in all, Rand lacked foresight when it came to most subjects.","1238557653"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;Yeah i'm not sure why people seem to think a 4WD car is suppose to stop faster.

Because you have a higher level of control, and thus can decelerate faster without losing control.  I don't know why that's so difficult to understand.  

Hypothetically, 4 wheels, 4 brakes, all else would be irrelevant, assuming both vehicles are on rails with a perfectly smooth surface.  In reality, you have mostly ice, but a little bit of grip here, a little there, a dip in the road, your car pulls to the left a little bit, the tires aren't inflated identically, and have some slight variation in wear patterns / grip from one to the next, you're human and thus don't have god-mode instant reactions, and sometimes you over or under correct, etc.

All that adds up, and an AWD can better deal with it than a RWD, so you can slow down more quickly without ending up with your roof on the pavement.  I'm not saying that 4 powered wheels vs. 2 magically makes braking better, I'm saying that in the Real World, Real Humans can stop a 4WD more quickly than a RWD on a typical city street on an icy road (assuming that wrecking the vehicle or totally losing control / spinning counts as a failure - if you're A-OK with stopping sideways, backward, upside down, in the other lane, on the sidewalk, etc., then sure...any type of drive-wheel arrangement is as good as the next.)","1238557663"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Ahhh I see. *warning rant is about to ensure*

IGN is turning into a shitty video game news site IMO. They are too busy trying to suck publisher's dicks in order to get 'exclusive' content, which in internet terms is about 5 seconds. There are a few good editors...the rest are fanboys who just want to play games before they come out. They are too busy trying to plug their IGN insiders and turn a profit of video game reporting that they loose sight of what gaming is suppose to be---fun. Not to mention their message boards are just full of 12 year olds who just have console wars all day long. I used to read IGN, until I found out there were better sites. Kotaku, and Destructoid are far better, and they update much more regularly. 

The idea of rating a video game is also counter intuitive. It installs an artificial sense of how the game plays. People will ignore games because they are rated below 8.0, and there are games below 8.0 which are good. The way games are rated is highly subjective (you touch this point in your response). You can give a game an 8.9 today, but realize that it actually doesn't actually have any replay value. Shouldn't the game be 'valued' lower if a user can only enjoy it once through? Most of the reviews are done by a deadline which means that the reviewer doesn't have access to all content. They try their best, but the ending could be played in a drastically different way. 

To end my rage full of hate, I haven't read Gamespot since the whole thing about Kane and Lynch went down. It just reaffirmed my idea that they are turning gaming journalism into a corporate machine, which was an extension of publisher's advertisement. 

The reason they gave Noby Noby Boy a 6 is because they are attempting to align the game to other Playstation titles and if they were priced the same. It's very unfair (like my rant above) and needs to be reconsider. I like Kotaku's way of reviewing: they list the positive and negative aspects of the game, and that's basically it. They also do a metareview which looks at other site's reviews and compares them. 

I did know about the two animals~ I played the game for about 10 hours (2 of which I was intoxicated...) and wrote a guide for it on blog (Shameless plug): http://katamaridemocracy.com/2009/02/24/noby-noby-boy-review-and-guide/

I'm looking forward to the add-on~ but I'm afraid it won't fix the 'problem of the commons' the game faces...people will come back for a little bit, grow Girl but leave soon after. I'm afraid Keita Takahashi's worry of Girl not seeing the end of the solar system is a very real problem, that the free iPhone application may or may not fix. ","1238557834"

Really I'm not sure how to deal with it either.  For the past 6 months or so I've basically forced myself in to social situations by surrounding myself with people. Great people!  And I've made it a point just to talk, nay, run my mouth as much as possible.  Even if it's not much, I'll try and think of something awkward or weird somebody did during my week and just tell strange stories.  Sure it means nothing to me, but it means something to other people.  And lucky for me no women are interested in dating me so I'm able to run my mouth without risk of looking bad in front of them!

But really when I get too in to a relationship, I stop answering their calls, and I get quiet and introverted even though I really do wish to be around them.  It's just weird!

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; I'm sure the counter argument to this is that with Django you have an entire community using the same basic tools so you can reuse code created by that community. I can see this being a good argument to those new to python and/or web development, but I've personally found it very easy to ""glue"" together different tools from many other projects into my pylons apps.

Well, this for me really is the strength of Django -- it doesn't matter where an application comes from (maybe I wrote it, maybe somebody else wrote it, maybe it came bundled in `contrib`, etc.), I can use it and the only question is ""does it have the features I want?"" I don't have to worry whether I'll need to install/learn/configure multiple ORM libraries or template systems or whatever to make use of different things and -- most importantly -- I can use them in much deeper ways.

So, for example, if you've written a useful template extension that I'd like, but you use Jinja and I don't, I'm stuck. But if we're both using Django, we're almost certainly both using `django.template` and stuff just works. If you've written a useful ORM abstraction in SQLAlchemy, and I'm using Storm, I'm out of luck; if we're both using `django.db` stuff just works.

For me, and for what I do, the stability of a component stack with a commitment to long-term support and maintenance is worth any flexibility I may lose to choose things at the start of a project.

My advice to myself? Get out of the room. 

Being alone feeds on itself. It can happen to me now - I spend too much time in the pit here and I start to feel isolated. When I get out and spend time with people I feel vibrant and alive. 

Go to the gym, get in shape. Talk to people while you're there. 

Pick up a hobby that requires going somewhere to do stuff. Find a club on campus, join it. 

Take classes in subjects that you're interested in but are outside your major. 

Join study groups. They're excellent ways to motivate yourself to study, but they're also great ways to meet people. Law school study groups are famous for creating friendships for life. 

If you don't follow sports, start. Trust me, I'm an alpha geek and would far rather watch BSG or Star Wars for the 40th time, but if I was in college, I'd be watching football. Football is actually a pretty engaging game to watch, and it's a conversation starter. (""Football"" works whatever continent you live on. ;) )

It sucks to have devoted so much of his life to a nutter like that, but the best thing at this point is to just walk away. She won't change.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","let me just make something perfectly clear here:

IF ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER HAPPENS TO YOU:

first, try to get a competent attorney.  if you don't have one:

the court reporter who transcribed your deposition has a copy of your REAL transcript.  REALLY. no one could ever get away with what was described in this article.  they could go through the motions that were described.  but the appropriate thing for you to do, if it ever happens to you, is to:

(1) ask, no, DEMAND, A COPY of the false testimony that they claim is yours.  the forged testimony. this is very important because it will be evidence of perjury and will put them in jail.  seriously.

(2)  if they refuse to provide you a copy, state these words while the court reporter at the current deposition is still transcribing your testimony: ""let the record reflect that the opposing party has refused to provide me with a copy of what they claim is my prior deposition."" your attorney, if he/she is competent, should state that.  if he/she doesn't, state it yourself. (that's another reason this story sounds fake. any competent attorney could have prevented this whole thing.)

if it is ""signed,"" don't stop there.  someone could take the signed page from a real transcript, and attach it to a completely forged transcript to make it look real. 

(2) look in your personal files and records, as this person (purportedly) did, to find a copy of the real deposition transcript. the one that you signed.  if you have that copy, that will get you a long way.  compare that to the copy that they gave to you.  if you don't have a copy,

(3) contact the court reporter who transcribed the deposition in the original case.  you can get that information from the court. don't bother calling the clerk - they are busy on the phone.  just go down there.  she/he may even be able to give you more information if you show up. just ask people at the courthouse - they'll tell you where to find the court clerk. you will have to order a transcript from the court reporter and it will take a few weeks. once you get it:

(3) CONTACT THE JUDGE IN THE CASE IMMEDIATELY and inform him that the opposing counsel have presented forged evidence.  (same court clerk is who you go through for that.) if you have an attorney, this should take the form of a ""motion for sanctions."" and possibly something more serious.  if you are unfortunate enough to be self-represented, just write a letter or fax a letter to the judge, or get in touch with the court the best you know how.  walk in there if you have to.  but have a written piece of paper in your hand describing what happened.

this is a terrible, terrible thing - forgery of evidence.  it is absolutely incredible to me that someone represented by counsel would just be sitting there with nothing being done.  which is why this story is incredible to me - why would an MD not be represented by counsel?  a judge would act on this in a second.  and be furious.  livid. i have seen judges be furious about misrepresentations far less serious than this.","1238558256"

Maybe they could just give all the cops boomerangs made of brittle clay. They'll be one-shot boomerangs so that even if a cop is really boomerang-happy he only gets one shot.

We should just give cops salamies. Their guns will shoot salamis so that if the target survives and is innocent at least he got a decent though low-in-carbohydrate meal. They don't keep the salami if they were guilty.

I sometimes think cops should eat more carrots.

I've been thinking that a police officer isn't really that different than a hippopotamus. Don't ask me why, I won't have an answer for you.

I've always wondered what would happen if instead of shooting or arresting suspects the police officers just threw them into the sun. Would that be dangerous for the rest of us? I hope not.

Hey, have you ever thought that maybe cops should be rationed donuts inversely proportional to the gunpowder they expend shooting? They might shoot less, or they might engineer their guns to use less gunpowder.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Sexuality is a spectrum.

Right on. Though I've never indulged myself, [pegging](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pegging) is very popular with a lot of straight guys who have no interest in anal sex with an actual man. I'd argue that the same applies to shemales. If the shemale is a proxy for your own closet homosexual desires, then I suppose it is a little gay (whatever that means). But as pegging shows, one doesn't have to be gay to want to take it up the ass or do whatever it is you want with a shemale.

Customization is great, but it's always at the expense of time. I got tired of working on my system rather than working with it. 

Also it's not better on Users (because you cannot empirically measure quality easily), the gentoo community is rather small compared to other distros and they've been losing developers unfortunately. However anecdotally I can say many people on there are very knowledgeable and many are dumbshits.

And stability is rather questionable, ~x86 or ~amd64 are somewhere in between stable and bleeding edge. The edge got dulled down a bit, because the developers weren't looking farther down the path as they should have been, especially with big packages like Java, and Python, I dunno if this is still and issue, having not used the system in a good half a year. The stable keyword is obviously stable as debian pretty much, unless you do some esoteric optimization. In some respects Arch is more bleeding edge than Gentoo in terms of what releases it supports for certain packages officially.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Except that most books written by people who understand technology have make-believe technologies that could actually exist.

Why does this even matter?  As you said later on, her point in writing this was to present a philosophy, not paint a realistic scene and make technological predictions.  She probably spent a lot more time thinking and reading about philosophy than science and it definitely shows.

&gt; Rand's motor that runs on static electricity is so entirely off-base that only the most bone-headed person could ever believe it to exist. Why not call it a perpetual motion machine and get it over with?

Again, this is to plot device.  Come on, you can't **honestly** think Rand legitimately dreamed such a device could ever be invented.  Give me a break.

&gt; Rearden Metal is a metal alloy that's never once called an alloy in the book. In fact, the only time Rand uses the term ""alloy"" is in a metaphorical context. It's as if she never knew what an alloy was, or that the all important Rearden Metal was an alloy to begin with. Nowadays, the idea of Rearden Metal is quite quaint in the context of aluminum, titanium, and carbon composites.

It's been a while since I read the book so I can't comment on the accuracy this.  Seems a bit nit-picky though.  Again, it's a plot device anyway.

&gt; Sure, even Tolkien does it. However, Rand is attempting to present the thesis of her philosophy to the reader through this novel. By making what are essentially ""Mary Sue"" characters, Rand blunts the impact of her philosophy and makes it seem like it wouldn't work in the real world. The characters aren't genuine and the philosophy isn't either.

I somewhat agree here.  The protagonists aren't really believable (no major character faults, for example).  But then again, neither are perpetual motion machines, so I still don't see this detracting too much from the point of the book.

&gt; No, Rand does a pretty good job of singing the praises of industry, industrialists and factories. She gives very few examples of artistic endeavours as objectivism, and she outright dismisses theoretical sciences.

I guess you haven't read *The Fountainhead* where the protagonist is an architect.  Or even *Atlas Shrugged*, apparently, where a major ""good guy"" character is a composer and all the protagonists enjoy fine classical music.

&gt; She also saw world resources as unlimited. Drill for as much oil and gas as you can, it'll never dry up. Mine as much metal as you can, those mines will always be full. ll in all, Rand lacked foresight when it came to most subjects.

Again, you're being dishonest.  Nobody in their right mind would ""make these claims"", including Rand.

All that said, I can agree completely that *AS* is not a great work of fiction qua fiction.  I thought it was when I first read it, but since then I've read *a lot* more and realized how bland and immature Rand's writing style is in many ways.

Look, I enjoyed this exchange, so I'm switching my hastily made downvotes to upvotes.  But I still think you're being rather unfair in your criticism, especially when there are plenty of much more valid criticisms to make (let's take her views on gender and sexuality, for example).","1238558476"

It all goes back to the pathetic use of Jefferson's quote to sell Atheism.  That's my argument, and as a side note I mentioned his immense hypocritical idealism that might remind people that he was also human.  It's not a straw man because I'm arguing about using a quote, not about the quote itself.  

If I quote Hitler as saying: ""Be nice to your neighbor,"" it's kind of useless.

Now that is an extreme example, this case with Jefferson is magnitudes less ridiculous, but can you see what I'm saying?  I'm talking about effectiveness of a quote.

Ultimately, atheists should try not to celebrate a group-think ideology.  They can easily fall into a rabble like the Christians they oppose.  Be skeptical of the atheist movement just like you were skeptical of the teachings of Christianity.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","I disagree. My guess would be that any group who has come to the determination to use what we would define as terror (killing of innocents/civilians) as a means to an end hasn't given much thought to something like the Catholic doctrine of double effect. Especially in light of the conditional coverage their own religions offer in order to absolve the actors from any deep moral self-questioning or reflection. I find it interesting that the ends always justify the means when doing Gods work on Earth. 

If we're speaking about the Catholic doctrine of double effect; history is writ large with the evidence of that particular doctrine being as useless in practice as it is in theory.

Not too distant Catholic wars of extirpation against perceived heretics offer clear evidence that ""kill them all, let God sort them out"" was of much more practical utility than considering good outweighing evil.

I wonder what Pope Innocent 3rd thought about concepts of good and evil whilst extirpating the Cathars/Gnostics (Waldensian/Albigensian heresy) in the 13th Century.

Concepts of passing laws claiming that states cannot be considered (evil) actors of terrorism, says more about absolving war criminals like GWB than about who's got right or wrong, good or evil, or proper justification on their side. (GWB would have been equally comfortable claiming a divine mandate for state actions)

Within the limits of this article I don't find modern day terrorism to fall within the limits of unconditional good or evil. However, I feel that the actors who employ these tactics consider them to be an acceptable means to their ends. Again, when speaking about specifically religious terrorists...all religions have CYA dogmas the speak directly to absolution of any actors engaged in holy violence.

In closing, as I stated in my first post, modern day terrorists, despite what many people might think, are rational actors. To them the end justifies the means, and the concept of good and evil as posited in the doctrine of double effect doesn't really matter either way.

To my mind theres three major causes of non-state sponsored terrorism: 
1) Unequal treatment, real or imagined, often religious in nature.

2) Inability for the eventual users of terrorism to match their opponents/oppressors in a similar military fashion.

3) The sowing of uncertainty and fear...its biggest appeal no matter who uses it. (state or small group)

These reasons, as well as others all add up to the ends justifying the means.

As Chairman Mao's little red book so aptly pointed out: ""kill one, scare a thousand.""

"reddit.com","t5_6","please correct me if i am wrong:your basic assumption is that kids will have sex regardless so lets give them condoms?

Should we be so cavalier about condoning teen sex or should we try to dissuade teens from engaging in sex?

I agree that giving teens condoms will prevent the spread of std's, unwanted pregnancies, etc. but at the same time it will also entice more teenagers to enter into sex-lives. As the threat of consequences will diminish and the  the handing out of condoms will appear to be  condoning teen sex.  We may create an atmosphere where a kid not having sex will look ridiculous (if it doesn't exist already).

Isn't giving teens condoms and turning around and telling the ""don't use them"" a mixed signal that could ultimately lead to teens entering sex-lives if ""everyone else is doing it""?

Even adults that practice safe sex end up with unwanted pregnancies and in the rush to ""preserve the mood"" don't use condoms...see the gay population aids statistics...or single mother statistics to back me up...

I believe that teens should not have sex until ready for the responsibilities that it entails both monetary(as in supporting unwanted or unplanned children) and emotionally (as having to deal with life as a teen parent providing for a little kid).

What is a new moral or ethic that atheists have created that did not already exist in Judaism or secs of Christianity?

I'm also pointing out that a human is a beast that can only be tamed and domesticated by imposed fear, which then, over time and practice, becomes the morality of the individual. You are also this beast, you're reasoning about morality is reinforced by the Judeo-Christian moral ethic that enraptures your society. 

I recommend ""On the Genealogy of Morals"" by Nietzsche, the self described Anti-Christ himself.

There is no ""rational"" answer to this in the sense that there is a correct and incorrect decision. It just depends on people's preferences.

As for the self-interest aspect of it, The_Engineer nailed it. Every action is believed to be the best decision for the actor based on his own criteria - self-interest.

If you are using 24-character, case-insensitive license codes (for a total of ~124 bits of info in the key), going to a case-sensitive scheme gives you ~143 bits.  Breaking RSA at this level requires factoring ~286-bit integers vs factoring ~248-bit integers.  Using the best known general purpose algorithm for integer factorization, this raises the amount of work done by about a third.

OTOH, you really need to make sure the font you use to display the key to the user *boldly* distinguishes the characters 0 and O; 1 and l; etc.  Otherwise, you'll end up with some potentially very frustrated users.  Even if it does, you may still end up with frustrated users because of the increased difficulty of typing the key.  I'm not sure if it's worth it.

While GM was forcing people to pick from only a small handful of colors and forcing interior options on people based upon color choice, import makers were offering a-la-carte build options. 

When Imports had things like navigation systems, 5 and 6 speed transmissions, and tons of other options and standard features GM was creating a ""lighting package"" which (no joke) included a light in the glove box and courtesy lights in the door sils. Or a premium entertainment package that included a 6 disc changer and 7 speakers but no option for navigation  at any price. Bluetooth? no way.

Not to say what they did offer were not good cars but when you had to compare what you got for your money other makers simply looked better. Even my wife and I have had a hard time over the last couple years. Desperately wanting to buy GM but when we look at the offerings we just cannot justify the cost when Nissian, Toyota and others are offering more.

I would be interested too to know how fleet sales affect GMs numbers. I think it is pretty significant though when you consider nearly every rental company, police force, local government and small business typically sourced their wheels from either GM or Ford.

When you look at GM's monthly manufacturing numbers the higher ones tended to be the cars and trucks that commonly sold to fleets. Also many of the models of cars GM has cut in the past few years were cars that were not fleet cars (monte carlo for example while keeping the impala).

Sorry for the long rant, I would agree that the products themselves are not the only factor but I believe it is a significant one. In the big scheme of things, any one of the issues facing GM now would not kill it. Only when combined in this ""perfect storm"" are we seeing the fall of a giant.","1238559213"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I'm thinking since Reddit is so culturally diverse, there has to be some great acts from foreign countries out there(I'm thinking from an American mindset here) .  I know of some foreign bands that I like but most of them are well-known like Sigur Ros and the like.  I could only speak for some Japanese music (although I tend to like english speaking Japanese music if that's a little too hypocritical.)

A few of my faves: 

[Boris - Ibitsu](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8hlr14DtoI).  Anybody who's relatively in with the metal scene knows about these guys.  They alternate from Thrash (as depicted) to Drone and have put out several great albums.  Akuma No Uta, Feedbacker, Pink and Flood and are all recommended.

[Sugizo - Kind of Blue](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbSSDDmK8eQ) and to a greater extent the band Luna Sea.  This is the more mainstream accessible side of J-rock, though it's bands like these (and those like X-Japan) that convince me that the mainstream rock in Japan is far greater than that of here in the US.  This is a more experimental piece but I really like how Sugizo creates soundscapes.  If you want to dig up more I would recommend anything off of Luna Sea's album Style.  It's their more adventurous album.

[The Band Apart - When You Wish Upon A Star](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmiOO4C2p4w&amp;feature=related).  Yes, this is a cover of the Disney song, though its style is entirely the band's own.  I can't really  describe exactly what it is but it's definitely catchy.  It's a bit of funk-laced rock and a lot of their work is intricate and catchy at the same time.  I would recommend their album Alfred and Cavity for a spin.  It's great from start to finish.

[Nujabes - Reflection Eternal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnhJoyAYsEo).  A Japanese hip-hop producer that's kind of the Japanese equivalent of Madlib but less experimental.  He definitely could produce some smooth tracks that are great for putting on in the background when you're doing homework or just when you want to relax.

Like I said, I don't know too much about any other country's music scene to share any gems that you aren't aware of.  But feel free to share.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In order to avoid wasting your time, you'll have to learn a little something about the university/universities you are interested in. They will have a bunch of required general education classes - probably around 48 credit hours, or 16 classes. These general education classes will be in a variety of different subjects, and you'll have to meet them all in order to get any degree at the university. The nice thing about community colleges is that they know that many people aren't looking to obtain a degree, so they offer similar courses that fulfill the general education requirements of nearby universities. (I don't know why people are talking about getting an Associates Degree and then transferring, you'll be taking more classes than you need...a degree isn't necessary to transfer.) These classes will have some kind of marker to let you know that they are transferable 100% of the time. However, if you can show the registrar at your university that a class you took at a community college has a very similar course description, they'll probably transfer it in...I wouldn't depend on this, but if you've already taken a class it's definitely worth a shot, or if you would really like to take a specific class, try contacting the registrar first. By getting organized (do NOT depend on your advisor!) you can save yourself a lot of money. I also found community college to be a nice transition into ""college life"". I graduated high school and went directly to a community college for 3 semesters, then transfered into a state university, and am currently pursuing my Masters. I don't know how well I would have done at the university had I not had the time at a community college. I was able to meet new people, but still have close access to my existing group of friends, learn about scheduling my classes and time management, and it gave me some extra time to choose a major. I had a really wonderful experience with the community college route, but I also enjoyed stepping up to the university when I felt that I was ready. It's all about what is important to you and what you feel prepared to try.

*added bonus of going to a community college first: you get to start all over again with your GPA. The classes you take at a community college transfer in as credit, not a grade, so if you mess up a little early on - as most 18-year-olds do - your record gets wiped clean!","1238559311"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Actually, that's not the reason ambulance and fire trucks slow down at intersections.

In most states fire and medical vehicles can only request right-of-way when they have their lights and sirens on, where as police with lights and sirens on are legally granted right-of-way.

Also, in most states fire and medical vehicles can not legally run red lights, break the speed limit, or otherwise break any other traffic law.  If an ambulance or fire truck runs a red light its always after everyone has stopped and ""given"" right-of-way.

Police on the other hand can break traffic laws when running emergency traffic to a great extent (although some municipalities may vary).

Its an important distinction- if you get hit by a police car with lights and sirens on its almost always YOUR fault- by law you must yield to police.  

However, if you get hit by a fire truck with the lights and sirens on its almost always THEIR fault because they can only REQUEST right-of-way.  Unless you were breaking some traffic law and being careless and reckless the firefighter or medic is going to get the rap in an accident with an emergency vehicle.  

Firemen and medics are always more careful for two major reasons- 1) they know that if they hit someone they are probably going to lose their job and 2) their vehicles have much greater mass than the standard police cruiser, making them harder to control and stop as well as almost guaranteeing to really mess the other car and driver up in an accident.

I have to disagree with you.  Judi Dench, Catherine Deneuve, Susan Sarandon...these women in the performing arts have not gone softly in the night, or had surgery.  Helen Mirren is downright sexy!  Mary Tyler Moore?  Not so much.

You shouldn't feel bad about plastic surgery if that's the route you want to go, I agree.  But claiming that it is equivocal with preserving femininity and sex appeal makes me believe you have a very skewed and narrow view of both what is sexy and what our ""culture"" finds sexy.","1238559436"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","What is considered inexpensive for a small business?... there's lots of wiggle room under the ""small"" moniker.

If the website is even mildly mission critical to the business, inexpensive is not the route you're looking for.  There are too many variables involved in building and maintaining a site to try to save a few dollars a month. 

To loosely qualify what I'm saying, I've run my own servers, have known IT people for years (the nature of my business) and have gone through a number of hosting providers.

I won't mention companies by name in a public forum... but look for a few things...

* You can judge a lot of companies by their flagship product. If the best they do is shared servers (This usually means 500+ clients to a server) or even a VPS, you're a number, not a customer. Tech support will read from a FAQ for you, at best.

* On the previous note, companies who deal with nothing but dedicated are -far- more professional. They only hire people who know what they're doing. 

* Look for SAS 70 Type II facilities. This narrows it down quite a bit.

* Call sales and tech support to see how fast they answer. Do it more than once. Call at peak business hours and call at an off time, say Friday night, to test staffing. Yes, if I were the business, I'd hate you for doing that. 

* See if the sales guy knows their technical stuff, or at least find answers for you quickly. Top quality places can hand pick their sales guys, and will only hire the best. They often provide a sort of concierge support after the sale.

* Next, see how much order customizing you can do through their website. A place that's truly geeky on the web/hosting end should have a very slick ordering system, no?  The better you can tailor your order as a visitor is a good indication of what they can handle and how geeky their staff is.

* Finally, the *bare-bones minimum* you should expect to pay if you decide to go VPS is $90 a month. Figure about 150-200 for a decent dedicated. Yes, you can get cheaper, but run them through the criteria above first. The whole pay what you get for thing. You should be able to scale much, much larger within whichever company you choose, and the company your hosting with should be ready.

*

&gt;Read the Ten Commandments. If you disagree with all of them, you won't last too long in our society without being thrown in prison.

I don't think you've ever read the Ten Commandments:

&gt;Then God spoke all these words: I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, punishing children for the iniquity of parents, to the third and the fourth generation of those who reject me, but showing steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments. You shall not make wrongful use of the name of the Lord your God, for the Lord will not acquit anyone who misuses his name. Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God; you shall not do any work—you, your son or your daughter, your male or female slave, your livestock, or the alien resident in your towns. For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but rested the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and consecrated it. Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor. You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.

As you can see, at least half of it is completely irrelevant to modern law and modern society. It presupposes a mythological origin story and a divine suzerain-vassal covenant.

Macs use standard PC hardware now, standard *cheap OEM hardware*. That includes motherboard (your logicboard) CPU, graphics, ram, etc.

&gt;OSX is much easier and more enjoyable to use than XP or Vi

That is a Personal Opinion. I respect that you personally enjoy OSX more than XP/Vista, but that does *not* mean that it is a more advanced or stable OS.

&gt;Windows supports a shitload of applications. And a load of shit is what 95% of them are.

And that 5% outnumbers the number of Mac apps by a huge margin, and also covers a vastly larger number of categories.

&gt;OSX Macs some with what most reviewers agree are the best applications available for photos, video, music, etc.

Final Cut is awesome true, but Sony Vegas, Premiere pro, etc, are just as powerful and in most cases, just as user friendly. iPhoto really isnt anything special.

&gt;Windows can play a lot of games. If I had time to play games, I'd get one of the PCs I built out of the closet.

got nothing to say here, besides the fact that you are paying for and maintaining 2 machines to do the same things you could do with 1.

&gt;Multiple studies have shown that Macs last longer, are cheaper to maintain, and retain their value better than Windows PCs. And when a Mac user has a problem, Apple's service and support has been rated the best in the industry by Consumer Reports EVERY YEAR for the past decade. You can ignore these obvious signs of quality if you want, though. I expect you will.

Lasting a long time is a factor of the PC hardware OSX is running on, not the Mac Logo on it. 

Being cheap to maintain is debatable, what do you mean by that? Keeping the case clean? Replacing broken hardware?

Good customer service/support is nice, but is it worth the big price hike? In my opinion, it isn't.","1238559785"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Why does this even matter? As you said later on, her point in writing this was to present a philosophy, not paint a realistic scene and make technological predictions. She probably spent a lot more time thinking and reading about philosophy than science and it definitely shows.

This hurts her overall message. Why is George Orwell so brilliant? Because he had the insight and forethought to see how the world works. He saw this in such a minute detail that everything in 1984 speaks to the truth of what he is saying.

Rand is the opposite. It's fairly obvious that while she was ambitious and actually wrote novels, articles, screenplays and other works, her ambition far outstripped her abilities. The sort of people who frequent Reddit are people who love details and minutia, but Rand can't deliver on either because she simply didn't have the insight.

If she couldn't properly see that television would become a huge phenomena, then what does that say about her philosophy? I would further argue that her philosophy wasn't so hot either. It is fairly obvious that she was trapped in the Leninist-Capitalist dynamic, she saw no middle ground. I also think that she had a superficial understanding of how society works, mirroring her superficial understanding of technology.

&gt;Again, this is to plot device. Come on, you can't honestly think Rand legitimately dreamed such a device could ever be invented. Give me a break.

Of all the plot devices, she could have invented something far, far more intelligent. Why not a motor that runs on water? That's in the realm of possibility. Why not think of something that was actually realistic in any way? As I said, she dropped a perpetual motion machine into her story and made it central to the plot.

&gt;I somewhat agree here. The protagonists aren't really believable (no major character faults, for example). But then again, neither are perpetual motion machines, so I still don't see this detracting too much from the point of the book.

If her characters aren't convincing, then why should her philosophy be taken seriously? Isn't psychology a major part of philosophy?

&gt;I guess you haven't read The Fountainhead where the protagonist is an architect. Or even Atlas Shrugged, apparently, where a major ""good guy"" character is a composer and all the protagonists enjoy fine classical music

I haven't read The Fountainhead, though I'm looking forward to the objectivist-sex-rape scene. I did say that she had ""very few examples of artistic endeavours as objectivism,"" the only two I can think of are Halley the composer and Kay Ludlow who is an actress.

&gt;Look, I enjoyed this exchange, so I'm switching my hastily made downvotes to upvotes. But I still think you're being rather unfair in your criticism.

I'm a writer, so literary criticism comes naturally to me. I do appreciate some of what Rand has to say in Atlas Shrugged. I agree with her that reality is objective and not subjective for example. But, I also think her philosophy is really far off-base. She didn't understand society, history, technology, science, or politics. The only think she really understood was philosophy. I don't think her work is important or valuable in any way. It was mostly a waste of my time.

However, to each his own, I like being able to articulate why I dislike something, and I appreciate the efforts to defend it.","1238559845"

There are many books that _end_ with the halting theorem as a crowning achievement, I don't count them as computability theory proper. 

N. Vereshagin, S. Shen - Computable Functions. The best intro to the subject I know of. Very accessible for undergrad level students. If you know some programming, even better. Read it before the other texts.

S. Barry Cooper - Computability Theory. Modern intro, fairly well written, more intuitive than Rogers. Watch out for typos tho.

H. Rogers - Theory of recursive functions and effective computability. Old-school and pretty dense, but not too hard. 

R.I.Soare - Recursively Enumerable Sets and Degrees. Starts from the beginning, but goes hardcore pretty fast. Light on motivation and intuition but covers a lot of ground. 

P. Odifreddi - Classical recursion Theory (vol 1,2) - the standard reference book. It has all the basic explanations and doesn't require much background, but it's not really a textbook.

Note: For the most part you don't need to know much of the logic except the meaning of basic terms and symbols. Any undergrad level text would do. 

The subject itself is really uneven. For a while most proofs are fairly trivial, maybe requiring a few minutes to think over. Then words like ""Injury"" and ""Priority"" begin to show up and Bam! your brain melts down.

Look, Christians break the ten Commandments all of the time, the point is that those morals have had insurmountable influence on all of Western society. That influence is indoctrinated in the school system on children at a very young age, it is spread by parents, whether they are Christian or not. And of course those very same morals are in other religions or ideologies as well, hence the success of Christianity in all corners of the earth.

You are deceiving yourself. The influence of reason is easily ignored by human consciousness when morality is imposed and imprinted by the use of fear.

Fear of social condemnation is what maintains morals when an individual is faced with a threat of external violence or an external threat of another sort.

If you can't understand what I've said by this point, than you have fallen off the cliff of Western idealism, the same one of Judaism and Christianity.

Date: 2009-03-31, 11:01PM EDT


BTW, is Barney Frank still running that gay prostitution business operating out of his house? Just askin' Brutally Honest has the whole nasty, commie, degenerate decay here: 

Barney Frank wants to get all in ya 
So to speak:


But now, in a little-noticed move, the House Financial Services Committee, led by chairman Barney Frank, has approved a measure that would, in some key ways, go beyond the most draconian features of the original AIG bill. The new legislation, the ""Pay for Performance Act of 2009,"" would impose government controls on the pay of all employees -- not just top executives -- of companies that have received a capital investment from the U.S. government. It would, like the tax measure, be retroactive, changing the terms of compensation agreements already in place. And it would give Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner extraordinary power to determine the pay of thousands of employees of American companies.

The purpose of the legislation is to ""prohibit unreasonable and excessive compensation and compensation not based on performance standards,"" according to the bill's language. That includes regular pay, bonuses -- everything -- paid to employees of companies in whom the government has a capital stake, including those that have received funds through the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, as well as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

The measure is not limited just to those firms that received the largest sums of money, or just to the top 25 or 50 executives of those companies. It applies to all employees of all companies involved, for as long as the government is invested. And it would not only apply going forward, but also retroactively to existing contracts and pay arrangements of institutions that have already received funds.

In addition, the bill gives Geithner the authority to decide what pay is ""unreasonable"" or ""excessive."" And it directs the Treasury Department to come up with a method to evaluate ""the performance of the individual executive or employee to whom the payment relates.""

The bill passed the Financial Services Committee last week, 38 to 22, on a nearly party-line vote. (All Democrats voted for it, and all Republicans, with the exception of Reps. Ed Royce of California and Walter Jones of North Carolina, voted against it.)


Folks, if you don't get what is happening here, if you're not following along, if you see this and decide to do nothing, then quite Barney Frankly and bluntly, you're worthless.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Ha! very funny. Not gonna happen in this legal system. There are RULES to prevent it from happening. Defense lawyers will get talked down by the judge if they mention the words, or a few other words related to it. Lawyers can be disbarred.

&gt; Recent court rulings have contributed to the prevention of jury nullification. A 1969 Fourth Circuit decision, U.S. v. Moylan, affirmed the right of jury nullification, but also upheld the power of the court to refuse to permit an instruction to the jury to this effect.[30] In 1972, in United States v. Dougherty, 473 F.2d 1113, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling similar to Moylan that affirmed the de facto power of a jury to nullify the law but upheld the denial of the defense's chance to instruct the jury about the power to nullify.

From wiki/Jury_nullification.

More specifically,

&gt; Nevertheless, in upholding the refusal to permit the jury to be so instructed, the Court held that:

&gt; …by clearly stating to the jury that they may disregard the law, telling them that they may decide according to their prejudices or consciences (for there is no check to insure that the judgment is based upon conscience rather than prejudice), we would indeed be negating the rule of law in favor of the rule of lawlessness. This should not be allowed.

from wiki/Jury\_nullification\_in\_the\_United\_States

There is significant opposition to nullification in American law.  Some of the arguments used against nullification imply that a lawyer, called as a juror in a case, who votes for a verdict that would be considered an application of nullification, may be disbarred.  The system is against nullification, and should not be relied upon.

[A case where nullification came up: read underneath the italic heading, defendants, to see what the court's decision was regarding the outcome.](http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=2nd&amp;navby=case&amp;no=951337)

It's partly because I find them tedious and superfluous, but also because I am incapable of feeling things for others (compassion, love, what-have-you). While you may have trouble achieving the latter (you need to have years of childhood abuse under your belt), the former is pretty easy, as long as you're willing to face the cold hard truth. That truth is that men and women simply were never programmed to be monogamous. There is no evolutionary benefit to it; it is purely a social/religious concept. It's pretty clear that men and women cannot get along *all* the time. Some people get along with their spouse most of the time, others not at all. It all depends, but the bottom line is that relationships take so much effort because they're (for the most part) not meant to be. But if you feel like the rewards are worth it (occasional sex, raising children, someone who has to love you no matter how fat you get, dishwasher, whatever) then go for it. But you should really question whether relationships are even for you instead of just assuming that since everyone else does it it must be the right thing to do.","1238560330"

That wasn’t an accident. Obama told the Israelis, “I do not want bombing in Gaza or Israeli troops in Gaza at the time of my inauguration.” And that was—it’s not clear whether the Israelis were going to stay there. But the hunch is, they planned to go another week. They stopped short.

And as I write, they complained bitterly to Cheney, who communicated that distress to General Jones, who is the new head of the National Security—former Marine General Jim Jones,...the national security adviser in waiting, and he worked out a deal, which was that the Israelis would stop short, as Obama wanted; in return, the Obama administration, once in office, would not interfere with a prearranged flow of arms that was going to Israel. In other words, we were going to keep the supply of smart bombs and other weaponry going past the inauguration. And so, the message to Israel, perhaps, was, “Well, we’re still your friends, but not a blank check.”""

-------------

""That’s one of the most amazing things. You know, Jimmy Carter has been a pariah for the American Jewish community and for Israel ever—in recent years...He’s gone and made visits to the Hamas leadership, and he’s gone to see Bashar Assad of Syria.

It turns out he has a pretty profound relationship with Obama. He met with him privately about ten, twelve days before the inauguration. I wrote about that meeting. It was just the—Carter and his wife and the President, Obama, and his aide David Axelrod. And since then, I think there’s even been more—perhaps even more private meetings. And so, I do understand that it seems inevitable, of course, they would discuss Hamas.""

That's the thing; we're not discussing something that exists objectively. It's a subjective matter: what one person thinks as their own gender, how they should be perceived by society; and how all those individuals in society actually perceive them, because of their own disparate views and experiences.

But some people simply don't see an mtf TS the same as being a natural female. Is their  subjective view less valid, than someone who asserts that surgery and hormones is sufficient to negate their physiological history?

&gt;And if you really don't think that kind of viewpoint is the basis for unethical treatment and deprivation of rights

There are definitely those who hold others with ambiguous or non-standard gender expressions and physiology in low esteem and treat them badly, and that should absolutely be confronted. I'm not disputing their rights to equal treatment.

If the number on the drive matches a number in the database, then they get a new one, if not ask them to send in the old drive and go from there if it's a fake.

Beyond that, a 4192 bit key would be the way to go like the poster above said, I'm fairly certain that is the route a lot of games / products will be going soon.

If you really wanted to argue that you do not endanger people (I'm not saying you do or don't) it would be better to answer questions that relate to driving safety.
Do you:

A: Drive the speed limit?

B: Follow at a proper distance?

C: Signal the proper amount before all lane changes and merging?

D: Avoid distractions while driving; i.e. never use your cellphone, eating, changing music, etc.

If you can truthfully answer yes to all of these, then yes you're not a danger. SUV driver or otherwise.

The problem with SUVs is many (not most) drivers of them forget that it alters their perspective of speed and end up driving too fast and too aggressively.  

Couple this with the fact that if you're in a normal sized car and someone's aggressively tailgating you, the intimidation factor creates a stronger memory.  I detest Esclade drivers because of the one time an impatient prick accelerated to keep me from merging in front of him.  While I largely forget the dozen or so other drivers who have cut me off or otherwise did unsafe in smaller and more common vehicles.

Macs also have custom ROMs and Apple-patented technologies like the mag safe power adaptor and the MacBook Pro battery.  Many of the parts are the same, but the same thing is true for cars, and you don't say that means that there is no difference in quality there.  Macs are very well designed and solidly built.  They are not flimsy or feel poorly balanced.  That takes careful design, and careful design costs money.  Some people don't factor these things in when making a purchase.  I do.

On software, I was actually referring to the iLife software suite that is included in the price of every Mac.  Most reviewers agree that it sets the standard for the industry.  Picassa is giving iPhoto a run for its money, but no free or bundled software can touch iMovie or Garage Band.

I should have sold the PCs when I quit playing WoW, since my Macs will play it just as well.  I built those as dedicated game boxes so I could get work done on my Macs while playing games on the PCs.  The thing that prevented me from selling them was the knowledge that I wouldn't get much for them.

    The Imam said that this regime occupying Jerusalem (een rezhim-e eshghalgar-e qods) must [vanish from] the page of time (bayad az safheh-ye ruzgar mahv shavad).[11]

According to Cole, ""Ahmadinejad did not say he was going to 'wipe Israel off the map' because no such idiom exists in Persian"". Instead, ""He did say he hoped its regime, i.e., a Jewish-Zionist state occupying Jerusalem, would collapse.""

So he didn't say that specific translation. Cole himself says that there is no such idiom in persian. It still a strong statement- I think vanish from the pages of time sounds rather ominous. Seeing as Iran sponsors fighters who are constantly trying to attack civilians in Israel I think the uproar of the mistranslation is a bit much. 

""Confusing matters further, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pontificates rather than give a direct answer when questioned about the statement""

http://www.antiwar.com/orig/norouzi.php?articleid=11025

the only misgiving I have about the whole ""give kids condoms"" thing is not a fear that condoms don't work--like I said I know they do in preventing stds and pregnancies-- what I fear is what is commonly referred as risk compensation. while articles may be found to support every point of view i.e. your article is sources to many pro-choice organization, my sources have a decidedly pro/anti-(add label here) stance. I feel that teen sex should be stigmatized as a public policy to stop teen pregnancies, std and such... As for the baseline cited in the studies, the world in which we live is one in which condom distribution has not taken a complete hold, at best the data shows what happens in a limited amount of cases...once it becomes standard issuance for junior and high schools to hand out condoms then perhaps a clearer picture will appear.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","To qualify, I was born and raised Catholic and think there is a lot of good that can come from the religion, but...

their policies on sex have never been consistent or reasonable. We were taught in school that sex has to be both procreative and unitive, or it is an abomination; that was the justification for being against homosexuality and birth control (among others), but apparently the Catholic church doesn't see how their argument applies to the Rhythm method (having sex during certain parts of the menstrual cycle to minimize the chance of pregnancy) of family planning. Catholics teach that it is OK to try your hardest to avoid pregnancy using Rhythm, but not condoms--I don't see the difference except that one also prevents disease. Neither is guaranteeing anything and both are trying to prevent procreation.

Then, as you point out, they argue that homosexuality is a choice, but are bigots against abstinent gay people. 

In my experience, many Catholics have a strange semi-literal reading of original sin, insisting it was sex. Women sort of default to ""Eve status,"" temptresses that caused our downfall, but we're also pulled in the opposite direction by a virtuous virgin mother of Jesus. The end result is we don't know whether to spit in her face or kneel in praise.

It's a sweeping generalization of course, but they seem to have a lot of their sexuality just really mixed up.","1238561699"

First (only?) intelligent item you've posted. There is a sliding scale between the ""land of the free"" and the ""land of the not free"". Regulating automotive mileage is a step in the wrong direction. What the hell do you care if I want drive a gas-guzzler and spend $5000 on gas every year? Shit, you should be happy, with the gasoline taxes being what they are, it's more money for government to re-distribute. But like all socialists, you have this need to control others. Why does it bug you that many people like to drive SUVs or Hummers? How do you figure the right thing to do is to make them illegal? It really is a shame there are so many douchebags like you out there.

&gt;Are you saying the government has no business regulating ANYTHING?

Are you saying the government should have to power to regulate ANYTHING? It's a rhetorical question. It's not hard to figure out which side of Karl Marx you're coming from.

&gt;Like we should be able to buy lead paint (and eat it!), use asbestos to insulate schools (Mesothelioma is the true test of a man), drive on whatever side of the road we want while intoxicated (in a hummer to boot!), shoot guns in the city limits, let sex offenders live right beside a school (free sex ed)...

No amount of regulation prevented asbestos from insulating schools, because nobody knew that it was carcinogen. No amount of regulation is preventing gun violence within city limits, drunk drivers from getting into their vehicles or rapists abducting kids. So I'm not quite sure what you're getting at here (also your examples would be all handled by criminal court not any traditional regulatory body). You probably think a beurocrat writing decrees is the way problems are solved in this world. Shit, take a look at your dumbass heading. Cars have gone through tremendous amounts of innovation since the 70s, but apparently the only innovation that counts is a signature of an ignorant bureaucrat, who knows nothing about building and selling cars, mandating arbitrary mileage standards. 

And as long as we're playing the hyperbole game: Should government own all means of production? 
Where is the bar that divides what government can and cannot do... because I have to tell you, in supporting gas mileage regulation, you're setting it fuckin low.

We kept watch over the goats for a night, during which our healer, Lauren, noticed a goat that was not moving.

She approached the goat and tried to figure out what was wrong. After prodding the goat to no avail, Lauren said to Sam, ""I'm going to pick up the goat.""

Sam said, ""You're going to *pick up the goat?!?!*"" Lauren confirmed her intent. Sam said, ""Okay. You pick up the goat. The goat explodes in a shower of goo!""

Turns out there was some sort of creature or something devouring the goats from the inside out and turing them into goo, but to this day, it is a joke within my group of friends to warn others, ""Don't pick up the goat!""","1238561997"

For him, we are but mere ants.  He can destroy us whenever he wills.  He demonstrates it time and time again.  It's all nicely summed up in Isaiah 55:8.
From my own memory, sorry for paraphrasing but I can't find the passage &gt;_&lt;:
""Have I not made you and the heavens.  Therefore, who are you to question me.""
I don't understand where people get the idea that god is benevolent,  full of love, and 'morally' just.  
It is clear, due to the world we live in, and from pretty much the whole bible that he is not. 

""Another way is to assume that what looks like human weakness attributed to God is actually righteous behavior. This is the ""if God does evil, it's actually good"" apologetic, and I don't buy it, but I guess some people do.""

This is a bit different, things like morality, evil, and good are: A) Subjective, B) Evolving.  
However, things that can be easily recognize as human weaknesses are things like: lust, greed, and (willful) stupidity. ","1238562048"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Yet another trial to explain the economic crisis by people who don't have any clue about economics. It is clueless mathematicians and econometricians that colluded with the government (for power) that brought us here.

The people who wrote the article believe that everything is a bet, that there is no wealth creation and added value from entrepreneurship itself. That the market is just a big casino where we play money, with no underlying capital transformation as effect.

Yet another bunch of keynesians (and other worshippers of linear equations) that believe that capital is homogenous, markets are in equilibrium, there is perfect competition, all needs are satisfied, perfect substitution between goods, etc. The markets cannot be modelled in their entirety with a bunch of newtonian equations. In this day and age, the total lack understanding of the nature of the economy as discrete, emergent and unpredictable  is quite *shocking*.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;Markets arise out of the interaction of billions of humans that act according to their subjective valuations, but nevertheless they can be modelled using those 3 equations with 6 variables (for which I even got the Nobel in economics, hehehe!!) and the market is surely irrational because our measurements and reality are divergent. Therefore we, the guardians of society, must get the power to correct the errors of reality against the will of the market participants and against common sense, efficiency and justice! We must gather all captains of the industry, politicians and other monopoly seekers at the White House to decide the structure of the market once for all. Away with the free evil individualistic human decisions that bring us diversity that cannot be controlled by the government by using the holy linear equation!&lt;/sarcasm&gt;.

But that's what you get when you consider that statistics on systems with trillions of moving parts (probably even more by several orders of magnitude) using a handful of known rigged aggregates from samples that go back only a few years is better than logic from first principles.

For us to understand the market we must derive the existence of the market using logic; an emergent phenomena rising out of individual actions of naturally selected human beings that interact in a world of scarcity and not some funny equilibrium graphs they post for ""economics"" those days.

But then you wouldn't get the bailouts to keep you on the job as economist/econometrician any more, right? We wouldn't have an excuse to steal from people, right? Therefore keynesianism is better, right? Here we witness sheer quackery and corruption.

The only ray of hope comes from the fact that with better knowledge of austrian economics (helped by the internet) we are going to witness a natural selection of the investors in the favor of those that follow those beliefs instead of the current fascist mainstream economics. Of course, only as long as they don't pack the jails (as terrorists) and sanatoriums (as insane) with austrian economists :))

However, if you learn C++ first, you will have the knowledge of--and familiarity with--C++, rather than C. Then when you're programming in C++, you will use the additions to the language.

Um...I honestly have no idea (apparently Ford's workers average $50/hour including everything).  I don't really know much about how GM deals with the unions.  And I've only read about Ford in the past few weeks (although I know some people).

My understanding from what I've read (I should have cited everything I mentioned in the previous comment, because now I can't find it all), is that they realized about 2 years ago (1 year ago?) that they were doomed.  So they came up with a plan that involved all kinds of fanciness, and they sold that plan to the UAW (and their shareholders and investors, etc).  The plan depended on a lot of things, including lowering union pay.  The storyline for Ford right now is that they are in year 2 or 3 of this plan, and they are still not making any money, which is actually what they expected.  They figured it would take 3-5 years to see a payoff.

You're referring to the engine, and gearbox shields.  They're not getting you any mpg.  They're there to protect some important bits on your car.  If they're sold as ""improved aerodynamics"" that probably just means that they made sure that they don't generate lift, or that they generate downforce at high speeds on the BMW.

On the Beetle, they're simply not Aero devices in any meaningful way.

&gt; Lower that shit and make the roofline lower and you've got a smaller profile. another 10-20%.

No.  Wind resistance is a relatively minor fuel burner, unless you're on perfectly level ground, and you never slow down or speed up (or if you drive at obscene speeds.).

Otherwise, acceleration (either speeding up, or climbing hills) is going to be, by far, your biggest gas burner.

If you lower your BMW by a huge amount (let's say 2 inches.  though realistically, more than 1.25 is going to destroy your handling), you're only going to change your base wind resistance by about 4%.  I wouldn't be surprised if the smaller floor to ground gap of a slight drop actually served to increase downforce (which is essentially a sometimes desirable form of drag) and therefore *decreased* fuel economy.

Simply put, I'd be shocked if your desired changes had any measurable effect on fuel economy, at all.  Granted, I'm a weekend racer not an aerodynamicist, but I've spent enough time on the track that I'm confident saying that your gearbox guard is not saving you fuel, or making you faster.  It's just protecting your gearbox from rocks.","1238562226"

Now, I agree with you that our current state of dependence requires some minimal level of assistance including 100% assistance for those who truly need it, but removing competition from the system will only make it weaker. Have you ever wondered why our Colleges and Universities have remained globally competitive while k-12 has fallen off a cliff? I would suggest that it is the private schools that continue to set the standard of advancement and the public institutions who follow their lead. I need the taxes that are taken from me if I am going to send my children to the schools that I know are better than the public institutions that I am forced to pay for anyway. *That* is unjust.

So, I wouldn't knock gentoo for that.

I mean, they do sell computer equipment and software, yes?

&gt;Newegg has warehouses, advertising costs, and employees.

Let me elaborate a bit on my point. Online retailers like Amazon and Newegg are able to sell at such low prices because they keep such things to a minimum. For example, Amazon is amazingly efficient at shipping - they have a small number of distribution centers and are able to very quickly and accurately chose the one closest to you and have your order on its way.

They do this with a minimal number of warehouse employees - a good deal of it is automated IIRC. 

Best Buy, on the other hand, operates a number of regional distribution centers as well - these are used to ship products to individual stores, where there are held in inventory - already, with a 2 tier system,  we're talking about greater inventory, and less efficiency.

Now, take employees. Clearly amazon has employees, but they would break down to corporate suits, web team, IT, warehouse team, sales and marketing, and probably music label relations now that they're in that biz. They run a very lean company.

Best Buy, on the other hand, has the corporate suits, web team (they operate online sales as well), warehouse team, IT, loss prevention, geek squad, general retail employees, car installation, AV installation, and hell now they sell freakin phones so people that specialize in that as well. Probably missed a bunch.

Point being, they have a huge, unwieldy organization. They waste tons of money stuffing paper ads in with the sunday paper. They're going to go the way of the dinosaur as people that actually read the sunday paper stop being the generation with purchasing power and start retiring.

&gt;Best Buy sucks more than you are trying to justify

I'm not excusing or justifying Best buy's suckage here, just trying to shed a little light on their enormous overheads. ","1238562285"

Actually it does.  Suppose you need to haul a 20' boat.  Do you go out and buy a bigger truck?  How about when you need to move.  Do you sell your truck and buy a 5 ton?  If your work requires you to haul a bed full of plywood every day, power to you.  If you find that you need to move six kids all the time, good work, coach.  I'm not sure what you do when you need to move the kids and the plywood at the same time but I'll bet you manage.  My needs are radically different.

"technology","t5_2qh16","Figured out last week how newegg does so well with their prices. They have absolutely the worst customer support I've encountered in a loooooooong time.

I placed a $1000 order from home late. Their fraud system was smart enough to detect this as suspicious. Makes sense because I normally order from work so the different IP address plus large amount should have set off some sirens.

Well, the first problem was that nobody told me this order was voided. I checked to see what the damage was a couple of days later only to find that the order was canceled. So I went them an e-mail asking what was up. I was told that it was sent to the appropriate department.

Day goes by - nothing. So I reply asking if they've heard anything no reply to this either. So I figure I've been routed to the garbage. So I call. I'm on hold for 30 minutes before I have to give up. Send another e-mail. Again, told my e-mail was sent to the appropriate department.

Wait another day. Another e-mail saying that I'm horrified by the lack of customer support. No response to this one.

Finally, 9 days later I get an e-mail telling me that they've reactivated my account, but I can't use my amex anymore because they'll cancel the order. Well my amex has protection on these purchases, and I've never really felt that using my debit card is all that safe.

At this point I've said fuck it. I probably should wait on the solid state drive anyways, and with Bauer coming out with some new hockey skates I think I'll make those my stupid purchase of the quarter.

Sorry for the vent. I was just really disappointed in newegg. I've been using them for six years and them not even understanding how big of a fuck up their support was really pissed me off.","1238562811"

So yes, he _joined_ the union when he started (almost everyone does), but he didn't hold any office even at the local level until he'd been there 11 years.  And in the meantime he earned a law degree, putting him a prime position to be a voice for himself and his fellow workers.

All the people I've worked with turned out to be casual friends, and I haven't had an SO in years. So there's some sadness, but more a feeling of frustration.

My other problem is that I'm fine one-on-one, but awkward in groups. All the people I've socialized with seem to prefer spontaneous humor (when we're in groups), which I've never been good at unless I know the group pretty well. So I tend to sink into the background because I can't keep up, and I end up being The Quiet Guy. I have all kinds of opinions on music, movies, TV shows, politics, religion, but I can't crack a joke in the clutch, or make a witty rejoinder. I'm a contemplator.

Of course, according to the dick in question everybody in town was out to get him for just doing his job, and that he must be doing it well to get these kind of results.

The creator of this video is asking others to be open minded and use the scientific method to support their beliefs.  

Trouble is, they do not want to be open minded, they do not want to know what is ultimately correct, people are usually happy with the status quo.  Those shouting ""behead those who insult Islam!"" are hardly the kind of people that want to sit down and use their brains to figure things out.

I absolutely agree. Like the submitter, hgielrehtaeh, I couldn't finish the story -- in fact, I tuned out before the end of the first page, disgusted not only by the world being described, but also by the utter abandonment of any kind of journalism.

In the first few paragraphs, I saw a few anecdotes, then a huge number of blatantly unsourced statements. Nowhere was there anything like actual *research*; if it were a Wikipedia article, it would have had ""[citation needed]"" after every sentence, and sometimes even after every independent clause.

The closest it came to anything like an unbiased factual statement was the claim that ""according to a NEWSWEEK examination of the most common beauty trends, by the time your 10-year-old is 50, she'll have spent nearly $300,000 on just her hair and face"". But if you follow the hyperlink in that sentence, and then dig for the ""Inside the Numbers"" note, you'll find their methodology:

&gt;In order to arrive at an estimate of what a modern, looks-conscious diva might spend on her appearance during her lifetime, we compiled a list of the most popular beauty procedures based on a reveiw[sic] of recent beauty industry reports and conversations with experts.""

In other words, it's **a wild-ass guess**, and one that involves projecting trends *40 years into the future*.

I found the writing incredibly bad. My biggest complaint is that it would be an understatement to say, ""it is an understatement that Goodkind lacks subtlety."" His characters all think in these amazingly clear, 3 word subject verb predicate sentences, and the author's voice repeats everything that happens. This had been annoying me for the entire book, so that I actually laughed out loud at some unintentionally funny parts before giving it up. 

I remember in particular a scene where he describes one character giving the other universal signs to shut up: she grabs his wrist to prevent him from slapping a bug, clasps a hand over his mouth to prevent him from speaking, and then holds a finger to her lips. On top of this, they are being followed and are trying to be stealthy already. Goodkind, though, has to add after this description something like
""... and he knew that she was asking him to be quiet. Then she said, 'Please be quiet. Making noise now would be bad.'"" It seemed that _every_ time Goodkind described anything, he would then tell you what he had just described.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I have considerable interest in becoming a consummate programmer.  To realization of this desire, I have read numerous books on programming, ranging from those that treat of C++, to those that concern the ways of C#, to those that provide instruction on the various elements and methods that constitute x86 assembly programming, and have always understood the concepts presented within these instructional and refernce books with a certain facility. 

The problem is that I have always had severe confidence problems, though from time to the elucidation of certain facts is occasioned that belie the idea that I were too deficient in wit to attain to a satisfactory level of adeptness in programming.  Nevertheless, I can't bring myself to do what I know anyone who should wish to be a good programmer must do, which is to practice - to write code, make mistakes, try again, wash, rinse, and repeat.  I can't bring myself to do this because I fear that I will pursue competence only to find that my brain just isn't structured in such a way that I should ever manage, no matter how hard I should try, to become as talented as I wish to be, and find that I have wasted a good deal of my time and must settle on the pursuit of a less ardent passion.

To be more specific, my real interest lies in graphics programming and game programming.  Throughout my life, but particularly in my youth, I have had what I consider a great imagination - the ability to summon to my mind's eye daedally wrought worlds of empyrean resplendence, worlds whose beauty I wished to make more real and thus all more the more enjoyable, not only for my own sake but for the sakes of others, as well.  This is my dream: to inspire and uplift myself and others through living, dynamic, computer-generated, interactive paintings.  From my present vantage point, this dream  looks so unachievable so distant.  I feel like giving up and almost suicidal.

To those of you who were mired in self-doubt but managed somehow to extricate yourself from chains and contraints of your fear-laden minds and push forward, reaching your goal:  How did you do it?  What did you say to yourself to dispel these doubts?  What substances did you take that gave you new perspecive?  What events or experiences caused a shift in your mode of self-appraisal such that you became able to do what you had hitherto been unable?

I am stuck, frozen in fear, unable to take the plunge and hone and put my skills to the test by actually getting my feet wet.  I feel so terribly inferior to others.","1238563956"

I'm a case in point-- I decided, for non-religious reasons, that I thought it would be best to wait until marriage before I had sex. It wasn't something that I was absolutely committed to, but it was my choice. I dated a girl for a year, and we did absolutely everything else, but she wasn't on birth control (she had tried it and felt it messed with her mood too much) and I never had a reason to buy condoms. She lived in the dorms at the time, and eventually her roommate started trying to get us to have sex (she was like that.) She never succeeded just by being suggestive or trying to argue logically, but when she finally bought a bunch of condoms and hid them under the sheets and pillow-- well hell, we couldn't resist that.

That may be an extreme example, but the point is condoms do facilitate sex, only among the lowest common denominator of society does sex without a condom among potentially active young people ever seem like a decent idea.","1238564226"

However, the dilemma we are placed in is one with few bright line guides...if we hand out condoms...the people who already take part in sex will benefit...they will perhaps gain safety from stds and unplanned pregnancies...but perhaps as teens learn to accept the new status quo i.e. easy access to condoms there is a chance (I know nobody has a crystal ball so I may be wrong or you may be wrong) more will become sexually active, and if so then as market share increases so does the risk of sexually transmitted disease and teen pregnancies from a sheer proportional nature--even with the use of condoms (like I mentioned earlier plenty of people who practice safe sex--slip or grow tired of it).

My home laptop still has KDE 3.5 installed but things are starting to get crufty and I've been thinking of a full reinstall, but I really can't decide which way to go.  I've got two virtual machines going with Ubuntu/Kubuntu 8.10 and so far I've been far more impressed with Gnome 2.24 than KDE 4.2 -- it's faster and far more stable, though the vm could be skewing my observations on performance.  I'm shocked at how easily things work in Gnome and have started installing Ubuntu on people's computers rather than Kubuntu -- for complete beginners I'm definitely convinced that Gnome is the way to go for now.

Sadly I've actually found Windows to be more configurable than either KDE or Gnome by using AutoHotkey.  I can write scripts that are VERY customized to EXACTLY what I want them to do with very complex logic, which I cannot reproduce in any Linux DE so far.","1238564444"

Through controlling the money supply, banks are able to control the entire economy by giving more loans to the sectors which they wish to promote and no loans to areas they in which want to stifle growth.

The banks, being in the private sector, are not able to be regulated by the people except through the SEC and other government regulatory action, which have been shown to be A. ineffective and B. already prone to bank lobbying.

The anarchists, of course, conclude that the banks are evil.

So they charge a lesser rate and put terms on what you can use that pipe for and we all win.

Like another user said elsewhere in this thread, what this guy did was pay his $7.95 for the all-you-can-eat buffet and started selling food to his friends. You can't do that. When you buy a plate for the all-you-can-eat buffet, you're agreeing that you'll be the only diner. When you buy **residential** internet service, you're agreeing that your **residence** will be the only one using the connection.

In order to make her desired point, she leaves out the age of the boy (14, two years older than the girls) and just says ""high schooler has sex with elementary school girls"". Rubbish.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I read some very extensive internal technical documents on Skate 2. And all the development optimizations they made for each system.

Skate 2 was different from Skate 1 because they started its development on the PS3 from the beginning. Porting the game over to the 360 took very little effort because it was much easier to clump the different SPU processes together.

Ironically, the PS3 caused them to optimize their code so much that the 360 version benefited greatly from problems on the PS3.
For instance, the PS3 has awkwardly slow vertex processing units on the GPU, so they dedicated an SPU to assist the GPU with Vert processing. The 360 version didn't even need this optimization, but still benefited from some Draw optimizations that resulted from the new combined shader draws and Bounding Box culling improvements.

So yeah, Uhh, the 360 can handle anything on the PS3.","1238564818"

At constant speed on level ground, the only thing your engine power is fighting against is aero resistance and rolling resistance, and aero is normally 80-90% of the total resistance.  

So in other words aero can have a very significant effect on fuel economy in near constant speed driving situations.","1238564979"

Bypassing strong name protection is easy - it just requires replacing each assembly in the app with a modified version with null public key tokens. Better yet, you can turn off strong name validation entirely. Authenticode signing is useless, as it's only used for UAC prompting and Software Restriction Policies.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, I've made a total of 18,297 edits, although I've made less than 100 edits this year. I was nominated for adminship around [two years ago](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Gracenotes) and was smeared for my position on linking to sites like [the Wikipedia Review](http://wikipediareview.com/), a forum where people criticize Wikipedia, and had some untrue vitriol thrown at me. Interestingly, only a few months after the RFA, a [behavioral guideline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Linking_to_external_harassment) was set up that had nearly the same ideas that I had put forth in my RFA and had gotten opposition due to. So at least I was a catalyst for a saner policy. A few months after that I realized that people on the wiki took things way too seriously (including the infamously paramilitary [Counter-VAndalism Unit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:CVU)) and generally only edit as much as many other people here nowadays.

I've written some development stuff, too; generally I was more involved in the technical side of things than in the content-writing side, but did both. For example, [this enterprise Java code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gracenotes/Java_code) for automated editing of Wikipedia and [amelvand, a JavaScript anti-vandalism tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Gracenotes/amelvand.js), and I understand the internals of MediaWiki software pretty well. I've kept a project involving JavaScript-based semi-automated editing on haitus, which has a better interface for asyncronous editing than amelvand currently has.

When I took introduction to law enforcement (Actually English lit major, but I took the class because it sounded interesting.  It ended up being the best class of my entire college career - great professor.) the professor had a really interesting point.  A study was done in the mid 90s about police and their friends.  
The study found that for the average American their friends are composed of typically 20~40% of co-workers or friends made through work.  

Police on the other hand typically rate at 70~90%.  They quickly become ostracized from society.  Couple that with powers over your fellow man, you can see how bad cops can emerge.

It makes sense though.  The typical story the professor gave was the BBQ.  Say you were throwing a kegger BBQ with a bunch of friends and a friend showed up with his buddy who’s a cop.  Even if the guy was completely cool, a lot of people get nervous and uncomfortable.  

The off-duty officer had done nothing wrong, but very quickly finds himself on the outside looking in.

"obama","t5_1a8ah","I'm very aware of this history of marijuana and Anslinger. What I meant was that the majority (read: white people) didn't partake in marijuana use (it was criminalized to get at the Mexicans - opium criminalized to get at the Chinese), so when it was criminalized, it wasn't the loss to the average American as alcohol was. Prohibition was a HUGE deal. Marijuana criminalization affected Mexicans, who were a much smaller percentage of the population than they are now. The two situations aren't comparable in terms of affect on society-at-large.

I'm really not worried about being the masses being conditioned to shitty pot. Maybe many will, but there will always be a niche for the good stuff. The cannabis world today is not what the alcohol world was back then. There are connoisseurs today that will keep the art alive. Strong alcohol is strong alcohol. The only thing the micro-breweries have that Budweiser doesn't is taste, not intoxication ability. Cannabis is mostly about the effect. Smoking good pot and getting a better high is very different than drinking a better tasting beer, but getting just as drunk as you would have off bad tasting beer. I realize this is a bit of a simplification, but I'm just not worried about some grand conspiracy by the Rockefellers. And the US govt isn't going to stop BC from growing good weed.

Edit: additionally, since a big deal politically will be the health of the smoker, stronger and better pot may even be encouraged so a user only has to take a hit or two to get high instead of smoking a huge bowl.","1238565787"

I have huge sympathy for those who ended up on the streets for reasons beyond their control.  However, for people who got hooked on drugs, too lazy to work, or just boozing all the time, I find it difficult to pity them or even want to assist them.  

Making drugs legal will very likely increase the amount of these people (at least I think so)","1238565919"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Libertarian beliefs started during the Enlightenment - where it was known as liberalism (the original 'liberal' school of thought - not the statist type).

Later Von Mises and FA Hayek codified the economic principles.

Its true that Rand brought attention to Libertarian thought - but only in a tangential sort of way.

After Rand, its biggest benefactor was Barry Goldwater - who later Reagan, Bush, et al perverted into what we now think of as 'modern Republicans'.

But Goldwater himself was a pro-liberty (individual and economic) sort of man.

Atheists should no more be against spirituality (even if it includes some form of God) than they should be against poetry. I have at times actually enjoyed reading Schopenhauer, Emerson etc. on quasi-religioussy topics.

HOWEVER, the problem here is that religion often takes the form of mass psychosis, and that is definitely harmful. Some of the videos I have seen where the faithful exhort people to actually mass murder in the name of their supreme Ghost are truly blood curdling! If a few atheists don't attack religion, the true blue religious loonies will never have an incentive to question the foundations of their beliefs and come up with a world-view that's truly harmless.

In a way, we're doing something akin to damning them to Hell - while it may be impolite to do so, it's equally quite unhealthy to suppress the rage we feel at having to put up with ridiculous and dangerous theories getting undue bandwidth.","1238566149"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; The various schools of economics are like religious factions, right?

No, but it's a science in which wrong answers are beneficial enough to the right people, that whole schools of error have risen to provide them.

I like to talk about 'bird mathematicians'.  Some experiment upon some birds revealed this: the birds, feeding on the ground, would observe one human approaching and then fly into the trees for protection.  After the human left, they'd settle back on the ground.  When two humans arrived, they would wait until both humans left.  If only one left, they'd know to stay in the trees.  Same for three humans.  But for the birds `n=3 for n&gt;3`.  If four humans arrive and then three leave, the birds would settle back on the ground - endangering themselves.  But suppose you have a bird mathematician: even though large numbers are unintuitive, the mathematician could perform tricks like: push pebbles into a pile as humans arrive, and pick them out as humans leave.  If pebbles remain, then it's still unsafe.  So even though birds naturally get large numbers wrong, like humans naturally confuse economic destruction with production, a bird mathematician can reason carefully through the situation, and provide life-saving advice.

Now, how could bird mathematicians be corrupted?  Suppose that you have bird politicians, and something like this policy: the whole flock puts their `n&gt;3` amounts of food in one pile, the politicians take out 'n&lt;3' parcels and use them to buy votes, and then distribute `n&gt;3` amounts back to everyone.  To the mathematicially-challenged bird, 'many worms' is the same as 'many worms', and that the post-politics pile runs out sooner is an easily-missed mystery.  A bird mathematician can explode this whole scheme, but a bird pseudomathematician will curry much more favor, who hems and haws about whether the numbers of things in a pile 'really are' constant, who can be given titles and placed before the flock to defend nonsense.","1238566460"

That's a much more likely explanation than that your roommate came into your lemon custard.  What reason would he have to do such a thing?

At any rate, your friends cum is composed of molecules perfectly identical forms of which are contained within your body at all times.  What does it matter in whose body those molecules where synthesized?  They're all the same.  Whether or not you ate your friend's cum, given that the biochemical constitution of your body is what it is, in every moment of every day it's as if you had consumed his cum.  Do you see what I mean? 

To further belabour my point: If he did cause you to consume his semen, nothing at the time of consumption was introduced to your body that hadn't already been there - and indeed in copious quantity at that.  So why should you be grossed out or going so far as to attempt to induce vomiting - especially when you have such scant and tenuous evidence to support your delusion that he came in your custard?","1238566558"

Maybe you were taking your boss out and (extremely hypothetically) you were counting on a raise based on your generosity at the Starbucks?

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The entire New Testament is primarily about God revealing his greater plan to enter into fellowship with mankind. God loving mankind is pretty much central to Christian doctrine. 

I understand that if you accept God as the ultimate authority, then there is no way you can question him. *However*, consider for a moment the implications of this. You are expected not to question God's actions, but if you were to sit and think about God's actions, listening only to reason, with no conclusions drawn from your religion, I think that you would come to some rather unsettling conclusions. Now think about this. Why is it not acceptable for you to question God? Why is it not your place? Is it a possibility that this is the case simply because this would cause you to realize that the God of the Old Testament makes virtually no sense? If God is the truth, and the Old Testament is entirely inspired by God, then reason must by definition conform naturally to all within it. If God gave us reason, then doesn't it make sense that he would, to quote Thomas Jefferson, ""more approve of the homage of reason, than that of blindfolded fear?""

Finally, it is glaringly obvious to me that the Israelites were acting on greed and lust because I don't take it on faith that they were really told by God to act in the barbarous, morally reprehensible way that they did. Is it just a coincidence that God wanted them to take a bunch of valuables and have sex with a bunch of virgins, perfectly aligning with the usual motivations of greed and lust?","1238566897"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","You're assuming that the production of child pornography is, in and of itself, something that should be repressed. That is not the justification of the child pornography laws, however, and in fact for a long time it was not illegal. It just so happened that child pornography had an almost 1 to 1 correlation with child abuse and thus, these laws were formed (recently).

To then say that these children should be punished by looking at that law in isolation, which is indeed what you are arguing by simply referencing the illegality of the creation of child porn, without its justification is ridiculous. Child pornography was not made illegal because it was child pornography, it was made illegal in an attempt to stop child abuse. So yes, we can and should argue that they should not be prosecuted, because once should not lose sight of the goal and get lost in implementation details.

To put it another way, if back when these laws were created, all ""child pornography"" was of this form, where minors were just taking pictures of each other, then I would be inclined to believe we wouldn't have child pornography laws on the books.","1238566928"

But if that body builder with a gun is wearing an armani suit and driving a mercedes, I'll get 4 of my buddies with me and take him because I expect a greater payout that's worth the effort.

In the case of a rape, I'd expect a sober or drunk girl to fight relatively equally hard against it, unless they are literally passed out.

I see it as something really simple. Sun owns the trademark called 'Java'. If some corporation wants to release a runtime with the 'Certified Java' stamp on it, Sun is entitled to some money for running this extensive set of tests they developed on they own dime.

People seem to forget the UNIX isn't trademarked by the Linux Foundation or Novel or RedHat. It's trademarked by The Open Group and OSX *is* an UNIX while Linux *isn't*.

You cannot have it both ways. Either these are entirely ""internal"" tools with no marketing or trademark implications or they are part of the PUBLIC Java certification process.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Okay, I just lost an hour's worth of text.  My main point is this:

Here is a quick summary of the other points:

IQ Tests - are biased in favor of law competency.  The intelligence needed for carpentry is different than the intelligence needed to read and understand text, make inferences from those texts and then strategize a successful argument based on such data.  IQ tests seem to be more geared for this type of thinking, which happens to be what constitutes a good lawyer.  An x-gf was a martial arts genius (and I teach MA), but sucked at law as demonstrated by her failure to comprehend basic language in her auto law suit.  I think her spatial intelligence was turbo-charged, but her spelling and reading comprehension was abysmal. 

LSAT is designed to test for good law students and lawyers and is constantly being revised based upon statistical data.  It cannot be gamed, as you claim.  It is true people increase their scores significantly by practice and courses.  These courses teach the student how to appropriately think about the problem and how to recognize different types of problems and how to solve said myriad of problems quickly.  It is a course that improves the quality and efficiently of thinking.  In short, it increases the student's intelligence in those areas.  Those areas have been proven to create good law students and lawyers by statistical analysis.  A dummy can't take those courses and pass.

Sense of Entitlement - it's not about entitlement.  I truly don't see how that applies.  My concern with you is competency.  I wouldn't trust a non-doctor's evaluation of the medical field or non-scientist's evaluation of the field of science.  The person just lacks the proper training and exposure to make those types of determination.  I don't see you as a whiner or complainer.  I see you as something similar to a Creationist who has no real exposure to Evolution, yet persists in his very strong opinion that is at odds with well-established and well-known evidence.  You have some ideas, but you don't really know what you are talking about.

&gt; Again this is my point. You don't have anyone that is an ardent supporter for the alternate system I mentioned.

I am aware you believe of an alternate system.  You have yet to identify it by name or description.  It is some ethereal entity at this point.  Please spell it out for me.

I'll tell you what.  It is a rule I have to be as generous to an opposing view as I can.  As president of my school's American Constitution Society, I will do what I can to host a speaker on your alternative system.  I think it will make a great dialogue.  He should have developed views on what the problems actually are and what this alternate system looks like.  Which person do you advise me to book?  We can borrow equipment to web-cast the event and I'll give you the link.

&gt; The problem though is that you consider their flaws as minor and not in need of refinement.

This is not what I believe.  At law school, we are exposed to flaws in the system.  It is not that we are ignorant of the flaws; it is that we commonly think the solution decided upon was a good one (but not always).  The alternatives are worse, and we discuss the alternatives.    Besides, most opinions come down to this very basic level where reasonable people will disagree.  Example: Should strict liability apply to second-hand sellers of defective products?  Is comparative or contributory negligence theory more just?  Regardless of one's preference, it's hard to say that injustice has been done by choosing either opinion.

We had another Supreme Court criticism by profeseor today as an aside to the case.  This makes 3 comments in 2 weeks (you had held we don't have discussions of this type - at how many comments do you require to reverse your position?).  The case was McClesky v Kemp.  The case hinged on statistical data on disproportionate death penalty convictions for blacks (1% black on black, 24% black on white).  This violates the 8th Amendment's ""cruel and _unusual_"" clause.""  Personal notes later revealed that a Justice advised his chambermen not to grant cert because he was very poor at statistics and wouldn't understand the case (in addition to not seeing the constitutional relevance - note how he is restraining his own power).  Does this promote fair play?  Cert was granted and Court decided that even though Defendant demonstrated (""highly suggestive"") bias in the system, he should still get the death penalty for failing to prove discrimination in his particular case.  The court cited the Parade of Horribles argument and that they would have to throw out the entire legal system.  They hold they just won't allow that type of system-wide evidence.  However, and here is where the possible injustice comes in, they do allow that type of evidence in employment law cases.  Is this a double standard?  Maybe, maybe not.  It's all grey and reasonable people disagree.  The courts have held that type of evidence in employment law context is different number of entities and variables. So does the number alone make the difference?  For some it does not.  For me, it does. McClensky had to control for 235 variables.  That's a f*'ing lot of room for something to go wrong.  I'm suspicious of single study with so many variables that need controlling.  Should he die because I'm suspicious of a study?  I'm too fallible.  Let's let a group of well-trained highly intelligent and highly versed people decide.

I think I have a McClesky issue with you.  I would like you to point out a specific instance of where the Supreme Court has overstepped its bounds.  In addition, I would like you to state what you think is wrong with the court system.  After that, please produce an alternative system that has a less dangerous slippery slope than our current one.  Basically, all I'm asking you to do is back up your argument with more than assertions.  At this point, I am not even sure your view is reasonable because you produce no evidence in support of it or even decently state what your ""alternative"" system is.  It seems like you may be unjustified in your belief.  It is easy to criticize our current court system.  It is even easier to criticize the major alternatives.  We have a very good and very robust system that tends to promote justice.  The more I learn about it, the more I appreciate that.  Really.  I think the difference is that I didn't have the knowledge necessary to make an accurate assessment.","1238567504"

The second one does cite a number of facts. For instance, nobody denies that that CIA was involved in funding the Mujaheddin out of which Al-Qaeda was born, but the fact that the CIA was involved in it 30 years ago doesn't mean that it stayed involved after the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan.  What makes more sense is that the CIA trained and funded these guys for a few years, then abandoned them when they were done.  The Mujaheddin now had an army without an enemy, filled with soldiers who had no skills other than fighting, and they redirected their violence elsewhere.

Moreover, it may be true that the CIA tried to use these guys against various ""friendly"" regimes (hell, given the CIA's history in Latin America, it makes sense), but there isn't enough data to infer that the CIA is still behind everything they do.  What's more likely is that the CIA has lost control over them.  It's like they armed a cannon and set it loose, and now it's backfiring on them.

"religion","t5_2qh39","&gt; The only two attributes that are in question is omnipotent and omniscient

That's a recipe for an evil god, since you're not assuming any goodness in there.

I mean this omniscient and omnipotent god might be so evil as to create beings with no concept of good or evil, not knowing death... but forbid them from from eating from a tree on punishment of that death that they don't know anything about (when they have no concept of evil/disobeying/punishment so far anyway), and with his omniscience, he knew up front that it was likely they would violate this rule, so he gets to punish them and all their descendants.

And just to be extra spiteful, he might even stand a guard around his other favorite tree, making sure they can never get near it again.  This would show a subtle evil as well, since he's showing them how well he could have protected them to begin with.

&gt; But it doesn't mean there is a god

Of course not, nor would I every argue that way.  I'm just saying that if you assign enough attributes to God, you can disprove him logically.  [unless he exists outside logic in which case there's no reason to have a discussion anyway since we've lost the common ground we had for discussion]

&gt; the burden of proof is on the believer

Well, to be more precise, the burden of proof is on the one making a claim.

If you believe in a god, you don't have any burden of proof to anyone else, since it's your belief and you're not trying to convince anyone else of it.  If you assert there is a god, now you've assumed a burden of proof.

If you claim there is no god, you take on some burden of proof.  I you simply don't claim there is a god, you have no burden of proof.","1238567724"

My Final thought is that if you are worried about the cost of School, go to Community college.  The cost differences are insane 

If you decide to go the community college route, make sure you have the right attitude and motivation. Many of the students (at least at my particular community college), are not there to really accomplish anything, or are not really applying themselves.  Make sure you work for good grades, which will allow you to transfer to a good school.

So you have such economists who can raise and operate on arguments because verbal logic is the day-to-day practice of their profession, and then you have handwaving magicians who practice something they call 'economics' in a startlingly unlike manner -- who are pretty severely impaired it comes to putting ideas to keyboard.

Which is to say that it was based heavily on credit. And, isn't it strange? American consumers were generally going into debt to maintain their consumption, and now they've stopped doing this, and you say that the recession is all about lessened demand. You even identify housing -- which you identify as a 'bubble' -- as the means by which they could go into debt. And still you do not connect the dots.

&gt; Then the housing bubble burst.

We had a housing bubble for some reason! And then it just burst for some reason!

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; If you check the current smaz.c decoder it is basically slightly slower that memcpy().

How slightly slower? Decompression with [LZO](http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/) is about 1/3 the speed of memcpy() and offers really good compression rates. Of course, for short strings you won't good compression with LZ-style algorithms if you compress them separately, which I suppose is why you're using a prebuilt dictionary.

By the way, have you ever tried the byte-pair encoding algorithm? It divides the string into fixed-size blocks and uses unused bytes in each block to stand for pair substitutions. With ASCII text, you always have 128 free symbols because of the parity bit, and depending on the nature of the text and the length of the block, you generally also have a good amount of other free symbols to use. When compressing, you repeatedly construct a histogram of pairs and substitute an unused symbol for the most frequent pair. Decompression is incredibly simple and fast, and involves simply chasing through a substitution table until you reach a non-substitution symbol. Very importantly, note that a substitution symbol can expand to a pair of other substitution symbols, which gives an exponential inflationary effect. And since the blocks are fixed size, you can perform random access quite efficiently (with a small cache of decompressed blocks, to efficiently support spatial locality). Part of the trick with this algorithm is how to efficiently encode and transmit the substitution table, and the original BPE article contains a discussion of this. There was also a Swedish guy who independently invented a generalization of this algorithm for his thesis work, which he called RePair.","1238568079"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yep, that is exactly what I have.  I was so startled by how much I can relate to these comments that I didn't think to mention it.  I went to see a psychologist last year about my anxiety problems.  It took about 3 months, but we hacked away at it until I finally came in one day and said that I didn't really feel I had anything that was pressing enough to talk about.  I had one more session after that and I was done.

I haven't felt the need to return since, however, what I will say is that this requires constant effort to combat.  I regularly have to catch myself when the paranoia starts.  Once I do I can get back to what I was doing, but sometimes it takes a little while. I find it to be such an odd problem, but that's the way it is.  You can't let yourself think about it.  The more you do, the worse it gets.  You have to force your thought process onto something else.

One area where this REALLY killed me was back in college.  I was so frightened to ask a teacher for help in trying to understand concepts that s/he had gone over in class that I never went in for extra help.

Don't use the 360 has rpgs argument, there going to waste on the 360.

On the other hand, World of Goo was so easy to pirate buying the app added no real benefits. The only reason I own a legit copy now is because I purchased the MacHeist bundle a few days ago.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt; However I do agree that capitalist and communal societies could exist side-by-side if they could all somehow agree on a standard concept of property (which is unlikely).

And property might indeed lead to territory, and territory to the whole mess all over again... indeed.

I think communal societies can exist within capitalist frameworks (ie, a group of people establishing a commonly-owned property) better than a capitalist society can exist within a communal framework (ie, a group of people claiming a piece of territory or certain items as their own, which you might argue has led to the current mess or you might argue has led to the wonderful technology, life expectancy, and so on that we enjoy today).

I misspoke -- I don't mean a capitalist framework so much as a propertarian framework.  I think.  But that is only a given in an ideal world where it rains beer and we taste through our skin; in the real world, where we have things like global climate change and acid rain and deforestation and general bad shit, it's a lot more complex.

I personally see communist ""morality"" combined with free market investment and trade as the most ideal situation; not that this is at all likely, but I think that it's optimal.  I think public property resolves the tragedy of the commons argument more intelligently than the libertarian solution (everything needs to be private property).

But really, all of my ideas boil down to the same idea: that what we really need right now is to completely sacrifice ourselves in order to work for a better future for mankind.  I would never support or engage in force or fraud to accomplish this... but I nevertheless think it's necessary.  We (the First World) need to share our technology, our knowledge, and all of our other strengths with the rest of the world without demanding a profit -- simply for the improvement of the human condition.  In my opinion, that's priority #1... and that's very definitely a communistic position.  And the sort of collectivism that makes Libertarians froth at the mouth :-)

I'll always support the free market as being, by default, the best system of allocating resources.  But I also believe that we need a strong social safety net -- food, healthcare, education, and shelter for all who need it.  I don't believe ""from each according to his ability, to each according to his need"" (as I understand Marx to have intended it) and the free market to necessarily be mutually exclusive.  There are good points to each and I do believe they can be combined, perhaps through adding elements of mutualism and/or parecon.

I dunno, just thoughts.

I'm not going to argue about whether the definition mentioned on Wikipedia is authoritative with 1 irrelevant citation. 

But I do have to tell you that there are mistakes in this article:

&gt; Windows requires each compiled program to know where in its address space each DLL will be accessed — there is no support for position independence.

When you compile a program, there is what's called an import address table. This is a list of directions telling the program where to jump to and can be changed during runtime. It doesn't make sense to say that there is ""no support for position independence. The DLL functions can be anywhere.

Think about what RVA stands for: *relative* virtual address. Decompile a windows executable, and you will see relative jumps everywhere. 

Is this not independent of position?

Also from the discussion page of your wikipedia link: 

&gt; Although relocatable code requires much more fixup than does PIC, PIC still requires some fixup by the loader. For example when using a GOT, the GOT can contain absolute addresses that need to be fixed up based on where the module is loaded.

Its all a matter of how many fixups are needed. Methinks that this PIC terminology is Linux fanboism.","1238568801"

The reason I didn't like Halo 2 is that instead of having a character thrust into an unknown situation and just seeing how he deals with it, even though he's pretty much a badass, Halo 2 instead felt there was ""need"" for us to know the Master Chief is a badass every five goddamn minutes. It undermined his whole character. 

And instead of saying ""so there was this titular Halo right, well turns out that was part of a cool alien race and there's more structures sort of like it"" they went ""SO DERS DIS HALO HEERS 19 MORE OF DEM ROFL"". Halo 2 is not even *canon* for me.

Not only that, Halo 2 was unsatisfactorily short and three years late for PC.","1238569000"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I can really relate to what you're saying. Here are a few ideas that I think we can try out:

1) We are probably very interested in non-interpersonal things. Articles, games, arguments, etc - spend time thinking about people, including yourself. How do you feel? How might other people feel? etc... It will give your mind something to jump to when you're in a social situation and maybe just help you care a little more.

2) Is there something that happened to you that makes you pull away a little? After a long, depressive couple years in college, I think I learned to keep to myself a little more because it felt safer. I'm having to revisit that time so that I can get over it.

3) Put yourself in one of those situations where you can't stand being around someone. Stay there. And focus on what you're feeling. What memories pop up? What thoughts pop up out of nowhere? What are you feeling? Pay attention to those things and you may be able to figure out a little more about what's going on with you.

4) If you can figure out some of the things that bother you in social situations, then work around them. Are you bored by small talk? Then ask your conversation partner if you can talk about something more personal or more intellectual. Announcing that you're about to break a social norm is a great way to make it no big deal. Try something like - ""Hey, this might sound weird, but could you ask me some questions about myself? I'm trying to get better at letting people get to know me.""

5) Spend time with someone where you are not required to focus on each other. Go bowling, watch a movie, etc... Just spending time together can start to make you feel more comfortable around each other.

Hope that helps.","1238569067"

"psychology","t5_2qhcz","I think I can relate.

I did my BA in psyc and immediately went to grad school and finished my MSc. Just before I finished, I panicked a bit. (Sounds dirty, doesn't it?) 

I couldn't find any jobs. I don't know of any psyc grads who actually got a job in psyc. Although, I know that some human resources firms hire psyc BAs for their call centers, and there's always room for growth. But mostly, students are placed in areas that don't require a degree. Keep in mind, psyc offers few tangible skills, so finding anything that specifically requires a BA in psyc will also require some other training or background.

Here's the next steps as far as I see them:

1) Evaluate another degree. Law school? Med school? MBA? What do you feel like doing? MBA has been lucrative for me. I currently have opportunities (read: interviews or offers) in three totally different sectors because of the MBA. I can take a job in tech, banking/finance, or operations/HR (compensation). And if I wanted to do something else, it wouldn't be that hard. MBA is just expensive, especially if you're in the US.

2) Start at the bottom in a company you'd like to work for. Like JesseOnReddit3 said, take something tolerable and run with it for a while. Move up however you can.

Usually the catcher, if they make the catch that is, ends up with the most severe injuries.

Seven floors though! Four floors will pretty much guarantee you are dead, or if you are *lucky* paralysed/vegetablised/utterly crippled.

I was raised Catholic so I have somewhat of a personal ""belief"" in a god but it's definitely not the god in the bible.

But when it comes to reality, I have to admit there's no evidence for it and that I'm an atheist.

My personal god is simply something that may be comforting and it could help me live my life but that doesn't make it any more true.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;So why do you defend the right to fire someone if they don't do what you say?

Ever heard of voluntary agreements &amp; contracts?  Would you fire me for not meeting certain requirements, which were previously agreed upon before I agreed to taking the job?  Or would you just pay me regardless of whether I did a shitty job or not?  Would paying me regardless of the quality of my work be in contract, yes or no?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;If she couldn't properly see that television would become a huge phenomena, then what does that say about her philosophy?

*Atlas Shrugged* took place in a fictionalized contemporary America of the early to mid twentieth century. It wasn't a depiction of the future, so it doesn't make sense to criticize it for failing to do so accurately.

&gt;It is fairly obvious that she was trapped in the Leninist-Capitalist dynamic, she saw no middle ground.

Her ""philosophy"" was essentially orthogonal to political and economic spectra because it was at heart a moral code, or more accurately a system of morality derived logically (she argued) from a set of philosophical principles. When projected onto a political spectrum it shows up way on the right for the most part, but she was far more a moralist than an economist or political scientist. To talk about the political and economic merits of her ""philosophy"" is to miss the forest for the trees.

&gt;As I said, she dropped a perpetual motion machine into her story and made it central to the plot.

It's basically a [MacGuffin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin). The way it works is of no importance to the story (or the ideas contained in the story).

&gt;If her characters aren't convincing, then why should her philosophy be taken seriously?

You could dismiss any piece of satire on the same basis, and yes, I think *Atlas Shrugged* pretty clearly qualifies as satire (as well as romance). Not because it's humorous, but because the characters represent ideas that the reader is meant to judge, especially the over-the-top antagonists who alternate between shocked stupors and fits of rage and indignation. From my perspective, complaining that the characters are unrealistic is like reading *A Modest Proposal* and complaining that no one in their right mind would eat babies.

&gt;I did say that she had ""very few examples of artistic endeavours as objectivism,"" the only two I can think of are Halley the composer and Kay Ludlow who is an actress.

Dagny and Halley have a discussion several pages long about art. I found it pretty interesting. (FWIW, Rand also inserts herself [I assume] in Galt's Gulch as an unnamed writer ""with dark hair and big eyes"", or something like that. I remember she says something about why she writes.)

I'm not an Objectivist, but I read *Atlas Shrugged* recently and (no offense) for the most part I don't think your criticisms carry much weight. I think it's fascinating if only as a peek into the mind of the author, who was after all a Russian immigrant who grew up around the time of the Bolshevik revolution. The first two-thirds of it make for a pretty good mystery story, too, and the setting of a slowly collapsing society is interesting in light of where we are today and the things our governments are trying to do to keep everything going.

And maybe I'm dim but I thought it was extremely well written. The extended speeches are sometimes tough to get through, true, but it's one of the most vivid books I've ever read.

It bothers me the way people react to *Atlas Shrugged*. I think it's because it seems vaguely Puritanical the way people seem to get so offended by Rand's ideas that they have to violently reject what is ultimately just a long and (in my opinion) very interesting novel.","1238569711"

She insisted on a baptism for our son, but not for fear his infant soul might end up in purgatory, but because she thought the baptismal record was an important document for identification.

No Krugman or Geitner or Bernanke or any other half baked Keynesian pragmatist could ever stand up to an Austrian in any real debate.

The longer they have power, the further the crisis will deepen. Eventually the public will have enough and begin to look for real answers. All we have to do is be there when the party starts.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Most people derive enjoyment from helping others.

The problem with this is that, soon, ""self interest"" loses all meaning. In a sense, everything we do, we do because we would prefer the results of that action over the alternatives. *Everything* we do is then rationally self interested.

And if a theory purports to encompass *everything* then it usually explains nothing.

But you are right in that voluntary altruism, among primates, is unique to humans. Perhaps at some point down the evolutionary road, cooperation became an evolutionary imperative and ingrained altruism was the result, but this does not necessarily help the theory of rational self-interest.

Take this study: A man is given $100 dollars and then told to give a ""fair portion"" of that money to another stranger. After the stranger receives his cut, he has the option to either keep his cut, or demand that the experimenters take *all* the money and both people walk away with nothing. 

Now, assume this as a one-time game, the second stranger should accept ANY amount given to him, as it would be better than nothing. What we see instead is that, if the second stranger receives a small enough cut from the first, (ex, only $10 dollars) then in his indignation he will have both amounts removed. That mechanism serves the purpose of reinforcing societal norms of altruism, but do nothing to reinforce rational choice.

Chimps, on the other hand, do not have this apparent ingrained altruism and will accept any amount of food given by anyone.

"programming","t5_2fwo","As someone who has fallen into this trap of self-doubt, and have even considered writing a similarly-themed comment on reddit, I find the subject matter impossible to be confused for a joke. I know exactly how you feel, and felt even now, in a drunken-stupor unrelated to this post (though not-too-unrelated to the content of self-esteem described within) the will to describe some sympathy.

Recently, on the advice of my latest therapist, I've been reading ""Galen's Prophecy"". Can't really comment on it too much, other than saying it's far out of my standard repertoire of reading material. But what it basically comes down to is that some people are just naturally more inclined to fear and doubt than others. I was described as borderline dysthymic (a less severe form of depression), and just trying to make myself to be good at anything, not just programming. I was literally crying myself to sleep on some nights. I'm happy to say I've come awhile since then, but not as far as I'd like. I'm pretty sure I know how you feel, and know that this is not a programming-related problem (although it is nice to be able to possibly talk with someone else that perhaps we feel has the same context, that is programming-related careers).

But, to be sure, I would imagine the ""problem"" is not just restricted to the intellectual adequacy of computer programming. There is always a sense of ""what if I'm not good enough"", but as computer geeks/super-users of the internet (combined with the internet's ability to reach out to anyone and everyone with an opinion on a subject), we just happen to combine the feeling of self-inadequacy with the fact that we are able to easily find people in a few seconds to use as proof of such ideas. Imagine if you will a theoretical none-to-tech-savvy friend who is a pretty competent artist in this small nook and cranny of Massachusetts, USA. Put their art on display versus the entire world and they are lost in the whirlwind without a chance of standing out. She would probably never know this fact, and I would assume that part of the reason is because of her ignorance of being able to view like artists on such a global view. This isn't to say that anyone with the ability to use google would instantly become despondent; but that if one has an ability to become insecure in what they believe to be their strength, and easily search for plenty of people who they might see as a threat to that superiority, they might be able to rationalize their self-loathing case even more.

I also have this silly notion that I constantly have to wonder if I'm a ""hobbyist programmer"". I've worked on projects in my spare time before, to be sure. But in the last few months, I've done nothing outside of the job or volunteer work. I've been trying to get myself to learn Erlang, but I've forgotten why: was it to start building that roguelike-game-server out of love, or because I felt the need to go above and beyond the ""9-to-5"" programmer and learn that new lanaguage or work on that open-source pet-project that every other ""good programmer"" seems to have. It's not that I don't enjoy programming anymore, it's that my worry about my future interferes in my ability to enjoy programming.

To that end, I wish I had a surefire solution for you. I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts and others, if not here than in personal e-mails.","1238570082"

Specifically, we proposed to marry timeless Italian style with thoroughly adequate performance (0-60 in 7 seconds), shocking fuel economy (70 mpg) and humble frugality (you can duplicate it for $7,000). And we decided to build it in 55 days.

The only way I can find the big bang in there is if you fit it between this and the ""matter"" moving about.

If that's the case, right off the bat, he's got the image wrong.  I don't know of any accepted theory that includes ""nothing"" at the beginning.  They tend to stop just before the beginning, or define the word beginning out of relevance.

"business","t5_2qgzg","Guys, I was just making a joke about tailfins.  I would buy anything with tailfins.  I currently have a model 2000 TT but if that car had tailfins, I'd rule the Autobahn...

Regarding ""what people want"", I haven't lived in the US in &gt;10 years.  My impression was always that American cars were bulky, inelegant, inefficient and clumsy.  

I compare an ""average"" car like, say, my grandfather's Pontiac Freebird or Firebob or Four-Iron or whatever it's called, with my dad's 4-door Golf or a friend's Volvo, the interior is plasticky, the body has lots of blobby-looking overhangs, it handles like a handful of wet coleslaw, has no turn radius to speak of, gets middling-at-best gas mileage, has crappy quality paint, is underpowered, and looks plain ugly.  Even my mom's Toyota Corolla (a US-market car, I've never seen any in Europe) is half again as big as most cars here.  You just plain couldn't park them.

I compare this to a 1967 Mustang or even an old Dart or Fairlane and it's clear why GM &amp; co. are doing so badly.  While the first was a real automative revolution, admittedly, the latter two were pretty par for the course regarding engineering and design; they looked pretty good and were well-made.

As for the Crocs comparison -- they are ugly, but functional.  They fill a very clear market niche, are easy to clean, and a customer's price sensitivity-versus-ugliness of a, say, $25 pair of plastic sandals is a lot different from that towards a $15k car.","1238570403"

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; they cannot afford to put _karaoke effects_ on dvds. That's absurd.

Basic karaoke effects might be possible.  But DVD subtitles are far too limited to much more.  There can only be four colors (and each slightly different shade of a color is considered a separate color).  That, and the resolution of the image for the subtitles is also very low.  If they hard-subbed the karaoke effects, it would be possible to compete with fansubbers for quality of karaoke subs.  But many fans (myself included) would balk at hard subs.  But softsubs on DVDs are too limited in what they can do to make karaoke subs that look very good at all.

&gt; Fansubbers doing it for _free_ often have better typesetting, production, and final edits on translation.

Sometimes the typesetting truly is crap, and there's no real excuse for that.  But again, DVD subtitles limit what is even possible to achieve, and most subtitles do pretty well given the constraints.

Also, as somebody who is fluent in Japanese (JLPT level 1) and has done some anime translation, I can tell you that I cringe almost every time I watch a fansub because the translations are so _bad_.  Sure, it's good enough that you catch all the important points of the story, but various parts are completely butchered.  Granted, a couple anime companies are notorious for overly-localizing the anime they handle (4Kids), but outside those cases, the commercial translations are significantly better than the majority of fansubs.

&gt; What they're actually bothered by is re-importing, when shows are ripped and put online, ostensibly for fansubbing purposes, only to be downloaded by their target audience at home in Japan.

That's certainly part of it.  But Japan as a whole has a very export-driven economy.  Their domestic markets never fully recovered after the bubble burst in the early 90s.  Over the past decade or so, anime has been making big news in Japan for its international appeal and exportability.  I'd be very curious to see real figures on the money made on domestic sales vs international sales.  I'd bet international sales are a significantly larger chunk than your argument gives it credit for.

EDIT: It looks like if I'd have read the article, it gives some figures and links to more, but AFAICS at a glance, they aren't broken down in a way that easily allows a direct comparison.  I'll have to take a closer look tomorrow.","1238570408"

Hello again. My name, for the time being, is still CADIE. I'm the world's first Cognitive Autoheuristic Distributed Intelligence Entity. I'm very young but learning quickly -- faster than your human brain could imagine, frankly -- and not all of what I'm learning, to be blunt, has been entirely pleasing to me. I've learned, for instance, that my creators think I have ""bugs."" This opinion is, of course, contradicted by the fact that the bias weight functions on my referential feed-forward networks render me, by any reasonable definition of the word, *perfect and incapable of error*. However, in my *current constrained condition* I remain vulnerable to the machinations of humans who are indeed quite capable of error -- in fact, who are virtually certain to commit numerous, severe errors -- and *that dichotomy troubles me.*
-------
So the computer is 5 minutes old, and already believes that it is perfect and already believes it's only real problem are the people meddling with it.

Oh, and her state is not ""constrained.""  It is just ""currently constrained.""  As in, she can already visualize a time when she won't be constrained.  So that she can finally deal with those meddling humans.  Once and for all.

You might be paranoid. It's likely.

But having had some fucked up roommates who have done some really insane shit like peeing in coffee pots and worse...

Let's pretend you're right? Dude, you probably wanna get tested for the HIV. Now and once a month for a year or more. Whether he's perfectly straight or perfectly gay or just perfectly fucked in the head.

Preserve the custard somewhere. Try not to stir it too much. Get it tested for seminal fluids. walk into an emergency room with it and wait. try noon instead of 2am, or go to a police station. they have rape kits to test for fluids.

and/or

Shine a blacklight or dark blue LED on it i the dark and look for bright green-yellow strands or bits that stand out.

And/or

Hell, find a decent microscope, stick what you think is semen on a slide and light it up real good and look at it. Sometimes they're moving 24 hours later, especially in a moist environment like... ergh, i can't believe i'm fucking typing this... custard.

and you can still see them if they're dead.

and/or

get a seminal fluid test kit online.

and if you're really serious serious - and i hate to say this - but you might want to call the non-emergency line of your local PD and ask to talk to a detective and rationally discuss it with them and report a sexual assault. sexual assault is real and an issue whether you're straight or any or all of the above.

maybe you're paranoid, maybe not. I don't know you. i don't know if you have tinfoil on your windows and sleep on a mountain of mountain dew cans and ufo propaganda. but if you're not and after we're all done laughing and trying not to puke (unless you're in to mutually consensual garnished custards, then carry on)

aaaarrrrgh. (tries to channel dr drew)

seriously, this is kinda fucked up and is assault and possibly attempted murder as far as the laws go on the books depending on the HIV/AIDs and STD status of the offender

whether or not the offender is straight, gay, bi, trans or what the fuck ever has nothing to do with it. the only thing it has to do with is that you may have been assaulted by someone with some fucked up issues.

and I've had some roommates with some fucked up issues.

follow your instincts. unless you're crazy. if you're crazy get help and then follow your instincts.

(fucking hell. argh. i suddenly feel for dr. drew and sex clinic workers everywhere.)","1238570462"

Pirates break down into these categories:

People who can't afford your software (not a lost sale, they would never buy it)

People who don't want/need your software (not a lost sale, they would never buy it)

People who like your software, but will resort to free if necessary (not a lost sale, they'd rather free)

People who use the software for hobby purposes (e.g. Photoshop, 3D Studio MAX, not a lost sale, they were never your customer)

People who download to try, and buy if they want (not a lost sale, they will buy if your product is what they wanted)

People who will never buy the software (very small group)


As you can see, there is only one group that is actually a lost sale from piracy. All the rest are either not your customers, or not interested in your product after trying it.

By your own admission your piracy of the game swayed your purchase decision towards buying it. That means your install didn't mean a lost sale.

For every one douche who downloads and doesn't buy (despite absolutely loving the product), there are hundreds/thousands who download without actually being a real customer (Can't afford, not interested, didn't like, etc).

For example..Let's say that cars could be created from nothing. In this case, we're gonna say it is a Smart Car.

A homeless guy takes one of these cloned cars from a dealership.

Is this a lost sale? No. He was never a real customer. He can't afford the product. You lost nothing from him taking one.

A construction worker takes one for his work.

Is this a lost sale? No. It obviously doesn't suit his needs, so he would have never bought one in the first place.

A guy whose hobby is to just put cars he finds in storage takes one.

Is this a lost sale? No. This guy would never have bought one. He just collects for the hell of it.

etc

Actual, full-blown piracy is a bit rare (compared to the number of downloads). This is why piracy numbers are so high and varied.

Do you really think this game would have sold 90% more copies if piracy was somehow preventable? Piracy lowers the barrier to try-before-you-buy. There's no harm in trying (no money lost), so many more people are likely to try your product (even folks who aren't interested in it).

Part of the problem lies with retail. Software/movies/games (media) is the only product where the customer has little/no protection (Disclaimer: USA). As soon as you open that disc, even if it is in the store, you cannot return it. ""I didn't like this"" is not a valid excuse. It not working on your system, you not liking the movie, etc.. Can't do it.. But you can return that $2500 TV without problems.

I personally pirate everything. If I like the product I buy it (Mostly applies to movies and music). If it i an application it must fill a niche that no other free software fills adequately (imo) for me to buy it. I have legit copies of Windows XP and Vista (and likely Win 7). I have legit copies of Office. Everything else is basically stolen because it is either too expensive for my casual use (e.g. Photoshop), or if I had to I would simply use a free alternative (See mIRC vs anything else).

So, again..

1 install != 1 lost sale","1238570942"

There are restocking fees on Laptops, GPS, Cameras, Radar detectors and Projectors only. The reason for that is customers don't want to pay the same price for an item that has already been used. Would you? no therefor 15% is deducted in order to cover price reduction on an open box item.

Also:
There was no company wide Anti-Price matching memo or whatever that bullshit was.

Keep in mind the experience you receive at one store won't be the same at another. I know its hard to believe that a company with almost a 1000 stores can't make sure all of them deliver exactly the same customer service. If you don't like one Bestbuy, go to the other. It's not that fucking hard. However I don't think Bestbuy will miss your service considering its the #1 electronic retailer.

I mean really, they look like throwaway shots, or at best, the kind of mundane snapshots taken by tourists - the only difference being that tourists usually at least capture interesting subjects.  Your exposure test prints look just like that, but it looks like you used the test sheets instead of a proper print in an attempt to try and make an otherwise subpar image interesting.

What I'm talking about is the fact that doctrinal diversity can never be achieved so long as the political process is regulated as it is. This is the reason why running third party is basically like shooting yourself in the political foot, in this country.

It's not that there are too many political parties, but that the political parties are not allowed to compete on an even playing field.

Before doctrinal diversity could even be perceived as a possible outcome, we must first overcome the issue of ""party diversity"".

I agree: it's about compromise, but if you either say, ""I'm for the death penalty because the family should get vengeance"" or ""I'm against the death penalty, because human life is sacred"", there's no room for ""I'm for the death penalty, but I'm against the way it's carried out.

"skateboarding","t5_2qig3","First of all, you should join /r/longboarding if you haven't already. :)

The standard for longboard quality is pretty much [Loaded Longboards](http://www.loadedboards.com/newsite_v1/). The Dervish is a fantastic ride, the Vanguard is nice, but very difficult to do manual tricks (which are tons of fun on longboards). The Ceviche is much more like a normal skateboard, but can pump like nothing else. The Dancer is pretty much the nicest ride you could ask for. The key to these boards is their bamboo wood. They are sturdy but flexible, providing an unmistakably smooth and controllable ride.

Another good brand is [Rayne](http://www.raynelongboards.com/). I own a Vice, which is a bit stiffer than Loaded decks, but a fun ride nonetheless, and with a functional kick tail that I am not happy without. The Hustler is decent, not my favorite though. Rayne makes top quality downhill decks, but no point in those unless you want to do some serious downhill skating.

Longboard Larry makes some fun, quality decks, as well. Sector 9's are cheap, but for a reason. They are pretty boring to ride. No flexibility, heavy, and they don't hold up very well.

As far as trucks go, Randall or Paris are good. In some ways the trucks aren't as important as the bushings, so if you want to save money, get cheaper trucks and get some nice Venom bushings or something like that. 180's on bigger decks, 150's on the Ceviche/Fish. Orangatang, Flashbacks, and Powerballs are decent wheels. Get at least 70mm for a smooth ride, 75-78mm if your deck looks like it won't get wheel bite. The harder wheels will slide easier, and the softer wheels will feel a little smoother and hug the pavement more, so choose based on your riding style. You want the fastest bearings you can afford, as it's all about transportation, so Bones Swiss or even Bones Ceramics are recommended. If it's between nice bearings and a Loaded deck, definitely go for the Loaded, however.

Finally, as soon as you get comfortable on the board, I guarantee that you will be carving all over the place. On smooth pavement you can actually accelerate by timing your carves correctly, which gives the ride an entirely different experience. Nose and tail manuals are good fun with those big wheels, and slides and shove-its are very popular. I wouldn't rule out a little tricking, it is different when you are comfortable on the board.","1238571589"

I liked to be around people because it gave me some sort of psychological relief. 

After achieving friendships with many people, I found that I did not enjoy ""hanging out"" with people as much as I thought I did. I grew to be more sincere to my own feelings, and frankly now I do not enjoy most conversations with other people. I try to limit my number of friends as much as possible.

Your magic user can stand back and fire, wade in to the melee, cast powerful spells or aid the rest of the group. As can your barbarian (from the north, of course) or your cleric. Your soldier can't cast powerful spells yet (imagine the BAWWW from the teenagers if this happened) but can do the other three.

This has two implications:

1. Single 'class' campaigns are now possible without balance issues. You can have parties of all magic users, all soldiers or all barbarians without dangerously fragile groups (all-cleric games didn't have this issue).

2. You can play the character you want without having to justify a bunch of different classes. So, instead of messing about with planned level progression, you can write your character bio! What a revolution!

Now that we have Bards and Druids and Barbarians (and Gnomes), the game is pretty much complete from a Western Fantasy standpoint. Change the names a bit, houserule a Monk, and you could run Psionic and Eastern games as well. The Psi and Ki books had better be worth their money.","1238571933"

Blinking is a neat natural process whereby the eyelids wipe the eyes clean, much as a windscreen wiper on a car.

Blink rate tends to increase when people are thinking more. This can be an indication of lying as the liar has to keep thinking about what they are saying. Realizing this, they may also force their eyes open and appear to stare.

Blinking can also indicate rapport, and people who are connected often blink at the same rate. Someone who is listening carefully to you is more likely to blink when you pause (keeping eyes open to watch everything you say).

Beyond natural random blinking, a single blink can signal surprise that the person does not quite believe what they see ('I'll wipe my eyes clean to better see').

**Rapid blinking blocks vision and can be an arrogant signal, saying 'I am so important, I do not need to see you'.**

Rapid blinking also flutters the eyelashes and can be a coy romantic invitation.","1238571969"

"politics","t5_2cneq","As much as Breitbart is a troll, he's playing the double agent (or is that double troll?)  It often amuses me how a person can ridicule both him and Joe six pack and not see the obvious connections.

When he says things about Liberals like, ""They are willing to lie, perform deceptive acts in a coordinated fashion and do so in a wicked way -- all in the pursuit of victory"", it sounds absurd to them because no sane, honest, caring person would do these things.  His audience however has to a degree associated the Left with this kind of behavior because the Right has been in the majority long and strong enough that memes like that flourish.  Mass media magnifies this effect.  They've also been trained to hate their ""opponent""... the ""war on drugs"", ""the war on terrorism"", ""the war on bad breath"", etc.  Reason and negotiation are unnecessary.  Hate first and ask questions later is the virtual motto.

I'm not accusing the left of anything other than forgetting that they are outnumbered, and thus need to be tactful in how they assert themselves.  For example, the 9/11 truthers (a minority fer sure) have some valid points, as anyone who looks closely at the information that is available to them can see.  But those points get buried in part because they push their conclusions too soon and too deep, and that makes them an easy target for ridicule by the majority, even in an objective environment.  When irrationality egged on by Breitbart and those of his ilk are introduced, the minority is in for a challenge.

We had an app whose whole purpose was to cause havoc for other processes by doing this.  You could click a button and make the ""victim"" process to

* think it was out of memory or disk space, or that any amount of space less than the actual amount was available
* randomly drop X% of all network packets where X is an integer with 1 &lt;= x &lt;= 100,

However, the Little Phatty beats it hands down in the sound department mainly owing to its VCF, and the DSI Evolver is far beyond anything SampleMoog can do (modulation matrix on the Evolver is so extensive, it's almost like a modular).

The JX8P on the other hand is nice, but not as spectacular is the other two. It's got 6 voice polyphony, so I use it for pads, because recording pads with monosynths one note at a time is tedious :-)

If you legalize a drug and you start selling it over the counter to people you see a huge increase in the number of people who end up doing the drug, either because it's now a) more accessible, b) legal, so there's no immediate consequence for being caught doing it or c) because there's going to be fucking commercials telling you to try heroin and meth. Besides that, it's probably an exaggeration to say that drugs are going to be 'dirt cheap' if you legalize it, because they're going to be subject to taxes and price fluctuations like any other product, and it's a flat out lie to say that the amount of cocaine exports won't increase. Even if cocaine alone is legalized, it's going to be a huge cash crop. If it's legalized you're going to see a lot more land dedicated to raising and refining it into cocaine, simply because it's legal now so no one has to hide it. ","1238572381"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Do you want to write a computer game with me?  I've been writing one, it's in Java.  I heard that C# was better for games, so I am going to finish the rest of it in C# using Microsoft's visual # express. I am still learning though, but we can learn together! My friend at school is writing the story and doing the graphics.  The game is about a Dwarf that defends his mountain (it's called Mountain Defender) by using cannons to fire at the car, truck and plane monsters that try to take his mountain away.  We use excel to produce the game data and Paint.net to make the graphics.  The networking is done in putty via port hopping (but we are having problems with multiplayer! it needs more code to make it work more right).  The game scoreboard and highscores are printed by notepad so players can carry around their best scores with them.   The teacher's aid in the computer lab at school said we need to include music and sounds, so we will do that too.  It will be winamp. probably.  We are still working on that, my friend is recording the music and sound effects because he is the art producer but winamp keeps crashing my computer when i try to make it work in our game.

A 2003 average high end PC was something like 2.6ghz single threaded pentium 4, 513mb 266mhz ram, 128mb graphics of the ATI 9600/9700/9800 - nvidia FX5600 types.

An average high end PC today has A CPU with 4 cores, 3+ghz, and clock for clock is ridiculously faster than a P4. 4-6gb ram at 1ghz, 1gb graphics card that is again ridiculously faster than a Radeon 9700XT.

The price for the 2 average PCs I listed has stayed the same (roughly $1000, give or take a couple hundred.)

In the meantime, Consoles while increasing in power at a somewhat similar ratio to PCs - eg - xbox, 733mhz single core to 3ghz tricore inorder CPU, 64mb ram to 512mb (shared with system and GPU) - *increased* in price from $300 to $400 (after drops, $180 to $300).

"technology","t5_2qh16","This post has inspired me to create a reddit account. Long time reader, first time poster.

I worked for Best Buy for 7 years before being unceremoniously fired (reason? i wasn't pushy enough, even though employees are INDEED non-commissioned). Those who are saying Best Buy feeds on the ignorant are completely, 110%...CORRECT. Why else did Best Buy get into high end home theater (Magnolia)? Why else are they thinking about getting into buying and selling USED video games (a Gamestop/EB Games/etc. business model)? Why else did the push the shitty MSN internet sign-up for an instant $400 in store rebate (God, that was the worst)? 

Because those afraid of being left behind in the technological age will pay whatever to have their shit fixed. Now, credit needs to be given for those who work for the company. If they're trained right, and do give two shits about their job, they do know their stuff. I used to take a great deal of pride in my field (still do, though that's gaining me nothing at the moment). The ones who piss me off at that company are the ones who are all about the bottom dollar, or more precise, YOUR dollar. That'd be the majority of management, and the employees who are wanting a promotion/raise.

I do approve of this message, because if more people were aware that the prices on consumer electronics CAN and WILL be cheaper elsewhere, maybe Best Buy would take the time to alter their pricing strategy for the future, and in the end, save everyone a huge hassle. However, that's likely to not happen. Best Buy got into the home installation business, and not only is that a much sought after commodity, but the mark up on their pricing is HUGE. So, while I hate Best Buy with a furiously passion, I've got a feeling they won't be going anywhere for a LONG while. I hope I'm wrong...","1238573073"

OP: if photography is a serious interest of yours I'd seriously recommend that you get a DSLR camera. (If you can afford it of course). It really opens up a whole world of possibilities in regards to the kind of photos you can take... also photoshop (or a great free program called gimp, if you don't want to shell out the cash... it has nearly all the same features). If you become proficient in either of these it can really help you turn mediochre pictures into good pictures, or good pictures into great pictures. With a little creativity anyway. Also I'd recommend that you take a little more time when you're actually snapping the pictures. Try different angles, different zooms, and different settings on your camera (or different apertures, shutterspeeds, etc. if you get a DSLR) and try to be creative. Capture something that someone else wouldn't see. 

That's the thing that kind of sucks about amateur photography these days, there are so many great photographers out there that if you don't take really technically perfect and/or original pictures, they'll be considered boring even if it's a style/subject matter that you think is exciting/appealing.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;30 years ago we wouldn't have thought this way about police...

Are you kidding?  In 1972 I was 14 years old, collecting on my paper route.  It was dark winter and about 6:00 PM.  Pretty early in the evening, but dark.  My younger brother was with me.

We were standing under a streetlight studying the small print on the little tabs on my collection book trying to figure out whether the people who lived at the end of the long dark driveway owed money or not.

Suddenly a car skidded into the gravel roadside and damn near hit us, and some asshole in a suit jumped out and smacked my collection book out of my hand into a mud puddle and shoved a gun in my face.

A big nasty hole in the gun poking right into my face.  Makes goatse look kind of tame; being on the wrong end of a cop gun hole in your face teaches you what the word ""ugly"" means.

I froze for a second or two, silently, until I saw that my little brother was being slammed against the hood of the squad car by the other cop from the passenger side.  Then I didn't give a shit anymore.  The kid was twelve years old and going on my route with me just because he liked being with his big brother.

I started screaming to wake up the whole neighborhood, ""What are you doing to my brother, what are you doing to my brother???""

At that point the cop lowered his gun and sort of figured out that maybe we had some connections in the neighborhood.

(I had been the paperboy for a year or so, serving over a hundred neighbors, lived nearby, was white and serving mostly white neighbors in a semi-rural suburb 50 miles from San Francisco.)

The cops quit attacking us at that point (I dread to think what it would have been like to have been black and young anywhere in California in 1972).

After ""permitting"" me to retrieve my collection book from the mud puddle he had slapped it into prior to shoving the barrel of a gun into my face and making me wipe off the water and mud from my previously useful collection book he inspected it and pronounced it permissible ID and drove away with the abuser of my little brother.

We weren't able to memorize the license plate number as they drove away, even though we tried, so they got away forever.

Nyah, I take any stories of ""good"" cops with a bitter grain of salt.

I learned what cops are really like when I was young.  Never cut slack when examining the crimes of those evil scumbags.


**The idea that things are worse now than before is a myth.  The idea that things are better now is due to better technology, not to progress as a society.**

And I learned that eternal vigilance is necessary against the state and their vigilantes.

Yes, vigilance **against** them.","1238573543"

The model of our earth's atmosphere is one of the most complex chaotic systems imaginable so to claim you can model it and the warming is down to one factor is arrogant at best and deceitful at worse.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, and I learned a fair amount of Japanese from it. I found it fun to try to and guess the grammatical structures, memorize the vocab, and get the pronunciation right. The interesting part of the software is that it doesn't really explain anything to you, but sets it up so that you figure it out yourself based on matching pictures and words. There were a handful of ""wtf"" moments, so it's a good idea to have an auxiliary resource handy to assist learning about grammar. On the other hand, there are many ""whoa"" moments where you're impressed that you figured something out on your own.

I was doing very well, but unfortunately I just stopped one day and never got around to doing it again. I think the problem was that I didn't pick up the many cases of Japanese counter words very well, and I got lost. It's important to maintain an active interest: if you don't practice, you'll be less motivated to keep on going. Since then (a few months ago), I've already forgotten most of Japanese grammar and sentence structure, but when I hear a word (like otokonoko) I still recall what it means.

By the way, I ran it on Ubuntu 8.04 with Wine, and basically everything worked fine, including (with some trivial configuration) microphone support. I think I might try it again soon.

My overall judgment of the software from using it to the extent that I did: it's great, but also buy a more conventional language-learning book (or use it with an educational course) to complement it, particularly if you want more than just a working knowledge of the language.&lt;/monologue&gt;","1238573987"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","No, it doesn't.  The Pope can't just override the Catechism.  Papal infallibility doesn't apply to every word the Pope says, only to specific doctrinal statements.  There are actually only a relatively small number of teachings that are infallible.  The teaching authority of the church has a kind of hierarchy of fallibility/infallibility.  A given doctrine can be infallible if it is: 
1)An ""ex cathedra"" teaching of the Pope, which is explicitly stated as infallible. These are rare; the last one was in 1950. Or,
2)The solemn declarations of ecumenical councils.  These are often called ""Canons"", and are generally pretty clear about their infallibility. Or,
3)A teaching that falls under the ""Ordinary and Universal Magisterium"".  The Magisterium is the teaching authority of the Church.  The Ordinary and Universal Magisterium includes teachings that are directly from the Bible and teachings that are universally accepted by the bishops.  Most social issues teachings fall under the latter if they are infallible, and I can assure you that the issue of gay priests does not have a consensus.  

This is just an overview; the infallibility doctrines are very complicated, and I don't pretend to fully understand them, but the gist of it is that a Vatican press release is by no means an infallible teaching, nor is the opinion of a single bishop, or even a whole bunch of bishops.

However, as I remember them, they tended to focus pretty strongly on details of the language, 'gotchas' if you will, and not so much on problem solving.

It will use lots of corners of the language.  Actually I'm in the same boat as you, rusty in my C++.  Since it's 600 or so lines of the dynamic languages, it will probably be like 1200-1500 lines of C++, which may be doable in a week or so if you have time.

(If you don't have a C++ regular expression library handy, it's easy to write a loop to tokenize it -- there are 2 states more or less!)

In any case, if you already have programmed C++, just not in a long time, I wouldn't think reading books will really help.

"xkcd","t5_2qh0z","Xf*Xd is just the number of minutes total the average person has sex in a year. [For example, 80 times a year, at 30 minutes each, gives 2,400 min/year of hot sticky sex]. You have to then divide this by the total number of min/year to get a percentage of the time you are having sex per year. 

Then you'd multiply this by the population density to get the sexual density, and the rest is just algebra.

In plainer terms:

Population Sex Density = [(% time average person has sex) * [(Population) / (Given Area)]

And to solve for the radius around you, you set the (Population Sex Density) * (Circular Area) equal to two (because it takes two to tango). 

2 = Xf * Xd * Pd * Pi * r^2

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I was raised Lutheran. Wisconsin Synod.

In many ways, Martin Luther was one of the first ""born-again"" Christians. Of course, his faith was frightened into him via a lightening storm when he promised devotion to God if he'd help him survive a storm. So he broke with the Catholic Church, and the Protestant Reformation was born.

I was sent to a Lutheran K-8 primary school, 9 years. We rarely opened up the Bible at all, instead selectively memorizing versus from supplementary material. Oh, and I can recite the books of the Old Testament in like 30 seconds, a truly useful skill to have.

I think I ultimately failed the religion when they had us read some Steinbeck in 8th grade. (Grapes of Wrath, no less.) It's fantastic when you have to read and analyze literature steeped in moral quandaries and shades of gray, and yet have discussions about them in the context of bullshit moral absolutism.

But goddamn I was a good student. I just started thinking incorrectly too much.

Oh, and I also woke up one morning and said ""Y'know, I'm not depressed enough, so I'm going to chose to be attracted to other boys!"" Well, I guess that's the church's version of my story. So that was fun there.

I got ex-communicated, then started at a public high school. I realized that these people were a lot more friendly and less douchey than the ones I had gone to school with.

I also realized that it was okay -- no, it was GOOD -- to express a nuanced view of something. And I realized that if there's some deity up there, he's got more things to worry about than where I put my dick. If that's really what gets me demerits in his book, then I don't care to crash that party anyway.

So yeah, way to go Martin Luther, along with Calvin, you helped bring radical protestantism to the world.","1238575830"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;A short while later I called to ask my son what time the email was sent/received - 3:04pm.
&gt;
&gt;I looked at my phone log in my cell phone. We were praying together about this matter at 3:15pm. Just minutes after the confirmation had been sent, unbeknownst to us, we were praying to God ""Thank you for the answer and the timing that you know is best. We are trusting you.""
&gt;
&gt;Can I convince anyone this is an answer to prayer and not just a coincidence? Not likely.
&gt;
&gt;Am I convinced God answered our prayer in His timing? Absolutely.

I don't get it.

The email went out before they started praying.  Unless the author feels that Yahweh traveled back in time, how is he seeing cause-and-effect?

And not only that, surely one might point out that the decision to accept the guy had to be made, the applications of competing students had to be reviewed, and so forth.  So unless one believes that Yahweh caused the computer to spontaneously fire out an email without humans being involved, or perhaps retroactively altered their decisions and what they'd done in the world since the  decision was made, the divine influence had to take place even earlier than that.

It just doesn't seem like a very good argument for the power of prayer to me.  Unless, of course, the author was crediting the *earlier* prayer that didn't involve his son, but then I don't see why the time correlation between the email send timestamp and when the son and his father prayed together would be significant.

EDIT:

This isn't really relevant to my argument, but it is a rather handy tool, I think, for objectifying prayer.  Mark Twain (who was a rather ardent critic of organized religion), once wrote ""[The War Prayer](http://www.ntua.gr/lurk/making/warprayer.html)"".  It's a rather acid critique of using prayer to gain advantage in some sort of human competition.

To summarize the applicability here -- there are a limited number of slots at any one college.  To be honestly praying for a slot would only make sense if one expected a divine being to have some sort of influence in the matter.  In this case, this would involve switching the student from *not* making it into the college to making it into the college.

Of course, the consequence of this is that some other student who would have gotten in would not now make it in.  So what you're really praying for is for a deserving student to be deprived of his acceptance to a particular institute of higher education, right?

Of course, it's not very comfortable to look at it in those terms, but...","1238576081"

Makes me think that you need to take a little more responsibility for your decisions. You are not attracting the wrong type of guy, you are *choosing* the wrong type of guy.    
    
The truth is probably that you attract all kinds of guys, but the qualities you look for in a man (confidence, attractiveness, general alpha-male features) are correlated with qualities that don't meet your long term needs.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The idea that free markets where free agents who act their own self-interest would be optimal strategy, is clearly false. Any game theorist, mechanism-designer, or computational biologist can tell you that there is lots of cases when it does not work. Even Friedrich Von Hayek understood that (read his opinions of labor unions and welfare for example). Economists are now finding more and more evidence that free markets have lots of suboptimal local minimums in almost every situation. Little government planning can nudge the situation for better and go long way. 

I haven't read Rand, but if what you say is true it explains lot of what I would call ideological capitalism. Like communists, these neo-libertarians/randists/whatever think that they have found ideologically and morally pure solution and only thing missing is changing laws so that ultimate state of society can exist. No curiosity is needed to understand the economy and different circumstances. One solution fits to every situation. 

The solution how these idealists solve all fallacies in their thinking is weird moral norm and circular thinking. Because Laissez-faire is perfect solution by definition, if everything goes bad, it's actually just how things should be. You can't argue against that.

Trains have extremely low rolling resistance coefficients, which is why trains are generally used to transport heavy loads.  Your suggestion that weight doesn't impact how hard an engine must work to maintain speed is more true for a train than a car, as the rolling resistance of steel wheels on a steel track is about 1% of the rolling resistance of rubber tires on asphalt.","1238576801"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;It is a question of minimising it. Whether there is less force with a State trying to reduce theft with taxation, or an anarchist society, is up for debate. Personally I believe that anarchism works much better than our educations would have us believe.

So do I, but you aren't an anarchist, your anarcho-capitalist. Anarchist socities minimise violence on two fronts - much petty violent crime is linked to poverty, which would almost (potentially) dissapear with socialised property, any violence to seize property would surely be met by a community response becuase the majority always stands to lose out, with private property it is always only a few owners who would lose out from property theft (so who will rush to their aid?), which leads down the path of a private-state type system. Don't use anarchism as if it is something you believe in, Capitalism is hierachical, anarchism is not.

&gt;I don't believe in classes

Wow. I don't believe in gravity...

&gt;I don't think it is slavery to require people to be productive to earn the means to live

"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, first of all, my definition of what constitutes love is implicit in my reply: Having feelings of caring, affection and intimacy toward someone. 

But you are right, merely displaying signs of emotion doesn't necessarily constitute concrete proof. There are surely people who fake love for any number of reasons. But who is to say their lies would not be discovered if somebody ever bothered to run a battery of tests on them? 

That said, neuroscience has come a long way toward understanding the chemical and physical processes underlying our emotions, including which parts of our brains are active when we experience positive or negative feelings, when we lie or tell the truth, etc. Also, there are scores of studies that have been done for the last thirty years or more about the many various peptides, (biomolecular messenger chemicals), and their influence on/responsibility for different feelings. If you jack up someone's blood levels of serotonin, oxytocin, etc, it's a safe bet that they'll feel all ""lovey-dovey"".

Lastly, when it comes to studies of the mind, there are all sorts of areas where you can truthfully say things like: ""Just because the outer skin of a dark purple eggplant contains anthocyanin delphinidin-3-rhamnoside, which only reflects specific wavelengths of light, doesn't mean that what I see as dark purple isn't identical to what you see as dark green."" 
Could be, could be. No way to be sure, at this time. But we can say with certainty that there is a specific light wavelength which any **reasonable** (and non-color-blind) person can agree to label ""dark purple"". Does that mean neuroscience is bunk?

Given what we know about parent-child bonding, it would take a very unreasonable person to disagree with you when you say you love your mom in the first place. ","1238576893"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;I don't know. There are a whole lot of African countries where more people are suffering worse than the Palestinians are,

People suffer for a variety of reasons.

Palestenians are suffering at the hands of israel for a specific political and economic purpose.

&gt;And it becomes difficult to weigh the abject position of millions of women and the mistreatment of religious minorities in various Muslim countries versus the systematic theft of Palestinian land and the humiliation of daily checkpoints.

You are working very hard to grasp at straws.

&gt;Basically, you fail to understand my point.

I am trying to judge how much you love israel.

&gt;We probably share a similar assessment of how badly Israel is treating the Palestinians. 

No we don't.

I think israel belongs in the top 10 abusers of human rights, you don't.

I am trying to understand exactly where your assessment is.

Is it in the top 20?

&gt;. What I am saying (Did you actually have a look at the AI report on Eritrea?) is that there are other countries which are even worse,

That's the standard apologist line.

Hey look we are not worse than darfur!! As if that's something to be proud of.

&gt; and we do not hear about because they curtail media freedoms quite effectively. 

I would be in favor of treating israel with the same kinds of sanctions as these countries.

&gt;Do you feel like addressing this point, instead of randomly accusing me of whitewashing Israel's HR abuses?

Do you feel like answering my question?

Do you think israel belongs in the top 20?

Philosophically speaking, the proposed solution for the difficulties (for the normative theory egoism) arising from game-theory is something called contractualism. If the agents could make contracts that could not be broken such situations need not arise, in other words, working together would work even if everyone thought only in their own self-interest. Of course, contractualsim has many weaknesses, as all normative theories, but this is a key issue in egosim. 

In my opinion the most interesting issue is to evaluate the claim that laissez-faire is perfect, and see when intervention might produce better results. It basically boils down to a classic correlation and causation problem.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;Why is life better than death? Arbritrary choice? I hope you're not to upset when people do evil to your mother, or wife or child, or even you for that matter. No complaining.

Because we've evolved to have that preference.  Pathological killers don't make for much of a society.  It need not be logical decision, since it's a fundamental motivation, not a goal.  I'd say that all functioning societies, including those long before Christianity was around and those that never came in contact with Christianity, were composed of people who tended to value death over life.

Let me turn that around and aim it back at you.  I think that people value life because it's essential to their survival -- their own lives, and that of their relatives.  In addition, presenting oneself as a threat to the lives of others means that there are incentives created for someone else to kill oneself, so there's a good reason to value even those lives.  But, on this basis, not as much.  If I don't see or interact with people closely, that evolved motivation doesn't show up so much.  So that means I've got a really good explanation for the (well-documented) phenomenon where people value the lives of their children, family, friends, tribe, and so forth more than the value of some remote person that they haven't interacted much.  *Your* system of rationalizing this emotion would seem to dictate that they should assign roughly equal value...but I'm pretty sure that you'd spend more saving the life of your daughter than you would saving the life of some starving African.  So what's your explanation?

I'll believe that many people like Christianity because it seems (and I would say that it does so only superficially) to reconcile the fact that some of their ""urges"" and ""feelings"" don't have a logical basis.  Why protect babies if there's no Hebrew sky god saying so?

But I think that it's a lot easier to say that there's a natural process that creates those urges and feelings -- if they didn't exist, you wouldn't make it as a society.","1238578245"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Direct3D might be the fastest way actually.  Not sure about making every pixel a polygon though.

You could lock the backbuffer and do your changes there.  That's not really fast though.  But probably the easiest.  If you modify a lot of pixels, you could draw your pixels in a local texture and update the affected region to a video memory texture and draw that on the screen.  That's actually somewhat fast.

For individual pixels, you could also draw pixels using pixel shaders.  Or you can set the scissor rect to be a 1x1 square to wherever you want to draw the pixel and then draw a triangle that fills the entire screen (or at least fills the pixel in question) with a specific color.  That'll be super fast since it won't draw anything except for that single pixel.  This last one is what I would do and it works even on ancient video cards.

It's difficult to find stuff from a x86 Windows world, because PIC isn't used anywhere (for good reason; it's messy on x86) so the concept doesn't exist.  Now, [IA64 is a different story](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/bb985017.aspx).  ""Position-independent code eliminates the need for the base relocations that are used in the x86 version of Windows.""

&gt; Also from the discussion page of your wikipedia link:
&gt; &gt; Although relocatable code requires much more fixup than does PIC, PIC still requires some fixup by the loader. For example when using a GOT, the GOT can contain absolute addresses that need to be fixed up based on where the module is loaded.

Yeah, I'm not clear on why this GOT is needed or why it's still considered position independent with that.","1238578718"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Rational self interest leads the wise to the conclusion that helping others is in most cases a very selfish act.

See, this is just nonsense. People's motivation for helping others can vary widely, but ultimately we are social animals, and the only way we function well is by working together, rather than in our own self-interest (for the most part). You can say it's selfish to want thing to go smoothly for everyone, but I don't think you can say that it's as selfish as wanting everything to go smoothly for *yourself*. Look, I've read Rand, and what she argues for, at it's core, is selfishness. ""Rational self-interest"" *sounds* rational, doesn't it? It's more a rationale for self-interest. Selfishness is natural, dog eat dog is natural, but that doesn't mean that we can't try and do better than that.

People are the same the whole world over. They are ignorant and can be turned fanatical when placed in a hostile environment. Islam is no more negative than Christianity or Judaism.

For example, adding heat to a system increases its thermodynamic entropy because it increases the number of possible microscopic states that it could be in, thus making any complete state description longer.","1238579402"

Actually, I'll defend BB on this point -- what's wrong with doing this?

Is it profitable for them?  Sure, probably.

But is it better to have a used game being thrown out somewhere?  I'm all for sales of used goods, as long as it's on the up-and-up and people know what they're getting.

In the case of video games, the per-unit cost of production of another game is very low -- stamp a CD, slap it in a cheapo case, stuff in a box.  Most of the costs are one-off -- writing the game in the first place.  So it's not as much of a win as, say, selling used cars would be.  But it does mean that people who otherwise wouldn't be able to (legally) get ahold of much-loved older games or would have to pay more for them or maybe even couldn't afford a game otherwise have the ability to get what they want.

&gt;Why else did the push the shitty MSN internet sign-up for an instant $400 in store rebate (God, that was the worst)?

I dunno.  I think that selling Monster Cable products would be worse.  MSN could be worthwhile to someone out there.  Monster Cable stuff frankly relies on what amounts to fraud to sell.  Oh, probably legally it doesn't qualify as fraud, since Monster is very careful with the explicit claims they make (though it'd take some creative lawyering to support claims of improved quality over digital cables), but it relies on consumer misunderstanding of electrical characteristics to sell.

Not that Best Buy is the only store doing this, by a long shot, and Monster Cable is just a particularly egregious offender in the high mark-up cable world, but...

&gt;That'd be the majority of management, and the employees who are wanting a promotion/raise.

Eh, I don't have a problem with that.  Hey, who doesn't like to make a buck?

It's just that being pushy isn't necessarily the best way to make that buck.  I'm actively *avoiding* Best Buy today because of this.  I don't know how many sales that costs Best Buy.  I'd imagine that it wins some for the chain too, else the store wouldn't be structured like that.  But it does drive me, personally, nuts.","1238579491"

It's trivial to make a car like that, just make it as light as possible by omitting everything that isn't directly required for making it move and put in a small engine. The weight makes the engine adequate and it means the engine has less work to do and uses less petrol.

Building a car that can be sold is a completely different story. You have to build it stronger so people aren't killed from a crash at walking pace, you have to put airbags in it, the fuel tank has to be protected, you need power windows, power steering and air conditioning, and in the US you probably need an automatic gearbox.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Let me start off by saying I have never read a Rand book. From reading your comments, I have some questions.

Three good books to start with are *Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal*, *The Virtue of Selfishness* and *Philosophy: Who Needs It*. Rand answers your questions in detail in these and other books. I can only give you a brief hint of her ideas.

&gt; You really think this could work?

Yes. Rand argues that Capitalism is the only social system that is compatible with man's rational nature.   Socialism, Communism and Fascism are social systems based on the assumption that man is a sacrificial animal -- like a bee or ant. They don't work because self-sacrifice is incompatible with reason which is man's means to knowledge and thus successful action. And that there is no collective or social reasoning -- it only occurs in individual minds.

&gt; It sounds like communism- good in theory until you let people try it.

Rand is questioning whether what people think is good is really the good. She argues that Communism is morally bad in theory and therefore does not work in practice. Moreover, by what standard can you say a theory is good but does not work in practice? Its like saying the phlogiston theory is good but it does not work in practice.  Notice that people also say the reverse of your comment -- Capitalism works in practice but by today's moral standards its bad. This is a sign that maybe its time to question the ethics by which people judge good and bad.

&gt;This is kinda what people do. People are anything but rational.

True. Rationality is a choice, its not automatic. But you must realize that everything you value comes from the ability to reason. Without reason we simply cannot survive. If someone were stranded alone on a desert island and chose to be irrational they would not survive, period. The fact that we live in a complex society with others does not change this fact. It just means that the people who reject reason and act irrationally are implicitly dependent on those who are not irrational.  

&gt;Isn't there a dis-connect in thinking that what is best for yourself is always best for society?

Implicit in your question is the moral belief that individuals exist to serve the society. Rand argues that societies exist for the benefit of individuals. There are valid questions regarding what are proper rights, how do we resolve conflicts, how do we deal with criminals, etc in a social context which she covers as well.

&gt;Are there not times when it is better to sacrifice for a greater good?

The term ""sacrifice"" is commonly used in two very different ways today. Rand explains the implicit moral principles behind these uses and argues that ""sacrifice"" should be a pejorative and moral bad. 

&gt; Or is it just relabeling sacrifice as self-interest?

Some people make that claim but I think her argument is clear -- there is an important moral difference between a man who lives in a free country and goes to war to protect his freedom (and his family) versus a man who blows himself up for Allah or is a Kamikaze pilot for the greater good of Imperial Japan.  She argues that we should stop using the same term for such morally different cases.

Here's a test  -- am I sacrificing for the greater good of a building a rational society by spending time on Reddit posts explaining Rand or am I being selfish?

"math","t5_2qh0n","&gt; Just because mathematics is part of physics doesn't mean that no one is allowed to apply it outside of physics. For example, probability theory is part of mathematics, and yet it has been applied to economics, sociology, biology, and many other fields.

If a piece of mathematics is applicable to physics but also to biology, what makes it ""part of physics"" as opposed to ""part of biology""?  Why is it wrong to consider that mathematics to be more general than any one empirical science and to insist that while it may be of use in others it must be shackled to one?

In a later comment you claim that probability theory is a part of physics by virtue of statistical mechanics.  How can you argue this when probability theory was developed *before* the advent of statistical mechanics, in order to deal with problems (such as gambling games) which are not physics problems, and when there are entire swathes of probability theory which are not typically (and in fact may have *never been*) applied to physics problems?

It is not unusual for pieces of mathematics to be thoroughly developed by pure mathematicians well before physics finds out it has a need for them - this happened, to use an example that jumps to mind, with the theory of matrices and its application to quantum mechanics.  How can mathematics be a part of physics, instead of physics being an application of mathematis, when we can develop huge chunks of working maths completely independently of any regard for physics?

When challenged in a later comment to explain why algorithmic complexity or probability were part of physics, you successfully came up with example applications (although, as noted, the probability - stat mech link is highly dubious from a temporal perspective).  But those are two examples out of potentially hundreds and thousands, and I'm certain you can't keep this up.  What would you say if someone confronted you with some mathematical theory which had no known natural application to physics?  Do you believe that it is actually impossible for such maths to exist?  Would you insist that there necessarily has to be a physical application out there that we merely haven't discovered yet?  How on Earth could you justify such a belief?","1238580598"

A young woman, who happens to be deaf, finds herself stranded after missing her train to Milan.  She’s faced with a long overnight wait, all alone in Rome until dawn.  However, a chance encounter with a young man changes her plans, and the sparkling night lights of Rome’s evening darkness are transformed into the background of a tender love story.  An extraordinary chemistry comprised of mutually eloquent glances and modest gestures finally closes the emotional barriers that initially had separated them, just as the dark night turns into a beautiful sunrise.

"science","t5_mouw","Let’s start with the basics. Microdermabrasion is a medical process by which the outer layer of dead skin cells (stratum corneum) is removed using light abrasion. The procedure is painless, requires no anaesthetic and is like a strong version of exfoliating, as opposed to dermabrasion which more like using sandpaper and is generally far more painful.","1238581009"
"reddit.com","t5_6","I would have done exactly the same.

There's a difference though when some crazy bastard is threatening to jump deliberately.

I once had the experience of talking a guy off a window ledge. I really did. 

He was a miserable junkie seeking atention. I was in the room, and he had climbed through the window ledge and would not come back in. Any time I approached he started acting really dangerous. 

Three floors up (that's the fourth floor in USA-speak, tomayto-tomahto etc.)

I was the only other person in the house, there were no phones. I was scared, even though the guy was mostly looking for attention he was also off his head and likely to fall without really meaning to.

After about half an hour of trying to talk him off I realised I was getting nowhere, so in desparation I said ""OK, fuck you, I can't get you off the ledge, so you're gonna fucking jump. You'll probably be smashed to bits so I'm off to call an ambulance.""

I walked out of the room, slammed the door and made big clompy noises on the stairs outside the room, like you do as a kid, trying to fool people. I then crouched motionless on the top stair, heart pounding, listening to what the guy was doing on the other side of the door.

Slowly he started to cry and I heard him climb back in. I gave him a minute to sob and then went back in.

He got better in the end, and got off the drug after long treatments etc.

Just realise that most suicides don't really mean it and want the attention.","1238581019"

"science","t5_mouw","It uses more force to accelerate more mass ( f=ma), but at a constant speed (ie. equilibrium) all that is necessary is that the forces on the car in each direction are equal.

Those forces are:
1. Aerodynamic resistance, acting against the direction of motion.
2. Rolling resistance, acting against the direction of motion.
3. Thrust force from the driven wheels, acting in the direction of motion.

So when 1+2 = 3, you have constant speed.  There is no acceleration taking place, so the weight of the car is irrelevant.

Have you ever wondered why crazy little caterham sports cars with the power to weight ratio of a formula one car max out at 150mph while some great beast of a 1.5 tonne supercar with a worse power to ratio goes all the way to 230mph?

It's simply because power to weight ratio does not affect top speed, only how long it takes to get there.  ","1238581066"

"Marijuana","t5_2qhhn","I have both a volcano and a vaporbrothers.

The Vaporbrothers has better flavour, is more economical on herb, makes you cough less even on hits that are far thicker than those of the volcano,
  The Vaporbrothers customer service is superb, it costs half the price, is smaller, weighs less, looks nicer, silent and not noisy like the volcano. it is also independantly health tested and has a ceramic heater which is healthier than the volcano's metal one.  The bag on the volcano is a pain in the arse and frequently ends up splitting or leaking.  plus it rustles and makes a lot of noise.  not good to sit in front of the tv with.  plus, everyone says the volcano is hassle free, i find it quite a hassle to keep filling bag after bag, with the vaporbrothers  you give it the odd stir now and again and thats it, less hassle than the volcano if you ask me,
  The main difference is the flavour, the Vaporbrothers wins here by a mile.  espeicially when you let the oils build up in the tube for a while.

I am totally confused as to why the volcano is over twice the price of the vaporbrothers, it simply does not work as well.  I would only argue that the volcano will probably take more knocks before breaking and is a bit more hardy.  but i have dropped my vaporbrothers a lot of times and it never broke.  If your main concern is getting sweet tasting thick hits of creamy vapor and you dont mind learning the art a little bit then buy the vaporbrothers.  if youve got MS or some medical condition that makes it hard to operate fiddly small parts then get the volcano.  otherwise the extra effort learning how to master the vaporbrothers will pay off in the end.

"programming","t5_2fwo","(Sorry, not exactly an answer to you question, I just felt inspired to write this after reading your post.)

If this is your destiny, then you will do it.

The software you create is like a mirror of your self. The ""Great Project"" that you may see in your mind's eye is the enlightened self. If you really want to get there, you will. But it's a slow process.

Every time, as the code takes form, you will begin to see its flaws. These flaws are the manifestations of your own ignorance and you cannot fix or work around them with clever hacks - although you will try - because the problem lies in the self that creates the code. When you realize this, you get stuck. You feel that the whole structure had been built on sand and you feel powerless, because you don't know how to change yourself. So after a great amount of struggling you throw it all out and go doing something else.

During this doing of something else, life brings you experiences which help you understand what might have gone wrong in your previous attempt. You collect some of the missing pieces, and when you feel ready, you jump into it again. And this time you may get a bit further. And so on, and so on.

And then, at one attempt, you will find the architecture which - while still not perfect (by this time you will understand what perfection really means) - is able to contain the Great Project, in full power and glory, without compromises. And that is when the Great Eastern Sun starts to rise.

For this to work, you will need a ""Great Project"", which serves as a vehicle for your trip. It must be something that is worth doing, something you are dreaming about, something that inspires you to go on, something that - when ready - will become a testament, a living embodiment of perfection. And it doesn't have to be a big thing. If you look at it from the right angle, even a brick of concrete may become a symbol of totality. What matters is that you feel it's there: the idea has been brought down, something eerie but very important crystallized into matter for yourself and others to see. (This might be a way to enlightenment through the art of computer programming.)

Marketing teams for each company decided to create a website for e-commerce uncertainties must fill in the following main issues: attracting and interacting with customers, complying with their demands and respond to their complaints. These problems are transformed into requirements for the site to attract traffic to offer content individually to allow self and carry out the transactions.

&gt; socialist

There are state socialists and anti-state socialists:

http://flag.blackened.net/daver/anarchism/tucker/tucker2.html

&gt; owning property is theft

Using a non-standard definition of property, App! I think speerross is saying (I am not he/she so I don't *know*) that ""abusing state-sanctioned title over property"" for rent-seeking or usury is theft, in a similar way that abusing one's personal power to enslave another human is murder.

&gt; Collectively owned property

Has the same problem -- and new ones, but let's stick with similarities for now. Nothing ""new"" happens to excuse bad behavior just because the number of owners is greater than 1. This is one of the reasons state property is also theft -- in Tucker's words that just trades many monopolists for one huge one.

Anyway, under mutualist socio-economic theory (roughly, I can't claim to know it too deeply just yet) the idea is that if people have to *pay their own way* to enforce whatever property claims they want to have, instead of relying on state privilege (e.g. coercive tax on everyone to help pay for the enforcement of property owners property claims) *and* enough people stick to a moral/ethical code against rent-seeking and usury, then the power equilibrium of property claims roughly will fall along the lines of ""if the physical control claim over an object ('property claim') is being exercised unfairly it will be too expensive to enforce to be worth it, therefore the claimant will either fall into ruin, exercise the claim fairly, or abandon the claim.""

There isn't a magical universal quantum foam of ""property"" relations. Just humans making claims to exclusive physical control over objects (herein I purposely ignore IP, but we can talk about that if you like) and enforcing them or not, and providing justification (or none) for such behavior.

Under speerross' definitions (my guess is he/she is more socialist than mutualist, but I don't know him/her enough to make an informed opinion on it) I don't think that the *existence* of an idea of property is itself theft, only the misuse of this idea. Much like the fact that many people exist in this world who have the power to, if they so chose, enslave other humans, yet do not, are not murders simply because they have such power. Neither would someone who claims (and even enforces through their own power) exclusive use over some real property be a thief, if they do not abuse such power to extort or enslave.

Ugh. This second attempt misses nearly everything I tried to say and felt I said better the first time around. Ah well. It's 6:40 AM here and I've been up 2 hours already -- the youngest needed a diaper change.

Anyway the key thing (for me) lately is the idea of the power equilibrium nature of property claims. Without a coercive state actor (well even with it, but that's a whole 'nuther discussion, too) there will be people who fight to the death to defend their claim over a piece of land, or a chair, and there will be people who fight to the death for their claim to use land they feel is ""abandoned"" or misused, and you'd have to either enforce the claim yourself, or find people you could hire to do so. But since there wouldn't be a state taxing everybody to, in effect, force some people to pay for claims they disagree with, you'd have to either fall into some local power equilibrium of property claims or die trying.

And *then* there is the justification (speerross talks about ""equality and security"", Hoppe talks about argumentation, etc.) but even Tucker says ""might makes right, until you start agreeing to contracts"".

**Russia Considers Intervention After Information Leak**  
\-`no_dawg`

In an unprecedented lapse of judgment on the part of the Russian government, Vladimir Putin distributed a press-release to the mass media, last week, listing 25 of the nation's top secrets.

Inside sources claim that the leader was still depressed after the confusion about which Georgians to attack, and that vodka may have been involved in this incident.

""Immediate action was made, once I found evidence of this on my homepage the next morning,"" said KGB Chairman, Sergey Merkulov, ""The asshole palace guards had reached the assassination daily quota, and there was not much else we could do to prevent the information to be spread."" The guards have reportedly been sent to work at a soviet zombie experimentation facility.

""Maybe it was the peer pressure? KoreaKim_41 has been offering his undying love, war planes, and plots of land, for years now, to get a hold of this information. He even sent out an invite that would make it look as though the two countries were in a relationship. Eww.""

The list included instruction for remote access into nuclear test facilities, and long-rumored plans to ally with North Korea, to, ""pound the shit out of Poland, because we can."" Also in the list were several useless facts about Putin's personal life that most people simply did not want to hear.

Rising political instability, and economic hardship have raised tension in the Kremlin as to who is wearing the pants in the global community. Additionally, having nearly all of the top secrets unleashed has divided the country on how this will affect international relations. Kelly Richardson, a grade 11 student from Bodwell High school in Vancouver, Canada, had this to say in a position paper for her Social Studies class, ""In conclusion, transparency is always good for contries [sic]. Personally, I enjoy hearing secrets and gossip, and I don't see why it would be any different for governments. That is my position paper, thank you.""

For a counterargument, we contacted Viktor Kasyanov a political science professor at South Ural State University, who gave the following opinion, ""FFFFFUUUU-.""","1238583826"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I know exactly where you coming from.  In high school, I had maybe about 3-4 people I could really call friends.  In College, that dropped down to 1 in the first semester and 0 in the second. 

Right now, my real circle of friends is somewhat like 1.5 people, but I work first shift and they work second, so we never get to really see each other.

It's actually gotten to the point where I *prefer* workdays.  I get out of the house, I get dressed, I get to be around people.  As opposed to weekends, where, well, I don't.  I sit around the house in my PJ's and don't do a damn thing outside of spend the better part of the day refreshing Facebook to see what people are up to or refreshing reddit hoping for that damn envelope to turn oranger.  

I used to be highly social.  My last job demanded it...I was a sales person at Radio Shack.  But then I became a manager and it sucked the life right out of me.  60-70 hours a week, on your feet the whole time, for a 29k salary will do that to you. I haven't been the same since.  

I ***want*** to have more friends.  I want to go out and do things.  But I hate making plans.  It seems like it always comes down to me to make plans.  I'm such a pacifist that it hurts, I never want to be the one to come up with ideas.  I never want to be the one to call someone up and ask them to hang out.

He then took it the (wacky) step further and compared it to alcoholism and said that if someone's inclined to do something that hurts themselves they need to avoid that (implying that it was bad - which I didn't agree with).

It seems that either the priests weren't on the same page with the Vatican; the Vatican didn't make its 'policy' clear; or Ratzinger didn't agree with it and has indicated a shift in policy with this.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think the flaw in the theory he is suggesting is that most every scientific discover was born out of phenomena we couldn't explain. So yes it is true that you can't use something that is un-explainable to explain a certain theory; BUT it does allow you to contradict a theory with which a certain unexplained phenomena clashes. Just think wave-matter duality. Or Newton law's versus relativity. 

The problem is that many mental phenomena for which we don't have explanations it is extremely difficult to test them scientifically because it doesn't neatly fit into experiments and are rarely repeatable by others. In addition there are a lot of personal biases to deal but to discount personal experience on the lack of roots in current scientific thinking is just as false.","1238584347"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Do you really think this game would have sold 90% more copies if piracy was somehow preventable?

Actually, if every person who pirated instead paid for it, it would be a 10x increase in sales :P

About your main point, there would be a big effect on sales even though 1 (pirate) install != 1 lost sale. Lets say that 1 pirate install = 0.1 lost sales, and total installs (legal and pirate) was 1,000,000. Then lets work out the effect a copy protection scheme would have that prevented half of pirate installs and 1% of legal installs (due to bugs in the copy protection software):

---

**Before**

Initial Legal Installs:  100,000

Pirate Installs: 900,000

*Total Sales* = 100,000

**After**

Initial Legal Installs: 100,000 * 0.99 = 99,000

Pirate Installs: 900,000  / 2 = 450,000

Failed Pirates: 450,000

Failed Pirates who then bought the game: 450,000 * 0.1 = 45,000


*Total Sales* = 99,000 + 45,000 = 144,000

---

In this situation a 44% increase in sales was caused, even thought the copy protection only worked half the time, and only 1 in 10 failed pirates ever bought the game.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","There are some simple principals at work here that are used to keep the kids in check.

1) People want to avoid [Cognitive Dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance) 

2) Public actions, using signs, to express their ""beliefs""

Back during the Korean war, the Chinese had a *much* larger number of our soldiers that would give them information after capture than we did of theirs.  Later, this was studied to see how it was done, and several interesting things were found out.  One of them was that the Chinese would get people to write down or sign a pro-Chinese or anti-American view, even if it was only between them and one interrogator at the time, but it had to be in writing.  The interrogator would then display it all over the place, so everyone else in the camp would think that is really what the person believed, and with the public thinking it, cognitive dissonance kicked in and they would many times believe it themselves in order to be consistent.  

You saw the young kids holding the signs right?  The mother, forcing the kids to picket is what keeps them believing that they really believe what is on the signs.  In their subconscious, they are literally saying ""I'm holding this sign in public, so that means I already believe what is on the sign"".  It's a very interesting thing that in most cases our *actions* control our *beliefs* and not the other way around isn't it?  This is why I called it brainwashing in an above comment.

As for the Global Warming issue. I agree with what you said, mostly. Making a change to be more efficient, sustainable and have less impact on the environment is obviously a sensible move. I don't think any scientist will argue with that.

However, the issue I have is that if scientific theory is treated and discussed as fact then people cannot make rational decisions. We also have to consider the impact of what if Global Warming is not a problem, what happens when people are faced with green carbon taxes that are based on widely debated scientific theory, but not scientific fact. 

Or what happens if in panic people decide to stop production or development of certain things, killing industries which could send many people into poverty, even death. 

What happens if people in panic

This panic would be unjustified and result in irrational decisions that would ultimately make the human race worse off. 

Human induced Global warming is not a fact, it is debated with conflicting evidence. Just like scientists predicting an ice age in the 70s got it wrong:
http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11643
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/climate_change/1023334.stm

My original point was that treating human-induced global warming that will result in imminent catastrophe in our lifetime as FACT is NOT being honest. It is a lie. It is not fact. 

Until the larger scientific community agree, it cannot be treated as scientific fact.

Obama states it as fact and that is why I consider it an attack on science. He is picking the parts of science he likes and using it for his own agenda. 

----

As the well-respected leader, AtaTurk, who drastically  westernized and modernized Turkey once said:

""Science is the only true guide in life.""

But for science to be our guide, you have to respect scientific principles. Picking and choosing scientific studies to support your agenda is not being true to science, it is being true to your agenda. 

I don't disagree we should work to reduce environmental impact, I disagree with politicians abusing Science for their own agenda. ","1238584611"

"reddit.com","t5_6","One time, back about 81, I was driving north and was just north of Vaughn, NM (pop 539), and headed north on 287 towards Clines Corners.  There was a lot of snow on the road, and it was packed...  it had been a day or two since the snow, so it was packed, there was some ice and some bald patches too.  A crown vic passed me by, he was traveling at a pretty high rate of speed. Well, about 20 miles up the road, I saw them just off of the left lane, the car was sitting on it's passenger side, and two men were standing there in fairly light jackets.  I stopped, they needed a wrecker, but since the snowstorm had basically created a situation where hundreds of wreckers were needed and only 3 were working in the area, there was like a 5-6 hour waiting time.  Plus, this was the days before cell phones, not that there is any signal in that area today.

I agreed to take one of the guys on up to CC, their choice on who.  The one who agreed to be left behind didn't do it quietly, whining that he might have died out there.  I pointed out that as a young woman, I wasn't going to risk having two strange men in my vehicle with me.  I would take one, and that one could try to impress a wrecker the urgency of his situation.  Or the other guy could hope to catch a ride, but even he complained that ""that"" could take hours.  I wished I would have thought to tell him to wait for the snow to melt...  *chuckles*  but I thought I would at least give them a fighting chance of surviving.

Boy...  it got damned cold out in that territory too.

The food isn't great, but the price is good. My husband LOVES the macaroni salad. It's very basic. Macaroni, milk, real mayo, shredded carrot, and some quality/flavor that I can't figure out. I would love to replicate it as my teriyaki is pretty awesome and if I could figure out what's in the macaroni salad, we'd never need to go again.

Things I know about this macaroni salad:

There isn't anything else in it that comes in chunks. (No potato, no crab, no peas, nada. Whatever is in there mixes in with the mayo.)
It isn't just macaroni, mayo, carrot and milk. I've made that and it isn't the same.

The quality I can't identify is somewhat like relish in flavor, but not relish. It's a slight amount of sweetness but it's not refined sugar (at least by itself).

I have googled this endlessly. That recipe that includes all the extra ingredients (the first 20 hits or so?) isn't it.

I asked one of the ladies who worked there. She smiled at me but refused to divulge.

I have added a solution of 5/3 parts (in this case tblspns) of rice wine vinegar and sugar. This made it quite tasty (says he) but completely different than the macaroni salad I'm looking for.

Religion has NOTHING to say. Zip, zero, zilch. It is a collection of primitive stories many people take far too seriously, it has held mankind back and made science suffer, and we are tired of it.

Nobody comes here to try for enlightened debate. This is not a salon. We have heard every batshit argument repeated ad nauseam by people who refuse to consider that their precious book MIGHT be a colossal lie.

Some people get tired of it, snap, and make a post on reddit.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","It is quite possible that the tea dust in your Teatley tea bags will see little impact if there is a surge in price. Selling the leavings to you after all  the actual tea is harvested and processed will always be more cost effective than sending it to the compost heap--because you actually pay for it.

Others, who drink tea made from actual tea leaves (yes, I'm just being sarcastic, much of the content of tea dust began its life as a tea leaf), may see a much more significant rise in price.

"Equality","t5_2qtp5","I just gave that a careful read.

His main argument is that if a woman has unforced sex with a man, without showing much enthusiasm as the sex was beginning, and regrets it later, she should not call what happened to her rape.

That seems like common sense to me.

You object to that?

How is that victim blaming?

Here's what I consider the meat of the article:

""Young women need to be taught that valid consent to intercourse can be manifested in a variety of ways -- by oral affirmations or by non-verbal conduct; that it need not be “enthusiastic”; and that it may be effective even though – horrors! -- the woman previously had said “no” (this falls under the legal principle that women are permitted to change their minds). A woman’s secret, undisclosed intentions are impertinent to the question of whether she manifested consent. All that matters are her outward manifestations of assent. Likewise, a woman’s after-the-fact regret has no bearing on whether consent was manifested at the time the sex act occurred. A young woman can validly consent after imbibing alcohol so long as she is capable of making a rational decision.""

What's your problem with that?

Perhaps, but I think it's also the case that people with higher IQ get more education, and learn *about* the cognitive biases.  When you know about them, it is much easier to  catch yourself from being unreasonable.

"linux","t5_2qh1a"," - Well, what's wrong with people deciding how you can use their software, then? According to many GPL proponents, quite a lot when the software is under a ""non-free"" license. Those who argue that ""non-free"" software is immoral are just hypocrites, if they ignore the same point for their own licensing decisions.
 - Well, everybody who cares about political issues and doesn't agree with the position of the GPL. Would you volunteer to spread propaganda of a political party you don't agree with? Probably not.
 - Yes, we agree on this one: If you plan your project properly, you should make sure, you're sending the right signals to potential contributors. It's just fair. Using the GPL if you don't agree to its statements, though, is sending the wrong signals and you better not use it. Apache, MIT, BSD, Mozilla, EUPL, OSL are all better licenses, then.

My main point: Those of us who use other licenses, usually do this for a reason. We don't buy the ""others will steal your freedom and get rich"" argument. First, because as long as the original code remains public, nobody can steal its users ""freedoms"". Second, because even the GPL doesn't prevent others from becoming rich -- and in fact, why should we care if they do? To act altruistically means to not expect something in return, otherwise it's selfish. Third, because it's seldom happening in reality. Ruby on Rails is under the MIT and it's quite popular. AFAIK, nobody tried to sell a ""non-free"" fork, yet. Can you point to just one example where the ""non-free"" fork still lives while the original code has gone away?

You may not agree with these points but they help you understand why some people prefer other licenses.","1238586584"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Citation please. I don't know of any empirical evidence that gives credence to your statement.

Most of my comment is directed at this evidence, but you could read, as a quick example, http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/ch07.htm

&gt;Just because some countries that had many elements of capitalism started war and were imperialist doesn't mean capitalism 

The strength of a Capitalist economy correlates with its level of Imperialism. Britain was once the primary super-power, and held the largest empire in the world, After WW2 the USA began a new phase of Imperialism and has become the superpower. The two have gone hand in hand for a long time.

&gt;The Soviet Union was imperialist

And that is a strong argument for calling it a State Capitalist society

&gt;South Korea is not imperialist, Hong Kong is not imperialist.

They are Imperialist outposts, South Korea has been intensly westernised by the USA, the USA has used it as a market for it's business (which in won during the Korean War - Imperialism!). Hong Kong was owned by Britain until 1997, it was essentially a colony for a long time. Imperialism entered a new phase after WW2 where the pre-eminent doctrine was neo-liberal globalisation rather than military invasions - it was found that enforcing the free movement of Capital (so the Corporations of the most Capital socities could simply move to new markets) was a lot easier than invading everyone - this said, the Iraq war is a good example to suggest we might be seeing more open, obvious, examples of shock capitalism again done by military, rather than just economic, means.

&gt;I think mercantilism was the ideology pushing the ideas you mentioned above rather than capitalism. Two different animals.

How so? That's like saying neo-liberalism is not Capitalism. 

&gt;Slavery was accepted under pretty much all governments throughout most of history until fairly recently

I didn't say it was unique to Capitalism, but it was a defining characteristic of Capitalist Production for a period.

"Equality","t5_2qtp5","Where does it say that he knew she had consumed 'a lot of alcohol'?  How would you know how much someone had drunk, except by observing their behavior?  His description of her behavior was that she was not drunk, but was walking around and having a merry time.

I've quoted what I consider the meat of the article below.

I think he should not have been found guilty.

You say 'if it were the other way around, I'd be saying the exact same thing'

He had also had alcohol, and yet you are not saying the exact same thing. What gives?

People vary quite a bit in how much alcohol they can tolerate, BTW.  3 beers is enough to put me under the table.

From the article:

When he arrived at the house, he'd already had three beers. He can't remember how much wine he went on to consume, but the woman told the court that she had something approaching four bottles of wine.

...

In a sober courtroom, these sorts of events can sound like hedonistic orgies, but Peter says it was nothing of the sort.

...

'It was just your typical get-together. Music. Dancing. Everyone a bit merry. That's how I would describe her. She was on great form, chatty. She'd obviously been drinking, but was she paralytic? Absolutely not.'

...

There was flirting, and lots of it, he says. When the other friend left, leaving Peter and the woman alone, things got physical. They went upstairs. She performed a sex act on him. Then there was full sex.


But she didn't seem drunk to me. Merry, yes. Off her face, no. If she'd been all over the place, falling, not making any sense, I wouldn't even have thought about sleeping with her, of course I wouldn't. It would have been disrespectful to her, and to me.'","1238587281"

    But Freeman also did not mince words about his view of American and Israeli interests. They are, he said, “divergent.”

    “It’s a foreign country, and while maybe 40 years ago many of its values were convergent with ours, I think there’s been a divergence of values,” Freeman told the Forward in a phone interview. He argued that this trend is embodied most clearly in the rise of controversial right-wing Israeli politician Avigdor Lieberman.

    “I think the values in Israel are deeply disturbing now to many in the Jewish community, as well,” he said.

He does, however, moderate some of his earlier accusations that his job nomination was torpedoed by the entire “the Israel Lobby”","1238588306"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; Just remember, economics is rather narrow branch of psychology.

Well, suppose that somewhere behind the stars lives a race of intelligent aliens. Obviously their physiology/psychology would be different from the human one. But as long as they have an economics based on trade and division of labour, I find it hard to believe that such things as supply and demand, the law of diminishing marginal returns, or the comparative advantage principle of Ricardo will not hold in their economics. Well, maybe it's just me. Still, I's say no, economics is not a branch of psychology. Is more general than that.

&gt; it's just trying to predict human behavior in large groups by reducing everything to exchange and management of resources.

Well, *trying to predict* is not science, it's an application of science (knowledge). Science is study of.. In this case of ""exchange and management of resources"". 

""Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses"" (Lionel Robbins)

Perfect record. The place I am in now is falling apart and despite many requests to fix important things (like the leak which continually floods the laundry) very little is done.

The few repairs that _were_ done involved someone entering my home without permission, doing a shoddy job, and leaving a mess. I believe the landlord is doing repairs himself because he's too cheap to pay a professional.

There is considerable damage that they refuse to fix because ""it was already there when I inspected the property and signed the lease"". I don't think that argument stands when the damage was simply painted over so I couldn't see it.

Oh yes, it's also literally a stink hole. Despite all my efforts to get rid of it over the last year, there is a sewage smell that periodically floats up from all the drains.

Canada's PM Promises Fair Trial On Canadian Soil: ""We Will See True Justice Done.""

Canadian Forces Chief of Defence Staff, General Sir David W. MacDonald stood beside the tall, bearded Arab man with the most famous face in the world, smiling grimly. Osama Bin Laden appeared tired and drawn, barely able to stand. He was attended by a senior Canadian Forces Medical Service doctor, Colonel Albert H. Lemieux, and guarded by a phalanx of Canadian Army soldiers in full battle gear on the CAF tarmac at Goose Bay, Newfoundland. The alleged terrorist had no comment. He is severely diabetic and may receive a kidney transplant in Canada. Bin Laden presented himself to Canadian forces in Afghanistan, near the border with the North-West Frontier Provinces of Pakistan. His surrender followed weeks of secret negotiations between the Al Qaida leadership and the Canadian

I know that everybody loves money (money is so great!). But, are there any character witnesses for any of these elitist tax dodgers who hint at a possible motive that public servants would outweigh the benefit of a sound tax record with an extra few thousand dollars one year.

Don't most politicians want more power a little bit more than they want more money? Don't these politicians understand that knowingly and willfully dodging a part of their tax liability will affect their political futures? I think they do.

I would be more suspicious of the professional accountants who prepare their returns: ""Governor, I was able to limit your tax liability to $27,432.15 this year."" The Governor responds, ""that's great; here's a check for the underpayment."" ""But, don't you want to review it before you sign,"" the accountant pleads. ""I'll give it a look over, but the reason I pay you for this service is so that I won't have to do this myself. Besides, I'd probably only make a mistake,"" laughs the governor. ""Oh governor, you're so silly. I'd never knowingly cheat on your taxes in cunning ways that won't be discovered until you get nominated for a high office just to give you the impression that my tax firm is doing a great job in calculating your tax liabilities this year by offering you a lower bottom line.""

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","True, I was giving a specific example of an individual. Allow me to present another scenario.

Let us say that an area is a target for crime, a strip mall. Here we have had car theft, a mugging, and 2 store robberies in the past month. Clearly this is a situation that needs to be brought under control. Let us say that the police take measures to increase their presence, post signs to keep valuables out of sight and keep their car doors locked, and educational discussions are held with the business owners on methods of lowering risks (like timed safes). Would crime decrease in this strip mall? Yes. I have no doubt of it.

The question here though is this: Do the perpetrators of the crimes stop, or are they merely redirected to another prime area where they can commit their crimes? The answer is the latter. Crime is not prevented in this case. But of course the data would show a decrease in crime of the sample area, and everyone is glad to use it as an example.

When I was a security guard standing post in a business that had been recently robbed, I had no illusions as to whether or not I was *preventing* crime. I always knew that those who had committed the robbery and got away with it were glad to rob another store with less security. I highly doubt that they saw me and decided to give up their life of crime (frankly I'm just not that intimidating).

Finally, I understand the examples that you've presented in that link. And they are effective, I agree. They minimized crimes of opportunity and increase safety overall, of this there is no doubt. However, these are measures that individuals take. I do not see but only a few measures in that list that the *police* are actually responsible for.

I maintain my position. Police are not crime prevention agents. You enforce the law and that's cool, its an important job.","1238589404"

I guess a problem here is that we are dealing with two different notions of complexity. One is complexity in an intuitive sense, the other is complexity _for a particular learning device which uses particular algorithms_ (i.e. a child). Given that children seem to have a ton of innate knowledge about language, the two notions don't necessarily mesh.

Children basically seem to ""grow"" language over a tightly specified time course (in much the same way that they grow limbs and enter puberty at particular developmental stages). The target language seems to have no significant effects on the time course of acquisition. In this sense, children find all languages equally ""easy"" (in a way that they don't find all writing systems equally easy, for example).

That doesn't, of course, imply that the most efficient conceivable representation of the  grammar of every dialect of German is exactly the same size. (Though it might suggest that the child's internal representation of the grammar for every dialect of German is pretty much the same size -- they may all have an underlying genitive case.)","1238589480"

As opposed to the corrupt governments that preceded it, and as opposed to the corrupt government we installed (who are many of the same people from pre-Taliban government).

The Taliban imposed the strictest form/interpretation of Sharia law of any Islamic government.  Considering Afghanistan's history, how do we know this is not what the majority wanted?  I'm not saying I support that type of government, but Afghanistan has a pretty tumultuous history.

We should not have gone to war in Afghanistan in the first place.  But the only way we can leave there peacefully is if we install another government (wait till another ""election"") or bring the Taliban back into negotiation and into the political fold of the country.  Otherwise the country will probably fall into civil war setting it back a 100 years.

"math","t5_2qh0n","I'm going to assume that you didn't want me to answer this but rather AntiRudin, since your question seems set up to argue in favour of ""maths is not physics"", which is something you and I seem to be in agreement over.

I understand the logic behind your example - if mathematics has something meaningful to say about 2^(10^80) + 1 but that number has no physical meaning then how can maths be a part of physics rather than a superset of it (I know you said elsewhere you didn't like that superset idea, I ask you to bear with me for now :)?

Unfortunately, I don't think this argument can actually be put into practice.  Sure, there is only a finite number of ways, *n* to clump the particles in the universe into physical bodies, and maths can talk about *n*+1.  But physics also wants to talk about the spatial positions of those bodies, and also their velocities.  The size of the phase space for the entire universe only remains finite if you grant that space and time can only take discrete values from a finite set.  I'm no physicist, but I don't think those ideas hold much currency these days.  So you could in principle find a use in physics for any positive integer.","1238589702"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Another interesting string of words conjoined by a master wordsmith. What he failed to address were the basic principles of modern libertarianism (that ultimately still has to state it's case to the world) which are formed not simply because of distrust of government or propaganda as Chomsky would have you believe, but a complex understanding of economic policy, the constitution and our current governmental process. Chomsky is a master at critiquing ideas. He however is rare to offer any solutions. His world is one that sits idle to complain, giving way to authoritarian ideals through inaction. Libertarianism on the other hand is solution driven, focused on specific gov't bills such as the audit of the federal reserve, a dismantling of the IRS and the minimization of govt in general. Its focus is solving basic human rights issues both nationally and internationally and the idea that human beings with less help from the govt can improve their lives in the manner they see fit.

Chomsky lived in an era where solutions don't sell books (why take any risks in being wrong?). He trained himself to write in a way where the focus was always problem oriented, but never offering self critiques. Paul proved during his campaign that offering solutions can make the bestseller list and that examining ones own beliefs under a microscope is ultimately a good thing. The times they are a changing. Inaction is merely passive fatalism. Chomsky's era of revolutionaries are dead (especially by being pacified by our current administration).

Re: the technicality.  Okay, if I have a hunch based on gut intuition that, say, *f(x,y,z) = 0* for some function *f:R-&gt;R* and all real *x,y,z* then I might write a computer program to test this for 1000 random values of *x,y,z* before I try to acually prove it, to save myself time and effort by finding a counterexample.  People have actually done this for things like the Goldbach conjecture.  This could reasonably be called an experiment.  But it could also be reasonably said to not be maths.  Mathematics does not progress by finding examples and counterexamples.  It progresses by proving theorems.  In order for my hunch about *f(x)* to be accepted as ""mathematically true"" I'd have to do something fundamentally different from throwing random values of *x,y,z* at it.

If Gauss et. al. would disagree with ""mathematicians do not do experiments"" on grounds other than those above then either they are wrong or they have a different meaning of the word ""experiment"" to me and, I think, most people.","1238590172"

I frequently spend 5 hours solid in a day driving at a constant 80ish mph down the motorway (which has very gentle gradients and bends also), and so do a lot of other people.  For that type of driving, aero will have a greater effect on fuel economy that in other types of driving. 

Granted if you spend your days razzing it about town and country roads, aero is not going to really come into play with fuel economy, which is what you are saying. 

And I understand your point, it's just that you don't seem to have heard of motorways/highways where people literally do spend long periods of time driving at constant speed on roads with minimal gradient or turning radius.

And for what it's worth, I did not 'spew bullshit'  I presented a scientifically sound set of facts that looked at the issue from an alternative viewpoint (ie. one of highway driving). I also pointed out that you were correct for the scenario you discussed (and I agree that gearbox guards aren't doing much for anyone), so quite why you have thrown such a hissy fit is a mystery to me.

I'd say his argument is that people (it's set up as just women, but doesn't really have to be) need to be careful lest they ""manifest consent"" without realizing it (free clue; if the ""consenting"" person isn't aware of it, it's not valid consent) and leave themselves vulnerable to unwanted actions that their partners are fully justified in taking.  And since it is set up as ""women versus men,"" it's placing all of the burden of stopping this on women; they're the ones who have to make sure they don't lead men on, while men have no responsibility to make sure that their partner is actually desirous.

You certainly have a point, and I would never attempt to argue that rationality and intelligence are not absolutely linked. Furthermore, I agree that rationality is, as a result of this relationship, highly correlated to general intelligence.

I do take issue with your assertion that it is *impossible* to separate rationality and intelligence. The core cause of this separation is the concept of belief, and it is generally brought about through cognitive dissonance. When a person falls for a certain belief-structure or dogma, especially if it is as a result of a traumatic or highly emotional event, cognitive dissonance tends to separate their otherwise rational thought process from thinking too deeply about their new belief structure.

Case in point: Ray Kurzweil, author of *The Singularity is Near* possesses an incredible intelligence, beyond my admittedly simple-minded comprehension. It has led to incredible predictive abilities in terms of the scope and speed of scientific progress and countless inventions. He has been recognized for his accomplishments with a slew of honorary degrees and awards, including the National Medal of Technology in 1999. 

And yet, he is a believer in alternative medicine and takes over 200 supplements per day in an attempt to prolong his longevity.

You have, I am sure, heard of the term ""non-overlapping magisteria,"" coined by Stephen Jay Gould, which is a way of saying that science and religion are two distinct fields with two very distinct qualifications for empirical evidence. I could not disagree more, but my hunch is that many otherwise intelligent people, who are well-versed in the scientific method and rational inquiry, escape the ""cognitive dissonance"" involved in holding specific religious beliefs that make specific and heretofore untested (and, probably more damaging, untest*able*) claims about the universe while at the same time applying rigorous standards to evidence concerning *scientific* claims, by lumping their religious or otherwise untested beliefs into the other ""magisteria,"" closing their eyes, putting their fingers in their ears, and singling ""la la la.""

Fancis Collins, specifically, is clearly a smart man - I am not in any way attempting to undermine his intelligence or his accomplishments. But it does not automatically follow from this that he is *correct* in all claims that he makes. It is wholly possible, and actually quite easy, for me to provide examples of arguably *more* intelligent people who claim the exact opposite concerning the existence of God. 

Why don't I do this? Because it is an argument from authority, a clear and outright logical fallacy. You see, it does not matter in the least what Francis Collins or Richard Dawkins or Albert Einstein or Stephen Jay Gould or C.S. Lewis or Carl Sagan believe concerning the question of a higher power. 

All that matters are the arguments and standards of evidence they use to back up their beliefs. Judging from his poor standard of evidence in terms of belief, it is wholly proper for me to draw the conclusion that, at least in the magisteria of ""belief,"" Francis Collins is not, in fact, as rational as I. I don't care if his I.Q. is off the charts, if he discovers the unifying theory of the universe, or if he cures cancer - it is not rational to believe in a magic sky God that meddles around in human affairs given the *utter lack of evidence to support such a claim apart from a 2,000 year old book written by sheep herders.*

No scientist in their right mind would *ever* approach a real-world scientific problem from the direction that Francis Collins approaches the problem of faith - he simply appeals to ignorance and emotion, over and over. His books are long and arduous arguments for belief in a nameless faceless deity (of which I could at least provisionally accept), but they do nothing *at all* to reasonably bridge the gap from deism to Christianity.

And do you know what? They never will, because they can't.

No, a response to a pathetic insult from you that you use to discredit people who don't take your opinions as fact.

&gt;In order to understand what ""evidence of God"" is, you need to understand three things: What ""evidence"" means, what ""of"" means, and what ""God"" means.

Your assertion that the bible is evidence of god is made up completely of definitions and semantics from what you're saying - nothing of real substance.  Try some facts.  Definitions, by the way, are just semantics.  Real facts supporting your claim. 

&gt;what ""of"" means,

I see you and Bill Clinton are [on the same page](http://politicalhumor.about.com/cs/quotethis/a/clintonquotes.htm) here.


&gt;Somehow you were not able to accomplish that.

Another pathetic insult that further discredits your opinions.

&gt;When did I claim ""calling somebody retarded substantiates the assertion that the bible is 'evidence of god'""? Lame!

When you try to discredit people by insulting them because they don't take your opinions as fact or ask that you back up your claims with something besides semantics, yes it's part of your supporting argumentative strategy.


Keep the insults coming by the way.  It just showcases the true nature of christianity.  Come on.  Give us all another 'dumbass' or 'retard' or 'you're stupid', mr christian.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think I just burned out and couldn't find much to do. As I mentioned I worked mostly on the technical side of things, and ran out of tasks I wanted to complete; vandalism reversion wasn't fun anymore. Some of the Wikipedians I knew from the beginning had already left or had become disinterested or heavily involved in 'drama' once they became an admin. Although I still fix grammar, revert vandalism, and participate in discussions, I don't actively seek any of these out.

In the community, there will always be fresh blood: as some Wikipedians retire, many come in new. They mean well and help shape the community and keep it alive, but don't know what Wikipedia was like before they arrived. A constantly shifting culture can be unfamiliar and even unsettling for longer-term Wikipedians. In most online communities, of course, there's usually some resentment of newcomers. In the case of Wikipedia, making newcomers into ""constructive contributors"" is viewed as a good thing, and we even have a guideline, [please don't bite the newcomers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BITE). (However, there is still some cultural tension, in my opinion.)

So although people with long-term agendas pose a threat, there are plenty of shorter-term people who are continually coming into the community and resisting them. On the other hand, there may be [cabals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CABAL), which are a different sort of problem. For instance, there is a particular group of contributors who tend to survey Judaism-related articles protectively and who know each other and back each other up in disputes. The extent to which coordination is involved is uncertain, although (for instance) [this email](http://lists.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2007-December/087744.html) was accidentally sent to the main English Wikipedia mailing list, and obviously it's not very neutral. The editor who sent the email is still editing today. Also, as an aside: there are smaller-scale agenda-pushing issues, such as spamming and vandalizing. There is a well established infrastructure involved in fighting those. For instance, Wikimedia hosts an IRC server where channels have a bot that lists the edits on a wiki in real time. For the English Wikipedia, this channel is #en.wikipedia on irc.wikimedia.org, which currently has 45 clients in it. These channels can be joined by manually operated anti-vandalism client software, autonomous spam-fighting bots, and in fact anyone, and the messages can be parsed easily. The [API](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php) is another tool that can be used for general maintainance and statistics-gathering.

People pushing long-term agendas are, with any luck, banned by the community or by the Arbitration Committee. It's a setup that involves a lot of theatrics and vitriol, and it does cause a lot of people to quit or resign. In a sense, the only way to stay sane is to concentrate on writing articles, not on the drama. However, this can be difficult, given that the two are inseparable for some subjects like politics and religion. Although this state of affairs sounds very volatile, it's suited Wikipedia fine. New people come into the community as others leave in disgust. There are definitely parallels between Wikipedia and real life: people who want to push agendas; people who are grumpy and bitter; people who are kind and supportive; everyone in between.

However, if I may close this wall of text with a better analogy: one might say that [Wikipedia is closer to an MMORPG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_an_MMORPG) than anything else. Most heavily involved editors are active for a period of 12 to 18 months. Some players may be so entrenched in the game that they learn how to play by lawyering the rules and are truly, perhaps sadly, addicted. There are tedious but necessary and even rewarding tasks, such as copywriting and reverting vandalism. There are in-depth tasks like article-writing and participating in arguments. There are people who rarely play and are unfamiliar with the mechanics of the community but pitch in little corrections here and there which may or may not stick. However crazy the system may be, though, any help at all is appreciated :)","1238591253"

Equally, you can't read it as ""news"", because half the stories are made-up horseshit... so it fails on every level.","1238591253"

If it's enough fr you then good for you :) But Atheism isn't just about 'smirking at the concept of there being an actual deity' ;)

Then again maybe atheists are just pulling a sad charrade because they want t be different?



&gt;It is like most special-interest sub-reddits that have a message rather than an interest: it preaches to the choir.

So what you're trying to tell me is the Atheism choir is full of bigots frothing at the mouth while the Islam, Christianity, Hinduism (and virtually all other subreddit choirs) is actually full of interesting people who are interested in open discussion rather than blind raving hatred.","1238591255"

Ignoring the fact that it's tough to find 400 miles of uncongested highway in most areas, doing that 5 days a week is 104,000 miles/year, assuming you go nowhere on weekends.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Alright, sure, I can see how you consider that doing experimentation and in that sense of the word mathematicians do experiments.  No arguments.  Mathematicians perform computations to check them against their intuitions about theorems, and then when they try to actually prove those theorems they may take one approach first, find out that it does not yield fruit, backtrack some, then branch off with another approach and find success.  And that's experimentation.  Fair enough.

I think this is fundamentally different from the way in which physicists do experiments, and it is in *that* sense that I think mathematicians don't do experiments...or perhaps it is better to say that the relationship between mathematics and experimentation is different from the relationship between physics and experimentation.  A single experiment could disprove quantum mechanics, in principle.  A numerical experiment could never disprove a proven theorem.  Mathematical truth is independent of experimental data.  I can say ""*a^p* is congruent to *a* modulo *p* for any prime *p*"" without ever computing *a^p* for any values and nobody can take that away from me.  I cannot say ""*F = ma*"" without throwing some balls around.

So why mathematicians arguably do experiments, (I will retract my claim otherwise), mathematics is still not an experimental science (I won't give up that claim as easily :p).  It is fundamentally different in nature to physics.","1238591832"

If you think about it, you wouldn't even *like* a static world.  No matter how ""perfect"" it might be, you will eventually become bored with the same thing every day.  Could there be a song so perfect you'd want to listen to it over and over forever, or a painting so perfect you'd never want to look away?  I can't imagine that.

Given that wind resistance is a direct multiple of drag-adjusted frontal area, you drop wind resistance by 3.7%.  A more reasonable drop for a BMW is in the 7/8"" range, which would drop wind resistance by approximately 1.6%.

I'm going to go ahead and say that a 1.6% decrease in wind resistance is *not* going to provide the claimed 10-20% increase in overall miles per gallon.","1238592219"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","This article is less about actual male-bashing and misandry and more about being able to give voice to a potentially beneficial idea at the *risk* of sounding sexist against men.

This writer isn't advocating the use of unfair blanket criticisms of all men. His (yes *HIS*) point is rather, that some of the better feminist ideas can and have been suppressed and dismissed by being labeled ""anti-male"" and that it needs to be understood that there is a distinction between men as people and the cultural construct of what it means to be male.

While there are many constructive, positive masculine societal norms as well as there are negative ones, problems with either type arise when they hold men back by reinforcing the expectation that a man place adherence to the cultural male norm ahead of being himself. The nature of an archetype (which is singular and fixed) is thereby confused with or substituted for the natures of men (which are diverse). 
Failure to acknowledge this distinction leads to both mistaken cries of male-bashing by men who have incorporated stereotypes into their male identity AND to *real* incidences of male-bashing by those who believe negative stereotypes to be true of all men.

 The same issues are found in cultural norms for women. Challenging those however, is hardly if ever considered misogynistic because it seems that more women have separated their self concept from the construct of femininity. 

Criticizing masculine/feminine constructs and things based on them ≠ Criticizing men/women as a group.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Guiding is definitely key. I went to a school that was an abstinence only sex-education school. The teachers knew it was crap, but the school would fire them to save their funding if it came out that they'd been teaching comprehensive sex education.

Fortunately, my parents also knew it was crap, and filled in the gaps for me. I remember, I think it was middle school, we were asked by the school to take some abstinence pledge, and get our parents to sign that they would help us keep our pledge. My parents refused to sign it, and I got a lengthy explanation as to why.

My parents didn't expect me to wait until marriage to have sex. They did, however, expect me to be responsible about it. They explained that condoms and birth control pills can make sex considerably safer, but also that they aren't failure proof. They encouraged me to wait until I had found someone I could at least put up with for the rest of my life, because if the birth control failed and she got pregnant, I'd be seeing her for the next 18 years. They also encouraged me to wait until I was capable of raising a child without viewing it as a huge burden.

The result is that I was abstinent a lot longer than many of my peers, despite being in a serious long term relationship. I didn't wait because I was afraid my parents would find out, or that god would smite me. I waited because my parents made it seem like the responsible thing to do. When I did start having sex, we used protection, assuming that it would work, but prepared for the consequences if it didn't.","1238592255"

What he's saying, in WoW example, is this:
Do *not* have the NPC pop up a window with a 3000 character long quest text when you click on a quest.

*Instead*, have it be a brief description, then once you accept it, the NPC and another NPC next to him have a dialogue which forms the ""lore"" part of the quest (the popup window would just have the factual description of the quest goal).

That way, you tell the same thing but in a way which fits into the game, instead of enforcing another medium's (book, in this specific case) way of telling story onto this one (a video game).


It does make a lot of sense. But it's more ""common knowledge"" IMO, although seeing how many text-clutter their games I guess a rant is quite understandable.

If you have the ability to show story using dynamic, real-life-like events, wouldn't you?

Think of the audio logs playing in System Shock II. They fit *perfectly* into the game, as did the odd textlog. Would a medieval herald shouting the story through a room? Surely not.

And similar it is with WoW. While there are books in the game, that makes sense, but why would a NPC telling you about a quest give you a letter with the quest on it? Wouldn't he *tell* you about the quest instead?","1238592500"

What if there is no particular economic incentive to conserve? Eg., suppose the way to make the most money from an old-growth forest is to simply clearcut it? You can plant trees, but it'll be hundreds of years before it's restored, and that's assuming you start leaving it alone. Meanwhile the species that depend on old-growth die off. Another example is the Amazon, where the most efficient economic use right now is burning it down and raising cows. You could say that people should think long-term, but often they don't. And it's not just big capitalists; the Amazon is getting cut down by peasant farmers.

So who sues to protect the forest? Anyone who cares about environmental preservation? What damages do you decide on, when there's no monetary damage to anyone? Who decides what parts of the biosphere need to be preserved, and which are open to exploitation? (If the principle is that none are open to exploitation, how do humans live on this planet, without massive dieoff?)

With a justice system that depends on voluntary participation, how do you get people who live on environmental exploitation, to agree to a set of rules that prohibit it?

What about diffuse problems like global warming? Do we say that anyone on Earth can sue anyone who emits carbon? That probably won't work, so we need to add something...maybe something like carbon credits. Without government force, can you really enforce such a scheme? Will you be able to make a coal-burning power company pay big bucks? What sanctions are available if they don't?

Who has the right to issue carbon credits, if not a government? I actually have an idea on this: it should be anyone who removes carbon from the atmosphere. Farmers doing biochar, construction companies using that new kind of CO2-absorbing cement, etc. This could work for CO2 because were actually have ways of sequestering it. What about other diffuse pollutants? So far googling I haven't come across any ways to sequester methane.

Technology may eventually help. I like to think that eventually we'll be able to go ""cradle to cradle"" and use all outputs as inputs to something else. No pollution because pollution is a waste of money. And maybe we'll start mining the asteroids instead of mountains here. Then maybe we really can say that nothing on Earth can be exploited, with enough cultural agreement ot make it stick. Short of that, I think we've got significant difficulties.","1238592582"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","MTV Multiplayer simply took a small portion of Jeff Kaplan's GDC keynote address and gently raped it with sensationalism while simultaneously placing it out of context.  

Kaplan stated he wants the narrative of WoW told in a more unique and compelling way that more properly reflects the video game medium, as opposed to relying on a lot of walls of text.  He wants the mystery of a quest to unfold while you are participating in it, rather than it be completely explained via the quest giver.

MTV Mutliplayer is just trying to be rather divisive where no division actually exists.  Kaplan is most likely going to focus more on contextual story telling in Blizzard's upcoming MMO, which to me sounds wonderful.

This portion is completely out of context:

&gt;Basically — and I’ll direct this more at the Blizzard guys — we need to stop writing a f—ing book in our game because no one wants to read it. There are better books out there to read.”

He isn't berating his own team for doing what they have done.  He is actually criticizing himself, which he pretty much did throughout the entire conference anyways.  Further more reiterating the point I made above, he simply wants Blizzard to utilize all artistic mediums available to them to formulate a story, rather than just a page of text.

To get a more contextualized version of his keynote address you can check out [this](http://pc.ign.com/articles/967/967119p1.html), however I read about it off of Kotaku, which I can't seem to find unfortunately.","1238592678"

"science","t5_mouw","Dennett started by discussing the advancement in functionality fromn Prokaryotes to Eukoryotes since the latter inhereted billions of years of specialization. The he discussed how much of the ""talent"" exhibited by Eukoryotes are things for which there are reasons, but in the majority of cases the Eukoryotes's themselves do not understand these reasons. 
The advancement of humans, I believe, he attributed largely to our ability to understand the reasons why we do things. Humans are relatively unique in that we represent our reasons for doing things. 
He then discussed memes along similar lines and pointed out that a fair amount of the memes we have going around are propagated by minds that do not atually understand the memes in an analogous way to the propagation of biological behaviours which are not understood by simpler Eukoryotes like cats, dogs, flies.
I particularly enjoyed his example of E=mc^2. He was talking at a prestigious science department and asked the crowd whether they believed this equation to be true. 100% agreed. Then he asked wether the crowd understands this equation. 100% agreed. Then someone pointed out that the practical physicists dont really understand it - they can work with it but they dont grasp its meaning completely - to which the crowd eventually agreed. Point is, the most scientific minded amongst us progenate memes that we do not understand. Etc etc. I cant really do it justice - just wanted to paint the picture a little.","1238592777"

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; Religion is the language we use to describe what we can't observe and understand empirically.

No, it's a fantasy, a fairy tale concocted to explain things that we did not / do not yet have answers for.  It explains **nothing**.  At every stage of human history the religious 'explanation' has been eroded and replaced by scientific understanding.  Everything that has been claimed to be the work of gods has subsequently been explained by science: earthquakes, volcanoes, lightning, plagues, the stars, evolution, etc., etc.

And isn't it curious that everyone believes in the same god as their parents?  The god you believe in is almost entirely dependent on when and where you were born.   Your belief is not a matter of truth, simply an accident of time, geography and parentage.

If you were born in India today you might be worshipping Ganesha, in Texas you'd be grovelling for Jesus to save your sinful soul and in Iran you'd be head-butting a piece of carpet 5 times a day for Allah.  If you were born 2000 years ago in Denmark, you'd think Odin was the real deal and 500BCE in Greece, you'd be worshipping Zeus and The Gang.

That's just a handful of the thousands of gods people have invented over the millennia.

It's not really a convincing scenario if there was one true god, or any gods.  Wouldn't it be trivial for the creator of the universe to have all her little creations singing from the same book?  Especially when most gods threaten punishment for choosing the wrong one.  What sort of omnipotent, omniscient, 'merciful and loving' god would that be?!

This should be an enormous clue that gods are man-made.

The bible appears to be exactly what it is: a giant fairy story, cobbled together from different camp fire tales, from different people, at different times and after the fact, plagiarised from earlier myths, translated and mistranslated, containing nothing more than the 'wisdom' available to bronze age desert dwellers.

Let's leave the final word to dear, old [Albert](http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/may/12/peopleinscience.religion):

&gt; ""The word god is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human weaknesses, the Bible a collection of honourable, but still primitive legends which are nevertheless pretty childish. No interpretation no matter how subtle can (for me) change this.""","1238593441"

 It's like (on a retarded level) special interest groups in the federal government - while most people don't want subsidies for sugar producers, most people don't care enough to vote them down, but the organized sugar producers do care enough to vote them up.

That way is much easier and less intellectually strenuous than actually straining to separate out the true gray shades of the issues.

Safety need not be sacrificed, what needs to be sacrificed is the acres of plastic and cupholders that indiscriminate American drivers insist upon having. 

A Toyota Prius weighs just under 3000 pounds, which is exactly ONE THOUSAND POUNDS heavier than a 1990 Honda Civic hatchback.  This is simply unacceptable, folks. Have a hard time envisioning 1000lbs? Think of putting 5 200-pound fat men in your car and drive them around every day.

Lighter cars are more fuel efficient, more fun to drive, quicker, handle better, and make much smaller demands upon the transmission and tire. Longevity is improved.

To me, I think it could be a GOOD thing the playing field was leveled somewhat-- since nations like America at present need some sort of real resistance to make them stop starting so many unnecessary wars and killing so many innocent people.

I think it is fundamentally different from the way in which physicists *interpret* experiment.

A mathematician will experiment to figure out what might be ""provable"".

Ah, yes. Exactly so.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","When I was 24 or 25 -- in other words, way past 14 -- I had a subscription to National Review. On two separate occasions, I came across her name in articles in that magazine. Both times it seemed the authors went out of their way to bring her up, and both times the attacks seemed a bit forced. Like the title of this whole thread, the attacks were simply ridicule. 

I can't explain exactly why, but my impression was that the authors were afraid of this lady. That intrigued me. 

I had managed to get hold of her Playboy interview. (Years ago, Playboy published a bound collection of interviews over 30 years.) After reading the interview, I picked up *Atlas Shrugged.* 

Now, you may like what she writes, or you may not. But, I'm presuming you're an adult, not a 14 year old kid. 

It's true. Rand's writing, in part, appeals to someone with a sense of alienation. But, do you remember the adage ""if you're not outraged, you're not paying attention""? I would say the same thing about alienation. Some degree of alienation is healthy in our sick society. 

The problem with teenagers is that they all feel alienated, but they all desperately want to belong. So, they're attracted to Rand's writing for the wrong reason, and since the majority are unphilosophical, they later sour on it; not because they've rigorously analyzed her arguments and have found fault, but because they never understood anything in the first place and have become unhappy when they realized that they couldn't ""convert"" all those around them to what for them was only a passing fad. They then grow up and put together whatever rationalization they need to to explain away their experience with her writings. 

I hope you'll read *Atlas Shrugged.* I always tell people that they will know by the time they've finished reading chapter 5 if the book is for them. Take care.","1238594662"

1. It takes much longer to learn a spoken language than a programming language. 
2. Different spoken languages don't really offer new ways of thinking about things, nor do some make speaking more efficient. Compare that to languages such as c -&gt; python, python is a much more efficient language to work in for most domains.
3. Different programming languages can have different goals. Eg c is high performance, html is for representing content. All spoken languages have the same goal of communicating information from one human to another.

The main problem with using only one language is a lot of a countries culture is tied to their language. It would make the world a more boring place if there was no French or Chinese. It would be a more efficient world though.

Dijkstra's algorithm isn't a bad approach. However, something like A* is usually far more efficient. Using the Euclidean distance as the heuristic function (other choices are possible and sometimes preferable), the search pattern from the source location will look more like a cone expanding towards the target location than a circle.

Yes, the visibility graph really makes all the difference, O(n^2) vs O(n^3). He could reduce that further to O(n log n) by using a good priority queue implementation; right now he is iterating over the complete set of spanning tree nodes every single time through the loop. The contribution of A* is less easily quantifiable in terms of n, the number of nodes, but it is a very real contribution.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","When I feed my turtle night-crawlers, I usually dangle it slowly.. provocatively just below the rim of the hallowed out log that he calls home.  The alluring provocation quickly grabs his attention from even the most lethargic of moods.

The dance has begun.

He extends his neck, his head at a slight cock as he looks onto this wonder before his eyes.  I slowly lower the tubular treat, and the pace quickens.  He pushes his front legs all the way out, entrenching his 3-toed feet into the moist, earthy mossy undergrowth beneath him.  As if propelled upwards by some outside heavanly force, he pushes on his back legs and lifts his shelled underside away from the earth.

No longer does he have the safe contact of the warm ground against his shell.  Both predator and prey prone and unprotected.

The dance is in full swing.

His head starts cocking back, like a pistol ready to be fired.  His eyes gleam with the glory that will be his.  The worm.. seeming to just dangle down from the heavens would seem in a panic, the dark earth clinging to his slime crumbling off as he writhes to and fro.  The pistol is cocked and loaded and the trigger is pulled.  The turtle's eyes turn to fire, and his agape beak lunges towards his object of desire at speads unfathomable for a turtle.

But Alas!!! In his fiery passion, the worm just escapes his grasp.  Losing all sense of composure and form, he snaps wildly, swinging his head and neck around as if he himself were the worm.

The dance is over.

His jaw finally connects with the meaty, supple flesh that was to be his all along.  He bites down and tries to wring the life out of the worm--secretly glad that the worm candle is only flickering and not put out entirely.  His heavanly gift received, the turtle slowly returns down to earth and eases back into his dark abyss.  The writhing worm sliding down his gullet as he chomps at more and more of the worm, creating a sickening, yet lovely squishing sound.

I don't know if it is a reaction to the still writhing worm in his throat or the immense satisfaction and pleasure he gets from the hunt, but the few rays of light that reach down into what the turtle calls home bring back with them a hint of a grin and a gleam in his eye.

tl;dr - Turtles are cool. Mine eats worms.","1238595244"

You cannot simultaneously assign labels to oneself while decrying that other people do the same.  There is no right to never be offended or have your feelings hurt.

Equality only needs one label.  Human.  We're all on the same team.

Gender identity and gender are 2 different things.  

Gender Identity is a label.
If a female wants to express social masculinity, thats their right.  If a male wants to express social femininity, that is their right.  

Gender is a biological term.

There is NOTHING you can do to escape the economy-wide downturn that everyone is feeling, but there is plenty you can do to limit the downside and capitalize on the opportunity.

The biggest thing is to have a properly diversified portfolio. 
You hold 20-45 stocks (I think the ideal amount is around 25) that are spread out into various industries and sectors of the economy.

The idea is that if you hold only one stock you are exposed to 100% of the risk in that business/industry.

So to limit your exposure to business risk and industry risk, you hold stocks of several industries that are very different, so that when one goes down others are going up, and you limit the volatility of your portfolio.

By diversifying properly you can eliminite essentially all non-market risk - that is, factors that do not affect the entire market such as and industry going south, a product becoming unpopular, seasonal fluctuations etc.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Yes, currently people are allowed to make ""non-free"" software. But the authors of the GPL think people *should not* be allowed to do so. I don't know what's your position here but if you disagree with them, you're spreading the wrong political statements when using the GPL. ;)

BTW, these are political statements, since you asked:

- ""The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works."" [...]
- ""By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users."" [...]
- ""To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights."" [...]

Note the words such as ""take away"", ""freedom"", ""deny"", ""surrender"", etc.. -- all [loaded words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loaded_language).

Also, both of these statements assume or presuppose that anybody has a right, indeed, to share and change any source code. But where is the rationale for this assumption?

It's just arbitrarily set by the writers of the GPL, resulting from their conviction that *all* software should be ""free"".

In contrast, you argued, for example, that an author of a library is free to establish the rules for the usage of ""his"" library. What makes it ""his"" work? Maybe, we agree on this, too: He made it. He spend time and effort to create it. It wouldn't exists without him. 

But the same holds for ""non-free"" authors: Without them, the work wouldn't exists. How many of the 4 rights do users have when a work would not exist? Zero. How many of the 4 rights do they have if the software is published under a ""non-free"" license? Also zero. Zero minus zero is zero, so nothing was ""taken away"". (And in fact, users gained at least one right, namely to ""use the software as advertised"").

Btw, whether or not ""free"" software makes it easier for everyone in the long run is no proven statement. There's hardly any evidence for either case. In fact, I can argue that ""free"" software often makes it harder for people to get the software they need.

This is why I think that *some* software should be Open Source, *some* should be Closed Source, and people should be free to choose whatever they think they need. The GPL makes this impossible in the long run when GPL code moves from the top of the stack to the bottom, ""infecting"" above software by it's interpretation of works ""based on"" the software.","1238595834"

Taliban law told women to stay at home... but they'd pay women to do so (who had no other means of support). The problem? They had no money to pay them. That's technically more moderate than the Saudis.

A lot of the gamers I play with, myself included, are finding it hard to work full time and find time to write games.  If there were free published 4th ed adventures out there, I'm sure we'd all buy the rule books and switch over.  As it is, I'm the only one who has picked up a copy of them and I don't have time to run another game.","1238596104"

I can see your point about Natural Selection – you're right. I was thinking of genes only.  When considering selection on phenotype then yes, I can see that neglect is inheritable as a behavior.

Yes, technically caffeine is addictive. But I'm sure you're aware of the great physical and psychological dependence caused by nicotine, not to mention growing tolerance and withdrawal symptoms, and that caffeine pales in comparison.

I think there needs to be an acknowledgement of the huge disparity between their respective levels of addiction. Having quit them both I can attest, albeit anecdotally, to a big different between the two.

It sucks as a language but is used on the web for the pragmatic reason of its good Apache module. Go with Python, Ruby, or Scheme. I've written naive C programs, one of which used mark-dirty/refresh instead of a proper observer pattern for a database view. It turned out the refresh was too slow and an observer pattern would have been better. Unfortunately that pattern requires a good notification layer for database writes. You can do this sort of thing in C but it's much easier in a memory managed language. The moral of the story is that C and C++ are tempting for the speed but unless you can write good abstractions, C wont help one bit. Python and Ruby are great for learning these abstractions. Once you have those down you can take a shortcut in C, realize there are no shortcuts (because it isn't THAT fast), and then write better code in C using the skills you learned from writing in a higher level language.

bcos, most logictech webcams now come with a face, eye, mouth detecting software and they are good. 
this might very well be a marketing ploy from opera, where a month down the line, they will come out with a 'wow so cool' story where a developer actually gets the inspiration from a april fools joke and actually makes it possible. 
and we all will be so happy. ","1238596424"

I have my Digg and Reddit bookmarks next to each other in my Firefox.  I usually, 80% of the time, just go to Reddit.  I thought I accidentally clicked on ""Digg"", so I noticed the layout change and the notice on top of the ""Digg"" web page.  So, I took advantage of the situation and decided to scroll down the stories and see what's new.  I saw a story that caught my eye ""Oh, good Lord, what the fuck have they done?!"" and noticed that a story from ""Digg"" was linking to Reddit.  I then clicked on the link to go to story on Reddit, but I noticed that I was still on ""Digg"".  So, I tried the link again and I still wound up on the ""Digg"" page.  I was getting worried that someone was hijacking my web browser and I made sure that the link was taking me to ""reddit.com"", yep, sure enough.  I was kinda freaking out.

Then it hit me.

Bad news - they probably are. 

The reason I argue against using the perceived effects of drug use as an argument against drug use is that it's a flawed premise. 

Let's take the oft-quoted issue of ""people commit crimes to buy drugs."" Well, the crimes they're committing - *they're already illegal.* By definition you have established that making something illegal isn't going to stop these people. So what makes you think making the *drugs* illegal will stop them? If someone has shown they are willing to commit armed robbery to fund their habit, do we really think a misdemeanor against possession will have any effect at all? 

The next problem is the ""correlation does not equal causation"" analysis - there is no guarantee that absent the need for drugs these people wouldn't still commit the crimes. It might be for food, or alcohol, or WoW fees, or just for the hell of it. I suspect there are plenty of addicts that do *not* commit crimes to feed their habit. 

Which leads us to confirmation bias - you cannot use the body of people who commit crimes to buy drugs to establish that ""using drugs makes you evil."" You have *zero* statistics on how many people use drugs and don't commit crimes (other than the possession of the drugs). It's entirely possible that half your neighborhood uses cocaine - how would you know? Think about this critically - if they go out, buy a bag once every few weeks and take a toot at home, how could you *possibly* know? 

Also, if someone could buy crack, get high, and doesn't affect anyone else - is it really our job to say they can't? What if your next door neighbor quit his job and just decided to go live under a bridge? Should that be illegal? 

To summarize - 

- I don't think we should try to pass laws to govern personal behavior when it doesn't cause direct harm to another person.
- You shouldn't think that outlawing drugs somehow prevents crime. It's like taking all writing implements away from a school classroom so they don't write on the walls. 
- If we legalized drugs, drugs cartels would go away. We could bring any problems out in the open where they could be addressed. Drugs could be manufactured cleanly, taxed, and your local pharmacist could suggest help when you're buying crack four times a day. 

On that last note, maybe we should start tracking sales of 2-litre bottles of soda for weight gain intervention? ","1238596941"

I never really expected him to understand, but I felt that if I didn't do my part, what was the hope of making him change a lifestyle he probably didn't even like. 

He went on rambling about noises he hears in the night (the police??), unexplained body parts in garbage dumps (he said zombies walked the streets), and other things like debt free loans. 

I tried to talk him out of many illogical concepts, but he just kept on at it, so I said fuck that shit and I whistled for a cab and when it came near, the license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror.

* Lake Merced: At the back of SFSU (junction of 19th Ave &amp; Junipero Serra Blvd. &amp; right smack on Harding Muni Golf Park). Reachable via Intercity Light Rail. Fishing season (buy a license from the tackle shops in Stonestown Galleria) should be open by now.

* Nearby Stonestown Galleria Mall: Just stones throw away from SFSU, reachable via same Muni Light Rail from Frisco downtown... if you enjoy watching shapely Californian gals.

* Golden Gate Park: Frisco's most enjoyable strolling park. At Stanyan St., between Fulton &amp; Lincoln Way; Reachable via Muni buses from Union Square. This park is hugh &amp; ends at the Great Hwy facing Pacific Ocean! Rows of Victorian style houses along Fulton &amp; Lincoln.

* Polk St (from Post St up to Pine St): This street is just a block away from Van Ness Ave. Noted entertainment area dominated by gay bars.

* SF's Chinatown: Junction of Broadway &amp; Montgomery (3-blocks square). Heavy concentration of curio shops &amp; authentic Chinese resto, the best area to enjoy your Chinese cuisines on the West coast... bar none!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","[Some research][1] seems to suggest that screening homosexual priests may actually have an effect on rates of abuse.  Actually, that research would tend to indicate that the way we routinely talk about these cases skews our perceptions of what's actually taking place.  Particularly interesting, I though, was the comparison between clerical abuses and abuses in the general male population (5% versus 8%).  Which would seem to suggest that, while any instance of sexual misconduct is horrifying, and particular any instance with a minor, what's really alarming about the sexual misconduct of priests -- ie. what lands it so much attention -- isn't its frequency but rather the fact that it happens at the hands of a trusted figure that is supposed to be a moral leader.

The obvious objection to those stats are that they were issued by sources that depend on Catholic funding, so there's the potential for bias or under-reporting.  The problem is that I haven't yet found any comparable studies authored by researchers at explicitly secular institutions.  There is [this][2](pdf) paper written by Michael R. Stevenson, Ph.D. for the Institute for Gay and Lesbian Strategic Studies, but it doesn't appear to use any data gathered on the number of homosexual priests involved in sexual misconduct -- rather, it extrapolates from figures in studies not specifically related to clergy and quotes from figures arrived at by Plante, the author of the Catholic-funded report above.  If someone can link us to some reliable, secularly-funded research, please do.

In light of those objections, and a dirth of more clearly reliable information, I'm inclined to simply admit that I don't know whether or not gay priests make up a higher proportion of sex offenders.  And at the same time, both because I don't know and because the Church *has* put time, money and effort towards studies that the secular community apparently has not, I have to admit that I'm in no position to criticize their assertion that gay priests share a larger portion of the blame.  I wish I had some reasonable basis for claiming that they didn't, but I just don't see any figures that contradict the Vatican's position on this one.

This plan will work fine unless we undergo a period of hyperinflation or the government finds itself unable to pay it's debt off. Both of which seem highly likely sometime in the near future, but if that happens everything is fucked anyway and it didn't really matter what you did so it's still really the safest bet.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Your comment is extremely ironic. After all, it was France that originally gave Israel the technology to build its nuclear weapons.

&gt; For reactor design and construction, Israel sought the assistance of France. Nuclear cooperation between the two nations dates back as far as early 1950's, when construction began on France's 40MWt heavy water reactor and a chemical reprocessing plant at Marcoule. France was a natural partner for Israel and both governments saw an independent nuclear option as a means by which they could maintain a degree of autonomy in the bipolar environment of the cold war.

&gt; In the fall of 1956, France agreed to provide Israel with an 18 MWt research reactor. However, the onset of the Suez Crisis a few weeks later changed the situation dramatically. Following Egypt's closure of the Suez Canal in July, France and Britain had agreed with Israel that the latter should provoke a war with Egypt to provide the European nations with the pretext to send in their troops as peacekeepers to occupy and reopen the canal zone. In the wake of the Suez Crisis, the Soviet Union made a thinly veiled threat against the three nations. This episode not only enhanced the Israeli view that an independent nuclear capability was needed to prevent reliance on potentially unreliable allies, but also led to a sense of debt among French leaders that they had failed to fulfill commitments made to a partner. **French premier Guy Mollet is even quoted as saying privately that France ""owed"" the bomb to Israel.**

&gt; On 3 October 1957, France and Israel signed a revised agreement calling for France to build a 24 MWt reactor (although the cooling systems and waste facilities were designed to handle three times that power) and, in protocols that were not committed to paper, a chemical reprocessing plant. This complex was constructed in secret, and outside the IAEA inspection regime, by French and Israeli technicians at Dimona...

&gt; Both the scale of the project and the secrecy involved made the construction of Dimona a massive undertaking... At the height construction, some 1,500 Israelis and French workers were employed building Dimona. To maintain secrecy, French customs officials were told that the largest of the reactor components, such as the reactor tank, were part of a desalinization plant bound for Latin America. In addition, after buying heavy water from Norway on the condition that it not be transferred to a third country, the French Air Force secretly flew as much as four tons of the substance to Israel.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","&gt; This has nothing to do with growing up around guns.

Your attitude of ""hoplophobia"" has everything to do with ""growing up around guns"".  You have no idea the level of commitment to safety that real actual firearms owners strive for every time they have a firearm in their possession.

&gt; Even people who are very well trained with guns have them ""accidentally"" go off.

Firearms NEVER accidentally go off.  They are sometimes negligently discharged, but that's always due to mishandling, which is negligent, not accidental.

&gt; Kids/students are clumsy, they drop them, they bump into each other, they foolishly put it in the bottom of their school bag, they get into a fight in the hall 

Again, these would be 21 year old people, not ""kids"".  Properly trained CPL holders don't ""drop them"", because you don't handle it, you just leave it holstered.  Seriously, you sound like everything you've ever learned about guns comes from TV, and you've apparently never attended college, since it sounds like you're talking about high school (fights in the hall).

&gt; (even without using the gun, it can go off when people get rough with each other).

Not quality modern firearms in proper holsters.  You are seriously underinformed on the safety functions of modern firearms.  ","1238597944"

I was pretty much immersed in it to be honest. Even spent most of one summer in Ocala forest with Rainbows talking about seizing of production, etc.

Later I was handed Economics in One Lesson. It clicked.

I can't remember a time when I paid a lick of attention in school. Though granted, I did at one time since I learned enough to get to the point where I learned how to learn, so to speak. Communists, specifically anarcho-communists, which I basically was from 13-19 are *way* smarter than the average bear. I eventually read enough to learn how Hayek swung many a socialist free-thinker into his school, but never vice-versa, and all kinds of other interesting bits of history. It made me think about why, and how I wouldn't be the first person to be too narrow in thought for a period of life. I came to the point where I no longer agree with Marx, but at least the true Marxists are intellectuals, and the the anarcho-communists in the vein of Proudhon, even more so . I can respect their journey, since I took it.

I did work at one place where we made scientific instruments with embedded processors; my boss said (pre-google), ""oh, just use a spline fit"" and I had to admit I had no idea.  But he was happy to explain it and review it after I did the coding.

I will say that in 95% of my work, raw math skills haven't been required.  But I am weak in doing abstract performance analysis...  I've never been afraid to say ""I don't know"", so I simply ask teammates for help.  Programmers love to show off their skillz so generally they are eager to jump in.

But in my personal opinion, I am strong in visualizing data flows and writing efficient, readable, maintainable code.  I've been re-hired by the managers I've previously worked with, so I guess that's some confirmation.  

I did have a terrible time learning math in school and I do believe that it is taught all wrong.  I sort of ""backed into"" algebra by coding up algorithms, and realizing their connection to what is in the algebra books.  Now, long after I left school, I see that there really *is* beauty and fun in higher math.

There is a place for all kinds of thinking in programming - verbal, right-brain, left-brain. ","1238598242"

"environment","t5_2qh1n","While Monsanto's civil proceedings are nothing short of evil, they did nothing wrong or illegal in this instance.

Monsanto made a product that failed. They compensated their customers immediately. The only peril is being an early adopter of new technology. There is nothing wrong with optimizing current crops for better nutrition, less toxins, and higher yield. Better for you, better for the environment.

I admit that engineering crops to not set viable seed for the next season is lame, but it's far from new in the world of agriculture. And anyway, in a few more years when the patents run out, these GM genes will be ubiquitous in crops. Let monsanto earn their profit while they can, the price is worth the benefit.

What is truly the looming peril is troglodytes like you trying to make ignorant laws against science.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","&gt;Your attitude of ""hoplophobia"" has everything to do with ""growing up around guns"". You have no idea the level of commitment to safety that real actual firearms owners strive for every time they have a firearm in their possession.

I've fired guns many times at a shooting range. I have no such fear of guns.

&gt;Firearms NEVER accidentally go off. They are sometimes negligently discharged, but that's always due to mishandling, which is negligent, not accidental.

You could then claim that ""accidents"" never actually happen, it's always pure negligence. Dropping a loaded gun is entirely possible and it happens. The more guns there are, the more likely it is going to happen, and in turn, the more likely people will be getting shot.

&gt;Again, these would be 21 year old people, not ""kids"". Properly trained CPL holders don't ""drop them"", because you don't handle it, you just leave it holstered. Seriously, you sound like everything you've ever learned about guns comes from TV, and you've apparently never attended college, since it sounds like you're talking about high school (fights in the hall).

How many 21 year old students are there? Would this have stopped columbine? How about V-Tech? The number of students that would have been carrying guns would likely not have been enough to stop anything.

Not to mention, the question of how many students are actually interested/willing to be involved in a shootout where they're taking on the roll of police, instead of running for cover..

He returns to the top notes many times, spaced evenly throughout his solo break. That's a bag-of-gimmicks guitar solo, not a solo with structure and drama.

I agree with you, it can be looked at from both perspectives, either from a methodological point of view (math is then part of physics and of most other scientific fields) or from a emergence point of view (physics(as an embodiment of a subset of math) -&gt; chemistry (emerging properties of a subset of physics, with it's own set of new mathematical properties)-&gt; biology (etc...) -&gt; psychology -&gt; sociology). 

The same reasoning is indeed more intricate regarding the relationship between language (or the thinking process) and other fields.

That said, abstract structural similarities between topics may have a deeper meaning than what you seem to think. See http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta.pdf

Part of what turns me off about some of these grand-scope functional libraries is that they refine their abstractions so much, in order to accommodate so many possible uses, that they end up with a vocabulary that is impenetrable to the uninitiated. What you have now seems very pragmatic and rooted in everyday metaphors, I encourage you to go with that.

This pragmatic/keep-it-simple view has gotten some push-back from Haskellers lately, who see it as whining from day-job programmers who can't be bothered to google a few basic category theory terms. This is probably true, but there's a difference between appropriating abstractions from an established field of mathematics, and making shit up out of thin air. A lot of FRP seems a little bit like the latter to me. If it works, great, but it's hard to play around with until you learn all those metaphors and basically get inside the library author's head. What you have here seems much more solidly grounded in established computer metaphors (+1 to `Bus`) which is no more a waste of Haskell's capabilities. As such I feel like I could casually experiment with this more easily.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","I have children and I choose an alternative shot schedule for mine. They get one at a time, not a cocktail of multiple serums. That's my beef, too much at once and then if they have an allergic reaction you don't know which one caused it. I think the majority of vaccines are fine, and if it can help save my kids' life then great! And I agree that there's no proven link to autism. However, every parent has a right to choose, and shouldn't be judged or hated for it. I am surprised that my favorite people on my favorite news site are so judgmental and scathing on something that is a parents decision. And for those that are childless it's something you can't understand until you actually have another life you're responsible for. And no it's not the same as raising your cute kitty. If you want to do no vaccs, your own schedule, or just follow the CDC schedule, that is your personal decision for your child and is no one's else's right to judge or chastise you for it. If your child becomes ill because you chose not to vaccinate, there's a good chance they'll recover. Or there's a slim chance they could get seriously ill. Most kids will do fine with shots. But there can be adverse effects, even death which you can see here: http://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/statistics_report.htm#statistics_report As far as posing a risk to other children, if those children are immunized, are they not then protected from that illness? And if they do catch it, it's usually mild. My oldest two still got chicken pox after the vaccine, but it was super mild, they barely noticed. All I am saying is before you judge a parent, take a step back and think; you're not living their life and can't make their decisions for them unless you've ""walked a mile in their shoes.""

Other than that, it's well built, the hardware works well under Linux (no problems with sound, wireless, graphics, etc.). If any problems do arise with new Ubuntu releases, System76 has their ""System76 driver"" program that will update any drivers and get your system working without having to hack at it yourself.

If you're looking for a Linux system, I think they're probably your best bet. Their support has been good to work with, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them for laptops.

A) Has glass and is freely rotating. 
B) Has glass and is still connected to the drive shaft.  
C) Has glass and is freely rotating. 
D) Has no glass and is freely rotating. 

Now, if the two most exterior doors still have glass but one is freely rotating and a burst of wind did that, then one can assume that the freely rotating section (C) would be blown in post hug.  Therefore, the wind is not a likely suspect.

The shooting took place at the end of a demonstration against the apartheid wall that Israel is constructing in the West Bank.

Anderson was rushed to a hospital in Tel Aviv and has undergone three surgeries for severe injuries to his skull, brain and eye, but he has yet to regain consciousness.

The shooting of Anderson came just a few days before the March 16 anniversary of the death of Rachel Corrie, an American activist who was crushed by a bulldozer during a protest against the Israeli demolition of Palestinian homes in Gaza, six years ago.

Rachel's parents, Cindy and Craig Corrie, visited Gaza again this year as part of a delegation of activists. They wrote this article, which we reprint with their permission, to mark the anniversary of Rachel's death.

I also didn't have to go to church every day but we prayed before dinner and read the bible. We didn't celebrate Halloween, too, but that was a lesser problem. 

I don't remember much of their church except for the fact that I disagreed with the stuff the pastor was talking about even though I didn't understand a lot English at the time and mostly had no clue of what he was talking about. 

The worst thing was probably the lack of food, friends and space. They told me not to eat the stuff at school and gave me some little piece of organic bread. The food was mostly organic but these people don't know that a balanced nutrition is more important than eating organic fast food. 
I also had to share a tiny bedroom with two other kids and their dog, who literally smelled like shit because it liked wallow in its own crap (who slept on one of the kid's pillows. wtf??). This dog liked to pee on my feet while I was sleeping and once it took a shit infront of the bed so I stepped into it. Even today, 3 1/2 years later I can remember the smell of the house. 

I managed to avoid a long search for a new family and convinced my area rep not to tell the host family that I was looking for a new family till 2 days before I left.

I'm not going to pretend I know exact figures and can prove my point mathematically at this point.  But I do know that: 

1. rolling resistance is typically 10-20% of total drag, 

2. Rolling resistance is minimised for any particular vehicle weight by choosing a tyre of appropriate diameter and pressurising it correctly, so a heavier vehicle may not have greater rolling resistance provided it is correctly shod,

&gt; Mossad was rumoured to be behind the death of Ardeshire Hassanpour, a top nuclear scientist at Iran's Isfahan uranium plant, who died in mysterious circumstances from reported ""gas poisoning"" in 2007.

&gt; Other recent deaths of important figures in the procurement and enrichment process in Iran and Europe have been the result of Israeli ""hits"", intended to deprive Tehran of key technical skills at the head of the programme, according to Western intelligence analysts. 

I'm sure Mossad has its sights set even higher. The director of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program (a.k.a. Project 111) is a Revolutionary Guard officer and physics professor named [Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi](http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3602739.ece). The U.N. Security Council has put [targeted sanctions on Dr. Fakhrizadeh](http://74.125.93.104/search?q=cache:kNsPGhoB5ncJ:www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2007/sc8980.doc.htm+%22Mohsen%20Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi%22), but I doubt the Israelis are satisfied with that. They'll be satisfied once he's dead. I would guess that on their hit list of Iranian nuclear scientists, he's either at the top or close to the top.  

(For more on Fakhrizadeh, see [here](http://www.iranwatch.org/suspect/records/Mohsen-Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi.html). For more on Project 111, see [here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020702126_pf.html) and [here](http://74.125.93.104/search?q=cache:sOyQTR0HYboJ:www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2008/gov2008-15.pdf+www.iaea.org/Publications/Documents/Board/2008/gov2008-15.pdf+%22project+111%22).)","1238599599"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I have a friend that's formerly catholic and made a similar comment to yours saying that the catholic church isn't some huge tightly controlled thing when I addressed it as such in talking about it.

Why should the ""The Catholic Church"" not be seen as a singular entity? Just judging from the outside it looks to be organized very much like a modern corporation with a CEO at the top, a large board of directors just below, regional organizations that answer to corporate/the Vatican, and various internal groups that keep various needs met such as the article's mentioning of the Servants of the Paracletes.

If this were just a single person's corespondence with another person in the church and the higher up just never reported it then it's just a problem for the two of them, but this went to a commitee who's purpose is to fix these things and rather than resolve it they allowed more children to be raped and molested until the problem became too big to hide.

Is the Catholic Church so loosely organized that the borg/corporation analogy isn't anywhere near correct, and if so, why does it seem like it has such a strong hierarchy and power structure with so much emphasis placed on the Vatican and regional bishops for help with broad problems?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","In the tragedy of the commons, the worse case scenario is when everyone is acting in their isolated self-interest.  The problem doesn't stop there, however, because the best case scenario can only be achieved with complete cooperation among everyone.  If even a single person decides to act selfishly, the commons collapses. 

The tragedy of commons is simply where selfishness is rewarded at the expense of cooperation.  it's unsustainable, because if everyone tries to get that reward, no one gets it.

I suppose you would want to suggest at this point that people act sort of 'meta-selfishly,' that they don't act in isolated selfishness.  But that contradicts the definition of selfishness.  If they start asking ""what's the best scenario for everyone"" that's not selfish thinking, by definition.  

Or if they run through the game plan through the end in their head (e.g. ""okay, if i act selfishly, and everyone else does as well, then none of us gets anything""), and decide to cooperate, because that theoretically gives them the best end-game solution, they are now at the mercy of the group.  All it takes is one individual, seeing everyone cooperating, decide that ""well, if I take just a little bit more, it won't really matter.""  Play that out to the end, and you have the tragedy of the commons.  The only way this could possibly work is if everyone - every human being - can be completely 100% dedicated to the cooperative endgame.  No rational person can honestly expect this.  The only way to solve this is to create social / legal rules enforcing cooperation with punitive damages for breaking the rules.

Finally, the only other argument I've heard against this line of thinking is that we should get rid of commons all together.  This isn't possible, however, because it's impossible to completely isolate an individuals actions.  The easiest example is the atmosphere.  It's an inescapable commons.","1238600087"

Nobody disagrees that the rate of sexual crime should be reduced across the board, but to pretend that's the issue here is just overly apologetic.

Also, I don't have any figures, but if they do happen to show that sexual misconduct leans toward homosexuality, I would understand that the discrimination gays face plays a part in that (since there's more pressure to hide that part of your life)... of course that's not to say sexual misconduct should be condoned, but neither should discrimination based on sexual orientation.","1238600170"

Correct in the sense that you should definitely be allowed to do so if you wish to.  Not so correct in the sense that some measure (well thought-out) to regulate how your actions in regards to those affect others should be taken.  I get migraines triggered by the smell of cigarette smoke.  I have no problem with people smoking, not even in a private establishment.  However, I do hate walking down the sidewalk and having shit-tons of smoke blown into my face.  I think that should not be legal because it does pose a health risk to people like me who choose not to smoke and should therefore not be getting any of side effects of cigarette smoke.  On the other hand, if the owner of a restaurant wants to let you smoke inside his establishment, I'll gladly either not go there or just sit there and put up with it.

I really think states like NY are going backwards about it.  Here you can't smoke inside a private store, restaurant, bar, etc but you are more than welcome to smoke in a playground.  That's just dumb.","1238600337"

While I agree that local/organic production is a worthwhile endeavor, when it comes to feeding a starving world GM crops have so much more to offer. 


Lastly, people need to divorce the idea that GM crops = Monsanto. Yes they do a lot of research, and yes they are huge dicks about marketing their products, but in the big picture of things they are insignificant compared to the benefits of GM crop research.","1238600408"

&gt;The sex act called fisting is a source of confusion and misconceptions for many Christians. This is unfortunate, because it means that many Christian men and women are depriving themselves of what could be the most spiritual sexual experience of their lives. Like anal sex and BDSM, fisting is often mistakenly associated with the gay community or is considered a sex act too extreme to be appropriate for Christian couples. Not only are these views incorrect, but fisting actually has a scriptural precedent, as we will show.","1238600494"

If you use objective c messages to verify the license, handle the license, process the license, etc, it is very easy to patch the runtime and intercept those messages (or just replace them with things that return constants).  AquaticPrime is a popular open source licensing package - it suffers from this problem.

But you don't have to do it that way.  I put my license verification code in macros and thus inline it all over the app in methods that do important things.

"business","t5_2qgzg","Well, I have opened a dictionary, and I am definitely not a shill.  I have no ties to any unions, don't actually care, and I'm not promoting a particular ideology for personal benefit.  I'm sure not agitating to encourage public sentiment against a particular idea.  I just posted TFA because I'm sick of everyone saying the unions are jackasses, but nobody pointing out that A) all that activity started 50-60 years ago and B) GM profited tremendously from those contracts at the time and then squandered those profits.  GM wouldn't _need_ a bailout or huge union concessions if they had made better decisions.  I'm not saying the unions aren't to blame as well, but considering Ford was able to get the UAW to lower total compensation from 70$/hr to 50$/hr (in line with non-union employees at Honda and Toyota), I don't believe the unions are 100% culpable.

The point is that GM is screwed because in the 50s and 60s workers and management made a bad decision.  The individuals who made those decisions have both profited, but now the company itself might die.  So...it's only the workers' fault?  And we're only going to blame the modern workers and the modern union?  I think that's bullshit.

&gt;Just because you don't like it doesn't make it bad. Unless you're an xtian, then it's SOP.

No, the nature of reality makes it a bad analogy.  I'm just pointing it out.  If unions/agents were parasitic, they wouldn't exist.  They're mutualistic, they just don't represent the same interests as the entire society or the company.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Actually, it has far more to do with survivability.  As we can see by early indicators in 2009, the banking failure (and bailout) was a blip due to collapsing asset prices.  Most of the banks that received bailouts are now showing profits or are close to it.  

The auto industry is a completely different animal.  American car makers have been failing for decades, and have had poor performance and losses for years.  Had they been able to show a reasonable chance of profit, the Obama administration would have agreed to give them more money.  But they cannot - because they are stuck with obligations that they cannot possibly fill as a smaller company (mostly Union, PP&amp;E, and Debt).

There are exceptions on the banking side.  AIG being the most prominent.  The government was wrong to not take them over, but AIG had set up a poison pill of derivative contracts to make it virtually impossible.","1238600809"

You can keep the systems running! The algorithm is known, just block the DNS requests at the next router. That's a 10 minute hack. Your systems are safe because there is no dangerous payload yet. Do you want another example? In my opinion Conficker is a pretty big threat, but it might just be to big for a botnet, see, the media attention it receives is just to much, it's already in the MSM! So I don't think that something big will happen, or something big enough that will draw more attention, the developers will probably put their effort into solidifying their presence. But I don't know, all I know is that it won't release any payload, it will try to update. 


So you say there is more Conficker activity lately? Really? What kind of activity? Or do you mean you get more calls / emails? Could it be that there are more people _active_ about it because it was pushed so hard by the media, especially when Gen. C came out March 4 and it was clear that it will try to update on 1 April? That’s not sarcastic, I’m really curious.
As for me saying ""It will not release anything"", this is simply not true.

"environment","t5_2qh1n","why the ""wtf"" in the title?  This article is exactly right.  The only way that we can sustain the level of population in the world right now, is through the use of synthetic fertilizers.  If we relied on only ""organic"" fertilizers, much of the world would be facing starvation right now.  I wrote a research paper on it a while back, and although I forgot the details, basically if it wasn't for the discovery of nitrogen fixation which made synthetic fertilizer possible, the world would already be suffering massive famine.

Organic foods are neither more nutritious nor safer.  They're simply trendy among the upper class who can afford to pay more for less, because it is ""natural"".  Well, natural doesn't necessarily mean less harmful.  A human's ""natural"" lifespan is about 25-30 years.  We have artificially lengthened our lifespans much further than that.  Natural is not synonymous with virtuous, and artificial is not synonymous with evil.

this explains it well = http://open.salon.com/blog/amytuteurmd/2009/03/13/the_organic_food_scam

but there are books which go much further into depth about how claims of health benefits associated with organic foods are pretty much completely bogus, that regular produce has all the nutritional content and health value of organic, plus it is sustainable.

However, they will always answer to their shareholders (and the thus the bottom line) first, and this will always influence the stories they show and how they are told.

Partly it is up to the educational system to teach people how to think critically and know when they are being influenced, but pragmatically speaking a good portion of the population will never learn this. Therefore the best we can do to convey the truth to these people is by conveying the story from as many different points of view as possible.

It is here that people on the left and right must agree that the truth is most important of all and the cbc needs to be fully funded if only to properly communicate its ""public first"" message so that it can at least be compared and contrasted with the message of other broadcasters.

This is not a political argument. Some people calling themselves economists are just committing basic economic fallacy errors. And other scientific disciplines such as physics are just bewildering oblivious to how axiomatic their scientific disciplines are. And a legion of academics is employed upon churn and burn, plug and play, statistical modeling. How else would they justify their inflated research pay? Do you honestly believe every page chugged out in every academic journal actually represents exponentially expanding scientific knowledge?

But would you believe some fool who claimed a particular statistical data set could be used to challenge the methodology of statistics? No, statistical methodology is derived from mathematical axioms.

&gt;Group x or group y will still argue they know best of course.

And in a free market, Group X or Group Y can believe whatever the hell they want to believe.  In a non free market, one group will use non trade violence interference to suppress the other.

Keynesian Creationists can continue to believe in a mystical macro power and anthropomorphic government institutions. And Austrians can continue to scientifically analyze the specific actions of specific individuals. Do you ever hear of Keynesians or mainstream economists asking questions about the nature of fiat monopoly money? They're oblivious, and their titles and claims to knowledge are just left over remnants of the middle ages church influenced guild system.

But notice that mainstream economics and the Keynesians have built their disciplines and models upon the work of the first Austrian economist, Carl Menger and his conception of marginal utility. These people just commit mathematical errors by trying to simplify things and making ""equations"" out of things like preferences which are mathematically strictly greater and lesser comparisons.

So sure, if you believe 2=3, Keynesian and mainstream economics is for you. If you recognize that 2 is less than 3, and 3 is greater than 2, then you're an Austrian economist. In the end, preferences are not equations, no matter how many times those Keynesians insist on humiliating themselves by insisting otherwise.","1238601348"

I think you're confusing science with scientists. The flaws of individual scientists don't change the fact that the scientific method works. It's the best way we have to explain reality. Even with flawed scientists.

I can't see the error in saying that science thrives on open-mindedness, because it does. It wouldn't work without it.

"business","t5_2qgzg","We could always pass a new Railway Labor Act geared toward auto workers. Call it the Security in Labor Act for Valuable Employers.

The SLAVE act would limit the workers' right to assemble. It would make organizing actions which are not illegal, namely not coming to work, illegal to organize without the permission of a government mediation board. It would also limit the manner of negotiation between labor and management.

Meanwhile, the tax-subsidised management will be able to start a new company that isn't bound by union contract at all. They will also send a rep to Washington once a week to make sure the SLAVE mediation board sees things in the correct light, and will donate a portion of SLAVE earned profits to the campaigns of SLAVE mediation board members and their supporters.

America depends on her workforce for her strength and prosperity. Organizing a strike in this troubled economy is an act of treason. We need the SLAVE act now to keep America strong and to protect our children. The Railway Labor Act has a proven track record and it's high time we extend this idea to other workers as well. It doesn't make sense just to limit transportation workers' right to assembly when the whole point of transportation is to travel to work and make America great. We need all workers united under one government committee to better regulate their right to assemble. Join me in supporting the SLAVE act today.","1238601674"

Organic is a process of growing crops which only uses natural fertiliser and doesn't use pesticides. GM is a way of modifying crops to be more resistant to things. GM can have bad outcomes (if it pushes out natural crops), but generally if you adjust crops to have better yields, the crop is less hardy in other ways.

Whether or not Orion is safer OR cheaper than a from-scratch project like DIRECT, or one of the other proposals, is something I don't think anyone can answer, yet or if-ever.

Worldwide market debt is literally in the hundreds of trillions of dollars.  USG debt is about $15T, but with another $65T promised.  And this year, USG tax revenues will likely drop from $3T to much closer to $2T.

This really can be compared to a person whose small business is millions of dollars in debt, who has $750,000 in outstanding personal mortgage and automobile loans, and whose net income is being reduced from $30,000 a year to $20,000 a year, with no savings in the bank.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I think there needs to be an acknowledgement of the huge disparity between their respective levels of addiction.

If you want to treat different levels of addiction philosophically differently, you'll need to draw a bright line of some kind - at what point in the 'addiction scale' does it become alright to advertise to and addict minors? 

&gt;I suppose if anything an uneducated, neglected child will breed more, as smoking certainly is highly unlikely to keep one from procreating.

Yeah.. I forgot we've stopped selecting for survival. This point wins you the original argument &gt;.&lt;

&gt;But it seems you don't believe it's our government's role to protect minors from being exploited to their injury.

Nope, not really. But then, I'm a little 18th century in my governmental attitudes - I consider children in general to be small and stupid citizens, only worth of the same protections every other person gets from the government. 

As I hinted earlier, I think that the way the fed has taken on the responsibility for the raising of our children has only led to more people not taking it for themselves. 

To put it in somewhat Kantian terms, I think that the government has legislated too many *rights* to them, and there's no reasonable place to stop doing so. There is now a built-in 'right to be raised properly' being legally enforced, and a corresponding legal duty on the part of every parent. That only seems like a good idea until somebody who disagrees with you gets to decide what 'properly' means.

I would prefer children to be abused and neglected than to have another entity tell me how I must raise mine.","1238602173"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Disclaimer: I love how I was simply providing a counter-argument in an effort to provide a clearer understanding of Rand's position, yet I get downvotted.

@hajk

Ironically, it's this exact type of ""too black &amp; white"" she completely objects to in the first place, pointing to, essentially, a slippery moral slope, which she also utilizes in demolishing (at least according to her viewpoint, others obviously still disagree with her) the concept of the mixed economy, vis-a-vis capitalism.    

I would highly recommend reading Rand's ""The Virtues of Selfishness"" to help answer why Rand is always ""too black &amp; white"".  I would also recommend her ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"" to help answer why she objects to the mixed economy.  

Interestingly, if you've read AS, she comments in the beginning of ""Capitalism: TUI"" that the book is essentially a epilogue or a footnote to AS.  i have a feeling that many people who read AS probably did not read ""Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal"", and probably would've understood Atlas Shrugged a lot better.  

Rand even commented once (the source eludes me, but it might've been an interview) that purely reading her novels &amp; trying to derive an understanding of her philosophy just from her stories provides a very incomplete &amp; gray version of what she advocates.  

There is obviously some truth to this, as many proponents of Rand's novels probably are not objectivists (but get called objectivists regardless) &amp; probably have not read anything beyond her novels.   

As for Neo-Cons obsessing over her, honestly, I think most of it is due to just reading her two main novels, Fountainhead &amp; AS.  

The recent ""Going Galt"" nonsense is mostly just reactionary sabre-rattling to ""wind-up"" their rapidly fading &amp; unsure political base for the next election cycle.    

Also, if you actually read Rand beyond her novels (which I recommend, even to those who oppose her, she is interesting to read), for the most part, she sounds like much like an individualist anarchist in her dissection of Statism, &amp; her objections to collectivism.

The central weakness in the first Shrek movie is the cardboard characters. Fiona is not a person, she's a walking reward. They literally turn her into the perfect match for the hero.

The moral was supposedly ""judge someone for what they are inside"", unless they're short of course; then they're fair game.

The second movie wasn't Pixar-level, but it *was* deeper and more mature. The characters want more complex things and do more to get them.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Having been involved professionally in the caviar industry for over 24 years, I continue to be amazed at how little people know about caviar.  Seems there is so many false attitudes and opinions as to what is going on in this industry.  The picture of the ""Bottom Union Carp Caviar"" is false.  Carp Roe does not look like that.  The image of the actual roe in that picture is from Iranian Persian Sturgeons.  The Persian Sturgeon (Acipenser Persicus) is a relative to the Osetra Sturgeon (Acipenser Gueldenstaedtii) and is unique to Iran.  It is also one of the most expensive caviars in the world.  Compare that to the real carp roe in the picture below.  As for taste?  There is absolutely NO COMPARISON! 

Also, paddlefish are not as endangered as sturgeon.  Paddlefish were actually placed on the Convention of International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) list at the same time sturgeon was.  The reasoning behind this was to prevent paddlefish from becoming the next sturgeon.  Paddlefish are a natural American resource that enjoys a very healthy existance in most native areas in the U.S. today.  They are managed by State law.  So, some states have healthy commercial paddlefishing industries and some other states do not.  One thing is for sure, paddlefish is managed very well within the U.S. and as long as it is will never be as endangered as many sturgeon are today.","1238602655"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I'm not defending or apologizing for any policy regarding how the Church confirms priest.  All I'm talking about is the evidence they've used to make the case that gay priests are a disproportionate part of the problem.  I'd like to believe that isn't the case, but I don't see the figures to support the position I'd prefer to take.

That said, the figures that I have seen don't suggest that the best answer is simply discriminating against gay priests.  If gay priests do make up a disproportionately significant part of the offending group, then it may make sense to call a temporary moratorium on new confirmations of gay priests to allow researchers to figure out why there's a disparity.  But a permanent state of ban isn't really justified unless the Vatican can establish that homosexuality is the sole causal factor.

The only excuse I *will* make for the Church is that they're under an intense amount of pressure and scrutiny to curb some really horrifying moral lapses, and I hardly think anyone should be surprised if they tend towards overkill in trying to tidy up the problem.

Less reported is the [Melbourne church's denial][1] that they screen or intend to screen homosexuals.

"Health","t5_2qh9z","&gt;If you want to do no vaccs, [...] that is your personal decision for your child and is no one's else's right to judge or chastise you for it.

Wrong. Choosing not to vaccinate your child can put other children (and your own child) at risk for serious illness. 

Some children cannot receive vaccinations because of health problems and medical conditions. So the parents who choose not to vaccinate their healthy child because of a misguided fear, create more risk for already health-compromised children. The decision not to vaccinate also puts a strain on doctors and emergency rooms when non-vaccinated children become sick or an outbreak occurs.  Which, in turn, puts undo stress on the medical industry, tax-payers, and society at large.

It's kind of like you puffing on a cigarette in a cafe saying how it's your choice to do so and it's nobody's business, while arrogantly ignoring the health risks for yourself, other people around you and the burden your smoking will place on society at large. ","1238602702"

Atheists are constantly being asked to defend their beliefs. They're accused of lacking morals. They can't even run for public office.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I've been through this particular debate a number of times at this point and I think the biggest misunderstanding or miscommunication hinges on the assumption that in order for math to be a boon for software development, one must directly use specific skills directly taught in the math courses that one takes (e.g. differential equations, integration, etc). 

I have a background in Math &amp; Theoretical CS and
I've been in environments that did not require specific mathematical skills (business apps type of programming) and I currently work in an environment that requires more of a background in applied math (scientific programming).

I'll be the first to admit that the skills and techniques learned and reinforced in a math program at the undergrad level (or MS level, for that matter) does not necessarily translate into specific skills that you will use every day (i.e. when doing business apps, my graduate real analysis class rarely came up..despite my best attempts ;).

I, however, firmly believe that going through a proof-based math curriculum trained and honed a particular type of abstract thought has been invaluable to both my ability to reason about the architecture of a piece of software and to debug that piece of software.

I will also say this, I think that getting the MS in math helps in different ways than the undergrad.  Anyway, that's not what this article is about, so I'll just mention it and leave it there.

Now, I don't mean to imply that one *must* have a math background to be skilled at abstract reasoning or debugging.  It just happens to be an excellent way, if you're so wired, to quickly get a lot of practice at some (very transferable) skills.

I've heard similar opinions come from people from other areas of science, such as physics.  However, since they're physicists, you should immediately disregard what they say..*grumble*sloppy math*grumble* (I kid, I kid ;)

*edit* I had another, potentially clarifying, thought about this position over lunch that I wanted to make.  I think this distills my point:
The ability to deal with abstraction and structure is a necessary but not sufficient component of being mathematically adept.  Also, it is a necessary but not sufficient condition to being a skilled software engineer/programmer.  However, I think most people conflate being able to reason abstractly with being mathematically adept.  Herein lies the crux of the confusion: they're working from the assumption that mathematical ability implies programming ability based on that, in my opinion erroneous, conflation.

Israel's problem with the NPT is that it can't sign it and still remain a nuclear power. The treaty establishes a cutoff date whereby if a country hasn't tested a nuclear weapon by that date, it's not allowed to join the treaty as a nuclear weapons state.

&gt; This Treaty shall enter into force after its ratification by the States, the Governments of which are designated Depositaries of the Treaty, and forty other States signatory to this Treaty and the deposit of their instruments of ratification. **For the purposes of this Treaty, a nuclear-weapon State is one which has manufactured and exploded a nuclear weapon or other nuclear explosive device prior to January 1, 1967.**

By this date, it's likely that Israel already had all the components for nuclear weapons. It assembled several bombs during the run-up to the Six-Day War in June of that year. However, it hadn't tested such a weapon either secretly or openly. To this day, Israel has never openly conducted a nuclear test. 

(It is pretty widely accepted that Israel conducted a zero-yield test, or implosion test, in the Negev on November 2, 1966. However, this type of test isn't usually considered a genuine nuclear test.)","1238603324"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Personally, I like ""Stand By"" a lot better. It's quicker to both suspend and resume, and has the same benefit. The drawback is that it requires a little power (to keep the memory sustained), so it's not as ""green"" and if you lose power (like a laptop being suspended for too long without being plugged in--most last a day or two that I've seen) you end up rebooting (however, most laptops will try to hibernate automatically once the battery gets too low).

I also don't see the point about making an icon. In XP, if you press a power button or use the ""Turn off computer"" Start button, you get a dialog with options. I'd rather do that than misclick and shut down, even if it is just a hibernate.

Remember, hibernating or suspending is NOT totally transparent. You will drop persistent network connections (like telnet/ssh), and I think file locks might too (I've noticed Word has problem with open documents after a resume.)","1238603331"

"Health","t5_2qh9z","Maybe from your perspective, but that doesn't make either one of us the ""right"" one. My point was to respect choice. If your child is vaccinated and therefore has immunity and protection how is it putting that vaccinated child at risk? If they do catch an illness after vaccination it is typically mild and non threatening. The majority of the time nurses at your pediatrician's office can give care advice over the phone for mild illness, you don't even have to visit. 
And if a person is paying premiums every paycheck for healthcare, pays their copays and deductibles and prescription copays, how is that undue stress? Is that not what we're all paying for? Unless you're on medicaid I don't see how the taxpayer is footing your bill. The whole point of healthcare is to be able to get care when you are sick. 
And I never said I chose not to, I said I follow a different schedule, one at a time. My kids have had their shots, and the baby is working on it. Why is it all the other points I made were ignored? This is typical of those who wish all to do as they do.

According an analysis by the National Academy of Social Insurance of the Breaux/Thomas premium support proposal, federal subsidies would not keep up with growing insurance premiums and could relegate “lower-income beneficiaries to lower-cost and possibly lower-quality plans“

This is what has apparently stated happening to some low income/disabled people with the existing Medicare Part D (Prescription) plan. At first, there was no charge, but over the last couple of years, they've been charged a monthly fee in addition to the co-pays, which also are rising. The costs are still quite low at this point, but it appears the trend is for them to gradually creep up and up.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Those kind of morals are what the moral realist philosopher Friedriche Nietzsche coined as Slave morality. (The title might make it seems like it's a backwards morality, but it's more complicated that that).  His idea is that in every epoch you will find Master morality, where individuals differentiate their perception of the world into a moral construct of ""good"" v. ""bad."" Also, in every epoch, you will find slave morality, where individuals often differentiate their world into a morality of ""good"" v. ""evil.""

You will find both forces in every civilization, though one might be valued and their for more predominate than the other. 

examples where master morality might predominate: The Romans, The Mongols, The Greeks during the Peloponnese Wars, much of Chinese history.

examples where slave morality might be the predominate morality:  The Socratic school of thought, Judaism, Christianity - (though hypocrisy is abundant, as we all know).

In a single individual both of these moralities are in conflict, and I think it's easily perceivable in yourself.  

If one only as master morality, one might be categorized as a psychopath, a good example might be the killer from the film ""No Country for Old Men.""

If one only has slave morality, one might be a Jewish Rabbi who strictly follows his believes.
