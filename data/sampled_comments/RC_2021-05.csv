This was a sensible action given that many units did not have time to upload full ammo/water/food/fuel loads, and it was doubtful the Kuwaiti forces could stage a cohesive resistance by the time most forces had been alerted.  The thought process was instead of expending these forces in pointless at that point counter attacks, that they would go west, link up with the Saudis for whatever happened next.  Kuwait had historically been  supported against Iraq by much of the Middle East, so the Kuwaitis rightly assumed their forces would be of use to whatever force went back into Kuwait to kick the Iraqis out. 

While some Kuwaiti units would be forced to surrender (The Kuwaiti Navy for instance, was more or less captured at anchor) a reasonable amount would find its way as part of JFC-N (Egyptian/Saudi/Kuwaiti/Syrian forces) or JFC-E (Mostly Saudi, with Kuwaiti, Omani, Emirate and other forces)",1619827201

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","I had some wicked uneven-ness on the IHS for my 3950x, it was so bad it caused a 10-25c variation in temp and bad spikes before getting under control, IN ADDITION, was literally biting into 3 corners of the plate on my heatsinks and water blocks.

SOOO since AMD was constantly out of stock and it took too long for them to get back to me, I sanded the corners down (after talking with someone who said as long as the printing on the face was still readable with Part number/serial number, warranty is still valid) and after doing so.... BOOM, temps dropped 

Not saying it WAS your issue, and NOT SAYING TO DO THIS (especially since AMD can say oh, nope, still warranty void because its not putting huge divots in your heatsinks anymore...), but, I had done it before with Intel, and didnt want to deal with no CPU for a time, and glad I did, solved my issue.

I would be interested in before/after RMA analysis for these situations.

What I WOULD say to do for others with temp issues, is pull the heatsink off when next a chance presents and look closely at the IHS top and the heatsink/coldplate you put on it to see if you have any bad spots where it doesnt look like contact is made.",1619827201

It would be a nice thing for him to do to agree to a proportional split of rent, but it's not a *fair* thing to do, it's a *generous* thing to do.

There's no benefit to the player in requiring it to be online because most people couldn't care less if someone is cheating in a single-player video game. Plus, online-only raises the question of whether or not it's worthwhile to essentially put an expiration date on a game (i.e. whenever the servers get shut down by Sony in the future) for such a negligible reason.

In regards to PR, I think that most people would be more put off by A) reports that the game doesn't allow for mid-run saves than they would be by B) reports that a small fraction of the player base of this single-player game are abusing the old reliable ""Close game, upload to cloud, reopen game, die, download to PS5, die, download to PS5, die, download to PS5‚Ä¶"" exploit to get through the game without any deaths on their stat tracker.",1619827203

Yes, that is a big plus. But, I wouldn't expect anything less from Apple given how tightly controlled iOS is.

But, 2 things:

(1) Android's update system -- both security and other stuff -- is no longer completely tied into the OS updates system. The Play Store delivers them.

(2) Most Android users, statistically, change phones faster and buy them for relatively lower prices (deals). 

I'm still surprised that Android has any significant market share in the US whatsoever. 

Last I checked, iPhone was at ~50%. Samsung ~30%, LG ~10%, Others at ~10%.

Camping people really don't get why non-camping people make a big deal out of it, but camping is just the worst. It ruins my entire day leading up to it because I'm dreading it, and then it also ruins the next day, when I feel grimy, resentful, poorly rested and uncomfortable.

I was accused of lying about knowing women who have an only fans, and how they've told me their story, and the motivation behind it, but it was dismissed because there's no way that I know one of these thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that take nudes for money online. They both work minimum wage jobs which dismissed this easy money idea that was put forth, and they both had no outside financial support, barley could afford rent let alone school or other luxuries more fortunate folks might take for granted which was impossible because this guy claimed it's all for vanity. Use this in a situation where race might occur. I'm a black man and I grew up in the hood and black folks will steal anything not bolted down and they're violent and so on and so forth, but in reality they're white.

"Superstonk","t5_43zwn1","*The second type of transaction, referred to herein as a ‚Äúreset,‚Äù is a transaction in which a market participant who has a ‚Äúfail-to-deliver‚Äù position in a threshold security buys shares of that security while simultaneously selling short-term, deep in-the-money4 call options to, or buying short-term, deep in-the-money put options from, the counterparty to the share purchase. The purchase of shares creates the illusion that the market participant has satisfied the close out obligation of Reg. SHO. However, the shares that are apparently purchased in the reset transactions are never actually delivered to the purchaser because on the day after executing the reset, the option is either exercised (if a call) or assigned (if a put), transferring the shares back to the party that apparently sold them the previous day. This paired transaction allows the market participant with the fail-to-deliver position to effectively borrow the stock for a day, in order to appear to have satisfied the close out requirement of Rule 203(b)(3).*

It's my understanding that they are skirting Reg SHO, and it's not even being hidden, they are using tactics that the SEC has seen before. I know people don't like to believe this kind of corruption but I feel like this isn't just a conspiracy. It's happened before and I strongly believe it's happening again. Show us the true failure to delivers.

This was also around the time they used to do those specials on those twin girls that shared the same body and also when they got started on episodes highlighting massively obese people.

A: I voted for Biden, but I didn't vote for this.

B:  Was specifically referring for the attempts to redefine everything.  We know what bipartisanship is, he made it a big deal of his presidential campaign, and yet he's completely given up on it 100 days in, and is simply trying to redefine it.

Also the attempts to redefine infrastructure.  We know what infrastructure is, he even knew what it was when we voted for him, right here:  [https://joebiden.com/infrastructure-plan](https://joebiden.com/infrastructure-plan)   But now we're stuck discussing the semantics of the word, because we can't call welfare for what it is, everything has to be called ""infrastructure"".

More interestingly the European Central Bank recently published a report for digital euro [https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210414\~ca3013c852.en.html](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2021/html/ecb.pr210414~ca3013c852.en.html)   


&gt;The European Central Bank (ECB) has published today a comprehensive  analysis of its public consultation on a digital euro. The analysis  confirms, by and large, our initial findings: what the public and  professionals want the most from such a digital currency is privacy  (43%), followed by security (18%), the ability to pay across the euro  area (11%), no additional costs (9%) and offline usability (8%).  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúA digital euro can only be successful if it meets the needs of  Europeans,‚Äù says ECB Executive Board member Fabio Panetta. ‚ÄúWe will do  our best to ensure that a digital euro meets the expectations of  citizens highlighted in the public consultation.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;Privacy is the most important feature of a digital euro for both the  public and professionals, especially merchants and other companies.  Both groups support requirements to avoid illicit activities, with fewer  than one in ten responses from members of the public showing support  for full anonymity.

"pakistan","t5_2qh89","My man. You're being dumb. I'm saying that when you're muslim, ISLAM is your identity.

It's as simple as that. That's the reason why our missiles are named Babur and Tanks are Zarrar and Khalid.

What other identity would you want? In islam, once one becomes Muslim, all previous relations and identities become void. The only reason Muslims of the world have different countries is sectarianism and also the fact that Allah said, 

""O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise (each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you.""

And to call what I gave you,"" just another poem of Iqbal"", is utterly disgraceful.

&gt;Keep in mind, you can't use Baloch, Sindhi, Punjabi, 
Pakhtuni,

Why would I? There aren't many things I dislike more than ethonationalist ""Pakistanis"". 

&gt;You did not answer my question of what sets me apart from the other Muslims of the world as a Pakistani muslim

You're one of the people of the Subcontinent who came together because of their devotion to their faith and consolidated themselves as a Muslim state and secured themselves a homeland to call their own, free from the tyranny of those who want to stop us from our practicing our faith and bar us from implementing laws and norms that abide by our faith.

Hold your head up. Be proud. Pakistan was born in 1947. Before that, your identity is Islam. Pakistan is a by-product of that Identity.

"PathOfExileBuilds","t5_2w3q8","Ok just gonna stream of consciousness as I see stuff:

Bloodletting wheel: Mixing bleed and impale is always a waste. You're doing it for Haemophilia, you don't need it, swap out haemophilia also. GOOT gloves are much better for you. Removing 3 points. Adding Great old one's tentacles. More life and now we can remove Swift skewering now. 

Martial experience: More leech is nice but I find the best way to get more leech is just get more life. This works two-fold. Especially because your life is very low for melee. I'm never comfortable under 6.5k life. I'm at 6.8k rn and aiming for 7.3/7.5k. Removing 4 points. Using these to complete scion life wheel.  (Addendum: I came back to this and put 3 points into it becuase it still ended up being the highest dps per point. )

Helm: Removed Devoto for Crown of the inward eye. More damage and life. A 40% cyclone damage one is 55c ish. You can also consider stuff like Pride reservation reduction and consider flesh and stone for defense. 

There's around 3 points left at the moment, and you can decide what you want to do. If you want tankyness I'd go for the fortify wheel Steadfast. You can also get more life, or damage, damage would be Butchery or Kinetic impacts. At this point I'd probably start getting more jewel sockets with phys/melee damage, crit/crit multi, and life. 

All in all your tree was pretty good, better than most phys champs I see on here. One thing I noticed though is you're not capped on resists and you have Soul of Steel. You're not benefitting from the +1 % max res if you're not going past 75. Plus being at around 115 or so ( I forget the exact number) keeps you safe when you get elemental weakness and your curse removal flask is down. Honestly the 5% uncapped on lightning could easily be throwing away everything and killing you constantly, especially due to shock. I always run with a shock flask now, at least until I get 100% ailment immunity which I always get eventually on every build. It's the best thing of all time, probably, but that's a ways down the road.

Gear: You're on the right track here with most things. Looking into a chestpiece should probably be your next big upgrade, I'd consider Hunter/Redeemer i86 Astral for Frenzy/Power charges and Base Attack Crit. 

Gems:  cyclone links: No issues here

Warchief: The damage is nice on bosses, especially if you're lacking in DPS. Eventually you will do significantly more than it though and you can drop impale/brutality to free up 2 gem slots. I would keep cull trhough for sure.

Vaal Haste: If this is working for you sure, but I would probably just run Warchief and let it get all the souls so you can use it more for the buff it grants you. It's a lot stronger than the attack speed steroid. 

CWDT Golem: Drop this. Golems are not great. Plus shit chains off them and kills you. It's pretty fucking annoying. The life regen is so absurdly negligible.

Uses for CWDT:

 \- You can put your molten shell here, I don't know what button you have Molten Shell bound to but trying to manually time it almost never works, noone is that good at anything. Either put it on left click or CWDT lvl 20 it. Wherever you put Molten Shell you should probably Increased Duration it.

   \- Void Sphere: great for Ultimatums and getting shit off your ass. I ran this all heist league on my Blade Flurry champion. It's pretty funny too.

   \- Enfeeble: I know you only have one curse limit but I've run with enfeeble cwdt and vuln on hit, kill shit until you start getting trucked then theyre hit with enfeeble, felt like it worked well. Can also just get 2 curses with Whispers of Doom annoint or on Hunter chest. At that point I'd probably also go Poacher's Mark though for the insane life on hit and phys dmg. 

\- There's other good uses for it I don't remember right now. Or replace with Cast on Death Portal x D (not joking)

Dash: Run Leap Slam dawg. Dash having charges and the hectic nature of spinning around and weaving through enemies makes it not the greatest (Note: I have used dash plenty of times but I feel like Leap Slam adds more and has more skill ceiling to dodge shit) Also Leap Slam allows us to put Lifetap support (so you don't mana screw yourself by traversing the map or drawing no lands), Endurance Charge On Melee Stun, so you get endurance charges like always and then use Enduring Cry as a health potion that also makes your endurance charges better, and Faster attacks so you can zoom zoom. Also Lifetap after a few uses of Leap Slam will make your Health flask better. 

Auras: Good aura setup, Precision not really needed. If you make it farther into maps and still need more survivability I would drop Herald of Purity and/or Blood and Sand depending on whether or not you have enlighten 4 and Pride Res Reduction on helm, and link Maim to it. 

One aura trick that owns: Get lvl 1 Vitality (or as much as you can pump it to without fucking your mana) and use the Life Gained per enemy Hit while affected by Vitality Watcher's Eye. It rolls 20-30, it's amazing. it's about 5 ex right now but many times in the past it's been about 1 ex so it may drop. Also an elder ring with life on hit is great, I'm using that currently.

So after making some changes you're at 5.8k life now and about double your dps with some wiggle room for points. Overcap your res too. None of the items I added are very expensive. If you let me know your budget I can make some more specific changes. Let me know what you think of these so far and see how it feels, and if any more issues come up I'd be happy to help. Here is the revised PoB:

I was basically not getting any iodine whatsoever. I developed a goiter, dr ran all the ‚Äúcancer‚Äù tests, turns out I had low iodine. Probably low all my life as I was never a healthy eater, but non existent once I cut out the processed foods. I went on biowarrior iodine supplement and within a month, my goiter was gone, all my thyroid levels were back to normal and I felt great. Since 2017, I‚Äôve cried a few times in 2020 when my brother passed away- that‚Äôs it. No suicidal thoughts even when things happened that would normally trigger those thoughts, and no daily naps. My thyroid levels are still normal and I tell everyone with any thyroid issues or energy issues- give it a try. It literally saved my life.",1619827210

Since it's from the start I feel like it was when they hadn't quite found their footing with the characters; a lot of other characters' stories from back then gives off subtly different vibes before they, over the course of a lot of time, got fleshed out and developed. Hagumi's definitely a special case though, since it's a really specific, kinda impactful thing that hasn't been addressed again but also hasn't been completely written out--later descriptions of or interactions with her parents seem to paint their relationship as a more standard parent-kid dynamic, but reading the initial story gives things a backdrop of tension. Since the writers haven't really brought it up again since to develop it, it feels either like it's been forgotten in the rush of new events and character development or like they just don't want to bring it up again, even to develop it into something.",1619827210

Indirect stores automatically send out surveys that verizon gets full visability on.  

If you ever have so much as you account accessed at an indirect store, you get an email from verizon asking about your experience there.  I would make sure you take the survey and give your feedback with an honest score.

*Fakespot analyzes the reviews authenticity and not the product quality using AI. We look for real reviews that mention product issues such as counterfeits, defects, and bad return policies that fake reviews try to hide from consumers.*

*We give an A-F letter for trustworthiness of reviews. A = very trustworthy reviews, F = highly untrustworthy reviews. We also provide seller ratings to warn you if the seller can be trusted or not.*",1619827211

"darkjokes","t5_2xg8a","Hello! April is National Poetry Month, and to celebrate we're requiring all comments to be in the form of a haiku-w, or as we're calling it a haikuwu.

What the fuck is a haikuwu, you ask? A haikuwu is a 3 line poem consisting of 5 words on the first and third lines, and 7 on the second. Like a haiku, but words.

Please ensure your comments fit this format, and have a wonderful National Poetry Month

I like to write regex

You also need other lawyers to be friends with, so that if there is a client they can't take because of a conflict of interest they refer him to you.

Lastly, if your client needs a transaction done with the government you need to know people there, for your paperwork to be expedited.

Basically this is what your connection does, it helps you and give you a boost. They might not be necessary, especially if your gonna work in PAO or Prosecutor (you would still need someone so you can enter government more easily).",1619827212

Yes, that's a really tough one to decide on, honestly. It's hard to determine what's right and wrong, and given the differences in information (most have no doubt not had all the intricacies laid out for them, the exact injury and surgery performed) i think it's a tough one.

I like the idea of the pamphlet, which states jogging after one week is alright, and avoid strenuous exercise and lifting for another week, and then listening to the signals your body sends you. Pain and discomfort, stop immediately.

On the other hand, i like having two functioning eyes. ü§î

I was told i could return to casual exercise after a week - that much i know. So i think I'll do non-strenuous, maybe 40-50% at most, no breath holding, no eye popping disco pumping, and ease in to it, feel it out over time

Qliphort gets its namesake from the Qliphoth, (the tree of death). The reverse of which I think is the Sephiroth (tree of life), and both are rooted in the Kabbalah ^(Jewish Mysticism). There is nothing Christian or even Catholic happening here, sir. Heck they're not even angels.

&amp;#x200B;

The Qlis themselves are just a bunch of computing references. Shell, Disk, Helix, etc. They also had a ""demon"" that shared their colors in Infernoids. Both of which would later fight the Zefra, your representatives of the Tree of Life.

If you notice, each Infernoid, Zefra, and Qli all have colors that demonstrate whom they opposed. You might also notice the ""angelic"" motif that all the Zefra tended to share, or perhaps the fact that they all were ""Called"" from places above (admittedly omitting Shaddoll) Satellar, Gem Knight, Yang Zing, Gusto, etc.

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

if you don't believe in the efficacy of the carnivore diet then you can't believe in the efficacy of autoimmune protocol, or even fasting, really. there's no great deficiency in vitamins or micronutrients in a carnivore diet. this is a therapeutic intervention to heal the gut and immune system, and alleviate the myriad symptoms that come with autoimmune disorders. joke's on you if you take any nutritional advice from Peterson. your statement about corn fed beef doesn't make sense either. it's ecological/ethical parameters are a completely different story. bottom line is it's healing tremendous amounts of ppl, and has virtually no risk either. there are ample micronutrients more densely packed into organ meats than virtually any vegetables anyway. how many case studies of those treating their autoimmune disorders with the carnivore diet have you assessed? have you really just googled a quip or quote about the concept from some massive health organization? those things are definitionally going to be 20-50 years behind many methodologies/practices/dietary interventions.",1619827214

OP, if I had a grandmother like that, I'd probably panic at her love-boming attempts at hoovering you back into abuse.

If they want to act as her agents, you will hand up the phone or go home or tell them to leave your home, etc.  Unfortunately, a lot of them will probably prefer to blow up their relationship with you... this isn't your fault... this is simply how abusive families work.  This is how my abusive family worked on both my mother's side and my father's side and those two sides don't even talk to each other.  But, good riddance to anyone who will act as an agent of an abuser.  Seriously.  They don't deserve contact with you.",1619827215

I can see a mild swing left before the election but we've gone far more right than I recall it being anytime during Trump's presidency. Definitely more so than it was say a year ago. 

Probably to be expected though, generally folks are less vocal about criticizing their president and a fair number of Trump voters might not have loved the guy but weren't going to go on the internet and rant against him, leading to more liberal voices. Likewise now, a lot of Biden voters aren't keen to argue about Biden's faults and you hear more conservative voices. Certainly since the election there have been things brought up here by conservatives that I just can't muster the energy or outrage to care about, which I would suspect is a feeling many conservatives can relate to from the past 5 years.",1619827217

Our FO for the past 20+ years, as a principle, just does not believe in paying LBs that much.  That's not even necessarily a knock at them, just an observation of historical fact.

Also, building at the trenches is never quite as sexy but always, always, always should be the priority - and I think this city understands &amp; appreciates that as much as anyone.  And we all know that ACLs in 2021 are generally not nearly as career-derailing(even for OL/mobile QBs/etc. who depend more heavily on those ligaments) as they were even 20 years ago.  Assuming that his knee is coming along fine(please god tell me the FO went out and got independent medical opinions and didn't just go with those of their own team doctors lol), this dude could be a serious mauler and a fixture on our O-Line for the next 8-10 years.

Fuck it, I'm good with this pick.  2.05 is frankly a bit too high to reach for ASJ, Stokes/Campbell were both gone, and I dunno what the actual fuck is happening with JOK right now.  Dude is either getting seriously Bo Callahan'ed right now, or else there's legit some reason why every GM for the past 15+ picks has passed on him(incl a few who very much need LBs and have no qualms about paying at that position).",1619827217

"CrazyFuckingVideos","t5_45hae8","Sorry for the late reply! Indeed, it's an interesting discussion, since the only ones I've had about gun control/laws is me being yelled at about the 2nd amendment. 

I mean, I get why people would be mad about being convicted of something before it even happened, but providing better background checks and fewer places allowing to sell guns is not the same. It's like baby-proofing your apartment even if there's only low risk for your little one. I get that people don't want to be categorize the minute they get a gun, but with stronger gun control, you'd get the security that this bearer of arms is a sane person, right?

Once again, I have to agree that a stronger mental health handling is definitely THE thing to explore. And yes, the stabbing numbers are probably bad but it doesn't mean that the clear gun problem shouldn't be explored. I see it as something to get rid of, because you can't ask people to get rid of their knives without giving them an alternative. As for guns, the main goal is to protect yourself, alternatives may be self-defense classes or the police (and I'll get ahead of you on this one, the police problem is a FAR bigger issue than gun control but it is the protection solution for most countries).

 While I agree that guns have been useful to oppressed part of the population in the past, times have now changed and there are far more useful and creative ways to fight oppression, especially in a country as developed as the US. While it takes a while, I know that, some passive movements and riots have been effective without the usage of guns (gay marriage for example). Plus, if one side is using guns to defend what they believe in, the other side will be doing it too (more prepared and geared up if the other side is the police), so it's just all escalating from there.

This is the part I genuinely don't get (and I mean that with no offense whatsoever). I do understand the correlation between all of those instance of rights being stripped from people by fascists governments, and it is a sensitive subject nowadays in every country with the vaccines and the masks, and maybe even more because yes, as you said, politicians are just serving what the voting population wants but that's politics for you. But, I don't understand why people are soooo attached to this specific right and why making it safer for everyone is making them so mad. It's probably linked to everything we've just been talking about, or maybe I don't get this as a person outside of the US, but it's just utter non sense to me.",1619827217

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Ahhh, ok, like I was too harsh, maybe? Yes, I do have 2 children and I had severe PPD and PPA with both, and severely with intrusive thoughts after my second. I am also a teacher with a mental health academic background, and I know people with the disorders that OP mentioned. So, the reason I said all that is because I have seen, and know personally, how bad it can get and OP didn‚Äôt initially sound like they had a sound support network. I have a devoted, wonderful husband who took up his fair share (and sometimes my fair share) of the childcare and if I had been with the kids 90% if the time, I can‚Äôt even imagine how I would have been. I worry about other people coming on here and giving some ‚Äútips and tricks‚Äù and ‚Äúcure-alls‚Äù (like the instagram lifestyle you mentioned) when with disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder require much more than what most anecdotal advice can provide. Being in the newborn stage it is also hard to think clearly sometimes. Anyways, OPs post had a few red flags for me, so I just wanted to cut to the crux of the issue first. That‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt respond when she said she had a good support system and was seeing a therapist. She has those resources, so hopefully anything else suggested here is icing on the cake, so to speak. Also, OP, I am not defining you by your disorders, I am just speaking that way for the purpose of this post. You are more than labels, so forgive me if I sound insensitive that way.

Edit: I appreciate you including me in your age bracket, as I am staring 37 in the face, but with two very young kids lol",1619827218

"researchchemicals","t5_2rhqm","Crypto is gonna revolutionize the sex-cam/porn market, for sho. Because it works in person, and remotely too, just with a phone and QR code.

It wouldn't surpise me if we start seeing girls at strip clubs, with implanted NFC chips for tipping via phone or smartwatch with cryptocurrency. QR tattoo has been done already too many times..

Within 2-4 years I reckon chips will become the the norm. Let's see. I think a scene could evolve out of it with tattoos, where people get mad tattoos with QRs or implants in certain places, that do different things. Could be a simple tip, could be anything though.. . .. 

Maybe you could tip a girl in cryptocurrency, to remotely stimulate different parts of her/your body that have vibrating/electrical implants in, and result in a crazy AR sex experience lol. 

In the near future perhaps we'll have mad implants that control blood flow, release precise doses of drugs in parts of the body, and even allow dosage control by the other person (with a cryptographic safeword :P).

Imagine a sex party with smart contracts controlling customized sexual rules/fetishes/drug infusions. All preprogrammed with audio recognition of safewords, perhaps even neural network algorithms that would adapt to your own personal tastes, and monitor levels of toxins/dysphoric metabolites. 

Implants that release certain drugs directly through an app, on command, like a mini pharmacy all ready to deploy weaponised combos of unimaginable hedonistic/sexual pleasure (or a more relaxed introspective program/combo, if you prefer a quiet night) straight to the bloodstream.

Orrr you could program a bot to handle your doses instead, either to push the envelope a bit further and investigate heroic doses of potent psychedelics, or to administer micro infusions of functional drugs as you go about your day.

But for real, you could set it up so it doses at the perfect amount related to your other levels of neurotransmitters and drugs, and mechanical implants. Have different maps and profiles for different types of experiences...

It really brought the best in Trey, as the groove was set for him - not always the case with phish (but both good).  I ended up seeing quite a few TAB shows and really enjoying the work Tony did.  Watching the beacon jams this past fall, is what made me want to get a bass again - I've been playing since the 80's, but been without an electric bass (only upright) for the past several years.  Playing his basslines and trying to keep them going like he did for over 15-20 minutes at time almost puts you in a zen meditative state.  

Definitely sad news and a loss to the bass world.  Jamming out to Last tube right now - my favorite of his TAB work.",1619827219

Hi Mo0kish, 

Your post has been automatically flagged for removal because it appears you are asking:

* for brainstorming ideas.

* how to ""get started"" on a project. 

* what is the best method or approach to a project.   

* whether or not you should do a project.  

* if anyone has used a product, or for a product recommendation.
                        
While we do allow questions in /r/DIY, they must relate to a specific aspect of a project, include the research you've done to find an answer yourself and explain why that research didn't answer your question. 
                        
If you have any of these questions, some places to get help are:
            
* The [Getting Started thread](/r/DIY/about/sticky) at the top of the subreddit.  

* Our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/diy) in the appropriate channel.

"politics","t5_2cneq","You're missing my point entirely, which is that he should not have waited that long to tell congress (and by proxy, the American people) that Barr was lying.

Mueller's testimony to congress was a full month after Barr's bullshit summary. During the entirety of that month, Barr's summary was being talked about both on the news and on social media. It doesn't take long for people to just accept a lie as the truth after they hear it from a source that's supposed to be trustworthy. Especially once it starts spreading and other people start accepting it. After that happens, it's extremely difficult to get most people to change their minds. We don't like to accept when we're wrong or when we've been taken for fools, so after accepting a lie as truth for very long, many are more likely to ignore or disbelieve any evidence that contradicts that 'truth'.

If another trustworthy source contradicts the lie before it's had time to settle in their mind as 'the truth' though, it can cause doubt. That doubt can change minds, or at least keep enough skepticism that they never accept the lie as 'truth' and are more willing to believe the evidence that it was a lie once it comes to light.

People had a full month to cement Barr's lie in their minds as the truth with no evidence to the contrary, and they simply ignored Mueller's testimony as a result because they already 'knew' the outcome of the investigation via Barr's summary. If Mueller had issued a statement refuting Barr's summary immediately afterward, I believe that more people would have actually *listened* to his testimony a month later when he gave it.",1619827221

"Choices","t5_2rd24","Content warning: discussion of abuse.

I really want to be positive about this chapter because as someone who's been vocal about the imbalance in how the LIs are treated, it was so nice to get to spend time with Bryce (and have his being from Hawai'i be acknowledged by the narrative), but as someone who's experienced domestic abuse, I just can't.

Disregarding the strange choices made regarding how the scene with Bryce, Keiki, and their mother played out, I'm really disappointed by the implications of the scene. Our society often emphasises forgiveness of abusers, especially in cases of parental abuse. What Bryce's parents did to him and Keiki was emotional abuse. They isolated them, created a hostile environment for them to grow up in, and put such immense pressure on Keiki, a 14 year old, that she left the island to see a brother she barely knew to get away from her mother. 

His mother's apology doesn't even begin to scratch the surface of what she did to him and Keiki. It doesn't make much sense, either, with what we learned in OH:SY, and doesn't acknowledge that what his parents did to him and Keiki outside of their criminal acts was wrong too. His mother crying made me feel sick because it was an emotionally abusive tactic used on me, to make me guilty about choosing to put my health and safety first.

I know that the way the scene is written leaves it as unfinished business, and only a start, but I'm so tired of being told to forgive the person who did that to me and my family, and that being angry with them is bad for me. My anger is mine. I get the choice to never forgive them for what they put me and my family through, and that choice is something I draw power from, especially since I'm forced to continue to interact with them on a daily basis. My freedom comes from allowing myself not to forgive and not forget, even though I was raised in a society that tells me I should continue to have a relationship with someone because they're my blood. 

The scene is poorly written and insulting and it soured everything.",1619827222

Do I think we'll see things level out, and maybe take a small pullback? Sure. But I was ready to buy a home. The one we got is a beautiful one for myself and my family. While I did the ""crazy"" things people talk about like offering over asking I'm 100% happy that I got my first home, and even if it does ""crash"" honestly I don't care. My mortgage is affordable, the location is desirable, and I'm happy.

Also some things I personally considered when trying to figure out if we are in a bubble or not.

1. I'm an older millenial and very few of my friends own a home, yet are all looking to do so.
2. Gen Z is only a few years away from entering the first time home owner market, while all us millenials are still trying for ours
3. Inflation seems to be coming, my house is now an asset probably stronger than the dollar
4. Remote working isn't going away, it might be scaled back, but we've made the jump. 
5. The wealth gap in the country is very real, and with new industries like AirBnB and VRBO, many homes are being purchased as rentals and essentially small businesses. 

Anyway, that's my perspective.",1619827223

"bleach","t5_2rk7q","small mistake here:
Unohana mentioned that she noticed something was off with Aizens 'corpse' and only suspected that some kind of doll was used. But in the same scene Aizen revealed that it was an illusion all along and that she did well to suspect anything.


apart from this, we learned in CFYOW that his abilities do indeed habe defined limits and that it's only as powerful as it is because Aizen is the one using it.
So it isn't too far fetched that even Aizen has a limit to what he can do at one.


Considering that he even got stronger in the less than 2 years he spent at muken, I think he was weaker 110 years ago than at tge point he faked his death.
so it's quite possible that Aizen as a Vice-Captain was still at a point where he might have needed a proper substitute to fool someone especially for a longer time as he did with Shinji.


 I think its safe to say that keeping up a believeable illusion gets exponentially harder with 2 factors: the number of people he wants to affect and the length of time he wants to keep the illusion up.",1619827223

"Socialism_101","t5_2ys9x","Well democratic socialism intends to implement socialism through taking advantage of the state machinery. Of course the machinery isn‚Äôt for us, however it is possible to make this inherently flawed system work with organized pressure to then change it permanently. If one can believe in a vanguard to lead the people through revolution, why not have this vanguard work through pressuring the current systems financially by withholding spending and labor. With organized, intelligent protests. With community work. Policing the police with knowledge, not guns. In America at least, We have benefits places like tzarist  russia or Chiang China didn‚Äôt. I would agree working through any of these corrupt parties and rogue politicians will never bring it about, but an organized people‚Äôs movement just as uncompromising as any armed revolutionary party, that can work. We can crush this system not by attacking the beast , but by starving and then manipulating the beast to bring down itself. The rich have influence because these politicians do their favor, however they only sustain this power because these politicians are in office. These positions at highest are six years. If we can put uncompromising sustained pressure on the system and if there is an ultimate threat to that they will ever fold or squeal their way out to a member of our party that is of the people. To then redistribute our stolen wealth from the .01% to then fund the basic human rights of everyone. Healthcare, housing, a baseline for everyone‚Äôs material needs. Then implement workplace democracy, transfer the means of production to the people, strong local councils with a bottom up approach to governance, an end to imperialism ,etc to make sure this never happens again. It just has to be firmly under the people‚Äôs control which it simply hasn‚Äôt, and won‚Äôt happen through current approaches. Such as Bernie sanders somehow working through the same corrupt party that interests are directly opposed. Even other third parties still fall into a bourgeois line, we need something of people without any politician speak. 34% is all we‚Äôd need for a national election, and strong groundwork for state and local elections working with ALL people. Instead of laying groundwork to make black people vote for Democrats, let‚Äôs get them about something revolutionary actually helping with material results. Lets not disregard poor whites and trump supporters and bolster the rise of fascism, let‚Äôs see if we can realize the reason people are so tired of this government they think the rich will help them. Let‚Äôs give a real third option with a line like the black panthers, but that takes advantage of the system farther and without agitating it the the point of our failure and death. There is a thin line to be treaded to achieve this through peaceful organized means to leave as few lives lost as possible. And worst case, such as a coup, every person in America should already be keeping a gun. I think the peopleS army will be ready for any threat certainly around a revolutionary party leading through this. just think if we can take in the state in a more direct approach head on, we definitely can do it this way.  Everyone hates this government, everyone here loves liberty, it‚Äôs simply making it clear socialism is needed for the people‚Äôs freedom and it‚Äôll be easier to convince this if people feel they can do it as safe as possible.

Btw I wasn‚Äôt necessarily trying to assume too much on your views, I just felt democratic socialism can be quite revolutionary and seems to be the best means as far as the conditions in America. I actually used to be far more ‚Äúradical‚Äù, however I realized perhaps there was a better way to achieve this HERE since all my hero‚Äôs have fallen in the fight trying to get us our freedom.",1619827223

"Bioshock","t5_2shl2","Actually Dishonored is EXTREMELY lenient when it comes to the kill ratio and the good/bad endings.  I myself am really terrible at stealth. Though I have managed to get through Dishonored fairly easy with a low kill count.   Because the low/high chaos meter measures on the amount of people you have killed per level. I think for memory I killed a few in the first level. 3/4 in the second level and 25 in the 3rd. Level five I went nuts and killed 50 people....still low chaos lol!.  Cause if you didn't kill that many early in the game then it measures against the people you haven't killed. It's kind of broken lol.  I sort of prefer the bad ending. It's really dark and action packed. I would recommend doing a low chaos then high chaos run. 

But Dishonored is actually quite fun in low chaos and stealthing it. Mainly cause the world is just so pretty and vibrant. When you go in stealth, it gives you more time to just take in the world and hear conversations and read stuff.",1619827224

There was even a browser extension for Chrome that spoofs your GPS location for the browser itself.  This is what they use to determine your location for broadcasts for local games.  So I just used the browser extension to change my location to Detroit, refresh YTTV, and then it would think I was really in Detroit watching.  By doing it that way, I didn't have to change my location back at any point in time since it wasn't ""traveling"".  

Additionally, doing it this way with the GPS spoof, it would let me change to other markets if there was a different game on that I wanted to watch or if game was blacked out or, if there was no (or a bad) game in the 4pm slot for example.  I remember there being no 4pm game one weekend in ""my viewing location"" so I just changed it to LA, refreshed, and saw what options were available there.

Dart Zone Dartstorm is a 40 rd belt full auto flywheeler, and also looks like a certain piece of male anatomy. Lol. 

Gonna recommend the Tommy gun-esque Villainator again.

BTW, don't buy nerf brand darts (except for accustrike on clearance). Way too expensive and imprecise compared to competitors. At the risk of sounding like a DZ fanboy, their waffle head darts are good for flywheelers, pro and bamboo for springers. The latter also have half length variants like what came with your mk ii. 

Others have mentioned Rival, and that's one space that Nerf still dominates in. Not sure if you want those yellow bawlz bouncing around a navy ship tho, as they get everywhere. 

If you do, highest recommended are Kronos (5 shot pistol springer, internal mag), Artemis/Hades (30 and 60 dart pump springers, internal mag) and Perses (50 dart full auto flywheeler, hopper).

So if that did end up happening, you would have to buy all the drives from Dell.. and they charge like 3x fair market price for any spare parts.. because they can.

Geordi's eyes were never functional. He was blind since birth.

Whether it is logically consistant or morally sound is a matter for debate, but 90s era Trek was pretty clear that the line is draw precisely here, and no farther: you can build a prosthetic to correct a handcap (like Geordi's VISOR or Picards heart) and even make it better than a normal person, but a doctor will not cut into a healthy body and remove parts to replace them with machines. You can correct a disorder with gene therapy, but it has to be pretty serious and clear cut-- Bashir's very-low cognative functions didn't cut it.

It's pretty close to how we handle drugs these days, actually. You can get a chemical to correct your learning disability, but no doctor will perscribe you something just to help you concentrate during finals unless you have a diagnosis.

"TheMotte","t5_vkedk","It's a matter of state capacity: China obliterated the virus with a massive Party-enforced crackdown. Emphasis rests on Party-enforced: I've seen videos of people getting locked inside their apartments, biomasked men with guns wandering around. They did everything else super fast too: massive disinfectant campaigns around cities that didn't really do anything, plus they made a vaccine very fast. I remember hearing that PLA personnel were getting vaccinated early in 2020, though their vaccines don't work fantastically compared to Western ones.

Now they're largely playing it slow because they're pretty confident that they can beat the virus without a vaccine. I believe that if they wanted to mass-produce vaccines, they could. How hard can it be for the world's workshop to pump them out? It may even be to their strategic interests not to: nobody else seems able to replicate their success so their relative strength is increased.

Why only China? They don't have to deal with complaints and civil society. Everyone just shuts up and does as they're told: there's a universal command and control system that takes their orders top-down - and if you fuck up you get arrested or killed. Everywhere else there isn't really a top-down command structure: the police aren't capable of enforcing a lockdown like a official on every street. There's no Party member in Astra-Zeneca relaying orders: there are market processes of buying and selling. There's tenders and bidding and all kinds of procedures before the plant gets built: China would just order it done and they'd bring in the guys who build skyscrapers in a few weeks to do it.

Whatever the other negative effects of autocracy, strong dictatorships can make extraordinary efforts better than market democracies.",1619827228

Smith I think is an adequate risk to take as there is a lot to look at and bet on. Dickerson is a phenomenal player.

That said, I think we can all agree it's only true on technicality, and not what anybody means when they say '3G'.

Some guys got creative in trying to accomplish the come over. One guy she was going to meet when she got close to the meeting area he claims that he cant find his keys and his wallet is in his car. Could she instead just come to his place instead. One guy tried  to come to her place when she told him he cant because shes a care taker its not her place. The guy told her to just drug her client and sneak him in...Not too mention the many married dudes she ran into on there. She disabled her acct just right after we met and just went back to IRL dating...

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but I think Dio Over Heaven has infinite time stop right? 

You see, the reason why Sakuya wins these fights is because she has an indefinite time stop compared to Dio‚Äôs (or other characters) limited time manipulation abilities. 

Indefinite time stop DIO: 10/10 win

10 second limit DIO: 6/10, he did get damaged during his fights by mere punches but he regen using TWOH. However, if time is completely stopped for him and he ran out, he is purely at the mercy of Sakuya‚Äôs knives. 

Also, DIO‚Äôs reality warping abilities aren‚Äôt throughly explored in the game so Idk if he can rewrite time stops or whatever",1619827230

People who serve tend to make more money, but it's so inconsistent that it has it's own stresses.

I personally have played Tayuya for a couple thousand matches at a relatively high level, and Minato Temari is my nightmare fuel. I haven't lost many matches with tayuya, but a couple of them are vs minato temari cover fire.

If that doesn‚Äôt work, check out the podcast ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Wrong About,‚Äù and listen to the Stonewall Uprising episode from last June. The first pride parade happened a year after the Stonewall riot, when a police raid on a gay bar turned violent. It was one of the first times we‚Äôd stood up to the police, and it made national news and led to several nights of riots in the neighborhood. This was back in the day where being arrested for homosexuality or ‚Äúfemale impersonation‚Äù meant your name would be published in the newspaper and you‚Äôd likely lose your job and be evicted. So the cops trying to meet their monthly arrest quotas were destroying people‚Äôs lives.

Pride arose as a reaction to the conditions we were made to live under, when we started loudly demanding civil rights and legal protections. If you want to go about your day-to-day life without any rainbow jockstraps in your wardrobe, that‚Äôs well and good. But the fact that you‚Äôre able to be out at work or at school is the result of more than 50 years of parades, marches, protests, and riots.",1619827231

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Normally I would agree with both of you, they are both skilled in privative living and wilderness survival.  The breaking point would be they have no supplies, packs or provisions.  I have hiked that area and it is short peaks to dry region all the way to Gunnison.  Then you start having to hide at 11-12Kft.  I stayed a 4 nighter near that area at 11K in July and at night it was getting down to 38F and heavy storms would cause flash floods.  That is why we were hammock camping.  

Shit is brutal up there without your basic needs, I bet even both of those guys would Ted Bundy it back to town.",1619827231

"smitepro","t5_2xdtn","Is it though? I think it's more then fair to consider this team just as much or more a super team. Every player on this team has a case for top 3 at their position and I'd say head to head 3/5 of the Warriors were better last year. Benji was probably better then Nika though it's close and even Dardez Paul is being skewed by world's. Dardez was the better mid for the majority of last year(though I'd still give Paul the edge.) This team also doesn't have a question mark as huge as Scary in jungle. 

Think the whole super team rep for the Titans is coming from guys reps rather then recent performance. Cyclone and Aror are big names who were the best in the world for a time, but they certainly weren't last year, and both struggled heavily at times last year. Not saying they were bad, but painting them as a super team and this team as not isn't true imo.",1619827232

1. Playing ranked is better experience than playing casuals/battle lounge, imo
2. I expect that someone playing only ranked will have reached the same place you have in fewer games
3. Let me see what I find
4. I find players meeting expected criteria of someone who only plays rank are doing it at 4k; that is fewer.
5. The cost of your suggested approach is considerable.

I didn't \_predict\_ it would be 4k. That's what I \_found\_  so when you asked if I was suggesting that you would have reached Ultra Diamond in 4k had you only played rank, yes, that is what I was finding.

Players meeting my conditions of only playing ranked, excluding the ones with win percentages above 51% as likely means they had prior experience:

So how am I supposed to answer what would have happened had you only played 4k ranked matches when the best evidence I have is that you would have gotten to Ultra Diamond sooner? The data I would have liked to have is all people who only played ranked and where they ended up, but I don't have that.   


I have that diamond players who played only ranked got to Diamond in significantly fewer total fights than people who putzed around in casuals.  Number I had then was 4k, looks like 4k-8k is the range i'm finding now.

"realestateinvesting","t5_2qnt1","I can agree with this guy to an extent. 10% vacancy if you have tenant turnover every year and a new leasing fee. that may be if you have a 1 bedroom place.

I‚Äôd run cap ex and maintenance around 12-15%

I was told if you found a turn key place that has a COC of 6-8% that, that is good. This depends on your goals. I would prob settle for 8-10% COC assuming tenant turnover every year with 10% vacancy as worst case scenario.

It may well be that OPwife has to do the Peruvian change first, and then change everything in the US to whatever the Peruvian passport says.

A Nord is equally as likely to be given a dragons soul by the Gods as an Altmer or an Argonian. 

The Nerevarine is a bit trickier, since they are meant to be an ""Outsider"". That could mean that it has to be someone not of Morrowind aka not a Dunmer, but it could just as much mean someone not born in or fluent in the ways of the Morrowind Dunmer, where a Dunmer Outsider is possible. Prophecies are messy like that.

"BorderCollie","t5_2sof5","Reach out to a behaviorist or positive trainer - lots are doing virtual training now, which is great for observing how you interact with your pup at home. Helped me realize I was giving my dog mixed signals, which was confusing him. 

My dog reacts to anyone looking him in the eye - if they seem like they‚Äôre coming in to say hi, it‚Äôs too direct for him and he freaks out. It may be that folks are being too direct with him for his current level of comfort - your trainer will give you better advice than I can, but I‚Äôd say to start with other folks throwing treats at him while they talk to you, without even acknowledging his presence. Even better if it‚Äôs little tiny treats that scatter on the ground (I use shredded cheese) - we learned that ‚Äònose down‚Äô is a self calming technique, so if they inadvertently find themselves in that position while scrounging for treats, it will help to increase feeling calm in a stressful situation. Also, I would never do this with strangers - only friends and family that I trust to follow my instructions. 

Lastly - today sounded overwhelming and stressful for both of you. Give yourself and your pup some time to chill (a few days) before starting stressful training.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","&gt;Not that i make the rules or anything. but one is potentially a brief gathering, while keeping distance.

&gt;The other is essentially living with someone, cooking, eating, washing, for potentially 3 days or longer.

Why does it have to be three days? Why can't it be one night in separate tents, washing separately, cooking separately. There is nothing that necessitates it will be close contact other than gathering around the campfire. Assinibpine park is no different. You can go back the next day. Same people. Stay there all day and even cook all the food there, then clean the utensils as well. There's even the public washroom there you MUST use, which increase exposure even further.

&gt;Not quite the same thing if you ask me. but as i said. i dont make the rules.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This probably isn't my worst experience but it left an impression on me for a while and made me rethink my regular nightly walks.  For context, I'm a college student who lives on campus, and I assumed it would be relatively safe to take walks around the area.

I recently got jump-scared by a guy on one of my nightly walks. I was power-walking down the road and had my earphones in when this dude suddenly came up from behind to tap my shoulder. My entire body jumped and I stuttered an audible ""Oh my god you scared me."" I turned around and he looked like another student, so I cautiously greeted him, but he proceeded to make small talk with me about my major and asked if he could walk with me. I just said ""sorry"" and noped out of there so quickly. My heart was pounding so quickly afterwards and I had to keep looking over my shoulder to make sure he wasn't trailing me either.

To think that I was just trying to de-stress after a long day of classes and ended up getting my fight-or-flight senses activated...",1619827237

assuming your save file hit the maximum population count, the game starts culling unplayed Sims. ageing here isn't a factor, as once the game reaches a certain number of Sims (because NPC Sims will continue to be generated), unplayed Sims will be culled to keep the save file at a manageable size, and the loading times faster.

if your save's total population is not high at all, then it would be a different reason worth looking into.",1619827237

Health care is expensive and our provider is a nightmare to deal with. We literally have next to no benefits. They stopped matching 401k contributions Years ago. It's maddening. The worst part is I love teaching. I excelled through High school and college and fell in love with being a student. Naturally teaching was a career I displayed a tremendous amount of interest in and I am good at it. Sadly in this career you are not rewarded for your above and beyond teaching record.

He took it very well. 
I made my own group of friends after moving here that I came out to the first chance I got.

On the other hand, every time I go out with the group of friends I made myself I feel free and have the best time ever, no matter what we go out to do.

It sounds like you guys are doing everything right and there's either an issue, or shit luck. It doesn't hurt to find out more. If you discover there's nothing obvious keeping you guys from conceiving, then reassess medical assistance at that time! But if there's little chance of conceiving on your own, wouldn't you prefer to know sooner rather than another year passing by? If there's bad news, it exists whether you know about it or not. It's your reality. Whether you take control or not is up to you.

But also, I'm 34 and I can guarantee that if we don't conceive by the time I'm 35, I will be in my obgyn's office on my 35th bday getting referred to an RE. Shoot, maybe even sooner since I'm doing opks + bbt and I know we're hitting timing correctly. I'm not messing around.",1619827239

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"fightporn","t5_2u5un","Yeah I had this happen once at the end of a concert, when they were saying goodnight and tossing a couple things off the stage. So I ended up catching the setlist at the exact same time as this really drunk girl, who also managed to catch my thumb in her death grip lol.

So right away she starts yanking on the paper (and my thumb), thinking I'm trying to have a tug-of-war with her over it or something. The place is still packed and loud as everyone starts leaving, and I'm trying to tell her the setlist is all hers as long as she gives me back my thumb. 

But she was hammered and just wasn't catching on, and so just keeps tweaking my thumb and kind of like half-slapping at my arm, while I'm trying unsuccessfully to like dislodge it without being aggressive while surrounded by a crowd of people (because I'm a 6'1 guy and she was like a 5'4 drunk girl).

But after maybe 30 seconds unsuccessfully trying to dismember my thumb, she decides the best way to get the setlist is to start Sparta-kicking me in the thigh/crotch. The first one threw me off because I was like ""wtf is wrong with her"", the second one landed was while I was *still* trying to be diplomatic, and then as she came with the third one I swept her leg to put her on the ground (because I still had plans for my dick to be functional later that night).

Anyways, point of the story, cue a bunch of people who had been right next to her hitting me with no reaction the whole time. Then they suddenly became shocked that I didn't let her keep kicking me, and started on me like ""wtf did you do to her"". And the venue security came up to me and ended up calling (or having present, I don't remember) the cops. 

Thankfully reality prevailed when I spoke to the officers and described exactly what had happened, and they ended up asking me if I wanted to press charges on her for the battery, but it was eye-opening to experience the double-standard from the surrounding people firsthand despite her having been the clear aggressor for the entire time.",1619827240

"Pristiq","t5_3jth5","I am on a medically supervised tapering program and have tapered from 100 to 50 so far by cutting the tablets - approved by my pharmacist 

It‚Äôs totally doable - but it has affects on me which I managed - when taking the cut medication I ate at the same time - a small bowl of protein custard a cookie and coffee - it‚Äôs my first food if the day after cycling for an hour (which REALLY REALLY helps during tapering as you are creating natural ‚Äòhighs‚Äô) 

Sometimes I could ‚Äòtaste‚Äô the tablet 30 minutes later so I ate two dark chocolate peanut butter cups as they countered the taste

Then my body would feel a ‚Äòsurge‚Äô around an hour later - not painful or unpleasant but definitely noticeable ...

I kept myself very busy with things that preoccupied me, like light housework or listening to podcasts whilst browsing online stores or watching something and playing candy crush - all designed to stay out of my head whilst the ‚Äòsurge‚Äô passed.   It always did 

You CAN cut them - you might react ... only one time in 7 weeks did I vomit but that was because I ate more than my normal system and didn‚Äôt again 

I am tapering at 1/4 of a 50 tablet every two weeks and it has been manageable not a horror story ...

"KevinSamuels","t5_3lsbvh","In my opinion,  I think you have to look at the whole collection of videos. From what I seen, and correct me if I am wrong, that video was on a collection of videos of improving yourself. I think he was saying that when you start to improve yourself and put work into yourself, people will label you as arrogant to put you down because now you are focusing on improving your life. So embrace it, and continue to put in the work. When you are grinding and trying to be better, you have to become selfish. You have to reclaim your time, resources, and energy to use them in a productive way to get to where you want to be. You here it from so many successful people,  that they became successful when they start saying no to people.  That is what I got from that video. From other videos he did, he also states when you get to that level you are aiming for, turn around and help others get there as well. He gave an example of how he became the top sale person and hired a whole team of black people to get them paid and helped them. Truly arrogant people do not do that. 

Tldr it is okay to become selfish and arrogant with your time, resources, and energy as you focus on becoming better. Once you've reach a high level, turn back and help others that are also doing the work, and assist them to getting to a higher level as well.",1619827243

"Games","t5_2qhwp","As much as I like the original RCT games, they haven't aged that well imo. The biggest problems have to be the restriction to isometric view and how there's nothing stopping you from building the same ride over and over. RCT doesn't have a view option like in the Sims where it allows you to see inside buildings or etc, without making all scenery invisible, and this really hurts the experience of building indoor rides like dark rides. And it doesn't even need to be indoors, tall rides or buildings can easily obstruct the view of something. Also the fact that scenery isn't able to make rides ""indoors"" to make them rideable during the rain bothers me.

And then there's how guests don't care about if you build the same ride over and over. There's nothing stopping the player from building 10 motion simulators and 10 shuttle loops. Yeah building a 300 feet tall giga coaster might be cool for your park, but those typically cost like 18k-25k dollars when a few shuttle loops can cost under 10k and attract the same amount of guests.

And then there's other things I had issues with. Employee path setting is too wide and imprecise and isn't capable to understand if there's a path above a path. There's no employee management beyond setting their path and firing them. Security guards feel too useless as vandalism isn't that big of an issue. You can't choose what ride to research where I think Sim Theme park had that at least. 

I just wish there was game with the customization and visuals of Planet Coaster with better management aspects like Caesar or Theme Hospital.",1619827244

So I made a few changes to it and Akiri was removed as the partner and I ended up replacing her with Ardenn. The deck plays similar, but I have a lot more fun with Ardenn and combo with a Voltron back up is fun.

The second one was what really got me into playing combo decks. My Kykar Wind's Fury deck. I had built a Divergent Transformations combo control list with Leveler and Thoracle as the wincon. The deck itself wasnt bad, but it was what I wanted in a combo deck amd wasnt how I wanted to play. So I took her apart for pieces for my other decks.

The problem is: that was pre-Chernobyl. We didn't manage to repeat that in the past 30 years. How much greenhouse gas emissions did the EPR in Flamanville save us up to now?

The growth rates of renewables are also not guess times? We observe exponential growth over the past decade, and we are now globally producing as much electricity from those renewables as from nuclear power.

&gt;Is it really better to get power ""faster"" along the way

Yes, because we need to watch out for accumulated CO2 emissions. So the sooner you reduce emissions the larger the effect. If we'd have continued to build nuclear power to displace coal in the nineties after oil in the eighties, we would have saved quite a lot by now. If we displace coal now by renewables, it's the same thing. If you continue fossil fuels until new reactors go online that will have accumulated quite some CO2 in the atmosphere in the meantime.

&gt;viciously fight against nuclear power after all.

Why do you see me viciously fight nuclear? I am seeing some hope in very recent developments. Something that nuclear power never provided for 20 years now. The past decade was rather depressing from a climate point of view, now there are some good news coming in that the coming decade actually could prove better, and you are telling me I should rather wait on new nuclear power plants being built.

&gt;So renewable it is then, good luck, please prove me wrong.

As you only want to look at past data and not projections or studies, I guess we'll have to see? I really hope that india actually has peaked its fossil fuels in 2018, that china will peak it earlier than 2025 and that ""the west"" rapidly decarbonizes its grid within the decade.",1619827245

Credit where credit is due.

The comments on this LDS article tonight are of the highest quality. I have picked this one:

""Expressed differently, if the vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing ‚Äúsevere cases‚Äù (those that result in hospitalization and/or death), wouldn‚Äôt we only expect 5 percent of fully vaccinated patients to die from COVID?

In this study, we have a ‚Äúknown knowable‚Äù ‚Äì 526 patients who WERE fully vaccinated. If only 5 percent of these fully-vaccinated patients died, this would be 26 patients who died from the disease. Instead we had 113 who died ‚Äì more than 4 times as many as one might have expected based on claims made by vaccine proponents.""

These vaccines would never have passed regulators if the studies and media were not sufficiently juiced",1619827245

"hardware","t5_2qh18","&gt; You don't think arbitrage happens in real world?

Of course it does. I never claimed otherwise. It certainly does not happen to even remotely the same degree that is seen in the crypto world, though.

Also, it's interesting that you're implying that the crypto world is something different than the ""real world"". I wonder why?

&gt;The reason it is not spent on food and housing is because this shit was literally invented a decade ago

Sure, I don't disagree with that either. Do you expect that to change in time?

When ""real world"" currency emerged, it was *not* held by speculators ad infinitum (or minted ad infinitum). Sure, some speculated, and many still do. But real world currency was also *immediately* put to its intended, predominant, practical use: facilitating the trade of real, intrinsically valuable goods and services.

&gt;You are sort of expecting it to already have transformed the world

No I'm not. In fact, I'd say it's transforming the world already.

&gt;when it has barely started getting accepted as legitimate

I agree. We seem to agree on quite a lot, actually.

So what will it take for it to finally become ""legitimate""? If the $926 trillion in transactions you cited hasn't proven its legitimacy yet, then what will?

&gt;You can use a visa/mastercard crypto card even today

Sure you can. That one guy even bought pizza with Bitcoin once.

But how often does that happen as a proportion of total crypto transactions?

Those crypto credit cards are overwhelmingly used to... exchange more crypto.",1619827246

# üë©‚Äçü¶∞ About Me

* Real next-door amateur girl. I never did porn or anything like that.
* I'm a geek, first and foremost.
* I love older video games and RPGs. Some of my favorite titles are SW:KOTOR 1&amp;2, Diablo Series, Dishonored, Witcher 3, Planescape Torment.
* I'm learning programming and I'm seriously into Python. I'm really completely obsessed and in love with it and I dream about code :) 
* I maxed out the standard Mensa IQ test(didn't take the second one) when I was 22 and became a member, but it's a sad circlejerk so I quit after going to 3 meetings. I used to be kind of a math whiz when I was a kid, doing well in national competitions.
* Used to work in IT, but got bored quickly. Hate the corpo world.
* I've been playing the guitar for 10+ years. I play mostly blues and musically am into progressive rock, post-punk, and folk-punk.
* I also like to cook challenging dishes and gardening in my spare time.

There is also the side issue of the word ‚ÄúBrits‚Äù as well - Americans love calling us that but I think most of us think it‚Äôs pretty cringeworthy. The correct term is actually ‚ÄúBritons‚Äù, although we wouldn‚Äôt use that either. Basically (and I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre American, sorry) we‚Äôd use these terms with these people:

Meeting other ‚ÄúBritons‚Äù in a bar in for example Spain: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from Town/City/Area X (if that place is in for example Scotland and they are from England then the country doesn‚Äôt need to be specified)‚Äù

Meeting foreign tourists in a country to which you are both foreign: usually ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from England/Scotland/etc‚Äù but sometimes ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the UK‚Äù

Meeting locals in a country you are a foreigner in: as above but depends on the country.

Talking to immigration, police or customs officials etc in other countries: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm from the UK‚Äù

We‚Äôve found ourselves in a country where the shit has absolutely hit the fan and the French Foreign Legion are going to airlift us out: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm British‚Äù


Then again we are a people full of nuances and if you made a new thread asking if everything I just said is true or not you‚Äôd get a hundred different answers. I‚Äôd probably answer differently myself! So who knows.

"saltierthancrait","t5_9d1wl","Why does Kylo even need them? They have guns and knives. He has the force. 

Vader used bounty hunters - who's speciality was hunting people - when needed to assist in his mission to find Han, Leia, and Luke. As soon as Fett found them, Vader dealt with them himself. I bet he had them on speed dial. Professional contractors that's all they were to him.

The KOR are like Kylo's personal gang. They like admire him, and he follows their demands to wear a mask and look 'cool'. And considering how entitled Kylo is, and how he only really cares about force powerful beings, and not weak people, why would he enlist this crew?

These guys just stand on rocks and look cool. They didn't even serve a point in the story.",1619827247

I am a union delegate for an Australian company and there was a lot of pressure on workers to accept a terrible deal that would have us accept a sub-inflation pay rise, continued mass casualization of the workforce and a loss of shift allowances. 

And in general, the workers believe whatever information the company puts forward because it's not really the worst place in the world to work. And they exploit your situation, especially during Covid, by saying things like ""many people aren't as fortunate as you to have work right now"", ""the whole country is struggling right now so we might have to outsource if you want too much money(even though this company in particular had record profits during covid)"" or ""we want to keep people in jobs, so we can't put on permanents because we might have to make some people redundant if there is a downturn in work(acting like redundancies are a worse outcome than being in insecure, casual work for years on end)"". 

But through action, which involved unpaid strike action, we secured a deal(I believe it was still a shit deal overall) that was levels above what they company initially offered. Wages to essentially match inflation, no loss of shift loading, some good roster preferencing and a casual conversion clause that is being followed by the company, providing full time work for people that want it. 

Companies will do everything they can to squeeze the employees. Payroll is one of the biggest expenses of any company, so any reduction or suppression of rises in workers' pay and conditions is massive value for a company. They can always(almost) pay more, but they will go to the ends of the earth to not have to. That is why we need to unionize.",1619827248

I failed it twice.. on the third try, it just clicked. It felt like I finally understood it. I started learning python by myself. A year later I got a job as a python tutor for kids up to 17yo!! Pretty nice job!

If you stay with this man, even if he turns around and behaves respectfully toward them from now on, THEY will be stuck with the knowledge of his behaviour and YOUR choice, and you may ruin your future relationships with them. Consider carefully.

#SERIOUSLY READ THIS WHOLE THING

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined **post &amp; comment** karma - ***award karma DOES NOT COUNT***. We don't care if the app says you have 600. ***It is wrong.***

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it or try r/karma.**

There's a different level of seriousness to everything in tf that it can sometimes get blurry and difficult to know what is serious and what not, but that doens't block discussion at all, and what if they're hidden rants? That's literally what a dedicated sub is for, starting discussion.

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","LGBTQ people are humans first and deserve the same rights afforded to any other group of people.

However, any religious organization Christian or otherwise should have the right to deny ‚Äúmarrying‚Äù an LQBTQ couple because they define marriage differently than how the government defines it (more on that in the next paragraph)

For the Christian, marriage is a symbol of Christ and the Church. It is about His life of sacrificing himself for the good of the Church even though the Church did nothing to deserve it. I think purity culture has ruined what marriage is by just defining it as a relationship but with sex. That‚Äôs so watered down and weak. To the govt‚Äô, marriage gives an individual the ability to make decisions on the other persons behalf and helps with tax breaks as well as other things. 

I have no problem with people entering into those legal (and consenting) relationships. Just don‚Äôt force me call it marriage because I believe it is a different relationship. However, I would still go to a gay friends wedding, invite them and their spouse to spend time with my wife and I, etc.

The main fear a few of my coworkers had (I‚Äôm a former pastor) is that they would be asked to do a LGBTQ wedding only to be sued when they would inevitably deny. The vast majority of pastors and churches are on the razors edge financially and even small issues can become major financial burdens. Yet the pastors I know care so much about the community (and I actually mean community not just the church. We forget often that many free social programs are actually provided by local churches) they are in and couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of losing everything to a lawsuit. Even if they won, it would in most cases be enough to close the church and push them out of ministry.

All this to say, LGBTQ+ people deserve right but so do religious organizations. Both can have them at the same time.",1619827252

He delivered us from evil into the light. He liberated us from the shackles enforced by the aristocracy. Your baseless accusations are not only an affront to us, the people of England, but also our God who assuredly blessed him as our savior. 

We will forgive this slight just once.""

All you've done is satisfy your own avarice at the expense of Scottish lives. Are your people even aware of the evil acts you have committed in Ireland?

Cadenhead‚Äôs ‚Äúliving casks‚Äù have quite the reputation in the whisky world. Each living cask is constantly replenished with fresh whisky as it‚Äôs bottled, so each bottling is slightly different. Let‚Äôs see how this sherry-matured iteration is. 

***
	
**Cadenhead‚Äôs Sherry Cask Blended Malt.** Blended malt scotch whisky. 57.5% ABV. No colour added, un-chillfiltered.

**Maturation:** No age statement. A blend of malts that have been exclusively matured in sherry casks.

**Served:** Neat, in my trusty glencairn. Rested about 10 minutes, enjoyed very slowly.

***

**Colour:** Deep amber.

**Nose:** Deep and syrupy. A Shabbos dinner scene: honey-soaked raisin challah, Manischewitz, flickering paraffin candles, and the smell of chicken soup wafting in from the next room. Spicy gingerbread, clove-studded orange, chocolate fudge. Sticky bread dough. Pineapple in syrup and Rose‚Äôs grenadine. A warm smoky undercurrent. Gentle earth‚Ä¶ black truffles?

**Palate:** Syrupy texture. Candied red fruit and blood oranges up front, with a whole pantry of various jams and sugary syrups. Rooibos tea and cloves on the development, with thick honey, warm oak, and spicy ginger. More of that slowly-rising bread dough. Coffee cake, toasted almonds, s‚Äômores, and raspberry jam on toasted buttered pumpernickel.

**Finish:** Medium-long and spiced. More red fruit. Chocolate truffles, chocolate orange, chocolate torte with raspberry sauce. Honey, candied ginger, warm cinnamon buns, and sponge toffee. More black truffle.

***

**Notes:** Wow, this is killer. It's overflowing with sweet succulent sherry. The palate is just so rich and chewy, with piles of sweet red fruit and these great spice notes. That doughy note in there is great too. I have no idea what‚Äôs in here, but it‚Äôs working. 

**Final score: 88/100** 


***

**Rating Scale:**


0-49: Blech.

50-59: Save it for mixing. 

60-69: I might not turn down a glass if I needed a drink.

70-74: Meh. It‚Äôs definitely drinkable, but it can do better.

75-79: Good whisky worth tasting.

80-84: Really quite good. Quality stuff.

85-89: Excellent, a standout dram.

90-94: Personal favourite.

95-100: Mythical. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever taste a whisky this good.

Obviously there are outliers to this as there are many people in the world with extra/missing limbs. No eyes. Etc. But it would be ridiculous to consider such descriptions of people in general terms as denying the humanity or existence of the outliers.

The definition of gender didn‚Äôt change alongside societal change. It is just that there are some people in our population that are trying to redefine gender in the name of social justice.

The problem with this is that it has become distant from even the science of those born with such biological anomalies. We are obviously not talking about intersex people or ambiguous genitalia.

We are talking about those born with the full functioning genitalia and chromosomes of one gender, but feels like they are the other gender.

Like that‚Äôs okay. But the problem is when the rest of the world becomes obligated to adhere to feelings and ignore biology. That becomes ridiculous.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt;The gases are not causing the change in climate its the opposite but they do amplify it by a tiny amount

&gt;its completely normal for c02, temperatures and sea levels to rise and fall but c02 is not the cause the change in temperature actually causes the c02 levels to change

Think you're pretty unclear on what you want to say here, since you're saying conflicting things. CO2 cannot initiate changes in temperature, but can help the pattern once an increase or decrease starts? But again, we're seeing CO2 levels rise right now before any kind of change in temperature, of which there isn't evidence of happening in the past - so that's an anomaly, no?

And while we're going through what you said earlier -

&gt;The last time CO2 was similar to current levels was around 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene. Back then, CO2 levels remained at around 365 to 410 ppm for thousands of years. Arctic temperatures were 11 to 16¬∞C warmer (Csank 2011). Global temperatures over this period is estimated to be 3 to 4¬∞C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures.  Sea levels were around 25 metres higher than current sea level (Dwyer 2008).

&gt;So how did c02 make the arctics 11 - 16c warmer when the c02 levels were practically identical to today?

Pretty funny you're saying we shouldn't use CO2 as a single predictor of temperature, but then bring up an example where the temperature was much higher, and use that to dismiss concerns about CO2 today because the CO2 levels weren't higher. The only way the Pliocene should be used as a comparison to today's planet is if, as you say, all other factors were the same too - where the Earth was in its axial procession, where it was in the Milankovich cycle, whether the continents were equally close to the equator as they are today, whether the sun's output is equal to what it is today, whether the amount of methane or other potential naturally-occurring greenhouse gasses were also the same, etc. etc.",1619827259

Jake smoked twice iirc, one when he was put in prison, and another time when he was paying respects for Olly. Both time I think he was stressed.

Gun smoked when he disqualified Johan and Samuel, he was prolly very disappointed and stressed that the successors he saw the most talent in turned out to be incompetent.

Anyways  rambling. I Would stay on blockers for a minimum of a year before you decide to have surgery/RAI

Uncontrolled hypo is terrifying.

Controlled hyper is absolutely manageable.

Do you remember the 2008 housing collapse that caused an economic recession?

Wallstreet and bankers made so much money it's not even funny.

The bailouts also helped your average joe keep their home.

Its unfortunate that the wealthy have so much sway that the bailouts help to the general population by 10% and that other 90% gets funneled into corporations coffers who then donate back to those same politicians.

&gt;the insane push to inject people with experimental treatments

I think the economy is barely staying afloat and the only way easy way out is vaccines.

&gt;the radical divisiveness spurred from rules that have zero effect on health

Foreign meddling caused this. Look at new zealand, masks, social distancing and contact tracing work if you live on a small island and can control those things. No one actually locked down in america, and half measures don't work, no big surprise there.

&gt;And I‚Äôm just missing the positives.

500k + people have died ontop of the already anticipated deaths (eg 500k additional deaths have been caused by covid, according to the cdc).

Fucking 9,11 was 3k deaths. There aren't positives about this situation, shit sucks. The media tried to hype up the sars outbreak and the h1n1 bird flu bullshit, but those are a joke compared to rona.

"ShambhalaBuddhism","t5_30ui4","Appeal to authority, or the Fallacy of Expertise. ""I am an expert in X, therefore you should believe what I say about Y"".

Yes, I think that Dr. Cachita really does think like this in real life. It's pretty common for academics to fall victim to their own notions of grandeur, but combine that academic hubris with adherence to a millenarian cult with a private army, armed with a gospel that preaches about the key to ""enlightened society"" and that sees outsiders as inferior or ""setting sun""-- and you've got a potent cauldron of self-deceit, even before you throw in the sexual abuse, coverups, dog torture, Audis and what-not.

And then there's the conceit that growing up under repressive regimes gives one special insight into how to heal from trauma. That's the saddest part here. ""I grew up under a dictatorship, therefore your whining about a little sexual trauma is irrelevant."" 

It is staggeringly sad to know that there are Shambhala people who actually think like that.",1619827262

"networking","t5_2qkaf","done a few of these. iwan was mostly about pfr3 and cli, gui sucked. viptela has an ok gui (vmanage). it does the automation pretty well, that is if you figure out the best way to consolidate your template design to avoid unnecessary overconfiguration. cisco didn‚Äôt change the gui and the concept, just added features that cisco routers could do, like voice, and also got their iosxe to run sdwan. hope to see more integration with dnac and multidomain end-to-end segmentation with sda, it‚Äôs just starting to appear.

your migration should be pretty straightforward especially since you can reuse hardware. you could potentially avoid touching any cabling.

you‚Äôll need to decide if your applications like voice and video need to keep direct site to site traffic path during migration. specifically traffic between new sdwan and old iwan sites. if you do one phase and convert both 4k routers to sdwan, your traffic to other iwan sites will have to take path over the data center. i‚Äôve seen customers who can‚Äôt have that and some who didn‚Äôt care at all. if it‚Äôs a problem, do a 2 phase approach. convert one router first at all sites, and then convert the second router. in between, you can keep iwan router to help with direct site to site path.

also for your data center, you should really get a second pair of routers for the hubs running in parallel to your iwan hubs.

I would love to see this shown in gameplay somehow. Maybe defensive bonuses if they're with another troop squad? 

Also, just to streamline the psychic phase make the troops have a physic buff that they get for the battle and then they don't cast spells. Like combat drugs but psychic version. 

Or. If you want all their units to be spellcasters, let their librarians take spells from other disciplines. Make it a warlord trait or relic so it's not abused but they should be able to cast anything.

I look great in pantyhose. I wear them at work but these are for you today. I ate lots of food so I have a dense and chunky poop that I want to fill up my sheer nude hose with. I know you love how you can see through and see my asshole and pussy through the fabric. I show them off with spread legs and wiggle my toes and wrinkle my soles in your face.

I push it out and you see the poop press and smush against the tights. Once it's pushed out, I squish it by sitting on it and mushing it around a little. I pull off the hose and you see my dirty smeared ass crack and I give it a good wipe with the hose so you can really enjoy all the smells and filth from my shit as well as my lovely scented feet and pussy.",1619827263

"college","t5_2qh3z","The only way I was able to have a life was to barely work. I work on campus (work study front desk job that allows me to do schoolwork on the clock) a couple times a week M-Th for a few hours between classes or whenever I have a gap, and then I work for like 5 hours on Fridays. Money is really tight during times my mom can't help financially, but I really only need money for grocery shopping, a little for leisure (getting pizza w/friends, etc), and some for emergencies or other needs like medication or an Uber. I also relied on leftover loans if I had any available.

Another thing is that I try to have morning classes and end school no later than like 5pm. Sometimes the only class available was once a week in the evening, but in general, I end at a decent time and do schoolwork during gaps or in the evening. I try to make evening times for chilling but I spend a couple hours doing work too. I usually don't go to bed until 11 or 12 and then wake up at 8 for a 9am class.",1619827263

‚Ä¢ In the list of returning casting, Renai Circulation herself is back to voice Kana Hanazawa, that good ;), so I think our fretting over whether or not Yoko Shimomura would be recasted as her were pretty silly in hindsight. 

‚Ä¢ the release date 'october' hmm. I'm not sure what they meant by that.. are they seriously saying that it will be released for the public? Is this what a post Taisha censorship world will be like?

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","GURL, you want advice on how to handle an argument with BF who ""accidentally"" (INTENTIONALLY) threw away your BC?

No, nonono. This argument does not need to be continued for any reason. Despite what he says, he knew what he was doing and did it on purpose because he TOLD YOU he did it but didn't go get it. How is that an ""accident"" then, especially since it all happened within a span of what 30 minutes from when you left to go to the store 5 minutes away and back. That was plenty of time to get it out of the trash.

&gt;I don‚Äôt even get why he would do that because he was the one last week talking about the idea of us having sex, so if he wanted me to be safe and ready that‚Äôs out of the window now. 

This is literally the oldest trick in the ""How to be Abusive 101"" textbook. Chapter 10, ""How to Trap and Prevent your Partner from Leaving you"". He can easily sabotage condoms, so all he needed to do was to get rid of the other option, throw away your BC, and BOOM you're pregnant. 

Why do you think he was upset and started apologizing once you started to pack your things and leave, based off of his previous reactions, 

&gt;He says I shouldn‚Äôt have been careless, and didn‚Äôt even apologize

&gt;He says that now I am an adult, I can figure it out

He thinks since you're 18, you'll appreciate hearing ""you're an adult now"" and will back down and let whatever happens (like the possibility of getting pregnant), happen.

Put him in the same place where your BC is, in the trash and keep it moving.",1619827266

"DentalAssistant","t5_3jubf","You will be fine. Smite and be talkative with patients. When the dentist comes in finish the conversation fast and get ready to start the treatment.

In the beginning you will learn sterilisation of the instruments. Who ever is teaching you will want you to focus and ask questions, write it all down ask if you can take photos or if they have a learning guide. 

You will have to wear mask and gloves and a gown in steri bay, make sure you don't touch clean things with gloves on because if someone walks passed after you put new ones on and didn't see you they will think your cross contaminating, gloves are seen as dirty.

When you put on your ppe its always mask glasses then gloves.

Every dentist is different you need to be able to adjust fast. They all follow a basic guide but they might like only one filling material or use disks instead of polishing cups. It will only be a slight difference but it can change the set up a bit depending on what they want. 

I would youtube different procedures starting with cleans, fillings and extractions these will be the majority of what you will assistant for in the beginning. 

As a tall man you will need to learn to sit in the assistants chair, you will need it low so your not bending your back in a weird way. 
Keep both feet on the floor legs at 90¬∞
Hopefully the belly bar lifts up, lift it up to your belly button (if it goes that high) if not just to the highest setting. You will lean on this to support your back.

When suctioning keep your posture and lean in. You will learn to use the suction in both hands but start with your dominant hand and keep your elbows down and your wrist loose.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","And now we get to why Objectivists are insufferable: They call all other philosophies ""ridiculous and mystical"".

The reason I challenged you to think without borrowing concepts is to prove to you that the limit of your thinking is an intersubjective horizon, meaning it is a horizon determined by how the past ideas have constructed you. Try reflecting on yourself without these communally made meanings. You can't. Your self is constructed through communally made meanings. This isn't to deny there is individuality, just to deny that it looks like egoism.

The only way I can think that you mistook this as ""mystical"" is that you are supposing that I am saying there is an inter-subjective being that hovers above us and determines us. That would be mystical, but luckily I am not saying that. I am just saying that the meanings of words only are coherent when they are made communally, in much the same way a meaningful sport can only be made when communal rules are shared.",1619827267

"blackopscoldwar","t5_2abod4","&gt; Who decides how hard snipers need to be?

I mean, sure, let's let Reddit decide!  Snipers are thus both OP and complete trash at the same time!

More seriously, it's a really tricky thing.  I used to be in video game QA (like years ago; early 2000s), and I remember talking with a buddy who was one of the programming leads for MDK 2 (if you haven't heard of it, no biggie).  That game is *FAMOUSLY* hard to play, and the reason for that is that when they were doing their balance/tuning passes on the game, they were using their QA guys as a benchmark.  (And this was when constant patching/tweaking was possible but not super common.)

Turns out people that play 40+ hours a week of a game, and have been since it started being playable aren't the best people to talk to about difficulty levels.

I'm sure there's something similar there, and I think I agree with you.

When I get one-hit by a shotgun it doesn't really bother me -- well, other than when the Streetsweeper was stupid-broken -- because usually if I know someone's got a shotgun I can keep my distance (though shotguns being *secondary* weapons is a whole OTHER balance discussion).  Sometimes it feels cheap (looking at you, Nuketown -- but everything kills you on that, so whatever), but it doesn't usually feel *unfair*.

But snipers are a different beast; a half-decent sniper can really *wreck* certain maps (like Armada Strike for an example, if you're spawning on the end of the boat and there's a decent sniper in the middle, it's *REALLY* unfun to try to push up.  At least when it's someone with an AK or something, it's theoretically possible to get through and into cover and even if you get killed most of the time it doesn't feel quite as bad.

I guess that's the issue; getting killed by snipers (and the M16/AUG to a lesser extent) it often feels like there isn't really any functional counterplay available.  There often is - throw smoke to cut of sightlines, chuck a stun/explosive (if the angles are right) and so on, but the frustration is when you've got someone who's thrown on a sniper with perk greed.  They're decent with quickscoping, they usually have some combination of tac/flak/paranoia | scavenger/assassin | spycraft/ninja/ghost and that narrows your counterplay option.

The more I think about it, the more I find myself wondering if the talk about 'babying' so-called 'low skill' players *is* one of the design goals - being able to take multiple instal-kill options as your secondary, being able to relatively trivally be immune to tacticals and/or explosives, and so on.

I'm not going to pretend it's *easy* to balance a game like CoD: there are just so many variables that it really doesn't take a huge change to break things sometimes.

But I do feel like snipers are a really polarizing subject.  I'm really curious what the player numbers would be like if for a week 3arc made both **Snipers Only** and **No Snipers** moshpits, and see how populated each playlist is.  I don't think that would happen but I find myself intensely curious as to how it would work out.",1619827267

However, since the gil wasnt ""lost"" and they cant prove you yourself didnt ""steal"" the gil, they wont give it back since its far too easy to abuse otherwise.

Its a case of Disney suing daycare centers with Mickey murals. If you don‚Äôt destroy even innocent use, people with malicious intent can come in and claim your mercy set a precedent. That results in longer cases, so more expensive lawsuits where you are in the moral right. By contrast the small fan teams and daycares can‚Äôt contest it, so you auto-win. Despite looking evil, the public only grumbles and supports you anyway in future work. 

So by doing oppressive jerkass moves to the fans, you can avoid tougher to win and more damaging fights with thieves.",1619827268

"norge","t5_2qh94","Jo alts√• jeg forst√•r det du mener, men jo noen substanser er farligere, og har for de fleste vil ha en ganske stor sjanse for avhengighet. √Ö si ""nesten garantert sjanse"" var kanskje √• ta for hardt i. 

Men la oss si for eksempel, heroin. Heroin er et rusmiddel som har et stort potensiale for avhengighet, selv om noen likevel ikke blir det like raskt. 

"" *When you inject, snort, or smoke heroin, the specialized opioid receptors in the brain and nervous system respond by triggering a potent release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that generates feelings of pleasure or euphoria. Once the brain gets used to the euphoric rush that heroin produces, the user can experience intense cravings for the drug.* "" - [https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/heroin-addiction/faq/addicted-first-time/](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/heroin-addiction/faq/addicted-first-time/)

Noen rusmidler er direkte skadelige for kroppen, blant annet alkohol. Noen har ogs√• ganske mye st√∏rre potensiale for avhengighet. Slik som for eksempel heroin. Heroin trigger dopaminet i hjernen, som er det hjernen bruker for √• l√¶re deg det som er bra, som √• trene, spise mat osv. Hjernen bel√∏nner deg for √• gj√∏re noe riktig. Da vil man jo ogs√• kunne se hvorfor heroin er s√• avhengighetsskapende, da det trigger dopaminsenteret og i grunn forteller kroppen din at den har gjort noe bedre enn faktiske viktige ting i livet. 

Og selvf√∏lgelig, takk! Diskusjoner som omhandler ruspolitikk osv. er noe som raskt fyrer meg opp, jeg f√∏ler at det er noe jeg virkelig klarer √• diskutere med god kunnskap. Og da er det jo ogs√• alltids viktig √• v√¶re √•pne mot litt innspill, og selv et s√• lite argument som det der er nok til √• kanskje kunne tenke litt dypere og muligens innse at man har tenkt litt feil. Og h√•per du leser motsvaret mitt her med litt hum√∏r i √∏yet, har jobbet p√• b√•t med et lite mannskap, s√• har blitt litt glad i √• argumentere ;)

&gt; A powerful suicide truck bombing struck a guest house in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, killing at least 21 people and wounding as many as 91, the Interior Ministry said.

&gt; In Afghanistan, guest houses are lodgings often provided for free by the government, usually for the poor, travellers and students.

&gt; The Taliban, who had demanded that all US troops pull out of Afghanistan by May 1, have not offered any guarantees for the safety of the departing troops.

"ADHD_partners","t5_ko7d1","I'm not sure your whole story so all I will say as someone with a lot of medical conditions and a lot of medications is that sometimes these things do happen even to non ADHD persons. I can absolutely remember a time my non ADHD father gave me WAY too much of a medication for a cold and we actually took me to the hospital for bradycardia and basically being a zombie. I can't remember what they did just that I was at the hospital a while while they made sure I was stable. If you don't want to get rid of your wife's medication privileges/responsibilities you could just put them into a pill container yourself prior to. There are pills with 3 or 4 rows. You can just make sure there are timers for her, and she then just empires out the next container. Keeps her from mixing up bottles. 

A lot of time all you can do in these situations is adapt and overcome. Untill your daughter is old enough to dose herself you're going to have to work with what you've got. 

I'm sorry this happened to you. Medication doesn't fix the issue for most people, and often people need a life coach and an active therapist to be able to make changes and be held accountable. She's unlearning life long habits, and learning to do things in a way she was never able to do before. Which I'm sure you know judging by the preamble of the post. Just a reminder that is might have been a mistake vs an ADHD thing. Those happen to all of us.

PM me if you want more help with pills and organization. I have a condition that causes some really extreme brain fog and forgetfulness and learning to work with that as live alone adult was ROUGH. I basically alternated between dosing and under dosing/forgetting for the first year until I learned the hacks for myself.",1619827270

Still, in today's society, everyone is a little bit bi- whether the realize it or not.  I would also caution this person that simply because a kid may be somewhat Bi- that doesn't mean they would be interested in THEM...  damn... arrogant much?  I wouldnt switch the kid, I would switch the counselor.  The last thing you want to do is make the kid feel odd or singled out... Im sure they feel pretty insecure as is.  So switch the counselor.    
But to have a problem with someone being Bi in today's world??  Man... catch up to reality.",1619827272

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","80% efficacy for the vaccines representing the lions share of our vaccinations and we're on track to have the first doses in 70% of Canadians by around Victoria Day.

However, the herd immunity threshold is proportional to R0 (it's estimated by 1/[1/R0])‚Äîif you cut the spread, you cut the number of vaccines it takes to reach it, and thus the time it takes.

With that in mind, I can see an argument for keeping *most* restrictions in place. There are some low-hanging fruit that you can scale back without much, if any, cost. But it's just like we've seen this whole time: the virus spreads exponentially; anything that's just barely sufficient looks like an overreaction, but if you do too little it makes the following weeks and months even shittier.",1619827272

*****
&gt; A powerful suicide truck bombing struck a guest house in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, killing at least 21 people and wounding as many as 91, the Interior Ministry said.

&gt; In Afghanistan, guest houses are lodgings often provided for free by the government, usually for the poor, travellers and students.

&gt; The Taliban, who had demanded that all US troops pull out of Afghanistan by May 1, have not offered any guarantees for the safety of the departing troops.

The key for me was finding something to replace that warm cozy feeling. I personally found that in community and friendship via AA. I know not everyone likes AA, but it worked for me to have a constant support network to call on and meetings at all hours. 

Someone once told me that sobriety delivers everything alcohol promises. It‚Äôs all about getting to the place where you start to reap those benefits. I‚Äôm now in a place where I wouldn‚Äôt trade my sobriety for anything, but man those early days were excruciating.

"AskGayMen","t5_2wlnp","After reading the last post and this, I think you're on the right track. There's probably nobody out there who hasn't done or said something shitty to someone they care about because of sexual confusion or internalized homophobia, but the fact that you're doing some serious introspection and trying to atone for what you did puts you well ahead of a lot of folks who never confront their past mistakes. Also, the letter was a good idea. It's more difficult to screw up what you're trying to say.

As for R, you very recently stirred up a lot of long buried emotions, and mentioning your feelings for him now would probably be overwhelming, at least in the short term. You should ask yourself what you intend to get out of this. Judging from what I've read, you're the type who overthinks things, so I imagine you've already envisioned every possible scenario and outcome, so what's the ideal ending to this story? 

My biggest concern is you're trying to do a lot of things at once, maybe because you want to make up for all the lost time and you feel like this may be your one chance at happiness, but you seem almost eager to confess your love and enter into a relationship with this guy, when you haven't yet come to grips with your own sexuality. I'm not saying you've got to know yourself completely, but you don't seem to have a handle on it at all. 

My recommendation would be to focus on figuring yourself out a little more. A conversation with a therapist might be in order. Teletherapy would be an easy way to start. You dismissed experimenting with other guys, but I'd say maybe give that a serious try. (I don't think you'll find a shortage of gay guys volunteering to help a straight boy experiment.) It's not unheard of for someone to be solely attracted to one person, but it is *unusual*.

And that brings me to another concern: You say you've been in love with this one person, carrying these feelings around for 10 years; what if after all this, he turns you down? What if you get a similar, if not larger dose of the hurt he felt all those years ago? As an overthinker, I'm sure you've considered this scenario too, but are you prepared to deal with rejection?

I don't speak from pessimism, I would love to see a happy ending between you and R, but you're standing in a minefield and wanting to run. You've taken some small steps already, just don't try to rush things.",1619827274

Is your end game a hook up or a relationship?

I would imagine a relationship would be easier to come by because women will be more apt to see the parts of you that don't rely on beauty--and beauty is very subjective. 

If fitness it your thing, make yourself appealing to active women! Show off your muscles/fit body without being shirtless. Unless you're going for a hookup, of course, then bust put those abs for some sex appeal. 

Know your audience. What kinds of women will find you funny, sexy, and someone that knows how to be adventurous?

Out here in the Mountain West in the US, active lifestyle is a big deal. I could not see myself dating a couch potato. Our lifestyles just wouldn't jive. On Tinder, profiles here almost always include people hiking, biking, and out adventuring with their dogs. The rest of the women I'm simply not interested in if their only photo is a mirror selfie.

If anything, Smash has become negative publicity for the series at this point because uninterested people are tired of the FE oversaturation.

I can think of SMT/Persona and SNK got put on the mainstream map thanks to Smash. Before that, a niche group of fans (For JRPG and Fighting games) followed them, but they weren't known to the extent they are now.

Joker and Terry were barely talked about at all in the speculation scene before they were announced or leaked. Not even as a joke like Cloud or Steve. I wonder if we'll get another wildcard character like those two.

Last but not least, Dragon Quest hasn't been popular in the west for many years. To the point many RPG fans didn't even know it existed.

&gt; A powerful suicide truck bombing struck a guest house in eastern Afghanistan on Friday, killing at least 21 people and wounding as many as 91, the Interior Ministry said.

&gt; In Afghanistan, guest houses are lodgings often provided for free by the government, usually for the poor, travellers and students.

&gt; The Taliban, who had demanded that all US troops pull out of Afghanistan by May 1, have not offered any guarantees for the safety of the departing troops.

The idea being that, in my interpretation anyway, capitalism can't help itself and courts its own demise. It will turn anything and everything into a commodity, including criticism of itself and tools that can take it down. There is a danger in it tho, because when it comes to criticism it will tend to water it down until it's indistinguishable from actual anti-capitalist movements and rhetoric, but looks close enough to be gratifying as a story.",1619827277

Then I hit the wall in osrs 2k total encroaching 2.1k.  I was bored with nothing to do since I play pretty much solo because all my irl friends are low level.  I decided to load up RS3 and give it a shot on a new account.

The game is good. It's really good. I'm having tons of fun exploring areas that are familiar and yet new, the music is spectacular, the shifts in times of day depending on where you are in the world are really cool. The combat, once I figured out some of the good rotations and how to set up my bars properly is a lot of fun. The skills actually feel useful and unique, each playing into each other and they feel like I'm leveling them for a reason rather than just to level them.

Those could've been for fun. This may sound unbelievable, but it makes sense once you realize that the Slayer has many other feats putting him at WAY above tentacle-level or glass window-level or struggling to break through chains-level. For example, in the DLC, we fight giant tentacles via normal means. Both lore and Hugo Martin himself said that the Slayer killed a Titan which is about a kilometer tall (Hugo clarifies that he used his ""bare hands and weapons""). We also launch ourselves at high speeds into walls and emerge unscathed. We also punch maglev trains across the tracks casually. We also knock over the gladiator demon with a punch and send him flying back a bit. We also obliterate the head of the cyberdemon, which would still be impressive EVEN IF it wasn't nuke level (it is).

But it hasn't been taken over by Instagram ""influencers"" looking for an easy photo op. It hasn't been co-opted by big corps looking for a buzzword to repackage and re-sell existing products (ahem, bikepacking and ""gravel"" cycling) at a markup. Even the most audacious bike tour will only earn you 15 seconds of fame in a hometown newspaper.

I sign my name in a neat little ribbon that takes me less than two seconds and that is distinctly mine to anyone who knows my signature. It's easier on the support staff too, since they're the only ones who need to see my signature with any regularity.",1619827281

Different municipal water companies will have different levels of other chemicals we do not check. But too little or too much can effect plants and fish, until they get used to the changes.

Some older houses have copper pipes. After a number of decades these pipes can leach trace amounts of copper. Some sources of water might have lead, or different amounts of magnesium or manganese. Phosphate and other stuff.

Even just being in a different part of the same town can have different levels of various chemical.

"biotech","t5_2qyja","Very broad field, a natural progression of what you‚Äôve described which is basically just regular medical molecular biology.

If you don‚Äôt know who George church is, or jay keasling or Chris voigt or Pamela silver you‚Äôre living under a rock.

Jay keasling does amazing stuff with yeast, he was heavily involved in Amyris a company that was accelerated by a deal with Sanofi to produce artemisinin in yeast at commercial scale to remove reliance on Chinese imports. They did it, it got to scale was still more expensive but was a successful proof of concept. Now Amyris makes beauty product high value molecules if I read correctly.

Pam silver recoded a salmonella tiphimurium genome. The entire genome lacks a specific leucine codon freeing up that codon for non natural amino acids (fluorescent or magnetic or whatever).

There‚Äôs a woman at duke van eaneam who has replaced the polled gene, which is genetically linked to milk production, with a cas9 casette for the endogenous locus. This means a heterozygous cow will create a double strand break and the HDR system will replace the polled gene in the wt version of the chromosome with the cas9 construct. This non Mendelian inheritance of ko v wt crosses always giving homozygous ko‚Äôs is called a gene drive.

Chris voigt designs genetic logic circuits. These mean everything. With an AND operator (eg a chaperone and a transcription factor being conditionally expressed so the resulting expression of both, but not individually of either component generates an output signal) you can make programs like oscillators and thresholds that have many fantastic uses from medicine to agriculture.

There are tons of spin out companies making stuff like recombinant yeast derived spider silk, there are labs engineering Cyanobacterial carbon concentration mechanisms into plants and algae there are people building a human designed genome based on yeast called yeast 2.0 there are people out there making the smallest functional bacterial genome possible called jcvi 3.0 there are people making cells that are can decontaminate soil.
Jeez there are about a million things out there but all you see on /r/biotech is ‚Äúbiotech is vaccines‚Äù or ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt choose between biomed and bioscience‚Äù. But the real thing that made me unsubscribe was reading, in 2021, the acronym RFLP. My god.",1619827282

It‚Äôs literally what are you going to be doing everyday. What are you going to do on tough days to stay on track. Google game plan. It‚Äôs a plan of attack. So it all depends on where you are at. If you haven‚Äôt read start there. If you still don‚Äôt get it read again. Decide what techniques all of it. It‚Äôs different for everyone but if you read his post he told you what he did. 

There is no magic phrase or affirmation. Stop looking for shortcuts and do the work. Once he stopped doing what you are and really went for it he got it in nine days. 

Figure out what works for you. Build your belief. Read. He said all of that yet you ask this question. He also said he ain‚Äôt answering questions yet you guys are all asking him questions. Stay focused do the work. Read. Try it build your belief get a game plan that‚Äôs for you. If you don‚Äôt put in the effort then you can‚Äôt get the results. If we figured it out you can too. Stop asking the same questions 20 different ways and just go for it. Intend to get it right and you will. Your lack of faith is what keeps you from taking a leap of faith. Until you jump and believe it can‚Äôt happen. It‚Äôs all belief. If you do believe you can go there in imagination and have it now. Imagination is realty not the 3 d. 3D is a shadow. An after effect. Live in imagination 

Also from what you are asking it‚Äôs clear you don‚Äôt get how this works or are confused. Reread or read if you haven‚Äôt. It‚Äôs crucial to this. If you don‚Äôt read it won‚Äôt make sense and it won‚Äôt happen. Please please read the damn books guys.",1619827282

They truly believe in the systems they are tasked with governing and don‚Äôt want to dismantle them like regressive conservatives like Rand Paul and McConnell. That means they‚Äôll at LEAST allow progress when it is economically viable for them to do so. But that‚Äôs as far right wing as I see as non-fascist right now. The current Republican Party is a fascist one. The current Democratic Party is what Republicans thought they were in the 90‚Äôs: fiscal conservatives, social liberals.

Authoritarian communists (like those in China, even though they also operate like a capitalist country but that‚Äôs an entirely different conversation) are fascist as well as right wing authoritarians. 

I think you‚Äôre not understanding the whole ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù aspect of fascism that I am 100% against. 

Do you care to walk back anything? Or at the very least chill out and stop assuming so much?",1619827283

"pharmacy","t5_2qjl3","I don‚Äôt work at Walgreens so I don‚Äôt know if they actually have a corporate policy on this, but I have disposed oxycodone for a patient on buprenorphine (it was a different prescriber and the patient did not alert the oxycodone prescriber in the ER that she was on buprenorphine), but we were able to call the buprenorphine prescriber and agreed 
to dispense the oxycodone with their permission. The prescriber also asked us NOT to tell the patient that the oxycodone may not work as well as it usually would because she‚Äôs on the bup. Ultimately we decided that it would be riskier for the patient to stop the bup while on oxycodone and then restart the bup. 

We did get a call from the patients insurance company about 2 months later and they asked us to justify why we dispensed both medications, but I kept a long note in her file for that. As for the results of this audit I don‚Äôt know, and if they can claw back money from the pharmacy or whatever. 

As for helping your patient, maybe try finding another pharmacy and explain to the pharmacist before sending in the prescription that the PT is on the buprenorphine and see if they‚Äôre open to dispensing.",1619827283

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I think the physical aspects have been addressed, but I wanted to add an opinion on the conversation. I disagree that ex‚Äôs are a topic to be left off the table. If you really want a relationship with someone, you can‚Äôt have secrets. You choosing not to be honest and keeping secrets created far more distrust than anything you could have said if you had answered honestly. You showed that you do not trust her and fostered a sense that she cannot trust you. As a woman, I cannot be vulnerable physically if I do not feel safe emotionally. I empathize with her desire to extricate herself physically from you if you were being evasive, secretive and dishonest over a topic that you brought up. Was her reaction extreme? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt know her past. Personally, I‚Äôve been cheated on by a partner who chose to reignite a relationship with an ex. It‚Äôs a trigger to me. But again, that‚Äôs not the point I‚Äôm trying to make. I‚Äôm saying that if you want a relationship with her long term, you need to learn to be honest, to trust her with your past and to trust that she is strong enough and mature enough emotionally to handle the truth. And if she is going to build any part of her life with you, she has a right to the truth.",1619827283

Eren destroyed 80% of the world, and just destroying the the world allied fleet would have sent all the countries in the world into an economic collapse, which mean no more means to fund your armies, and now, we know that Eren destroyed way more than that, he destroyed the fleet, infrasctructre, environment, wildlife, etc. 80% of the world gone, and if we go by the logic of our world that means that the economic trade of the rmeianing nations is fucked since there are now lack of resources and lots of mouths to feed with all of the refugees from the destroyed countries.

So waging war against Paradis when there are is such a lack o resources is a waste of time and of resources, so Ere bought them at least decades worth of time.

Not to mention, that the remaining nations chose Armin and the alliance as the peace ambassadors to Paradis Island, so that means that they respect them just like they did wih the Tyrbus and that they do not which to wage war against Paradis.

The only problem are the Yeagerists that are afraid of retaliatin from the outside world even though the outisde world doesn't want to wage war.

The Alliance trust Historia since she proected their famileis which means that there is hope for peace, even if it is an open ending.

Also thanks to Eren and Mikasa, the power of the titans no longer exists, which means that Armin won't die in less of a decade because of a curse and that Historia and all the other Paradisians won't have to sacrifice their children every 13 years in order to keep the por of the titans.

Even if Eren had compleed the full rumbling, there would have still be the power of the titans back on Paradis and people would have fought for it just like in great Titan War 100 years ago.

So in the end, Ereb made sure that the world can't invade Paradis for at least decades and made sure that Armin and his friends are in a position or status of respect which allows the to try to make peace with Paradis and thr world.

And the power of the titans is gone which means that Eldians won't have to sacrifice their children in order to keep their powers.",1619827284

Do you understand what a deduction is? I don't think you do.  A deduction can reduce your taxable amount that you ultimately pay income taxes on.  FICA etc are unaffected.

FWIW, there are very few Uber markets that pay over $0.60/mile.  Many major cities do, but then they pay almost nothing for time.  Uber goes to great pains to hide this amount.  I can't even find it in the driver app.",1619827284

But there is also a significant difference between stargazing in a cold, northern country versus a desert. I‚Äôve been doing astrophotography for years now, and I‚Äôve just had the most consistency in the American southwest and Australian outback. I‚Äôve also done it in Alaska (quite similar to Iceland or Finland), the Appalachian mountains, and Maine, which was a lot more difficult.

The mountains and forests make getting to truly remote places more difficult, and the weather and moisture is far less consistent. 

I‚Äôm not saying that you can‚Äôt get a good view of the galaxy in Europe, but it is the most dense and urban continent... you guys just don‚Äôt have the same level of access to the beautiful night sky as the rest of the world.

Which is why I always recommend a vacation to the American SW or Australia.

sorry if i overexplained lol, i wasnt sure if i was making a very good point. wearing something nice and smelling nice should definitely be part of it, but why not make her feel extra special with other stuff too :) if you want extra points, incorporate something she really loves, and EXTRA extra points if its some really subtle things or if it was from a while ago. girls seeing that you pay attention always makes them feel rlly special :)

That is, just immerse themselves in friendships with women they aren't interested in dating, just to get used to how women are as plain old people.  That way, when they are faced with a true ""prospect"" they're not all nervous and not knowing what to do/say and so on.

Likely she's always had this problem, like back when she tormented your MIL as a child. Only nobody got her the help she needed.  No excuses. She has some kind of mental problem. 

It's unfortunate that FIL wants to brand your entire family as trash (unless there is more we don't know?) when your mom is the only problem.
I'd personally have a problem with that, unless you have been very vocal trying to excuse your mom's behavior around your fiance and his parents. In which case you can apologize that your mom acted crazy after you uninvited her to the wedding.

You might feel sorry for her, but you need to hold her accountable for her behavior and not excuse it.

I have to wonder if you and your fiance can survive all the history and abuse between these women.
FIL's comment doesn't sound promising.
Wishing you some good luck navigating this fiasco.

"bloodpressure","t5_2w7ge","Your BP decrease was probably the med. They work pretty fast, in a matter of days. Typically BP will drop a little bit more each day right after you start the med and then level out within 1-2 weeks or so. 

I‚Äôm not a doctor, and this is not medical advice, but I want to share my experience. I was on Losartan HCTZ for my BP. HCTZ is a diuretic. I was put on it in early Jan 2021, and I wanted to make lifestyle changes to get back off of it as soon as I could. I‚Äôve changed my diet, am exercising, and losing weight. My BP started around 150/90 and got down to 90/60 on meds. 

From my limited understanding, diuretics reduce BP by making you pee out water and sodium, and thus lowering your blood volume. But there are lots of BP meds that aren‚Äôt diuretics. You really only have to take a diuretic if you have conditions like heart failure or kidney failure, where your body causes serious water retention. 

Why all this text??  Based on my lifestyle changes, doc took me off of the HCTZ. IT WAS MISERABLE. Google ‚Äúrebound water retention from stopping diuretic‚Äù (or something similar).  The diuretic makes you pee out water and sodium, and when you stop taking it, all the water comes back FAST. I was told to expect a at least a pound a day of water weight to come back for the first week. And YEP 1-1.5 lb higher on the scale every day. You gain back the water the diuretic took off originally, plus MORE water than that (the rebound). It takes around three - four weeks to gain all the rebound water, then lose some of the excess rebound water, and then for your body to regulate back to the water equilibrium you had before starting the diuretic. You will likely end up at a higher weight at the end because your body will go back to holding the water it did before you started the diuretic. I hated going through this process when I was trying to lose weight. It was just annoying. 

Anyway, please, please consult your doctor and do not stop taking any meds!! But if you can take a different BP med, or stop altogether, you can get the fun rebound water retention over with. I‚Äôm really glad I‚Äôm done with it now, and I know that none of the weight I‚Äôve lost at this point is simply water that was taken off by the diuretic.

Best of luck, and great job making lifestyle changes!!",1619827287

Caci was great, they explained everything to me and took their time answering my questions. They also have affordable payment plans.

I recommend a chain like Caci, rather than smaller stores. It may not be true of all stores but chains are more likely to have better H&amp;S management and training for their staff.

I have very pale skin and dark,thick hair, so my results have been great. It really depends on the person, but Caci will assess you and give you an indication of how successful they think it will be for you. They were also super sensitive during my assessment (I'm quite self conscious) and weren't pushy at all.

I will say that it can definitely be painful. I'm getting my face and neck done, which are both really sensitive areas (compared to somewhere like legs). My technician is so skilled, she can complete my treatments very quickly, so it's really only seconds worth of pain.

LSD comes on in about 45 minutes for me. When it starts to come on I turn off the music and my phone. I want no intrusions. I then STOP thinking.  Listen to your breathing and learn to just be. It can last a long time so have 48 hours free.

people act like having trauma will break you. it will. but you will emerge stronger from the process. you are not broken forever, like nothing in nature is broken forever. we heal. how you approach the process makes all the difference. 

its going to be scary and hard and awful- it already is. in that way, theres nothing to lose. the disaster is going to happen, but you can be prepared. you can choose to acknowledge what you know and not try to cover it up from yourself, even when the knowing is only emotion and fear, rather than fact. people around you probably wont understand or know what to say. your journey isnt about them.

like, you have to take the journey no matter what. if you take time, rest, take care of your body, and dive into the root issues, the stress will lessen. you dont want to take it unprepared. facing what is happening with as much strength as possible will be so helpful to you.

its awful to realize how people have treated us and to feel so broken inside. but the transformation happens by owning it. by learning to give ourselves the compassion we weren't offered. you can do it. you probably are hella strong and that strength will help you in facing this. what we can't see always makes us the most afraid. no matter how awful it is, its easier to deal with it in the light.",1619827290

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was in college, I lived at home and would just drive in for my classes; I always made sure to arrive super early because parking was difficult and also I‚Äôm a freak and needed to get to class early to sit in the same exact seat every time. So I‚Äôd be sitting in my car for at least 30-45 minutes before it was time to walk to whatever building I was going to first. The first time this happened was before an early evening class‚ÄîI want to say it started around 6:00, and it was the only class I had on Tuesdays and Thursdays. So I arrive around 5:00 or a few minutes prior and park, and am just studying and minding my own business. I suppose I should specify that I went to the University of New Orleans, which is basically smack dab in the middle of a neighborhood and accessible to literally anyone. Anyway, I noticed a red truck entering the parking lot (which was fairly empty), and strangely it approached the space in front of me and backed in. There were many other places to park where such a maneuver wouldn‚Äôt have been necessary, but this dude backed in right in front of me, so that the ass end of his truck was a couple feet away from the front of my car. I definitely thought it was weird, and I‚Äôm a suspicious person by nature so I totally had my eye on this dude. After a few minutes I see him start wiggling around in the cab of the truck, almost like he was changing clothes or something. This goes on for a few minutes, and then I see the driver‚Äôs side door pop open. I don‚Äôt know what I was expecting, but I can damn sure promise I didn‚Äôt expect to see what I saw, which was a fully grown man crawling out of that truck wearing nothing but a diaper, with a pacifier in his mouth. I was so stunned all I could do was stare. Dude walked around to the back of the truck, literal FEET away from me, opened the tailgate, hopped inside, and proceeded to fetch another diaper from one of those toolbox things you sometimes see in the back of trucks. He returned to the cab of the truck, put the fresh diaper inside it, and began to like open it and smooth it out the way you do when you‚Äôre fixing to change a baby. At that point I decided it was time to get the fuck out of there. I think I may have skipped class entirely that night because of Diaper Boy. And although this was my first encounter with this fucking creep, it wasn‚Äôt my last. I‚Äôll tell more if anyone is interested.",1619827290

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt;&gt;Though it‚Äôs not completely clear who perpetrated the biological warfare attack, documentary evidence points to Trent as the probable culprit. As detailed in Fenn‚Äôs 2000 article, the trader later submitted an invoice to the British military for purchasing two blankets and a silk handkerchief

It seems to have been done by one militia captain, Trent, on his own.   And it's also not clear that the attempt *worked*.  Smallpox was already circulating, and the blankets had not been freshly exposed.

&gt;&gt; ‚ÄúThere is no evidence that the scheme worked,‚Äù Ranlet says. ‚ÄúThe infection on the blankets was apparently old, so no one could catch smallpox from the blankets. Besides, the Indians just had smallpox‚Äîthe smallpox that reached Fort Pitt had come from Indians‚Äîand anyone susceptible to smallpox had already had it.‚Äù

As the article goes on to say, even if the smallpox scheme didn't work, it was still emblematic of a larger program of brutality.   The question for me is whether we have grounds to call this *genocide*.",1619827292

Who do you think report the statistics? So now it's okay to lie about the number of cases? If the medias can lie so easily what makes you think hospitals can't? This is deeply troubling and unethical considering general population is fed lies and this whole pandemic is being pushed by medias, not the medical 'examiners'. If medias were not making everyone panic that much we could actually have an open discussion but any dissident opinion is automatically suppressed. Questioning is not allowed. What do we end up with? Rushed vaccines that are not FDA approved and if you question it you are cancelled by the system. See r/covidvaccinated if you want to know how safe and successful these vaccines are. So successful that people are dying from them.

Also you ask where did they claim he died of COVID? It's right in the title of the article.  The primary cause of hospitalization was the car crash not covid. Then he died one week later and the death was ruled as covid. And massive lol at the death certificate. You want me to contact the family of the deceased person and ask for their death certificate?

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","I haven't felt that a client should ever fire us as an MSP before, but I did have something similar with my last company. The last company I was with would upsell products with a 20% markup. Basically they would buy it on Amazon, or any other retailer, and then just charge 1.2x the price. 

I questioned this practice with the owner, and his argument was that ""Well they have 30 days to pay the bill, it's basically like they have the product on credit! We can't charge for that?"" I gave a rebuttal of ""So you don't think any of our clients have a credit card?"" and there was no response to that. 

From then on I would basically steer companies away from buying products through us. I would say ""Yeah you need a new HDMI to VGA adapter. We can order one for you OR you might be able to find one pretty cheap on Amazon or something..."" The client would kind of get the hint and then I would then help the customer buy the right one.

https://support.torproject.org/censorship/what-is-snowflake/  
         
Snowflake is a pluggable transport in Tor Browser Alpha. The Snowflake extension is not the Snowflake pluggable transport. A Firefox or Chrome user can install the Snowflake extension to be a volunteer proxy for Tor Browser Alpha users connecting with the Snowflake pluggable transport.  
             
Unlike Tor Browser, Tor Browser Alpha has the built-in Snowflake pluggable transport. Tor Browser Alpha users can use the Snowflake pluggable transport to connect to the Tor network if they are connecting from a country that blocks or monitors connections to the Tor network. 
             
""Snowflake is a [pluggable transport](https://tb-manual.torproject.org/circumvention/) available in Tor Browser to defeat internet censorship. Like a Tor bridge, a user can access the open internet when even regular Tor connections are censored. To use Snowflake is as easy as to switch to a new bridge configuration in Tor Browser."":

&gt;isnt adding extensions and addons to Tor dangerous?  
               
The Tor Project  strongly discourages installing new add-ons in Tor Browser, ""because they can compromise your privacy and security."":  
            
https://support.torproject.org/tbb/tbb-14/  
                 
""If your internet access is not censored, you should consider installing the Snowflake extension to help users in censored networks."" A user can install the Snowflake extension on the Firefox browser or the Chrome browser if the user's internet access is not censored. The Firefox or Chrome browser with the Snowflake extension installed will be a volunteer proxy for connections from Tor Browsers using the Snowflake pluggable transport to circumvent blocking or censorship:

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I think a good way to make a character is to start with class then choose a fitting race.

If you want to be on the front lines of battle, but aren‚Äôt confident taking the lead in social situations maybe a barbarian is a good choice. 

From there, you assess the needs of your class. Barbarians rely on strength to smack things and constitution for AC and HP, so a mountain dwarf, which get bonuses to both, would be a good choice. However, if you have a different image in your mind another race would also be fine. 

From there the question becomes who this person is, what‚Äôs your background and how does that fit into/shape your personality. There is really no right choice here, just read through and decide on something that‚Äôs fun. 

The main thing to bring to the character creation session is an answer to the ‚Äúwhat do I want to do‚Äù question.",1619827293

"RPGdesign","t5_31cnk","I think in order to hit your theme goals, you should consider lowering your player lethality, while leaning more into wounds, scars, disfigurement, trauma, etc.

In terms of ""fighting against overwhelming odds"", it's going to feel a lot more impactful if players come out the other side in shit condition. D&amp;D style ""sleep for a night and you're fully recharged"" doesn't really give the feeling of an intense and traumatizing knock down drag out fight. And relying too much on HP reduces the visceral feeling of combat. Being at half HP doesn't feel as meaningful as having a broken leg and an arrow in your shoulder.

But you also don't need to jump straight to death. In fact if you're going for grim and gritty, I would delay death as long as possible. Death should feel like a release after everything your players endure. Especially if you're taking inspiration from Berserk, where the main character is covered in scars, missing an eye, a hand, and has a prematurely gray streak in his hair (not to mention everything he has psychologically).

I think it's worth looking at systems like Blades in the Dark, where the damage you take  (emotionally and physically) is much more relevant than the threat of death.",1619827295

3. ""Rural"" corporate is a gold mine.
4. Fuck yeah, Im rich bitch!
5. Dont try to. In my opinion private practice is unfortunately a dying breed. We are turning into pharmacy. I do medical optometry in corporate with no problems. Corporate is always deemed as evil. Its the dont give a shit lame docs that give it a bad rep. I have never once been told how to practice in three years of corporate. At the private practices ive contractor for, usually get told what to do once a week. I only practice standard of care, have legit been told by two private practices to dilate less...
6. Hell yea. Lumps and bumps and lasers baby. Service fees are gonna skyrocket!
7. All garbage. All decrease a doctors motivation to give good care. They can all go to hell.
8. Facing good optometrists? Re-writing the mistakes of decades of shit ODs. Half of my day is explaining missed conditions or educating on all the things a dilated eye exam can reveal.

Short answer, you cant.

Long answer, the US is EXTREMELY strict on who they let in. Ill rundown your options, under the assumption that you have money (despite what you said about having no money).

You have your option of the work visa. You need to prove that the job youre taking is one other US citizens cant do. This is EXTREMELY specialized and takes not only years of university but also years upon years of job experience. The job needs to sponser you, and a lot wont since its easier and cheaper just to hire student visas.

You have your Student visas, which you end up needing most of the money upfront. I don't need to explain more as I doubt you have 20k sitting around.

You then, have your fiance/marriage visas. Not an option unless you have a binational partner. Its the easiest and cheapest option, that being said its still a pricy, exhausting proccess I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy. Ive been separated from my Us fiance for a year now, beginning a proccess that takes 435 days to even be together
I cant work/drive for a year after im granted a k1 visa
And the proccess itself can range from 3000-4000$ This option is NOT one to do just because you want to enter. That is fraud.

Personally, I see GME as an investment with the absolute highest possibility of return, and basically the lowest risk. 

While it is obviously volatile and heavily manipulated, find me another stock (or coin) that has the amount of DD and evidence that GME has.

If somehow the squeeze doesn't happen (extremely unlikely IMO), the fundamentals and transformation alone will deliver the same returns that my crypto portfolio likely would have. 

Being honest, the only thing I miss is the evening and weekend entertainment from watching my crypto portfolio bounce around like a ping pong ball. I guess I'll just have to play with my kids on the weekends...

1. Before the auction
2. Under the hammer
3. After the auction

Phase 3 is very similar to a normal sale by negotiation, so the benefit of an auction process is creating the first two. With sales before an auction, the threat of a competitive bidding situation compels serious buyers to offer their top dollar and minimal conditions - and can lead to a better price than under the hammer, especially if it turns out that buyer was the only one serious enough to pay that price.",1619827297

We both enjoy this game and she's been hinting she'd like to do this with all the subtlety of Zenos' bloodlust, and we're coming up on our anniversary next month.  And since we'd like to invite our FC and they like to have a calendar for upcoming events, knowing the details of scheduling is important:

1.) I'm seeing that I can set the date two weeks in advance.  Since reservations open up on Friday, does that mean that, say, on the 7th next week, that what opens up is the 16th-22nd? The 11th through the 17th?

2.) I'm seeing that the hours that reservations become available are...uncomfortably early.  But you know what?  We've been married almost 12 years and she's worth getting up absurdly early for this.  But do we both need to be logged on to make the reservation, or just one of us?

3.) I know there's a quest that we need to do before we can make reservations that involves travelling gd everywhere.  Can we go around, /pray everywhere, and then just leave it at that until it's time to do reservations?

Thanks in advance.  I've been trying to find answers, but I can't seem to find it spelled out anywhere.",1619827297

This is why he doesn‚Äôt feature on CNBC.. It‚Äôs not because of his views on gold or government. It‚Äôs his piss poor performance. However, In comparison to ARK‚Äôs growth fund (which I hate) Cathie Wood seems to feature every second day pumping her funds. 

It‚Äôs the management fees that Shift is great at turning over and to cap it off his draw downs are huge considering the long term gain. -30% drawdown with a 3-5% return average return.. Like I said above, it‚Äôs not views on gold and the US dollar but his funds performance.

At the end of the day it‚Äôs all paper US dollars. I‚Äôd prefer my beautiful family and hard work saved in Gold and Silver then this speculative crap. This is the WSS movement. ü™ôü¶çü™ô

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","I ise qiqi alot shes a solid healer best artifact option is 2 pc gladiator 2 maiden. Im assuming shes taking a healing role which she is an utter tank. Her ability to apply cryo isnt the greatest nor does she have good energy regen. Do with this in mind

Id do childe main dps - can readily applies hydro decent dps but does require alot of resources to geow properly

Ninguang nuke/burst 


Xinyan - support if possible sacrificial greatsword is good + does improver her energy regen and can increase her pyro application period. Her shield is just a little bonus and shouldn't be a focus when build8ng her especially as you have qiqi whos raw healing ability is the best. Note i love xinyan but she is outclassed by alot of similar characters.  It based on ehat you have id reckon shed do pretty decent 


With qiqi and xinyan  you should be able to get regular reactions


However while xinyan has decent energy regen she is out classed by sucrose significantly in this aspect. So if youd rather a higher energy regen id use sucrose


Remember to alter teams for each chamber

Chamber 1 building teams around defeating cry and another for pyro

Chamber 2/3 
-xinyan will be stronger in floor 2 and weaker in floor 3",1619827300

I don't know the laws of all countries, but I know that in Canada, the written word intended only for the eyes of the creator is not illegal. The United States is even less strict.

I appreciate your open-mindedness.

&gt; yes. its worth it. if even one child is saved from being hurt. i think it the filter needs to be looked at in the opposite manor.

I generally think that the default position should always be the one of the most freedom, and restrictions applied only as necessary. But where the balance of freedom versus safety lies is subjective, and I accept your position as valid, even though I would decide differently.

I would ask you to consider though the possibility that sociopaths and sadists are affected similarly by violent media, as pedophiles are by sexual media, and whether this would justify regulating violent media as well. In other words, let's say playing Grand Theft Auto made certain violence-predisposed individuals more likely to hurt people. Should Grand Theft Auto be banned? I'm not arguing against your position, just asking you to consider it.

Unfortunately, regardless of Latitude's intentions and whether they're right or not, I do not believe it is fundamentally possible to achieve the goal of blocking this kind of content without crippling the program, because it's free-form text.

"BackyardOrchard","t5_2xuc5","For more information I'm in zone 8 in BC (Canada), and the plant is two years old, which I recently bought from the nursery.

It had yellow leaves after transplanting, so I assumed it was transplant shock. 

It kept staying yellow for a week so I thought it might have been nitrogen/nutrient deficiency.

After applying a fertilizer it was still was yellow so I thought it might be micronutrients and applied a micronutrient mix. I spilled a lot of micronutrient solution inside the container but I left it there hoping it wouldn't matter too much. After, the plant starting growing black and leaves recently started falling off (pictures). This looked very clearly like boron toxicity based on pictures from the internet.

I cut of the damaged growth and flushed the plant many times, so hopefully I can save it. However, it still leaves the original problem of the yellow leaves, which was the original issue. Any advice would be great to make my mandarin happy.",1619827301

"synology","t5_2s4co","hello - 

this is the problem of not owning enough equipment to troubleshoot properly.  If I was there, and I had the gear that you had, I could not be of any more assistance.  You take a USB dock or thunderbolt dock, and spin this drive up on a local computer and format it.  Does it work?  Does it not work ?   Who knows - but you don't have a drive dock - you only have your expansion chassis and you are getting failure after failure.  ""It must be bad drives"" - well - maybe it's the Synology.  You won't know until you try these ""bad drives"" in other hardware (Win 10 PC, drive dock, etc.).  If you don't have access to this, then you will remain in this dilemma.   I love EXOS drives - they need to be tested in another system - even if it's a cheap drive dock. If it works in the drive dock, and not in the expansion chassis - then it's the Synology expansion chassis. 

From your description - it ""sounds"" like it's the expansion chassis - but how would I know.  You have to try these drives in another enclosure.  ""Well - I don't have another enclosure"" - well, do you expect Synology to replace ""defective hardware"" - when it might be your drives ? 

And if you placed them in a USB enclosure and they won't read as well in macOS Big Sur or Ubuntu - then it's YOUR DEALER - he received a batch of defective drives.  Seagate will give you a 5 year warranty - but you keep going back to the SAME DEALER who bought a BIG batch of drives to keep his prices low, and they are ALL DEFECTIVE.  Try another dealer.

You can buy crypto on around exchange much as binance or coinbase or apparently cash app too. I would advise you buy xlm since it has really low fees compared to bitcoin or ethereum. After you buy the crypto on one of these exchanges you need to withdraw it to gate.io. You have to click on withdraw/send on your exchange and deposit on gate.io. you copy the deposit info and paste it where they asked. After that you send the crypto and wait a few minutes until it's done possessing. After it processes, you locate it on gate.io and then trade it to usdt. You will then use the usdt you gained to buy shib from gate.io. just search for shib in the search bar and trade it. 

Be warned though that if you want to withdraw your earnings you need to complete kyc verification which requires your ID and the withdrawal fee for if you want to transfer the coins into a wallet was around 10million Shib last time I checked. It still seems cheaper than the gas frees from the uniswap and wallet method and is less shady than the hotbit method. 

I have a referral link for gate.io that gives you 10% of my commission fees whenever I made a trade and 30% to me whenever you make a trade. I'll leave it below incase you want to use it. I didn't use a referral link on my signuo because I didn't realize it was mutually beneficial.

 Playing with no HUD and maximum survival settings cranked up, and with the rebel presence enabled to give some activity across the landscape,it‚Äôs almost like an action hiking simulator.

 I play using no map, and only allowing myself to look at the map when I‚Äôm standing in front of one in the world or on a computer screen. So it really takes the feeling of exploring and traversing long distances to another level. Using my binoculars and compass to make my way. All foot travel. The world seems more mysterious and massive and open when you cant just look at the map constantly and just run from base to base.

"SpaceXLounge","t5_3eye9","&gt; Yes but these vehicles are usually space probes massing perhaps 100 Kg not 100,000 Kg 

The Dawn spacecraft and most ion propelled probes I'm aware of are more in the ballpark of 1 - 1.5 metric tons not 100kg.  So the discrepancy is more like 100x not 1000x.

&gt; So the same engine would produce 10,000 times less acceleration on Starship 

If you have 1000x the mass with the same force you get 1/1000th the acceleration, it's a linear relationship dude.  But like I already said it's more like **100x** the mass and **1/100th** the acceleration if you used the same propulsion system.

**But why would you use the same engine?**  You'd **obviously** use a scaled up engine *(there are active research efforts to produce such scaled up ion engines)* and you'd also probably be using many of them.

&gt; An ion engine could not lift off the ground 

That's why you put it in space for cheap with Starship.

&gt; so can only work in space where there is no resistance to motion. 

Yes.

So if you start with slow easy strokes, that is going to bring the average down for a bit. Start strong and then fall into your base pase, rather than work up to your base pase.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Those people have debts. Gambling, prostitutes, expensive cars, apartments etc.

They don't get money and then spend it. They spend it first and then sweat about fucking up their credit score which would make them lose their security clearance and lose their job (and probably their home, spouse divorce them etc).

So this Russian guy comes along and you sell them seemingly harmless information ""just this once"". You rack up more debt and the Russian guy comes along again with a stack of money. Repeat on-off over years and the amount of ""harmless information"" quickly adds up. Over time they demand more juicy stuff for the money.

This happened several times. The US really sucks at monitoring the finances/behavior of their intelligence community employees. Like the recent secret service having parties with hookers stuff or FBI agents dancing drunk with a loaded gun in their pants... that shit happens all the time and if it doesn't make the news nothing will be done about it.

Compare that to Russia/KGB where a single wrong comment during lunch or having the wrong kind of books at home could tank your career and the careers of your entire family. They would spy on their own spies with the ""trust but verify"" attitude and everyone knew that there might be several teams spying on each other at all times.

Mostly because FBI and others needs warrants etc. to do counterintelligence work. Background checks are quite lousy if you have a common name and moved around a lot.",1619827306

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I have taken a look and explored many spaces on the online sphere regarding dating politics. Obviously the blue pill growing up in american society, being exposed to the red pill in high school, and as of recent, the explosion of MGTOW and FDS seems to be picking up a lot too. I think all of the different spheres have something interesting you can learn from. A different, unique perspective that you can apply in the context of your own life. 

I like that the FDS sphere is a space only for women and what they are seeking makes sense. Don't settle for anyone less than what you find suitable and just live your best life. That's mostly what i picked up after reading through some of their posts and peering through their handbook, it's very sound advice and I think it's something many young women should take a look into and of course take whatever advice they want from it. There are hints of misandry sprinkled there, but it is certainly not as bad as people make it out to be, and it is usually directed towards a very specific subset of men. 

Overall, I think FDS is pretty alright and people in general have painted that sphere in a negative light, but when you actually visit the sub, it's generally pretty chill from what i've seen on there. Any sphere will have its extremists though, i've seen some Red pillers and MGTOW people say some pretty fucked up things about women. It's best just to take everything with a grain of salt and understand where people are coming from, and I recognize at the end of the day, most people in these spheres come from a place of extreme hurt and pain and just want to do their best to prevent other people in the future to enter that same state.",1619827307

*****
&gt; State Rep Mike Nearman, the Polk County Republican who allowed far-right demonstrators to breach the state Capitol in December, now faces criminal charges.

&gt; As lawmakers met in a special legislative session to take up COVID-19 relief that day, surveillance footage showed Nearman exiting the locked Capitol building into a throng of protesters who were trying to get inside the statehouse.

&gt; The charges announced Friday are just one facet of the repercussions Nearman faces from the incident.

We just need a light capable of being swung, like a lantern, to signal for help.  However, it is my personal belief that since I do a fair amount of night fishing, I want my yak to be setup like the bigger boys and gals.  For that, you need a 360 degree light capable of being seen 2 nautical miles. On the bow, you need a green and red light capable of being seen 1 nautical mile but they do not need to be visible from a full 360 degs.  

Any other lights are for the pure enjoyment of attracting bugs and the subsequent army of bats that will swoop by your head to scare the crap out of you while trying to eat the aforementioned bugs.",1619827312

"BlackDesertMobile","t5_3pv7b","Hey man, i have a decent info for you just in case you still need it.

If you already have a lv 60is char, you can make another char lv 60 in aroun 3 hours with this method. Heck, i tested this method on archer and he goes from lv 1 to 60 in about 90 minutes. Keep in my this method works best with classes who's already awakened/acsended.


Step 1: after creating your new alt, get him a good weapon and sub weapon, and also all the skill books from the merchant if your alt is already ascended. Then go to cron castle to clear the mobs there. You should be able to reach lv 30 within 10 minutes. ( I think you dont need leaders blessing for this but i could be wrong)

Step 2: if you've been following the kunoichi events, you should have interchangeable red gears by now so your alt cp will most likely be around 4.5k right now. Before you go to hadum, i suggest you to enchance your main and sub weapon up to +20 to make the grind faster. If you have a gold weapon then it should  be good enough. Just make sure your ap is 1.9k-2k or more.

Step 3: go to hadum. I usually go to hadum serendia, the place with swamp naga. Its the one after the portal that leads to a dead end. The farming area is just right after the entrance. Never realy saw anyone farm there so its a nice place. I will apreciate it if you can share what you think is a better place though.

Step 4: if you use an already ascended class, it will be over in no time. Needless to say, stack up lv 3 ellion blessing with leaders blessing and you can add the soup that cost 1 pearl to get 1100% field exp. Make sure you have those ellion vials ready if you want to just black spirit mode it and go to sleep.

I got this method from an old yt video. Cant realy recomend you to watch it cuz its not in english but indonesian so yeah.
Addition: this method is highly class dependent. Im writing this while waiting for my witch to reach 60 and she took so freaking long. It took her more than 6 hours while archer only took 1 and hashasin took 1.5 hours. I left bdm right before they introduce the first new class and i returned just now at the start of this kunoichi event. I decided to main berserker just because he looks cool and i couldnt remember why i ditches my witch at lv 48 back then. Now i remember, her scaling is realy bad and the animation took so long.",1619827312

* Focusing on your health. I work out twice per day normally (though 0x right now due to an injury...)
* Mentoring other people.
* Learning new skills like cooking, languages, etc.
* Planning your post-Covid world travels.
* Shit, sometimes I even put my effort towards grinding for stupid skins in video games.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**



Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At 17 I had a 23 year old first ask when I was turning 18 and was disappointed that he had to wait a year because I was ""jailbait"", then later proceeded to tell me how hot it was that I wasn't afraid to get dirty, that he liked dirty girls. Said he bet I was dirty in other ways too. Asked if I liked older men and if I had a bf my age, and how old guys were better.


This was someone who knew my dad. I had been helping him work on an old truck at his buddies house. I didn't get much time with my dad because he worked a ton so I took whatever time I got with him. It was usually working on the truck or his friend's racecar. It wasn't uncommon that I'd be covered in dirt, sweat, and grease by the end of the day. The guys taught me how to work on cars and were always respectful around me. This wasn't the first time I had talked to this guy or even been alone with him. He was never a creep until that day. I told my dad that he was being a creep, but didn't go into detail in fear of what the guys wouldn't let me come around anymore and would think it was a lie. No idea what I felt that way.

A few weeks later I went with my dad to the racetrack. My dad had already told me to stay away from the guy and if he was a creep to let him know. We were in the pits and a friend of my dad's comes up, said something, looked at me and smiled. He had overheard the guy talking about me to another guy, saying he couldn't wait to get me alone again. That he wanted my number and was counting down the days until I was 18. That night my dad pinned him against a wall and threatened him, told him he'd get his ass kicked if he ever talked to me again. That he better not catch him even looking my way. He was black listed from their friends group and didn't talk to me again until I was 21. By then I didn't give a shit who I pissed off and had found my inner bitch. Haven't talked to him since that night. Oh and the rest of my dad's friends thought the guy was a total piece of shit after that and became overly protective of me.",1619827314

1. Animal though bubbles. No guide I have found really lists what they mean. Most are self explanatory but there are a couple I have questions on. Maybe you guys can help. 

Sun/Smile = ?
Shears = shear 
Brush = brush
Milk can = milk 
Star = ?
Music notes = daily friendship/heart level achieved  - do you guys agree?
Any others I missed or have not seen yet?

2. Animal/Pet heart/friendship level. Does animal hearts/friendship degrade of you don‚Äôt pet over time? Or once you hit Max hearts all you need to do is milk/brush etc... 

2b. Does this apply for pets too? Do I have to pet and give treats everyday to keep their heart level at max?

3. What items will still be available the next day after being left on the ground? Sometimes I think they are there the next day other times they disappear.

I started that hobby at age 6 and even as a kid, I figured out the steering pretty fast, servo or not. I transitioned to a manual gear car at age 12 (on private property) and drove back and forth a couple of times to get a proper feel of a real car.

"BBQ","t5_2qxww","If I were you, with what you have at your disposal, I‚Äôd water down a bbq sauce and braise the ribs in that in a pot on a low setting on the hob with the lid on. The diluted bbq sauce will reduce to form a serving sauce, and the ribs will be tender. You could sear them in a skillet after, or under the broiler. That way the sugar in the sauce will caramelise on top and add a little colour.To my mind this would be the advantage of searing after, rather than before as you would do for boeuf bourguignon for example.

The whole thing should take almost exactly as long as your wine braised ribs. If your oven is sufficiently large  and your saucepan oven proof, then the ‚Äúbbq‚Äù ribs could go in next to the wine ones on the same temperature.

That‚Äôs just my tuppence worth though.

"40krpg","t5_2stnr","First, you need to let your players know that non combat skills will be useful. One way to do this is to ensure that you give the players tests that are based on the non combat skills they have. If a player has forbidden lore(archeotech), feature some archeotech. Reward the player for having that skill. If they have trade(construction), give them a chance to repair some fortifications.

As for how to actually use investigative skills, you are probably going to need to change your DMing style a bit. Especially if you come from a DnD background. Don't gate a single piece of crucial knowledge behind a single investigation check. Have multiple clues, and don't make it a hard requirement to pass the check to access those clues. Instead of having a book with the info the players need, and requiring them to pass forbidden knowledge(xenos) to read that book, give them a partially translated copy of that book, with the crucial piece of knowledge already translated. If they pass forbidden knowledge(xenos), then they can finish the translation and learn exactly what they need to do. If they fail, they still have that first bit of information, but you throw a wrench in.

Even places that need more of a ""location"" setup such as baerlon, whitebridge, and caemlyn could all be found in the same places, because they require different shots and they are all in andor and don't require any specific differences in appearance as you would get going from andor to fal dara.  So the statements from production about needing to cut locations seems absurd and unnecessary.  The only reason would be if they cut one location to add in another that requires an actual different location.

&gt; This is where we are, Sen. Fann?Kern believes the election was stolenFann is flat wrong on the rules the media had to agree to in order to gain access to the audit of Maricopa County&amp;#039;s 2.1 million ballots.

&gt; The only thing identifiable in Randazzo&amp;#039;s picture is the sheer outrageousness of this whole joke of an Arizona election audit.

&gt; To recap, it&amp;#039;s OK for a former Republican legislator who has repeatedly promoted baseless conspiracy theories about how the election was stolen - a guy who actually signed a letter asking Congress not to accept Arizona&amp;#039;s electors - to be recounting our votes in this &amp;quot;Independent&amp;quot; audit.

I don't think 4/5 look bad, don't get me wrong, but the artstyle just feels so generic and cluttered to me. It feels more like a hollywood movie than a Halo game imo. In CE-3 the forests, islands, jungles etc. were vibrant and colorful, the snow environments felt calm and blissful, and then there was a distinct and stark contrast with the forerunner environments which felt felt cold, dark, ancient, and mysterious. All this while remaining incredibly simplistic and basic in artstyle, right on the edge of being cartoony but not quite there. I just love it, and I've never felt quite the same way playing any other games. I won't judge people for preferring the other artystyle, but Infinite's direction is something I've literally been dreaming about for over a decade now.

&gt;""While decriminalization bills sometimes impose a civil penalty or infraction for possession, rather than a misdemeanor, this [measure](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=87R&amp;Bill=HB441) generally meets advocates‚Äô definition of decriminalization because a class C misdemeanor does not involve incarceration as a punishment. Instead, people who commit the offense face a $500 fine.

&gt;If the person pays the fine and enters into a plea of no contest or guilty, their case would be automatically deferred for one year. Then, if the judge‚Äôs orders are followed, they would avoid a criminal record.""

"history","t5_2qh53","Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. Questions can't just be questions, we require that you have put in some effort yourself towards finding an answer. Your post should include what you have found so far, where you have looked so far, the context that made you ask the question and possibly a start towards what you think might be the answer. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

Before you attempt to expand your post you should make sure it follows [the /r/history rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_rules_.26amp.3B_guidelines). These things are particually important to keep in mind:

- Requests for sources should still be capable of generating a discussion  You can request help with finding sources (Books/Podcasts/Documentaries/etc.) but your post must conform to [Rule 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/index#wiki_9._text_posts_require_a_descriptive_body_text.), the same as any other self-post.
- If your question is homework related your post most likely belongs in /r/homeworkhelp. 
- Titles of posts should accurately describe the content. Rule of thumb: see the title as a short summary of your post which will draw people in. 
- /r/history is not a place to crowdsource your research efforts. We apply our ""no homework"" rule to not only students, but to authors, journalists, and anyone else seeking to use the subreddit as their research team. The goal here is to generate discussions about history, and the original post should be geared in that effort.
- If your post includes a link to content you made, check out the [/r/history Self Promotion &amp; Spam guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/wiki/selfpromotion)
- All of the above too much effort but still want to ask your question? check out our weekly [Silly Questions Saturday](https://www.reddit.com/r/history/search/?q=Silly+Questions+Saturday&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;t=all) topic where we are less strict in what we require for questions (self promotion rules still apply though).

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history&amp;subject=I%20expanded%20my%20post&amp;message=I%20expanded%20my%20submission%20for%20your%20review%3A%20https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/n26qk3/books_on_european_and_eastern_european_jewish/) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**

Stop giving her the information altogether. She doesn't need to know what pets, houses or what wedding you want/get. Don't allow yourself to do what she wants.  Talk with DF. Make sure you point out that you and he are the ones in the relationship. His mom needs to back off. You have every right to insist on boundaries.  Imagine how she will be if you do not enforce boundaries and consequences. If DF cannot see it within himself to separate himself from mommy than I'd seriously reconsider marriage.  But you need boundaries with her and stop allowing her to over rule and boundary stomp you. Do the wedding you and DF want not what she wants.  Look at houses with DF not her. Don't even tell her you're looking.  Don't tell her about what pets you want.  You and your SO are going to be your own little family. And once you add kids into it you most certainly will not want extended family running that as well. 

Couples counseling would be good as well. That way your partner and you can talk about it with a mediator type. And he will see how this is really affecting you and the relationship. If he won't do counseling, well there's your answer. Don't marry him. Not if he can't or won't put mom in her place",1619827322

Kappa also love sumo wrestling. Now why on earth would they enjoy a sport exclusively practiced by nearly naked men? It's a mystery!

"Archero","t5_103ahr","There's plenty of end game players using Ryan because his shards are more accessible than shade shards but besides that yes you can easily use any other hero for just about anything.

End game content is all about stars, after 3 stars each evolution is the equivalent of 2  evolutions so the numbers add up pretty quickly if you can get a 5-7 star Helix or Onir it would easily beat out a 0 star shade.

Basically keep doing ancient maze and try to get as much shards as you can get, focus on the premium heroes first that cost 120-180 soulstones for 6 of their shards since they are the rarest it's smart to stock up on them as much as you can.

Afterwards stockpile 300 soulstones for auto redeem 20 hero shards (5 hero shards for 4 different random heroes) once Ancient Maze ends you'll get up to 20 random shards for 300 soulstones.

If you have any soulstones left buy anything you want, after you unlock all the heroes and get them up to 2 stars most will recommend you buy the individual random shards or cookies with any leftover soulstones.",1619827324

"lightningnetwork","t5_39tnh","1. You need to have a new invoice for each payment.  There is an experimental feature called key-send which allows nodes to receive payments directly without an invoice but there aren't many wallets that support it yet.
2. The mobile wallets (Phoenix/Breex/Muun) are essentially a nodes in and of themselves, just not full featured as they aren't capable of routing.   They're just end points (or beginning) They need to be online but this not usually an issue if you're phone is always online.
3. When you're swapping out you should swap to a bech32 address.  It's the native onchain address for Lightning.  Best not to try anything fancy.  You can swap out to a wallet that supports bech32 and then send on further to a legacy address.  That shouldn't be an issue.

Phoenix is going to be the cheapest and probably your best best for  an ease of use wallet.  Breez is good too.  Muun is easy but it's actually pretty expensive from a fee standpoing as they make extensive use of submarine swaps for channel management.  

Alternatively, if this is an ongoing thing that you expect to continue indefinitely, consider setting up a node and using Umbrel with a Raspberry Pi.  That way you can setup your own channels to nodes you choose and you can seriously minimize the fees you'd have to pay.  Pretty much once the channels are open it's just the swap outs that you'd have to pay fees on.  But that all depends on your situation though.",1619827327

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","Women aren't overrepresented in higher education because they are ""trying harder"", it's because lower education employs teaching methods that are more effective for girls than boys, and boys are also often treated unfairly by majority female teachers. This then turns off a lot of young men from pursuing higher education because they've had a negative experience with education so far. And in higher education, the bias takes a new form in anti-male, woke ideologies. 

I think your experience is a prime example of how the school system being structured to favor women actually hurts women too. Education biased against boys/men &gt; fewer men in higher education &gt; fewer men out-earning the average woman &gt; more women competing for fewer men &gt; those men leverage their position to get away with shitty behavior.",1619827328

"EstatePlanning","t5_32tsg","Here's the relevant portion of the article I shared, which covers why the IRS's ruling in ""Letter Ruling 200920031"" is inconsistent with Tax Court ruling Rev. Rul. 85-13 and 55-410


 ""The issue arising with the grantor CLATs may well be another situation in which Rev. Rul. 85-13 creates a tax result that the IRS may not have intended. *Under Rev. Rul. 85-13, the grantor of a grantor CLAT is treated as the owner* of the assets in the CLAT. Thus, the *transfer of some of those assets to charity should be treated as a transfer made directly from the grantor* to the charity. An individual does not recognize gain when the individual transfers appreciated property directly to charity unless there is a bargain sale element to the transfer. *As long as the grantor is treated as owning the assets in the grantor CLAT, the grantor for federal income tax purposes has merely promised to transfer them*, or assets that they are converted into, at points of time in the future. This is an identical situation to Rev. Rul. 55-410, except for the fact that by statute the donor has received an accelerated charitable deduction.

If the IRS wishes to advance the position set forth in the letter ruling, it should do so in published guidance such as a revenue ruling, which would at least establish the IRS‚Äôs position. Such guidance would have to address the application of Rev. Rul. 85-13 and explain why the grantor is not treated as transferring the assets directly from the grantor to charity in satisfaction of a pledge. It should be pointed out that while revenue rulings are not binding on taxpayers or the courts, the *IRS is bound to follow its revenue rulings in Tax Court* proceedings, and indeed the Tax Court on several occasions has treated revenue rulings as concessions by the IRS where they are relevant to the facts before the court (see \*Rauenhorst\*, 119 T.C. 157 (2002)). **Currently Rev. Ruls. 85-13 and 55-410 appear to stand for the proposition that the grantor of a grantor CLAT is treated as transferring the assets directly to charity, and as a result no gain or loss is triggered upon the transfer**.",1619827328

"saltierthankrayt","t5_syz7q","Just another quick reply. As I said, I‚Äôm not gonna read that but don‚Äôt take it personally. I‚Äôm sure you maybe have a few good points but the fact remains that, in the past 20 or even 10 years, technology has advanced at an exponential rate. To suggest that the miniaturisation of this technology wouldn‚Äôt be possible in 30 years is absurd. Yes, it‚Äôs a large scale down but that is comparable to the tiny, microscopic size in which computer chips (that used to be gigantic) have become.

Moreover, this is Star Wars. It‚Äôs never made sense, especially with its technology and sci-fi. If TROS wants to give Palpatine and the Saga the end it deserves, it needed to have a threat at least equal to that in ANH, ROTJ and TFA. If Star Wars wants to do something, it shouldn‚Äôt ever be held back by it not making sense because ‚Äútechnology‚Äù or ‚Äúscience‚Äù.

Lastly, you can write paragraphs upon paragraphs about how pretty much everything in Star Wars from episodes 1-9 and everything in-between makes no sense but all Star Wars has to do is come out with one made-up and random piece of lore to explain it. It‚Äôs happened tens if not hundreds of times before.

The Xyston‚Äôs and Final Order were able to miniaturise DS tech in 30 years? All Satr Wars has to say is ‚ÄúThere was a technological breakthrough and a new type of reactor method was discovered that is 2,000,000 times more efficient and powerful than those used in the past, allowing for much smaller reactors to give off even more energy and, therefore, more powerful and smaller lasers = miniaturised big boom tech.

Look, it‚Äôs Star Wars. The tech doesn‚Äôt make sense, both from an in-universe and out-of-universe POV",1619827329

‚Ä¢ Ashley reveals to the ladies that she has an open marriage

‚Ä¢ We find out she‚Äôd already told Monique, who nevertheless acts SHOCKED

‚Ä¢ Karen wore a fake Fendi cape to this same event where Gizelle wore a fake bedazzled GUCCI ski cap reminiscent of when the Gorgas used to dress like cat burglars on RHONJ season 4 

‚Ä¢ While Ashley is in the bathroom, Monique starts a FIGHT with Candiace, including a two minute death grip, chasing her around a barn in the dark, and threatening to kill her, and has to be physically restrained by a producer 

‚Ä¢ Karen invites a ‚Äúlife coach‚Äù who is actually just her acquaintance who is a radio host over to assist with her and Ray‚Äôs marriage, and Ray admits he isn‚Äôt sure he‚Äôs ‚Äúin love‚Äù with Karen anymore, blindsiding Karen, who (rightfully) runs to a closet and takes her mic off and cries

"DragonOfIcespirePeak","t5_144tnh","So first I gave the players an in game 14 day countdown where they had to split their time wisely train the town and get them ready for battle. This included clearing out Axeholm. This made for them getting to know the town better as well as forming their own militia.  
As for the battle itself- I made every Orc giant and count as 10 with an HP of 150, I believe there were 20 of these, so 200 Orcs total. I also made Moesko the lead of that army and a necromancer with legendary actions to resurrect allies. I sprinkled in a few Orogs and Ogres for good measure.  
For the players, I allowed them to multiply their HP by: 2.5 for frontliners, 2 for midline, and 1.5 for backline. Initiative was run as normal. However, something i learned here was that you should give players 2 turns every round of combat to alleviate the boredom. What I had thought of for next time was half initiatives- for example if someone rolls a 20 for initiative they go again at count 10 as well. Lastly; I had them roll their attacks, then double it. This kept it from dragging it too much.  


Other than the initiative thing i mentioned above, the biggest take away i had was- don't be afraid to make it harder than you think you are. I overloaded my players- they had the towns people, mages, themselves, a few of the named NPCs as champions, and gnome-manned automatic crossbows that fired explosive bolts. This made the Orcs melt like butter. So don't feel bad beefing them up.",1619827331

There‚Äôs nothing else to say about the retard that got dropped. Dude made a bad decision and died. You say stalked as if he was going to continue, but based on the outcome only one died. So clearly, a normal person can infer that he didn‚Äôt want to kill him. It seems like you‚Äôre the one with clouded judgment. It is debatable, it wasn‚Äôt heroic at all because it changed no outcome besides him losing his life. He didn‚Äôt stop the threat, he didn‚Äôt stop the guy from killing the driver because he didn‚Äôt want the driver dead. If you can‚Äôt see that you need to watch more of these videos lmao just because someone shoots doesn‚Äôt mean they want him to die, he wants him to suffer the consequences, and learn from the pain. Tell me why only one is dead? Hmm.

I feel like you don‚Äôt carry, and if you do, you need to take some courses. 

If we can assume he‚Äôs shooting either way, why attack someone who is within killing range with a sidearm than flee by reversing in something that can open the distance up very quickly. Have you played too many video games and think that cars can‚Äôt reverse very quickly or was it too much apex legends that makes you think a fist is a good enough force multiplier for a gun? You still dodge half the shit I respond with because you have no response. Why did he have his door unlocked and why was he so ready to jump out when his door was opened? Seems to me that he was ready for confrontation.

You keep saying that it being heroism isn‚Äôt debatable, so clearly you have no idea what the word opinion means. You saying that I divert away from heroism really makes me think that you cannot read. Idk how many times you need me to tell you that it wasn‚Äôt really heroic, especially if they were the ones who might‚Äôve started it. How often do we hear about someone opening another persons car door and just shooting their foot? If you cannot see how him shooting his foot wasn‚Äôt an attempt at his life then I know some Facebook retards that might wanna sell you some stuff. How many times does a person mess with you? Maybe you should change what you are doing.

At first your comments made you seem like a reasonable person to have a discussion with, but you slowly drifted into being irrational. If you think that your life is so worthless, that you would‚Äôve done what we saw in this video with the same outcome, then maybe you should be speaking with a therapist and not a stranger on the internet. I know people who have too much pride like you that can‚Äôt let shit go and you‚Äôd be the idiot in this situation to attack someone who has a 100% chance of inflicting a mortal wound on you.

Findings: Dedicated imaging of the left lower extremity was performed, at the site of the palpable lesion as indicated by the patient. There is a 0.6 x 0.2 x 0.3 cm fluid collection in the distal lateral left calf, difficult to further characterize due to its small size but could represent sequela of prior trauma.

If it works fine at 1 foot away you know for sure that either your signal is degrading, or you are getting enough voltage drop to cause the control chips to malfunction. 

Since the control signal is a continuous stream of serial data that is regenerated by each chip, as individual chips sort of ‚Äúreboot‚Äù the serial data passing through them gets corrupted. As this process repeats thousands of times, you get the random flickering and colors your seeing. 

Since upgrading the power supply or decreasing the brightness (to keep the current use under your 3 amp limit) is the easiest thing to fix try one of those things first. As others have noted you can set the maximum brightness in your sketch.

Tommy has no knowledge about the business deal, as it's a very secret, very shady, definitely corrupt arrangement that goes against the warden rules (which is why Sam snapped at Tommy when he called him corrupt. He's aware it's technically also breaking the rules he set for himself as a warden, and he's still trying to convince himself he's in the right).

But why excuse corrupt warden Sam for reacting out of anger but not reckless traumatized Tommy for acting too fast? I feel like people just want to blame Tommy for everything and than excuse others for making the same mistakes. (He didn't quite break any rules, just kind of skipped around them since he didn't sign the books for his new visit. But he did technically lie to Sam when he said he wouldn't visit the prison again, which I'm 60% sure he said).",1619827335

Simon muss sich ausserdem vor den Hatern auch √ºberhaupt gar nicht rechtfertigen, wenn er sagt, dass er keine Zeit hat. Nach der v√∂llig ungerechtfertigten und f√ºr ihn sicherlich zutiefst dem√ºtigenden Socko-Schmach durch die fiese Mobber-Jury dieses total unfairen Pitch-Wettbewerbs steckt Simon sein ganzes Herzblut und seinen Bock inzwischen n√§mlich schon l√§ngst wieder in ein vollkommen neues und sehr pers√∂nliches Leidenschafts-Projekt: und zwar die Gr√ºndung eines eigenen Lebkuchen-Fabrikations-Labels namens LBKCHNMON.

Denn, und das k√∂nnt ihr rundgewichsten Blassr√ºcken nat√ºrlich nicht wissen, weil ihr seid ja nicht vom Fach, an Lebkuchen w√§rmen normal gebliebene und vor allem geistig gesunde und ausgeglichene Menschen wie eben Simon zum Beispiel √ºber die Feiertage nicht nur sich selbst, sondern auch die ganze Familie.
Von daher w√ºrde ich an eurer Stelle also schon mal die Vorbestellungen f√ºr die ersten LBKCHNMON-XXL-Family-Starter-Kits direkt raushauen. Denn echte Bohnenfans wissen ja auch, dass wenn dieses stark limitierte und nicht minder √ºberteuerte Kult-Item in den Merch Shop kommt, es dann auch garantiert sofort ausverkauft sein wird.

Also, keine Sekunde z√∂gern, liebe Elite-Dullis, und sofort zuschlagen! Oder wollt ihr etwa nicht, dass Simon sch√∂ne Weihnachten hat..?

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Yup!  This is what truly pains me about the old white folks complaining about the immigrants who risk everything (leaving their family, risk of arrest/death) **just for a chance to work here.**  You've heard all of the nasty stereotypes they used to (and still) sling around: that they're lazy, they're here to sell drugs, etc..

The reality is clear if you ever interacted with one for more than a second: the whole reason they are here is to bust their ass working as hard as humanly possible so that they can send almost all of the $ they earn back to the family they support. 

NPR  had a couple of segments discussing the conditions in Central America that a lot of the immigrants are fleeing from. They mentioned that, for the ones that do make it to the US and able to work, **they typically are supporting 10 to 15 people off of the meager wages they are able to earn here!**

How dare these old white people in America claim that these hard-working folks are lazy or are taking American jobs!  Almost to a rule, every single laborer I have met has been extremely hard working, willing to work extremely long hours doing grueling work while never issuing a single complaint, polite and grateful. 

I was servicing some life safety equipment at a country church the other day and happened to overhear the church staff parroting talking points they've heard off of Fox News. There were about 5 ppl there.....3 older women and 2 older men. None below the age of 55. After saying ridiculous things about Governor Cuomo in New York, they started talking about the immigrant wave at the southern border.

I swear it was like watching hypocrisy manifest in front of my very own eyes! As part of my work I had to go room to room in this beautiful old church. One room was devoted entirely to the history of the church as well as the numerous mission trips that the various church elders took over the years, including long term (5-10 yr) stays overseas. 

From where I was standing I could stare at the museum room where numerous photos of church elders surrounded by dozens of poverty stricken  village people in different locale such as Brazil, the Philippines, Nigeria. Without moving and still able to see the photos, I could see the group of church staff repeating repeating  stereotypes about the immigrants.    Definitely struck a chord in me!",1619827336

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","Most of my businesses have started because I was looking for something and couldn't easily find it. After spending lots of time finding it, I decided to compile my findings into an easy to find resource.

I needed niche medical supplies, had few options to choose from, found a good source and opened a wholesale account with them, then started selling those products because I could make my website easier to find than theirs.

I needed a list of software that fit a specific need, couldn't find it without really doing some digging, then compiled a list after labourous research, built a directory of that software, then struck referral fee agreements with those software companies.

I've had situations where I have access to the product that plenty of other people had, but I could get a better or cheaper product, then entered a saturated market with an advantage.

There are many ways to get started. It's all about paying attention to things, learning a market or skill, then a combination of luck and drive.

You can decide that you want to do a certain thing and focus on becoming good at it too. I don't have the attention span to be an expert, so I diversify.",1619827337

Boy, I'm really getting mileage out of this comment:


&gt; [...] every single time this question gets asked the proper answer is **""For what fight are you trying to assemble a team for""**?


&gt; In this game you **don't** assemble a team just because, you just don't add random people to the party because it _seems_ that they work together. You need to set a party for the **specific boss** you're trying to fight, for the specific conditions of the fight, and for the specific Lufenia Orb you have to counter. 


So yeah. We can tell you which team is better because we don't know what you're trying to do, but as always in Cosmos difficulties and under it literally doesn't matter who you use.


&gt;what is a special countdown? fought an evil gaze lvl 200 after 15 turns it wiped my party....and it's ok to sell EX+ if u have the burst wep for that character right? TIA!


Special countdowns, also know as Lufenia Orb are a mechanic present in every Lufenia difficulty battle. When this countdown reaches zero you will wipe, simple as that. Each battle has a very specific conditions you need to cover in order to increase the countdown, or freeze it altogether. 


Since you said you were fighting medusas, I'm assuming you're doing the Act 3 Chapter 1 Part 1 Lufenia boss, and IIRC the condition to increase the orb count is to deal Ice damage, so characters who can enchant your party with the Ice element like Celes and OK are necessary to hit the orb and avoid the wipe.


This is where my first point comes into play: in high level content and SPECIALLY in Lufenia you can't just throw 3 people together and hope you can clear, you need to study the fight and have a wide enough roster to cover the requirements of the Orb and the fight itself. If you have to ask what a countdown is, then maybe you're not ready for Lufenia stuff yet (which is literally the endgame of this game as of now).


Lastly, if you own a character's Burst then you're safe to sell their EX+, of course make sure it's fully realized and maxed (purpled) beforehand.",1619827338

Difficulty settings don‚Äôt exist to help the player better understand a game, they exist to make the game more accessible, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a fair comparison. A film can still be accessible without explaining every detail of it, but a game isn‚Äôt always accessible if the level of challenge is too high by default. 

And you‚Äôre right that gamers aren‚Äôt forced to buy games, especially for full price at launch. But with any other product, you buy it with the expectation that you will have the ability to use it, video games are no different.

In my opinion, difficulty settings mean that everybody wins, and I don‚Äôt see why people view them as a bad thing. People who want a challenging experience will always choose a higher difficulty, and their experience is not affected in any way by the presence of easier difficulty settings.

If you have have a fertilized egg that is only 3 days along and then get your period thus releasing the egg, a baby did not die. You just got your period. You literally wouldn‚Äôt even know that their was an egg their because it‚Äôs microscopic.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","First of all, I‚Äôd like to say that it‚Äôs actually a good thing that you‚Äôre thinking about these kind of issues in today‚Äôs society. 

But I there are some things I don‚Äôt quite understand with your thought process. 
You said that you once wanted to be a doctor, but 
you decided against it because ‚Äú white doctors harm their patience with bias and racism ‚Äú. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong but that‚Äôs kind of a stupid and nonsensical reason. The answer is simple, just become a doctor and don‚Äôt harm your patients with bias and racism. Ever thought of that ? Just because you‚Äôre a white doctor you don‚Äôt have to be a racist ? I really don‚Äôt get your thought process. 

In fact your statement is quite racist and shows that you have no problem with generalising white people and their behaviour just because white supremacy is a thing. Of course there are white doctors who are racists, but there are also white doctors who are not racists. To claim that every white doctor is a racist is just dumb. 

Your hate and self-shame towards white supremacy became so intense that you‚Äôre starting to become the thing you don‚Äôt want to be. A racist. If you think that being racist towards white people because of white supremacy helps anyone then you‚Äôre wrong. 

And as you already stated correctly, blaming yourself also helps no one. 

Just don‚Äôt be a racist. Don‚Äôt be a part of it.
Don‚Äôt judge people by their races. Stop generalising people because of their origins and try to actively fight racist behaviour when you encounter any. That‚Äôs enough.",1619827339

"motogp","t5_2r7pg","Thanks for the measured and thoughtful response. I suspected that my frivolous comparison of Monster to the Saudi government might draw some heat, but I will say this - I have made no excuses for the behavior of Saudi Arabia government and remain wholly against the violations of human rights there. The Energy Drink comparison was to say that I don't believe putting logos on things necessarily makes that athlete or viewer agree with the morals and opinions of the company.

Maybe I'm digging my heals in here but if I had an ounce of talent, skill, and dedication and somehow magically got a MotoGP ride I would hate to have the Monster brand associated with me. I genuinely feel it's not far off from Marlboro and we'll probably see legislation against it within our lifetime. But to race and get paid I would enthusiastically smile, wear it, and chug cans of it at the press conference. VR46 getting Aramco money sits in the same space for me, personally.

Your point about other locations of racing being bad is also valid. I happen to fall on the side of being ok with it - I vehemently disagree with the persecution of homosexuality in Russia but I'll still watch the F1 race there. If someone else chooses to boycott watching that one on political grounds I have no issue with them.

Women are treated as second class citizens in Qatar which is abhorrent, but I'm comfortable watching racing there and don't believe my actions make me complicit in their skewed moral compass. The US regularly and actively conducts state sponsored terrorism and executes its own citizens, but I love the Austin race. Maybe I'm just more comfortable separating my thoughts on a nation's geopolitics with my enjoyment of racing. I'd watch a race in North Korea if they found a way to cram it into the calendar.",1619827340

Title: **I have enough information to believe that a redditor is distributing child pornography. Is there anything to do about it?**

Original Post: 

&gt; basically, this is just purely out of what's called ""white knighting"". I know for a fact that this person does provide it to others, and he's made a clique. he even charges some people for it. I want to know if there's anything to do about him
&gt; 
&gt; unfortunately, I don't know him, or even his username. however, a friend of mine (who unfortunately was one of his preys) does know. I don't want to hurt my friend, but I'm determined to get this person. he destroyed my friend's life. if my friend was able to cooperate with authorities (assuming that this can be done), would she be in trouble?
&gt; 
&gt; to add insult to injury, I am not a US citizen. so please tell me, what steps, if any, I should take. thank you all.

Because:

1. It's easy at least for me while there were some things that were confusing as time went on i understood more and more.
2. It allows you to do a lot of things if you found web development boring you can try game development ethical hacking etc.

Start with [A byte of python](https://python.swaroopch.com/) if you don't understand anything check the python discord, then watch youtube videos for html css ('they are very simple') then go to  [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) after that create something.

Obviously there is more to that like javascript frameworks, Git but you can probably make decent website with these skills.

You just need to know the basics like data types etc after that use your search engine.

Personally, I just love the Ult since it feels very ‚ÄúJohn Wick-esque‚Äù so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve stuck with them. Other than that, reduce how long someone is scanned for or revert back to static image, but I doubt they‚Äôll go down that path again",1619827345

Thankfully we're small so the impact isn't major, but I grilled the owner last night (I had a few drinks, was pissy, and we're more friends than anything so drunk texting is okay ) and still no plan what happens if there's a staff positive case. It's infuriating. They're fucked if there's a positive case.

 Been talking  to a very close friend all day cause I'm worried and she's in safety and a good person to bounce thoughts off of and she's losing her mind because machine workers are coming in and working  with no PPE but still remembering to wear their face masks lol.

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","On every other  hardpoints (all 3 of them) I have long range thermal vent beam lasers. I do not suggest this setup: it deplete the distributor too fast and is not very effective against hull. The pros are high DPS (but just for a very short time) and the fact that you will need restock not so often (I'm not an ace with fixed so it takes ages to run out of railgun ammo).

A possible alternative would be class 4 efficient thermal vent beam laser and 2 efficient class 3 burst lasers. I will keep railguns just because I find It funny to use them.

Another possible set up is all kinetic: 1 class 1 frag with drag munition, 1 class 1 multicannon with corrosive, 2 class 3 multicannons with short range incendiare rounds, 1 class 4 multicannon with short range oversized.

I'm mainly doing pve so this what I would use the ship for. I yet have to try the 2 alternative setups I presented, on coriolis they seem to work fine, but real test may tell otherwise.

Hope this was helpfull

Edit: I am not an ace with fixed",1619827347

You're not wearing as much as before?"" and because she experiments all the time she'll be like ""Oh yeah I tried no blush today"" and then I'm like ""You don't need blush! Ugly women need blush!"" and the next day, no blush.

"SHINee","t5_2tmg1","Only BTS has received the official designation to delay enlistment until 30 as of yet. This is likely a strategic move for the group as the other 3 are back (and can promote different activities) and this year as 4 they have put out an album a repackage and a Japanese mini (July 2021) and the Beyond Live concert. Right now they can't tour and for the time being no in person concerts locally in SK. If Taemin waited until he absolutely had to go (ex. up to his 29th bday like Baekhyun is doing next week üò≠) it would be cutting into what by that time (should) be a new heyday for live perfomances and international tours. This way he will overlap his enlistment with the covid restrictions that are in place in South Korea and most of the world. Large scale live perfomances and tours are a ways off (6-12 months in my personal opinion). Taemin will be enlisted for 18 months returning in the Fall of 2022, which also gives the group time to prepare something grand for their 15th Anniversary in May of 2023.

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","Henchoz was excellent, one of those players who is always talked about as being ""underrated"" to the point you start wondering if there's anyone who doesn't rate him. He was the covering defender in partnership with Hyppia, notably good on the ball for the time, could play full back as well as centre back. Reminded me of Steve Staunton a bit. Equivalent in our squad would be Wijnaldum, people going on about how he's an unsung hero while he quietly gets on with his job. 

Abel Xavier was a filler transfer, he was a Portugal international, more associated with Everton than with us. He was athletic, strong, charismatic, made loads of mistakes on and off the ball, brought the thunder somehow. We all liked him. Not really an equivalent in our squad presently. Maybe someone like Nat has similar feels about him. 

Patrik Berger is a near-legend from the miserable 1992-2000 period. He was supremely talented and athletic, a tall, wide-striding midfielder with outstanding flair and technical ability, plus lovely hair. He would have been a brilliant player in current football, scored some spectacular goals and produced wonderful moments, saw the game at a high level. Nearest in our squad would be Curtis Jones. He was like a fully developed Curtis Jones. 

Veggard Heggem was hugely talented, young full back who we thought would grow to become world class, frankly. He was elegant, lightweight, had a nice weight of pass and some extra pace though that dried up with his injuries which eventually curtailed his development and his career. I guess Tsimikas would be the closest in the current group, you can see the talent is there but not sure it's ever going to be unlocked really. 

Igor Biscan was touted as being a special player, people were excited about signing him. He was supposed to be some sort of incredible midfield prospect and he did look the part. But he was totally out of his depth from the first minute he stepped on the pitch for us and you could see it wasn't going to work. Bit like Keita unfortunately. 

Not much to say about the others really.",1619827351

Absolutely, because if you know there are issues and you let him fight, then they can be sued in a decade on the pretenses that they knew. 

Basically Fabia sparked a problem that didn't need to exist. The UFC can't provide his records, but now that they have to be reasonably concerned about his health (given the request), they can't let him fight. The way out was for Fabia to respond to the email saying there were no concerns and he refused to do that, so unfortunately they have to cut him.",1619827351

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","Demisexual is when you function as an asexual until you form a particular connection with someone, and after that you function as an allosexual with them with full sexual attraction. You can be anywhere on the asexual or allosexual spectrums.

Demiromantic is the same, except romantic attraction instead of sexual attraction. It sounds to me like you would be asexual and demiromantic.

Asexuality is very specifically about not experiencing sexual attraction towards others. That's the entire deal. If you don't experience sexual attraction towards others, you're asexual. It's not all that complicated, really. It doesn't matter why. Could be trauma, hormones, or you were just always that way. Cause is irrelevant to the label.

Asexuality has nothing to do with: romantic attraction, kissing, cuddling, gender preferences, masturbation, porn, kinks, or actually having sex. It's just about sexual attraction towards others. Some sex repulsed asexuals will use porn or masturbate even though they'd have no interest in the real thing, because with fantasy you can skip the stuff you wouldn't like in reality.

The asexual spectrum basically sort of goes  
\--- Sex Repulsed: Usually avoid sex ---  
\#1: Repulsed by comments about sex or others having sex  
\#2: Repulsed by the reality of having sex personally  
\#3: Willing to have sex, but may be disgusted afterwards  
\-- Sex Indifferent or Favourable: May enjoy sex ----  
\#4: Neutral towards sex, but no sexual attraction  
\#5: Enjoy pleasing partner, but no sexual attraction  
\--- Exceptions: Will also be anywhere #1-5 ---  
\* Grey-asexual: Occasional sexual attraction, but rarely or less intense.  
\* Demisexual is entirely different. Demis function like asexuals until they have a particular emotional connection with someone, after which they function like allosexuals with that person (full sexual attraction).",1619827352

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

"holdmyfries","t5_36znx","People don't know and/or forget that the Gracie family co-owned and were among the founding investors in the UFC.  It existed as a means to promote their style of BJJ.  They chose Royce to represent them, not because he was the best, but because he looked smaller so it was more impressive when he beat the huge opponents he faced in the UFC.  I think the ""best"" Gracie at that time was considered to be Rickson Gracie, but he was too well known and looked tougher.

So, it wasn't so much that Royce Gracie entered the tournament and was a surprise winner.  It's more that the tournament was designed around showing off Gracie BJJ and he was the chosen Gracie clan representative.

&gt; The tournament was inspired by the Gracies in Action video-series produced by the Gracie family of Brazil which featured Gracie jiu-jitsu students defeating martial artists of various disciplines such as karate, kung fu, and kickboxing.

Most others I know of do this as well, with only a handful who don't. It's not that we don't care as Americans', it's that corporate entities decide it's easier to push a product they intend to mark-up (or want the option of marking up) to by hiding the applied tax to the product, so it sounds cheaper, and you become more complacent with the price hike AFTER having paid the marked price (plus tax) prior. McD's Dollar Menu is my fav example, because even *when* the majority items were a buck, the reality is that they were .99 plus tax, whihc rounded out to about 1.18-1.25ish.

"Marriage","t5_2reak","Hi there.  I am struggling with my own CPTSD.   Here is my personal opinion:

It is very common for a person with ptsd to feel ashamed, defective, a burden, and general depression as a result of the flashbacks.  But you must remember you are not ""defective""; you are a SURVIVOR of something terrible that was not your fault or under your control.  You are stronger than you realize.  

In my opinion, you should tell your husband but maybe not today.  I highly recommend you see a trauma therapist.   He/she can help you decide what to tell your husband and how.  There are some great new therapies for trauma such as EMDR that may really help you.    Also a good psychiatrist can help you with meds that manage symptoms.  I see one, and I no longer am woken up by nightmares &amp; my depression is controlled.  

I think you should tell him so that he can understand you better and it can bring the two of you closer. 

I recommend you start treatment now before delivery.     About 10% of births result in the woman reporting Post partum depression symptoms.  A new baby is a big stressor.  As a mother myself, I think the more prepared you are before baby arrives the better.  

I dont think you need to tell the in-laws anything if you dont want to.  If your husband is made aware  of triggers, he can cover for you if you need to bail on a family gathering or something.",1619827355

Subscribers receive 8 points just for logging in four days per week.  21 \* 8 = 168

Daily missions give 3 points and there are two per day.  21 \* 3 \* 2 \* 7 = 882

Weekly missions give 12 points and there are two per week.  21 \* 12 \* 2 = 504

168 + 882 + 504 = 1554 total available points

You need 800 points to reach level 100 and receive all rewards.

You can completely skip the weekly missions and still make level 100.  168 + 882 = 1050

You can even skip 83 of the daily missions and still hit level 100.  168 + 882 - 83(3) = 801

You do not have to do everything every day.  Skip the stuff that does not interest you.  Do not think of this as a job, consider it for what it is: getting free stuff for playing the game.

\*\* These values are for subscribers.  F2P and preferred players earn fewer points for each activity and thus will have to either do some of the weekly objectives or utilize one of the catch up methods (credits or CCs).

\*\* If the season lasts 20 weeks then you can skip up to 66 daily missions.",1619827355

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","&gt; Some ships like the F8 lightening are only available via squadron 42. How it's earned is still a mystery but it's assumed it's a reward for completing certain parts of the game.

My guess is that it'll be a reward for completing the full campaign, but possibly only on harder difficulties, and you have to do well enough. In the Wing Commander series, your performance in missions (do you keep failing objectives or are you a freakin' ace?) determined what ships you could access, with better performance giving you access to the best ships in the fleet.

It would not surprise me if you have to earn your way into flying an F8A during the campaign, and if you do and any other conditions are satisfied you unlock the right to fly an F8C as a civilian.

A comparable real-life example is that Michael Schumacher owned a special Ferrari FXX, one of less than 10 made; his insurance would only cover him driving it because it's such a powerful, rare, and irreplaceable supercar. Someone who hasn't proven themselves capable of driving a Formula 1 racer safely shouldn't be getting behind the wheel of a car that powerful because it'll try and kill them immediately. So, it wouldn't surprise me if the UEE military isn't going to just let someone who crashed their ship every mission fly one.",1619827356

I curse thee! let a sufferer's curse Clasp thee, his torturer, like remorse; Till thine Infinity shall be A robe of envenomed agony; And thine Omnipotence a crown of pain, To cling like burning gold round thy dissolving brain.""


- **The Marriage of Heaven and Hell**: ""Those who restrain desire do so because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer usurps its place and governs the unwilling. And being restrained it by degrees becomes passive, till it is only the shadow of desire. The history of this is written in Paradise Lost, and the Governor is called Messiah.""

But He! so wretched in his height, So restless in his wretchedness, must still Create, and re‚Äìcreate‚Äì‚Äìperhaps he'll make One day a Son unto himself‚Äì‚Äìas he Gave you a father‚Äì‚Äìand if he so doth, Mark me! that Son will be a sacrifice!... Evil and Good are things in their own essence, And not made good or evil by the Giver; But if he gives you good‚Äìso call him; if Evil springs from him, do not name it mine, Till ye know better its true fount; and judge Not by words, though of Spirits, but the fruits Of your existence, such as it must be.

- **The Diabolicon**: ""And so I saw that God would not recognize a Will apart from its own, and I was seized with horror, for I perceived that the final scheme of God would destroy creation in all things, and the Cosmos would become as a concentric mechanism whose function would be not to create anew, but rather to freeze into perpetuity that which already was.

"OfficeChairs","t5_32ivr","I have been sitting on getting either a Haworth Fern or a HM Embody, but think am going to go for latter (especially as after picking options pricing is similar with current HM sale) but I am stuck on colours. 

Green is my favourite colour but I don't like the ""Everglade"" option in the Sync as it is a little too ""hospital green"" for me from what I have seen of it, so would go with Medley Loden if I get green. Cannot decide on the base/frame colour. The one in pics is actually ""Rhythm Green Apple"" as HM site does not have the Loden, but it shows dark enough it seems to give the vibes. Other option is to do Sync Dark Carbon. Not as fun but definitely more neutral. 

Let me know what colourway you like best...it is for work office but I don't mind having colour in my office to break out from all the other boring colours.

1. Medley Loden with White Frame/Graphite Base
2. Medley Loden with White Frame/Titanium Base
3. Medley Loden with Graphite Frame/Graphite Base
4. Sync Dark Carbon with White Frame/Titanium Base
5. Sync Dark Carbon with White Frame/Graphite Base
6. Sync Dark Carbon with Graphite Frame/Titanium Base

Everyone knows everyone out there.  Very community based people.  They are also very private too.  Most mind their own business, but some do like to gossip as well.

Otherwise, the folks there are very welcoming and friendly from my experience.  Just watch out for deer when you're driving out there!

They pay you almost completely to make the company successful, not to have a great time and avoid commuting.

Feeling more productive is not the same as actually being more productive from a management standpoint. That would be great if you get to come out of this with a sweet new WFH gig that pays off.

although some things are definitely out-dated, it is still comedy  
and it still catches me off guard and makes me laugh  


Like some jokes about countries...we **know** for a fact they aren't true, yet we still joke about it even when we live in the country itself. We still joke about it because it is kind of a funny take on it. The way things are delivered and the concept itself makes it funny. Even if the jokes Bill Burr tells are a bit off the hooks, we can still laugh at it because of it being intended for comedy. Honestly, it depends on the surrounding environment one is in at the moment.  


My father has introduced to me many comedians, but also the amazing origins of a movie's quote. I also love laughing and dad jokes and just jokes in general, so I still get a laugh out of these things. Maybe it's my light-hearted and take some things with a grain of salt mindset when it comes to jokes guys make. After a while I learned that certain jokes the guys will make and that it is what it is.  


So in my opinion, it's not that bad, depending on one's mindset towards certain topics.",1619827358

The other poster said you can declare any major at any point, which is true for all majors / minors in LSA (assuming that‚Äôs the school you will attend). Since PH is it‚Äôs own school, you will need to apply to transfer there after two years in LSA (or whatever other school you‚Äôre admitted to).

That being said, if you don‚Äôt get admitted to the SPH, there are many other majors to consider. International Studies is popular for protective SPH students as it has a Global Health and Environment submajor. You can also choose to major in a science based major you‚Äôre most interested such as bio, chem, environmental studies, etc. You can also double major or minor in a more social science subject to get that public health aspect.

There are also tons of minors to consider that are related to public health, such as the Food and Environment minor.

And anyway this seems like the right place to air out the disagreement, and find out if and how I'm wrong. This is the right place to debate it, and learn more.

There definitely does seem to be an element of alien stories that is materializing/dematerializing, I agree.

I haven't seen any alien interest in religion, though. That seems to come across, that they have little interest in Jesus or spirit beings or what have you. They seem to put that in the 'things humans care about' box and move on.

I guess I'd put it this way.

There's different planes.

We exist on one, aliens on another, demons or fully 'spirit beings' on yet another.

My take is that our plane and the alien one are pretty close together. The aliens seem, oh, about 90% physical. The rest might even be explicable by basically physical technology.

Demons and spirits, ghosts, the dead - it's almost the opposite. It's 90% spirit, hardly any matter there.

What I'm saying is that humans and aliens are like humans and, say, gorillas, while the fully spirit plane is like something aquatic... alive, but very different, and in a totally altered, almost foreign, relation to us.",1619827362

Incognito tab and check out some hot dudes with mullets. Then look for those traits in your partner. That might not be your style and that's fine, but it's a good way to unlearn biases in what you find attractive in general.

If you're dead set not attracted to him with his hair this way, then you should probably end the relationship. Make sure to place the blame where it belongs. I would say something like ""I have to end this because I'm feeling like I have lost my attraction to you as we have changed over the years, and that isn't fair to you.""

I would personally just work on seeing the parts of him that are changing as attractive in new, exciting ways. Do a trucker roleplay or something. Get into the mullet! (I'm biased, I (23m) and my boyfriend (22nb) both have them).",1619827362

"Megaten","t5_2sj8i","Metatron being a robot initially is also a reference to the fact that he used to be human. Which is why sandalphon and victor are depicted the same way in the games. One game even mentions how he used to be enoch. But when you jump to iv, angels in general are referred to as robotic, and even the four cardinal archangels are machines.

But I can go on.

Some of the early games had regular Jewish stars in the demon fusing area, which is a reference to the fact that the symbol was originally in folklore as a symbol solomon used to command demons before becoming a more wide use jewish symbol. 

Mastema's role in the dead sea scrolls is referenced in iv. In the Dead Sea Scrolls he asks God for permission to Command demons in order to tempt mankind. This would put him at odds with the angels trying to get them to do good. In iv he works for neutral, commands demons, and is at odds with the other angels.

There is also the Jewish folklore story where God tells some angels he is deliberately creating Humanity capable of sin, because it is for the greater good. And some angels got frustrated by this, and some of them even try to frustrate the process. It's not clear if atlus knows this story, but atlus having mastema say his goal is closer in line with god's will is conspicuous. 

This can also reference the kabbalic idea that in the world to come the light and dark parts will be revealed to be part of one greater whole. So you can try to crowbar the kabbalic readings even to neutral, even if law is most obvious.

In II, the church's chests with special items are shaped like the Ark of the Covenant.

In II, robots used by the church are referred to as golems in reference to the idea of it being an artificial creation.

In devil survivor, the idea of god versus the original bel is reference to the story of judaism in babylon. Bel becomes the bels in reference to caananite religion's influence by babylon.

Cherubs look babylonian in reference to their design's relationship to babylonian lamassu. 

The law side being called, well, law, is just a coincidence, but it is probably not lost on atlus that the word has special significance in Judaism. 

Mem aleph is based on the kabbalic idea of the mother letters of creation, mem shin and aleph. More specifically a new age butchering of them that doesn't realize that aleph is not pronounced like a, and so passed mem aleph off as MA, and insisted it is the divine feminine. Regardless, the mother letters are associated with the primal chaos that is meant to be reified. 

Merkabah's second form not only references ezekiel's merkabah vision of wheels (first form having four heads is also conspicuous), but is half dark, presumably in reference to this idea that the light and dark parts are both aspects of the system. The spirit of spite from the same game, coming from Lucifer may also reference the evil inclination. And of course lucifer being manipulated by god in apocalypse references the same idea of the dark being part of the system.

Ahazyua, the king of mikado becoming corrupt and summoning beelzebub is a reference to the old testament story of a king with a similar name becoming corrupt, and consorting with beelzebub.

The plot of soul hackers has the fallen watchers from the dead sea scrolls creating dangerous technology, which is of course what they do in their original story. In iv, the watchers are with chaos likewise giving dangerous information, and saying if you die from it its your own fault.

The games' ideas of demons are based on the jungian idea of archetypes. In reference to this, the demon world is sometimes referred to as atziluth. Which is the kabbalic realm of archetypes where the divine archetype for creation exists. The human world is sometines called assiyah, which is the kabbalic human world.

A kabbalic tree of life motif shows up often. The demon world is structured after it in II, in reference to the idea of it being everywhere. Even in persona, in p5 mementos is shaped like the tree of death, represents humanity's vices, and has palaces in it which reference kabbalic palaces of impurity. Many games use religious motifs to depict the idea of moving through the story and developing as a person as compared to spiritual growth.

Lucifer says he is a part of god that god discarded. So you get reference to the more panentheistic readings of kabbalah.

The presence of lilith as such a major character in general.

Although the church primarily uses christian symbols, a few units have a mix, with jewish stars over a cross. There's even a cross and lotus symbol. In II there's a spider tank named rabbi for some reason. It projects an image of a speaking person, so maybe it can also be used for remote teaching?

Tengu demons randomly wear jewish clothing items, and its never explained why. Maybe because they look like angels? Maybe the reason for this got dummied out of whatever game was going to adress it.

Although the units in ii look more christian, a few look like they might be jewish inspired too, having something that looks like the old head covering.

In nocturne, you collect menorahs named after the sephirot for tde. Although in english they change the name to candlabraum. 

In iv, talking about clean and unclean references the idea of ritual purity. Ritual purity isnt only a jewish idea, but having jewish figures talk about it is conspicuous. Noting that unclean in the game means something different from evil.

And one of the more interrsting ones, in the rerelease of smtii zayin has a mysterious voice paradoxically tell him that god doesn't exist, but then goes on to explain god as existing. Due to all the kabbalic references, this likely is referencing the idea that ein sof is in a sense beyond ordinary conceptions of existence, and so from human perspective is nonexistent. Kabbalic writing does paradoxically talk about god not existing for this reason. 

In overclocked they talk about several old testament stories on amane's end, and talk about job and the idea of god using evils for the greater good. 

The coming of the messiah being an eschatological event where the world is ushered to eternal peace is also more jewish than the christian one where it happens much earlier.

Then of course there's jewish demons like dybbuk.

Your Lord of the Flies logic is flawed and based on fiction. But you are right. You don't need whistleblowers or guilty confessors... if you can catch the cheaters. Without them, 73 people would have gotten away with it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was still at my old college when this happened (about 2 years ago now). Around 5 in the morning, I kept hearing what sounded like persistent knocking, so I went to go check out the little peephole in my door. I didn't see anything, but I kept hearing the knocking, so I opened the door and there was this guy, about the same age as I was, standing outside my door sobbing, and he gave me this whole story about how ""his friends are outside the dorm threatening him and can he please just sit with me for a few minutes so he can make sure they go away?"" This was definitely where I messed up, and I can admit that I definitely made a mistake that night, but I told him that he could sit at my desk, and I kept myself firmly stationed by the door. This guy wasn't huge and I was sure I could take him if I really needed to, but standing by the door just made me feel more comfortable. This dipshit decided to sit on my bed instead, which wouldn't have been a problem, except he then asked me if I wanted a hug. Obviously I answered that with a firm no. And then he kept asking. And when he was finally content with that answer, he then asked me if I wanted to see his dick. That was somehow answered with an even firmer no, and I'm sure he could see the way the fires of Hell were burning behind my eyes, because at that point I was pissed. How dare he take advantage of my kindness like that?? But he left. And according to campus security, I wasn't the first one he had done that to.",1619827364

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","I do this!!! It‚Äôs like this weird little warm-up for me. I do it every time! I think I do it because the little projects aren‚Äôt as scary and overwhelming as the big one and I‚Äôm just trying to feel successful. Then once I‚Äôve got a few little successes under my belt, I can (sometimes) move on to the big project to get the big success. It doesn‚Äôt always work. But sometimes it does. 

It‚Äôs like all I can think about is alllllll the little things that need doing, and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm trying to clear the little things out to make brain space for the big awful thing.

When I absolutely must do a big horrible awful task, I try to reframe my thinking. Instead of thinking about how awful it is and how I just can‚Äôt make myself do it, I think: Ok I might not be able to do THAT right now, but what CAN I do right now? And just by thinking that way it builds up and eventually it gets done. 

I also break down big awfuls into tiny awfuls. Even if the awfuls are itsy bitsy, a lot of tinies add to a big.

A statistical disparity is in and of itself not proof of racism, especially by society at large. It could be many things, but racism on the basis of just that is an unproven conclusion.

To contrast this, we have Jim Crow, one of the most famous examples of systematic, institutional, or legal racism, especially because many of the laws that made up Jim Crow were not explicitly racist. But that smokescreen didn't stand up when the laws were found to have no other basis or reason of existing other than racism, and the disparate impact.

Nowadays leftists just say ""oh the statistics don't match some semi-arbitrary benchmark (like corporate boardrooms and legislatures not being 50/50 male/female), and from that alone, say it's discrimination.

Fortunately I had heard of it before so I wasn‚Äôt totally clueless when it happened, but still caught off guard. My eyes were open but the room was dim and blurry. It looked like there were storm clouds overhead in my apartment, it was really weird. My mouth was stuck open, I was trying to scream but only breaths were coming out. My hand was open next to my head, I tried squeezing it into a fist but nothing was happening. My entire body felt tingly. I felt the presence of someone looming over top of me from behind the couch arm, pressing my head down and whispering ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look at the face in the mirror‚Äù (whatever tf that means). Once I realized what was happening I slowed my breathing and focused on calming down while continuing to hallucinate. Suddenly I was able to open my eyes wider and the voices subsided, the room brightened and I could finally move. I sat up and was fine! I‚Äôve been researching about it ever since it happened this afternoon and I‚Äôm really scared to go to sleep tonight because I don‚Äôt ever want to experience that again :(",1619827366

Join sports teams. Track, swimming, wrestling and cross country are all great choices, but its also important to do what you enjoy.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","I disagree with your assessment *in the entirety.* By which I mean you have everything *exactly backwards.*

A bear isn't going to attempt to coup-de-grace something that's on the ground when there are still active hostiles in the area. It might attempt to lift the victim and pull them away from the area, but it wants to take its ""kill"" to somewhere it can eat in peace and quiet - it isn't trying to finish a downed fighter, a bear doesn't have a concept of administering the coup de grace.

An apex predator *does not want to fight.* Fights are dangerous. Even if you win, you might get injured, and if you're injured, you won't be as effective next time, a rival might attack you while you're weak, etc.

Animals fight for only a few reasons:

1. They're hungry, in which case its priority is getting its meal. Very often apex predators like bears and wolves will *flee outright* when it becomes clear it's not going to get an ambush-kill on a solo victim from which the rest will scatter (like deer).

2. They're defending their territory/offspring. In this case they *will* fight, and viciously, but their goal is to drive the intruders *away,* not engage in wanton slaughter. If the intruders depart with the swiftness, they won't be chased.

3. They're fighting over mates. This is pretty much inapplicable to humanoids in most cases, as wolves, bears, etc, won't perceive them as mating rivals - though the aggression of mating season may still make them attack if they're the dominant alpha, or if there's no rivals around. In this case, they'll fight in a frenzy, but they're going to keep fighting until all targets are down.

Whereas a sapient opponent knows *damn well* that a downed fighter may be one good spell away from being back on their feet. A sapient opponent, particularly one to whom chivalry and honor and good sportsmanship and even taking prisoners for ransom means nothing, *they're* the ones who will take the risk and pause to make a coup-de-grace, because they want to make *sure* that guy is properly *dead* rather than just ""downed.""

Of course, *if* you're throwing in foes like this, you should probably make them take the time to administer a CdG even if the target *is* dead - they don't realize in the heat of the battle that the target's dead unless they have a permanent *see living* effect doing on.",1619827367

I think you really underestimate the potential of people being horrifically underqualified applying.  I can specifically state that I know of a 4-year college with a 60% admissions rate, that basically admits anyone with minimum qualifications (a high school diploma with certain minimum classes, and a 2.5 in high school).  People who are specifically unqualified are applying.  And that's because they still perceive it as a ""maybe reachable"" school because it isn't really all that selective.

And OMSCS, at least here on reddit ... it's kind of clear that people understand it to be ""reachable"" in the same way.

In other words the applicant pool matters.  I agree you're almost certainly right, if we were talking about the on-campus program --- the messaging is clear that that program is NOT very reachable.  In a program that makes a point about providing ""access"" to a ton of people, like OMSCS, the messaging is a little different.",1619827368

I do agree that the current balance isn‚Äôt a perfect solution. Playing against one or two snipers is okay, but playing against a full team of competent snipers is a miserable experience and really exposes the upper bound of the problem. Every angle is just an imminent death ray. 

That said, sticking flinch back in isn‚Äôt a solution either. They‚Äôd either need to rework flinch or figure out another new design approach. 

I‚Äôd be interested to see a damage ramp as you stay in scope. ADS would be reasonably quick (450-500ms?), but quickscoping would require accuracy since the damage would be at a minimum; hardscoping would one-shot bellies. Maybe balance those two approaches by only applying flinch while holding your breath/hardscoping. Then they could be counter-played in SnD, but the extra penalty isn‚Äôt applied when quickscoping since that‚Äôs already getting a damage nerf. Let the player be in control of accuracy there.

In the context of quickscoping, there would be no waist-up OSK (basically Tundra without Tiger Team barrel). That would actually make more snipers viable to use since their power would be partially dictated by your playstyle rather than purely baked-in stats (no more weak snipers that are annoying to use at range, no heavy snipers that are impossible to use on smaller maps).

Well the rest of the world certainly can‚Äôt seem to get enough of keeping up with us and our drama. 

And I‚Äôm of the opinion that America shouldn‚Äôt go around forcing our will on other countries. If Saudi Arabia won‚Äôt let women show their ankles, well, that‚Äôs their prerogative. 

What right do we have to tell other countries how to operate?

So of course I‚Äôm going to approach this from an American perspective. 

So you want to use non-legal means to implement your idea of equity? Because I don‚Äôt know what else we can do as a society to show that we approve of equality between men and women. 

Women can vote, they can own land, they can go to college, they can refuse to raise families. 

They can pursue their career paths of choice. They can be truck drivers or nurses or models or welders. 

If the worst thing facing women‚Äôs sports in America is a rare PlayStation trophy and some random guy making a joke on reddit, then i would say job well done.

Both the RX100 VII and the X100V are good travel cameras. The Sony gives you a zoom with a relatively long zoom range. The Fuji is much better in low-light conditions, and will likely produce higher quality images. But it doesn't zoom.

I have the RX100VA (better in low light than the VII.) I'd still like a bit better low light performance, and I wish the camera was a bit more responsive (turns on faster, zoom lens operates faster.)

On the upside, the RX100 has a great sports sensor, it has an inexpensive dive housing, and it does some cool high speed video.

You might also consider the Sony A6100 with a compact lens like the 20/2.8.",1619827370

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","&gt;I wonder if I want to remember anything or if I want to keep my childhood as I remember it now. Was it worthwhile to delve into that? Did it help?

You dont have to remember it totally or go digging up memories, but for me it did help to explore it. Inside, parts of you know there is a mismatch between what you believe to be true and what you felt in those moments. I didnt even realize that fight was going on inside me until my therapist taught me how to understand those events. Then i felt this kind of  *click*  as my feelings and my understanding finally connected after decades. I think that alone is worth it. Its an ending of a pain I never realized was there until it was gone. 

On one hand, only part of you remembers how you.think it was. Other parts of you remember the rest and they wont forget of you decide nit to look. They will just keep doing what they are doing now, slipping put sideways in habits you can seem to break, behaviors you dont really want and reactions that seem to come out of nowhere. Only in the reconnection can you get that to stop. 

On the other hand, you dont have to go digging up memories. Someone traines in family systems theory will be able to see the dysfunction in the ""normal"" memories. That's what my therapist did at first. Digging up the deep buried stuff was more about the damage my ex did. Basically I was the mental equivalent a total rebuild house. Research is showing that we dont have to remember. Its enough to to understand and put the feelings in context. If the system decides the memory is needed for that, it will share it. Otherwise it will remain buried and you get a kind of ""aha"" experience. 

I will also never get reconciliation or acknowledgement. My mom is still lucid as a tack but admitting what she  would probably cause a psychotic break. But you dont do it for the reconciliation. You do it so you can put down the 10 tonne boulder you don't realize you are carrying. With everything I lost and all the pain uncovered, i would still to this work again in heartbeat. Im now free in a way I never realized was even possible.",1619827371

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure that a lot of people (like me) have no idea where they get most of this information, but, wish to be able to also have access to it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, i thought that we could start a comment thread sharing the sources of this type of information that we normaly use so everybody can have access to it (and deppending on how successful this is i could also make in the future a post to share all the info from this comment thread).

&amp;#x200B;

I will start with sources for ""how many people are playing **X** game that i know"":

"NYGiants","t5_2ruqw","I used to play this mobile football sim ProFootball GM and in earlier versions they made it comically easy to trade for picks because they used a visible point value system rather than hidden AI trade values. The point values for young, mid to high-potential QBs were insane enough that offering one 77 overall 3 star QB (30-50,000 points) could net you 3 first rounders (11 K each) or two entire drafts. So you'd trade for a bunch of picks, draft a QB with like 1/3 of them and then flip those QBs for more picks. 

You could easily wind up with all 32 first round picks after enough time haha. It was so busted.",1619827372

Nobody wants to be a burn out fuck faced street rat but willpower and the want to quit just sometimes isnt enough. Sometimes mental illness can make addiction worse, sometimes it can be trauma, but no matter how you look at it 'willpower' is not a good thing to fall back on in an argument. 

Especially because these things are purposely designed to be addictive. Why are we pushing the moral quandry onto the users who just tagged along for the ride instead of the wildly corrupt and shitty people who made it so corrupting in the first place?",1619827374

All of them were really cool about it, said they don‚Äôt ‚Äúhunt that shit‚Äù of course if they were there for the ‚Äúright reason‚Äù i‚Äôm sure they could‚Äôve busted me, or at least would‚Äôve tried. And this is only the most recent encounter with police and drugs i‚Äôve gotten away from, only of those times i got arrested for having LEGAL WEED. didn‚Äôt even have to go to court, the judge didn‚Äôt want to see me

And that‚Äôs interesting to me, i have many friends from chicago and they‚Äôve all said almost the exact same thing.

"insaneparents","t5_3pkgv","Happened with me and my cousins. It was everyone vs everyone and it freaking sucked. I was the main bad guy in everything though so when I was around it was everyone vs me. Then when it was just my two cousins it was always them vs each other. It freaking sucked. Me and my cousins could have been friends. Me and the one my age, we spent a week together, pretty much alone when we were 6/7 years old because I had the chicken pox and he decided he had a sore throat when he found out I was going to his in the day. We played outside all morning playing football, then we played a bit in his room in the afternoon before settling down for a movie. We got along really well and had fun together. Then our grandparents would show up, collect us with the younger cousin and all hell would break loose. Grandparents encouraged it along with the other adults, my mum included. They were such ass holes.

I didn't know my older cousins and my younger cousins are ten and I think fourteen years younger then me. Luckily my ass hole aunt and cousins excluded themselves from the other relatives so they didn't have much impact on the younger and the older ones, the younger of the two older grew up like me, so we understand each other. Didn't know each other growing up though. Was probably for the best as everyone hated me 

Man, our relatives sucked. I don't understand how I was always some awful child from day one. Hell, first thing my nan said about me was ""wouldn't you have rather had a boy?"" She already had two grandsons when I was born...",1619827374

""A series of suspension bridge graphs show similarities between the economies of 1928 and 2007, two years that preceded economic crashes. The economy boomed after World War II in a period of 1947 to 1977 Reich names 'The Great Prosperity,' when inequality was declining. Then came president Ronald Reagan's union-busting efforts and cutting of taxes on the rich in the late 1970s and 1980s; this, along with globalization, technology, job outsourcing, and Wall Street's desire to have their profits as high as possible, resulted in stagnant wages, stilted college attendance rate, and the ruining of manufacturing jobs that made the middle class. In combatting this, the middle and working class took on several techniques that eventually became useless, such as working multiple jobs and longer hours, using houses as banks, and women entering the workforce. An average male worker's annual pay went from $48,302 in 1978 to $33,751 in 2010, while the average pay of someone in the top one-percent grew at a higher rate, from $393,682 to $1.1 million. Now, the 400 richest Americans own more wealth than the bottom 150 million combined; and 42% of Americans born into poverty aren't out of it, compared to 30% of poor British citizens and 25% of the poor living in Denmark."" -[Inequality For All](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inequality_for_All)

With great effort, you pull your eyes away from the mug, easily the most interesting thing in the room, and shift them slightly to the right, to the monitor still displaying the same screen it has for the past ten years.
The screen blinks.
You yawn and silently curse to a god you‚Äôre not quite sure you believe in. Why are you here, you wonder, when you could be cuddled up in bed next to your girlfriend, asleep. It's not like after ten years of absolutely nothing, tonight is the night a transmission is received. Tomorrow, you vow, you are going to take some time and just lay with your girlfriend, enjoying her presence.¬†
With more effort than you care to admit, you slowly rise from the vaguely uncomfortable desk chair provided for you. Partially to stretch out your back, starting to hurt from being as hunched over as it was, and partially because the first three cups of coffee had finally made its way through you.
TRANSMISSION RECEIVED beeps the automated voice of the computer in a tone just shy of being described as cheerful

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Short answer: No, the transformers you're pointing to do not have an impact on sound quality directly as you discussed. 

Longer answer:

These transformers here make up the power supplies of amplifiers. They fall generally into two categories. Linear power supplies are those with whopping big transformers which use wires wrapped around large magnetic cores to turn down (literally, it's dependent on the number of turns around the core) your mains voltage in your house (230V / 110V) to something more usable for the amplifier (20-50V). These are normally then filtered afterwards  to convert the alternating current from your wall into a steady direct current used by amps. The other kind are switch mode power supplies. Much like your computer these use high frequencies and rapidly switch the voltage on and off across a much smaller inductor very efficiently stepping down the voltage to exactly where it needs to be. They are efficient, they are smaller, they have very different filtering requirements. 

In general traditional audio companies favour linear supplies for their simplicity. Consumer audio companies favour switching supplies for their efficiency both in terms of performance as well as cost. But the switching supplies need to be carefully designed and incorporated due to the additional noise they cause. 

Beyond that there are different designs of transformers which have different tradeoffs. They are just tradeoffs and not necessarily an indicator of quality. You linked pictures of EI core transformers. These are generally cheaper and used in older equipment and sometimes larger power amplifiers. Their big downside is they radiate large magnetic fields. More common in audio industries are toroidal transformers which look like large donuts. These radiate smaller electric fields, but have other downsides including their weight, efficiency and propensity to buzz. 

Finally all other things being equal there's also a question of the power requirements for your amplifier. If you have a linear supply with toroids you may still find big differences in transformer size depending if your amplifier is a Class A (highly inefficient) amplifier or a Class-AB or even a Class-D (highly efficient) amplifier, even if all the amplifiers have the same output power rating.",1619827376

"YangForPresidentHQ","t5_j1rvz","&gt; 1) The crop of politicians/parties we have had for the past 20 or so years is not just bad, they are really fucking bad. I mean abysmal. Not just here, but globally. You have standouts, of course, but they seem to have completely lost the plot in what their job actually is and are hell bent on attacking the other side. 

This is cyclical. Recently I went back through American history and looked at who I would vote for in every election. I also looked at the various cycles in American elections in terms of party realignments.

The tail end of party alignments always suck, and we're at that tail end. This time around our specific problem seems to stem from the fact that we got two unresponsive parties, with the democrats in particular being a gerontocracy. Pelosi, Schumer, Biden, they're all old people who have been in power for decades. And the next generation they're trying to cultivate a la harris and buttigieg are too...in the last generation's image. 

We're heading toward a realignment, but until we get there, all hell is gonna break loose. This always happens. The period from 1968-1980 was similarly awful.

After the civil war, you had like 1 decade of decent republican leadership before things descended into corruption and unresponsiveness for a good 20+ years.

Before the civil war, well, we had that civil war because the democrats and whigs wouldnt step up and address the slavery crisis.

The tail end of an alignment always sucks. And that's where we are.

&gt;2) Our major institutions have all failed spectacularly and have not found a way to retool in order to accomplish their missions and rebuild trust. Media(obvious), Medicine, Tech, Legal, Police, Finance, Education, Religion, Business. Again, you can find outliers which haven't (Love you Costco!) but the trend is that they have either corrupted their mission or the tools they use to accomplish their mission are inadequate.

Again, tail end of an era. We're in the ""mounting dysfunction"" stage. In the next decade or so something is gonna have to give to alleviate the mounting pressure. This might lead to massive electoral shifts.

&gt;3) We've confused good times for what is normal. The entire globe has had relatively good times since the 50s. Science, business, politics, all of it expanded and evolved fairly rapidly, bringing their benefits to a huge potion of the globe in short order. Generations grew up while this occured. But we are at the limits of that positive growth, and many of the negative externalities not captured by any economic system of the time were ignored. Such as the environment. So, we don't have anywhere to really grow or go to, to juice our economy again. There is no more 'west' to go. Additionally, much of the low hanging fruit in modern societies has already been picked. 

Again, tail end of an alignment. And this alignment is actually the tail end of a larger alignment that we've been in since FDR. Our politicians are stuck in the 20th century and the ideologies thereof. 

&gt;I'm still trying to figure out how I fit on the political spectrum but at the end of the day I want 3 things. Competence, Integrity, Leadership. I think if we select for that, we get good governance. Regardless of party affiliation. But I'm open to being wrong, we are all figuring this out and most of the old rules seem to be at the end of their warranty.

I want a new vision for the 21st century that distances itself from the past. Old ideologies can only work for so long before dysfunction mounts and things start going to hell like they are now.",1619827377

I pulled the ""next stop"" cord so the driver would stop, and I stood up when the bus was pulling up. The man next to me didn't move aside or stand to let me out, so I stepped over him and on my way past he grabbed my ass and I heard him sniff.  

When I had stepped all the way over I turned around and confronted him. My mom told me that most creeps that try stuff in public don't expect to get confronted, so grill them and point them out. ""WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? YOU THINK IT'S OKAY TO GRAB PEOPLE'S ASSES ON THE BUS? YOU CROSSED THE WRONG WOMAN."" and I punched that douchebag in the nose. 

The driver heard the commotion, parked the bus, came back to see what was up and I told him everything, the man only said ""I'm just minding my business.""

The level of development on the rez is an economic issue tied to historical reasons, but we're talking long in the past. If you're born to a native tribe right now you basically have access to any university in the nation *free* with huge preference, you can start a company and get massive bid preferences on government contracts, and your tribe enjoys a level of sovereignty that is higher than a state government in nearly every way.

I suggest you actually go spend some time on one to learn what it's like.

She asked if I minded taking her. Sure, turned into a 78 minute ride, no traffic, great tip, even stopped at my favorite  pizza place for her because she was famished. 

Icing on this cake? After all the money Uber took from surges, from me today. The Pax could not change it in her app, so I did on mine. 

When I looked at the payout, I got mine with the sure and a great tip! $120!

"gangplankmains","t5_38he7","You should watch Vars video on ""Why no one plays Gangplank"". It's really well made. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NMVuI1Iw86k).

Tl,dr of the points that he makes on which i agree: 

1. Gangplank's damage variance is among the worst in the game, ranging from extremely high to extremely low because of how inconsistent his powder kegs can be if the enemy team has champions/players who can disarm them before they explode;
2. Prior to season 9 his blunders weren't as punishing thanks to his high numbers and utilization of Kleptomancy and Ancient Coin. Ever since those nerfs/removals, the margin for error has tightened drastically. His pressure ceiling has to be much higher than his opponent(s) in order to be a desirable pick relative to someone else due to his weaknesses;
3. The way his playstyle is designed makes it so that Gangplank can't solo carry games. His pressure and teamfight control can only be fully maximized as punishers or follow-up damage after someone else engages, since he lacks immediate and safe poke or trade options outside of a double barrel combo;
4. Gangplank's itemization has been awkward ever since the removal of crit chance from Trinity Force. Because he lacks both a quick trade pattern and all in, he doesn't get as satisfying of a benefit from building items since they don't improve his playstyle by making it easier, faster or better, outside of dealing more damage.

Basically he's really inconsistent and can't initiate fights or engage alone. He has short range but not enough survivability to actually enter the melee fight. He loses against a lot of bruisers in a 1v1 and is resource hungry (since he is a late game champion).

80% of his damage is lost as soon as his barrels are defused. A great presence of mind and reflexes are then required to compensate for the fact that your damage is influenced by the enemy actions.",1619827378

Big deal.  
Spent years there myself both before and during my uni studies there, all my mates were gun nuts. Went shooting with them regularly. 
So no they wouldn't be upset about what I said, in fact they'd be joking about it themselves.

But, just like welloiledsling said, it‚Äôs still a nice parka and for a bit cheaper than I would‚Äôve gotten it on a re-enactment site lmao. Plus there was a helmet cover in one of the pockets so I guess it‚Äôs not entirely a loss üòÇ

Nothing too crazy, but if it had hit me in the head or chest I would've probably died out there. 

I added a level 4 plate carrier to my shooting gear. It looks LARP-y but when you're shooting in an area full of rocks... I'd rather look like a dork and be alive than be dead and not look like a dork.

Generally, a braille display can show anywhere between 12 to 88 characters at once, and there are buttons along the bottom, often referred to as thumb keys, to essentially scroll or pan through the available text, one ""lineful"" at a time.

What you can use it with depends on the display itself; generally you can use it with a pc or a mac over a USB or, for very old models, serial connection. The more modern displays will also have Bluetooth support which will let them be used wirelessly with both computers and phones (iOS and to a lesser degree Android).

"neoconNWO","t5_3kcxv","&gt;I keep hearing about how the ‚ÄúReagan era is over.‚Äù In fact, I hear it virtually every time I tune into MSNBC. Doyle McManus, writing in the Los Angeles Times‚Äîwhere I am a columnist‚Äîdubs President Biden the ‚Äúanti-Reagan.‚Äù John Harris at Politico makes essentially the same argument. In fairness, this is a bipartisan observation; here‚Äôs former Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker saying pretty much the same thing. 

&gt;The linchpin of this argument‚Äîwhich obviously has merit given Biden‚Äôs fairly radical plans to inflate the government and national debt‚Äîis that Reagan said ‚Äúgovernment is the problem,‚Äù and Biden thinks, to put it bluntly, that government is the solution. To what? Well, pretty much everything. 

&gt;Again, there‚Äôs truth to the argument, but it rests on a lot of sloppy assumptions and stolen bases. First, a lot of people forget the full quote: ‚ÄúIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.‚Äù That‚Äôs a very different assertion. There‚Äôs this myth that government was cut to the bone under Reagan. Yet the government was bigger on Reagan‚Äôs last day of office than his first. He promised to abolish the Department of Education, but by the end of his presidency, its budget doubled. But that‚Äôs a topic for another time.  

&gt;Second, when the COVID-19 pandemic began, very few conservatives and Republicans disagreed that the government has a role in this present crisis. That‚Äôs why the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Senate agreed to spend trillions on economic and public health efforts to mitigate the crisis. I‚Äôve argued in this space countless times that pandemics, like wars, are supposed to be tackled by the government. The objection to Biden‚Äôs program is that he wants to spend trillions of dollars on policies that have nothing to do with the present crisis. 

&gt;But that‚Äôs all grist for another day. The thing I find fascinating is that there is only one topic that obsesses the liberals celebrating the ‚ÄúBiden era‚Äù of big government as the solution to all that ails us is. That topic‚Äîwait for it‚Äîis policing. To be sure, left-wingers don‚Äôt all support efforts to ‚Äúdefund the police,‚Äù but it is very rare to hear any of them push back against those who do. As I noted on Wednesday, they tend to let the ‚Äúdefund the police‚Äù crowd claim that police forces are modern incarnations of slave patrols without any skepticism. 

&gt;But here‚Äôs the thing: There is no more central institution to government qua government than policing. Police are part of this thing called ‚Äúlaw enforcement.‚Äù And law enforcement is pretty much the essence of government. Governments make laws. Laws are meaningless if they are not enforced. 

&gt;The first states probably began as a form of ‚Äústationary banditry,‚Äù as Mancur Olson argued. But even then, inherent to the idea of government was the enforcement of rules. That‚Äôs what police do. You can change their name, you can take away their guns, you can do all sorts of things‚Äîgood, bad, wise, or dumb‚Äîin an effort to reform policing. But if you want to make sure laws are enforced, someone‚Äôs gotta do the enforcing. 

&gt;George Washington probably never said, ‚ÄúGovernment is not reason; it is not eloquence; it is force. Like fire, it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.‚Äù But whoever really did say it had a point. Let‚Äôs say Congress passes a nice, progressive law like a wealth tax on billionaires and Elon Musk refuses to pay. Eventually, after all the paper gets pushed and lawyers get paid, the police are going to knock on his door (assuming he doesn‚Äôt hyper-tube to some place without extradition) and either say ‚ÄúPay up,‚Äù or ‚ÄúCome with us.‚Äù I guess you could rely on citizen arrests or posses instead of a traditional police force. But in a modern, diverse, and very large society, that sounds like a recipe for headaches. 

&gt;Now, I‚Äôm not arguing that, because you have to have police‚Äîand you do‚Äîtheir behavior can‚Äôt be regulated. I don‚Äôt know anybody of any ideological stripe who doesn‚Äôt agree that cops should follow some fairly strict rules. Anarchists of the left and right might stupidly think we don‚Äôt need cops at all, but even they agree that if we‚Äôre going to have cops, they should be constrained by laws and regulations. The only argument is what those laws and regulations should look like. 

&gt;And that‚Äôs the amusing irony. All of these people who mock the idea that ‚ÄúGovernment is the problem,‚Äù and giddily celebrate that the ‚ÄúGovernment is the problem‚Äù era is over, are simultaneously saying that the most central and concrete manifestation of government in America (and everywhere else) is a problem. They alternate between arguing that one set of government officials have too much power over the lives of Americans and arguing that another set of government officials should be given vastly more power. Of course, there‚Äôs a difference between federal bureaucrats and local cops, but power can corrupt bureaucrats too. And when it does, the bureaucrats aren‚Äôt the ones who knock on your door.  

&gt;Let‚Äôs stipulate that liberals are right when they say police abuse is the most pressing national crisis right now. Another way of saying that might be: ‚ÄúIn this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.‚Äù

Esto nos da seguridad jur√≠dica, ante un ente de Gobierno. Asimismo, GBM como retenedor de impuestos, te cobra y emite comprobante fiscal el cual se registra autom√°ticamente en el sistema del SAT manifestando que ya te retuvo el porcentaje de impuesto (ISR) que la ley marca.

En cuesti√≥n de la venta de acciones durante la MOASS, es otro t√≥pico un poco dif√≠cil, ya que si bien la acci√≥n es tuya, GBM sigue administr√°ndola, y si la plataforma se cae, o bloquean el numero de acciones que puede uno comprar, como lo que pas√≥ en enero, pudiese haber una litis, pero ser√≠a un procedimiento largo y dif√≠cil, sin mencionar que mundialmente, no hay precedentes. Sin embargo, considero que GBM es la mejor opci√≥n actualmente ya que una vez que tengas tu dinero no te preocupas de tus impuestos (solo de hacer tu declaraci√≥n anual de impuestos, que ya en autom√°tico debe tener tus movimientos de inversi√≥n), adem√°s que todo esta dentro de la norma.

"composer","t5_2sjib","&gt;but then realized a lot of the software i use will eventually stop supporting the Intel stuff.

Not if you don't update it.

My philosophy is get a working system together, then disconnect it from the internet ;-)

Go over to the Logic forum and see how many stupidly bought an M1 and now nothing they have works. And they just took the 10.6.2 update and Logic has destroyed projects. I still don't trust Catalina!

I think you're as likely to find that you're going to have more issues with Big Sur than the M1 in particular.

Sorry about the crash, that always sucks. Good luck sorting it out - Apple is horrible about this.

I think though the software ""eventually not supporting intel"" is going to be a lot further down the road - unless you again want to stay on top of the latest OS and keep invalidating all the stuff you paid good money for...

I never mentioned capital gains, in context its clear my ""cap"" reference was to SALT caps 

&gt;I confess, after looking at my taxes, I found that hard to believe, but I have no reason to doubt /u/StreetWalkingCheetah.

For all intents and purposes I'm sure he's telling the truth, however that still makes him an exception/rarity to the overall rule, rather than a typical case to reference when making policy 

&gt;I said ""SALT cap"" Nothing about Capital Gains. You seem to be deliberately going out of your way to deny that some people were adversely affected by the SALT cap.

Yes a slight increase in taxes is annoying, I get that. But should we scrap the billions in tax revenue from oligarchs just so that one person (and a few others) can save a few bucks? Is that the lesson? 

Overall as a trend, the SALT cap almost entirely allowed tax cuts for working and middle classes, while increasing them on the ultra rich. Overall, not 100.00% of the time.

There are always exceptions to rules, and I am quite confident I can find a few middle/working class people who saw incomes increase with the passage of policies like NAFTA, despite such policies being bad for those classes overall.

It used to be a common liberal meme to mock Republicans who pushed dumb austerity measures under ""working class"" rhetoric, like the family guy tea party meme. That's the vibe I see popping up with this SALT cap.",1619827382

"FireEmblemThreeHouses","t5_kcm0c","Byleth is best as a wyvern. It's just such a strong class and flying around with a bow is great. I always get my bow rank up since its basically a watered down version of claudes class which is great.

Yep, edelgard does best as a wyvern. Just make sure to raise her authority for the cichol wyvern battalion and her armour for weight-3. With axe prowess, death blow, darting blow, weight -3 and hit +20 she becomes an absurdly strong player phase unit. You can get weight -3, super early and I highly recommend it so she doesn't get doubled as much. 

Alternatively grab a dark seal (you get a free one from jeritza post TS but you'll need 2) and make him a dark bishop. Crimson flower hates horse units so it could end up being better just for that chapter. Either way they're both great options. Train up his authority too, he makes good use of the macuil evil repelling Corp.

Yep, you may want to grow some yellow seeds to boost his magic for further warp but this is great

Don't bother with swords, petra appreciates the axe fair. Give her alert stance+ and (if you have the DLC) the secret transport Co, or whatever your highest avo battalion is, then grab a killer axe and battalion wrath and have fun.

Yep. Felix is great as a war master. Try train his authority, its a pain but he can use the fraldarius troops which gives +20 crit. I was able to reach 80 crit by AM ch 22

Just go wyvern. Ferdinand does so much damage with swift strikes anyway and like you said the extra avo is great. In fact you don't even need alert stance, he has innate +25 avo on top of anything he has fro. Stats, I still give him alert stance though, I remember doing the petra bernie paralogue and having sylvain hold off the entire right group of reinforcements on his own until my other units got over thanks to alert stance and a forest. 

Dorothea should just be a dancer. Her damage is bad so she won't make much use of the extra spells and being able to grab more levels can help. Train her authority early for rally charm as its +40, hit with gambits, crucial for early game.

Bernie is exceptional. I like bow knight for 4 range but flying is great too, you can always get to 1hp with blessing (gaurantees you survive the first attack) and a guard adjutant (guarantees you survive the second) at 1 hp vengeance is one of the strongest combat arts in the game, then you can give her vantage and battalion wrath and watch her decimate enemies on player phase and enemy phase

I highly recommend jeritza. He's fast, hits hard and has great ranks and abilities. Darting blow is incredible and his naturally great strength means he has very good AS, scyth of serial is 6 weight with 30 crit and he gets lance crit +10 really fast thanks to mastermind. Its a devastating combo of hitting twice with a nearly 50% crit rate. You could probably play around with battalion desperation meaning he would attack twice in a row with good damage and crit rates but you could also just stick to a safer build. Grab counterattack from death knight and certify as a wyvern just in case the final chapter screws you over.",1619827382

And you've already used a sentence and word that Chris Roberts has no idea the meaning of....

&gt; It's like someone saw something cool, didn't get it, but still thought to copy it, but copied all the wrong parts. 

And now you've stumbled on the path of Chris Roberts...

&gt;This is like someone seeing ""Apocalypse Now"" and then saying ""Yeah, that  was an awesome movie! I want to make a scene where they come in with  spaceships with that valkyr-song and shoot all the vanduul-soldiers in  the enemy-village and afterwards they go surfing under a purple sky!  Man, what an awesome movie full of meaning that was with a so cool  scene!"" 

BINGO! This is what Christo Roberto thinks! How did you channel his creative genius?!!

You could be twice as strong and it wouldn't have the chemical issues of steroids, which people take today even with those risks anyway. People replace healthy tissue TODAY just for aesthetics. So I was taking for granted I didn't have to get too deep into that premise from the show being demonstrably false in everyday life.

My point about Geordi openly having a prosthetic is to show that it's not some sort of red line against it like there is with genetic alterations as we learn about in DS9 with Bashir. Like I get the sense in Trek's world if you can mechanically correct it it's fine, but you couldn't use gene therapy to cure Down syndrome for instance.",1619827384

Lets just say I had the worst time of my life. I was playing Gwen and he suprisingly wasnt weaker than a normal Tank shen. He still could duel me 1v1 (I felt behind early game because I was limit testing) as if he was building tank with the same damage and tankiness.

But the difference is THAT HE IS EVEN MORE USEFUL IN A TEAMFIGHT WITHOUT LOOSING OUT ON ANYTHING. He was as tanky as a tank shen, barely lost damage and was 1000% more useful.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean, I like playing Shen but playing against this build is just disgusting, its op.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I played RedempSHEN myself today and lets just say.... My impact on the map tripled. This build genuinly feels OP, you barely loose damage or tankiness (I mean, Shen doesnt deal that much damage anyways since he is a support tank).

Well, I got in the ladies coach and I could see from the corner of my eye that he was standing in the coach right next to mine and staring at me the whole time, I pretended to use my phone, then I get off at a long intersection to change metros and he catched up with me again. Started making small talk, and as I was so nervous and this was the first time a stranger was just randomly being so talkative, I VERY STUPIDLY started giving him real answers to his questions, like my name, which area I live in, where I study, etc. etc. He told me he almost took a job at my college (yeah right), and gave me the most weird random compliments. This guy just won't buzz off even though I'm trying to be as rude as I can be. 


The intersection finally came to an end and he again asked me for directions, I said I don't know his route from here and his reply was ""Oh you already wanna get rid of me huh? Hahahah"" Then he asked why I only travel in the ladies coach (because of creeps like him) and my number, I quickly said I don't give that out to strangers and rannnnn to my metro ASAP.

"incremental_games","t5_2yia0","I take it as a sign. I'm not sure how iOS does it, but the Google App Store rewards apps that generate more revenue with more visibility. This evidently causes app designers to attempt to maximize revenue at any cost, and look for the intersection between ""annoyance"" and ""willing to pay"". 

But, as attempts are made, the general populace becomes more used to large, useless purchases. In 2009 when Angry Birds came out, games with $100 purchases were blasphemous. Before that, before smart phones, any DLC had to be full game expansions (although that could be due to poor internet speeds making small digital add-ons unwieldly). 

Granted, Super Retro World does not appear to be a chart topper, so there is hope that the populace does not approve of their business decisions. But seeing any designers trying this means that attempts to maximize profits at the cost of good game design hasn't stopped.

Here‚Äôs what I ran before
https://i.imgur.com/trmtGXJ.jpg

No matter what I did I had loose steering and tie rod roll. By moving the drag link (steering arm) to an independent mount on the knuckle I fixed my tie rod roll, and the heims I found to be tighter feeling than the tie rod ends I used before. An added benefit is the much beefier brakes and rotors, as well as the over the axle track bar mount with the better steering angle fixing my bump steer. Some might add that you get higher clearance from the over the knuckle mount, as well as an independent drag link getting rid of one of the sheer points.",1619827385

I have the game on both console and PC as of a month ago, I have to say the DLC is the biggest downside to console. 

As with basically every other game on both console and PC, the console version is going to appeal to more casual gamers and so the console community has it's own feel to it. Still worth playing.",1619827385

When I was 17 a guy cornered me on an otherwise empty bus and started rubbing my thigh and moaning. I got out at my stop and had to get on another bus. I waited for as long as I could before hopping on my next bus, making sure he wasn't already on it. At the last second, he ran up and gets on the bus too. 

He kept being creepy but the bus driver did nothing, even thoughl I kept trying to talk to him. I called my mum, asking if she could pick up _blueberry waffles_ from the store. This became our ""help me"" codeword after having read it in a Garfield comic (yes, really). When I got to my stop, it was already dark out. I got up to leave, and he stood up as well, following me out. Outside were my parents, waiting for me. They were the only people at the bus stop, had I not had that codeword I don't want to know what would've happened to me.

At a younger age (14-15) I was being groomed by a much older guy from my high school. He was an adult. He told me he'd commit suicide or self harm if I didn't do all sorts of disgusting things with him. I recently read that groomers groom their environment as much as they do their victim and this couldn't be more true. This guy managed to convince all the adults around me that he was just caring for me, that I was mature for my age, and that it was totally consensual. Meanwhile I didn't know what to do and I was in over my head. This didn't stop until I quit high schoo, and the social media platform he used to talk to me got shut down. Yep, I had to go to another school and rely on a technological development to get rid of this jerk.

Also just yesterday I was in the park with my partner. Some weird tweaker dude was talking to us. I don't mind that stuff much, I have noticed that when you just stay calm and go like ""oh yeah, for real? Wow"" when they spout their bs they normally don't do much. My partner didn't trust him though and he turned out to be right. Dude started sexually harassing 2 girls that walked by. My partner (6'6"") and I (small but can look really angry) sorta jumped into action, him a little faster than me. He told the guy to fuck off and leave these girls alone. When the tweaker moved on to a different woman, my partner deadass chased the guy out of the park. I stayed with the girls to check if they were OK (they were fine just confused) while my partner kept tweakerman away. That was wild.

ETA: there are way more but it's past 2AM and I want to sleep. Also; I'm not conventionally attractive (I say this not as self depreciation but moreso as an objective fact). Big nose, odd teeth, rectangular build. I dress like I'm a guy half the time. And I STILL get men doing this shit to me. I know from my more conventionally attractive friends that it happens to them ten times more often. Pretty girls, I used to envy you, but now I realise it can be a blessing and a curse.",1619827385

"beingaDIK","t5_2ia9mv","Dealbreakers - RPGM games, sandbox games, games that are too grindy. I like free roams or minigames and tracking stats but do not ever give me repeatable events that I must do over and over to raise a skill or some shit.

Graphics and animations are nice but they are secondary to the writing. An author who is actually able to write out a sex scene and describe it without it sounding like it was written a virgin ""he stuck his big pp in her small hooha"" is better than a perfectly looped lewd scene.

Art style I'm not picky about as long as its good. Photorealism like City of Broken Dreamers is cool but so is comic book style like Our Red String. As long as the body's are well proportioned. Stop giving me 36FFF breasts that look like balloons (looking at you Bella).

Some games are all about the kinks and lewd scenes which is fine but you gotta gotta have a back story that is at least interesting. Otherwise you end up with shit like "" A Knights Tale"". Tons and tons of sex but literally nothing else ever happens. Character wakes up, bathes, practices fighting, fucks a different girl, goes to sleep - literally over and over. Compare that to ""to be a king"" which is very very similair in as farm as harem of young girls kink and medieval fantasy genre but the MC actually does different things throughout the day between the sex so its not monotonous.

Other games though that aren't kink focused I prefer to be story focused rather than lewd scene focused (i.e BADIK - not really any kinks in it which is fine because I love the story and the characters and those stand on their own).",1619827385

However, it seems very flavorful for the Mystic class!

Maybe a member of Jim Culver's jazz band, it could fit with the Skull token interaction? A drummer? A basist maybe?

Survivor offclass is overall sort of ""regular, salt of the earth"" sort of people... Agnes, were she only a waitress would be fully survivor, but she's got the the 'reincarnated Hyperborean sorcerer'-backstory, hence the Mystic mainclass. So it could be any regular Joe and Jane with some sort of strange connection or heritage. Maybe a nanny that got carried away by Nighgaunts to the jagged peaks of Thok? Or a cab driver who got mind-swapped with a Yithian? Maybe a typist who had her brain transplanted by Mi-Go scientists? A janitor who got swept up by a cult of Yog-Sothoth? Or a roadworker with poetic inclinations who started dreaming dreams of the sunken R'lyeh and the horrors who sleeps at the depths of the ocean?

There's plenty of ways the Mythos forces could seep into the life of any ""normal"" individual, and perhaps empower them in strange ways! Personally I'd look to any regular 1920's profession, and try and combine it with any of the variety of Mythos creatures or entities that you'd feel make the most sense.",1619827386

&gt;&gt; En una ocasi√≥n, cuando se encontraba metiendo sus narices en comprender a las parejas, Ver√≥nica recuerda que quiso formar parte de la Sociedad Argentina de Sexualidad Humana y se lo negaron: ‚ÄúEra la loca que hablaba de cosas espirituales.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ver√≥nica asegura que si ahora volviera a estudiar su tema de tesis ser√≠a otro o bien se dedicar√≠a a una investigaci√≥n por fuera del marco acad√©mico.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì _Tengo la hip√≥tesis de que los temas que los animales nos traen son los temas que la persona necesita trabajar terap√©uticamente.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_Estoy convencida de que hay una conciencia creciente de la valoraci√≥n de todos los seres vivos como seres de derecho y que esto incluye a los animales.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ver√≥nica Keingstein no es vegana y trata en la medida de lo posible de no comer carne.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_S√≠ como pescado, huevo y me da una culpa horrible comer vacas o pollos.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_Cre√© la carrera que yo hubiera querido estudiar._
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_Ahora me rodeo de personas que vibran como yo y los v√≠nculos que ya no vibran as√≠ se caen solos, se terminan.
&gt;
&gt;Ver√≥nica Kenigstein no siente que hablar con animales sea algo raro, pero es consciente de que es un camino nuevo, en el que es pionera.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_Muchas veces me siento no parte, me siento expulsada y hasta un poco loca, pero me doy cuenta que esto es √∫til, que da alivio y que ayuda a que cada uno de los seres sea el ser que vino a ser a este planeta._

3. american de-centralization of education / distrust in state-capacity

If American Gini coefficient was closer to norway vs. being one of the worst in the OECD, college arms race would be tamped down big time. 

If America had a more functioning racial relations without massive disparities in outcomes when looking at various racial groups, institutions wouldn't be pressured to create black boxes as much shape classes. Furtheremore, there would be stronger state capacity and equalization of opportunities unlike the vast disparities you see today. 

Lastly, America fundamentally beieves in de-centralization of most goods/services so public education and standardization of procoess/finding info is by design confusing. 

all of these points are intersectional with each other and give rise to the Frankenstein that is the American university system.",1619827386

"SonicTheHedgehog","t5_2rh21","You'd lose your money then, no one's gonna love Forces in ten years because it DIDN'T have passion and ambition.

Actually, the series hasn't had that big of a problem with having ambition and not reaching it, the only game I can think of that did would be '06 itself, but even then, wasn't as bad a game as everyone thought it was. It's just a bunch of reviewers overblew the flaws and whined about the Sonic and Elise stuff, (which literally no one but a minority of vocal morons care about, by the way.)

These same reviewers, by the way, were the ones saying 3 was ""the last good Sonic game,"" well, them and the man-children in this fandom. I'd say it was peer pressure that forced people to think '06 was so bad for so long, but, now that those fans have grown older, they've learned that those people were full of shit, especially since worse games have come out since then, like Boom and Lost World.

Bottom line, it's not a case of ""time heals all wounds"" it's a case of ""seeing through bullshit.""

I also find it odd you'd lump SA2 with games you see as failures, since everyone agrees it's the best Sonic game. And no, don't give me that ""dark and edgy"" bullshit, it's not an argument, give me actual examples or don't say anything.

Admiration for military is a festish?  How did u determine that?

We haven't fought for freedom for decades?  You managed to be wrong on both sides of your alimentary canal.

A. A strong military is a precursor to peace.  NK stopped threatening to shoot missiles over Guam under a strong military stance.  Iran stopped jumping our Navy ships.  All these things were commonplace when Obama reduced our military to 1800's numbers.

B. Muslim Brotherhood, Al Qaeda, Taliban, Iranian Guard General, and those bastards who killed/poisoned Syrian kids, Druze, Jews, Christians, Kurds, Americans, etc., were righteously (albeit oo mercifully) were killed out for freedom!

You need to grow up and realize not everyone sits in their bedroom waiting for their mom to leave their Pop Tarts outside their locked bedroom door.

No military does not determine there will be no need; quite the opposite.

When have YOU put yourself on the line to stand up for someone at the risk of even a punch in the nose, let alone to be on the wrong end of a gun?  A fetish??  Ura moron.",1619827387

I had my partner hide 3 of them in our apartment.  First one I found right away, second one he hid on the upper part of the door frame of our bathroom, I was checking inside, but could not get it to lock on to the HERE, then I went on the other side of the door and found it, so it knew it was there, just not on the other side of the wall.  The third one it had a little trouble locking on to, at first it said it might be on another level, but once I was in the same room, I found it.

I think a lot of people are hoping these are going to work a lot more advanced then they are designed for right now.  You can't share them in a family.  Their not designed to be anti-theft deterrents or trackers.  They're more for ""oh I can't find where I put my keys down.""

&gt;Pero una foto de ni√±a, a los cuatro a√±os cargando a un perro al que amaba, le sembr√≥ un deseo irracional: quer√≠a poder hablar con animales.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Al norte de Buenos Aires, en las profundidades de Escobar, Ver√≥nica camina rodeada de un verde frondoso, hace segundos que sali√≥ de una casa peque√±a en pleno pastizal y con ella vino al encuentro una perra marr√≥n claro de actitud amigable.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì_Yo quer√≠a hablar con animales y en un viaje al Cerro Uritorco de repente ocurri√≥.
&gt;
&gt;Durante el tiempo que pasa en casa Ver√≥nica dedica gran parte de su d√≠a a estar con sus animales, les cocina, pasea con ellos y les habla.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **‚Äì**_Los perros son como los guardianes del mundo f√≠sico, nos conectan con el cuerpo y con el presente.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El d√≠a antes de la entrevista, Ver√≥nica llor√≥ todo el d√≠a.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Una semana antes del encuentro, al regreso de un viaje a Mendoza, Ver√≥nica descubri√≥ que Princesa, su gata de cinco a√±os, se hab√≠a ido.
&gt;
&gt;Cada vez que Ver√≥nica piensa en Princesa los ojos se le llenan de l√°grimas, no puede evitarlo.
&gt;
&gt;En m√°s de una oportunidad hablar con animales ha sido para ella hacer crecer ra√≠ces de las piedras.
&gt;
&gt;Una vez mi viejo, que siempre quiso que me fuera bien, me dec√≠a: ‚Äú¬øpor qu√© no le ped√≠s a alguna empresa que fabrica alimento para animales que te esponsoree?‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; A lo largo de su trayectoria intentando comprender v√≠nculos, Ver√≥nica Kenigstein escribi√≥ dos libros, el primero se llam√≥ **‚ÄúSexos encontrados.
&gt;
&gt;Entre risas asegura que habl√≥ de parejas cuando necesit√≥ entender la relaci√≥n con la suya: ‚Äú_Porque en las relaciones humanas a veces queremos controlar y que las cosas sean como uno quiere, lo mismo hacemos con nuestros animales_‚Äù.
&gt;
&gt;Yo le doy la informaci√≥n a la persona para que ella act√∫e, intento devolverles el poder a la persona y al animal, porque no me gusta que dependan de m√≠_.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ### **El poder animal**
&gt;
&gt;&gt; ‚Äì _S√© que si voy a hablar con un psicoanalista, al estilo de un terapeuta, me va a decir que estoy loca, que c√≥mo se me va a manifestar en el cuerpo la emoci√≥n de los animales._
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Para Ver√≥nica la medicina y la psicolog√≠a tradicional ponen etiquetas y eso nos impide conectar con una dimensi√≥n espiritual.
&gt;
&gt;Los animales nos ayudan a ver como s√≠ es posible._

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt; mind that receiving institution may charge a fee for incoming ACATS 

On the other hand, depending on the size of your account, many receiving institutions will not only not charge you a fee for the inbound account transfer, they may even reimburse you for the $75 fee that RH charges. They might not list it on their web site, but it's worth contacting a few brokerages and saying ""I'm planning on moving my brokerage account, but RH is charging me $75 to do it. Would [name of institution] reimburse the fee if I go with you?"" $75 is well within the range of standard incentives for a new customer account, so it shouldn't be too hard to find some brokerage that will go along with it.

I wouldn't recommend picking a brokerage strictly based on the new account incentives, but to me, they're all mostly the same. I use Vanguard; the web site is a little clunky, but it's fine, and I trust that they're not going to try and nickel and dime me, or find ways to pass along hidden costs (the big hidden cost to look out for is low interest rates on your cash sweep accounts; Vanguard sweeps me in to some reasonable money market fund).",1619827391

"GunAccessoriesForSale","t5_h4uwp","Paypal offers two different services.  Paypal Friends and Family (F&amp;F) has zero fees, but offer no protections and makes the buyer vulnerable to scammers.  Paypal Goods and Services (G&amp;S) charges an additional ~3% of the item price (actually 2.9% plus $0.30), but provides the buyer insurance in case the seller dissapears without providing the item.  Paypal does prohibit [some specific items](https://web.archive.org/web/20180409201310/https://www.paypal.com/us/selfhelp/article/what-is-paypal%E2%80%99s-policy-on-transactions-that-involve-firearms-faq585) but has a ""catch all comment"" that may apply to others, so NO NOTES IN PAYPAL. As a general guideline, if a buyer wants to use Paypal G&amp;S rather than F&amp;F, it is expected that they will absorb the +3% fee for the increased protections that it provides them. [Here is a easy fee calculator](https://thefeecalculator.com/). If a seller specifies a F&amp;F price, assume that is his ""to his pocket"" cost. However these terms are up for negotiation between the buyer and seller. It is recommended to pay via G&amp;S and absorb the fee. If the seller mandates F&amp;F, be wary of a scam and use a [Scam prevention method](https://www.reddit.com/r/GunAccessoriesForSale/wiki/proxy).  Additionally, Paypal has deleted the account of several members due to using F&amp;F for purchases.  Paypal considers this theft from them (you're stealing their fees), and a violation of their [ToS](https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full). DO NOT put notes in F&amp;F payments as it is evidence you are violating PP ToS.

No.  Those who have refused to be vaccinated should not be legally mandated to do so, but participation in social activities should remain curtailed for the voluntarily unvaccinated until such a time that COVID is no longer a threat.

They shouldn't be denied basic fundamental services such as access to grocery stores, government offices, or medical facilities, but everything else including restaurants, bars, employment, sporting events, concerts, public gatherings, etc., should require possession of proof of vaccination.  

I'm fucking done with these people.  If they want to play fuck fuck games and refuse the shot, fine.  The rest of us can get back to our lives and they can be segregated to prevent further outbreaks, at least until such a time that infection rates have dropped to near-zero rates.",1619827392

1st level: Dex+Wis AC is fine, but the bonus action feature is much too powerful, especially at low levels.

Channel Divinity: I suggest modifying this feature to target creatures (except undead and constructs) with different in combat/out of combat results. If this feature only applies to humanoids, it's usefulness might be limited in many campaigns. The out of combat result could be ""On a failure, the creature is charmed by you for 10 minutes. While charmed, it views all creatures as beloved friends.""
The in combat result could be ""the creature becomes intoxicated and suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks for 1 minute, or until it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw made at the end of it's turn."" I would limit the use to one creature, or at least a limited number of creatures.

I'm not sure about the other two features without seeing how they function in play. Overall, nice work, and I hope to see more versions in the future.",1619827393

"Lexus","t5_2sflg","About a month ago I had commented on a post here where a white LS460(?) was being towed away, saying ‚Äúcommon sight for my IS.‚Äù 
So here‚Äôs the story for my beloved paperweight daily driven project car... it‚Äôs also my first car. 
I bout the car in 2018, thought it was cool because 2jz blah blah blah. It was a pile with some polish and shine to distract from the disaster hidden beneath it. Got it inspected and received nearly two pages of repair suggestions after I had bought it. Fixed what I could but the engines till decided to blow in January of 2020. So I thought, oh boy what a perfect opportunity to get my dream engine swap. I‚Äôll buy a 2jz gte and all will be great with the world... we all know how 2020 went and my car wasn‚Äôt spared from its curse. Lack of budget on my part being young and dumb didnt help either. The car runs and drives but not reliably. It‚Äôs held together with hopes and dreams under the hood. Wires cut and connectors leading nowhere. Oil blasting out of the BOV, and half the sensors not communicating with my car... because they can‚Äôt. I had failed to do my own research when I got this swap done putting all my faith in the shop that was doing it. Oh boy. 
Just so I don‚Äôt run on forever, it‚Äôs one thing after another with this car. Most recently it likes drowning itself in fuel. It stalls regularly, it‚Äôs an automatic. And I still need to put a catch can on it.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Pe√ßo desculpas pelo texto grande. S√£o muitas ideias e √© meio complicado sintetizar tudo com todas as nuances envolvidas. 

√â o seguinte, o SFLB (o movimento que tu falou da meritocracia) defende mais a quest√£o da meritocracia dentro do movimento. Os caras tem um monte de projetos sociais feitos pelos membros e √© basicamente uma rede de ajuda e colabora√ß√£o m√∫tua. A diferen√ßa √© que eles defendem a caridade voluntaria, baseada no ju√≠zo de cada indiv√≠duo. Se voc√™ quiser parte de uma associa√ß√£o que se junta para fazer atividades sociais, como a Ma√ßonaria e o Rotary Club, ou fazer suas boas a√ß√µes individualmente, parab√©ns. Se voc√™ n√£o quiser, √© uma quest√£o sua e voc√™ mesmo sofrer√° as consequ√™ncias futuras de suas a√ß√µes. √â um projeto em escala mundial com as unidades de cada pa√≠s associadas e independentes entre si. 

O Livres √© mais complicado. Era uma divis√£o do PSL at√© chegar o Bolsonaro. Era uma divis√£o que estava crescendo dentro do partido e havia o projeto de tornar a linha dominante, mudando o nome do PSL para Livres. A diferen√ßa √© que como era um partido pequeno e ""limpo"", em compara√ß√£o com os outros partidos, o Bolsonarismo bateu na porta. Os chefes, como Luciano Bivar, acharam melhor pegar o Bolsonaro, um candidato pronto e ""popular"" para chegar a ser o partido chefe do governo j√° na pr√≥xima elei√ß√£o do que trabalhar a imagem do partido do zero para ser eleito em um futuro incerto, enfim, decidiram pegar a estrada curta ao inv√©s da longa. Logo que o cara chegou, eles decidiram se separar, afirmando ser incoerente algu√©m que defendia a liberdade dos indiv√≠duos apoiar um projeto de ditador. Os que se alinhavam a eles foram para outros e eles, at√© agora, ent√£o na constru√ß√£o dessa bancada. N√≥s sabemos o resultado dessa escolha e sabemos que os caras que permaneceram no PSL cometeram um erro, sendo o 17 considerado hoje um n√∫mero maldito.

Eu s√≥ acho que quem diz que a ideia do liberalismo √© contra pobre, que √© algo elitista, nunca conheceram o embasamento te√≥rico. Se vissem, veriam que os caras como Thatcher e Reagan foram caras bancados por bilion√°rios para chegarem ao poder com a bandeira da ideologia e usarem o Estado para aplicarem pol√≠ticas que privilegiaram os grandes empres√°rios (pacotes bilion√°rios de ajuda governamental com dinheiro impresso ou dos contribuintes, aumento dos gastos militares, privil√©gios protecionistas, privatiza√ß√µes de compadrio, etc.) em detrimento dos pequenos, o completo oposto do que a ideologia defende que √© correto. N√£o √© uma ideologia oposta ao fornecimento de educa√ß√£o e sa√∫de ou bem estar aos mais pobres, √© uma ideologia que defende um modelo alternativo para dar isso. A diferen√ßa √© que enquanto quem defende o aumento do Estado e da atua√ß√£o dele acha que devemos dar mais dinheiro ao Estado para que ele mesmo d√™ esses servi√ßos diretamente (como a educa√ß√£o p√∫blica e o SUS funcionam hoje) a alternativa √© que o Estado d√™ o dinheiro que seria gasto (como um UBI/RBU) para que as fam√≠lias escolham uma op√ß√£o privada ao mesmo tempo em que facilite ao m√°ximo a entrada de concorrentes estrangeiros com o objetivo de ferrar com os corporativistas nacionais e9 aumentar absurdamente a competi√ß√£o/concorr√™ncia no mercado, o que faz os pre√ßos baixar. Se sobrar dinheiro, ele fica com as fam√≠lias. Isso incentiva o povo a procurar os melhores pre√ßos e como cada individuo quer o melhor que puder, a tend√™ncia √© que eles busquem a op√ß√£o que melhor concilia pre√ßo com qualidade. Existem monte de propostas como essas, as quais eu acho bem mais promissoras, eu nem detalhei as principais para educa√ß√£o e sa√∫de, ficaria um texto maior.",1619827393

We're really excited that you posted, but it had to be removed because it violated Rule 2 - our rules are what keep LBGW one of the top-visited NSFW sites on Reddit, so we need to ensure that our hot post providers always follow them.

Here is a good way to make sure you are following the rules:

Rule 2 means that all posts must contain at least half your face. We must clearly be able to see some of your features! 
I.e. (eyes and nose)/(nose and mouth)/(eyes and mouth). 

This means that we DO NOT allow text-only posts. All posts must contain at least one image which fulfills rule two.

You are talking like it's gonna completely blow our fkin minds. Gt sport literally almost looks like real life. Same goes for Forza. The difference will be less. 

Also, Real Time lighting is there on Forza. There are day night transitions. GT sport is missing that. GT 6 had that. Shadows look pretty good on both games. The only improvements Forza Motorsport can do is trees. The trees in the game (Maple Valley Track) look terrible because it the trees are just a 2D texture (this is only for Maple Valley Raceway). It's more noticible in this track than others.

Ray Tracing:

In terms of reflection, SSR is enough as the camera movement isn't like open world games where you can look up at the sky to remove the SSR. The SSR gathers enough info to reflect accurately. There isn't much need for RT reflections on track. There is a reason why both Microsoft and SONY showed in game/engine garage clips as they both showcased reflections. 

The only place where there will be a proper visible difference would be night races. Ray Tracing GI would be very useful to the devs. Hopefully there are infinite bounces of the light and hope that the game is optimised enough to bring the RT GI Ray bouncing almost instantly, instead of loading in like Metro Exodus Enhanced Edition. 

(In Metro Exodus, the Ray Tracing GI, takes 0.333 seconds to load in. The lighting in that game is pretty much in one place so the difference won't be noticible at all. But in Forza and GT, the cars are racing at top speed, when the light hits the barriers, it can lag behind and give inappropriate lighting)",1619827395

The gender is *not* unknown. They can distinguish the two individuals just fine. They don't know what gender the Eagle Bearer was at the beginning. I explained this above.

&gt;  I distinctly remember someone assuring me with utmost confidence that there will be a hard barrier between transmedia and the games where plot and story won't bounce between the two anymore like they did before Origins. 

The novel that introduced this concept was published before Origins came out. Only the third in the series came out after Origins. People knew about this concept beforehand.

&gt; If they cared enough, this wouldn't be here period. 

It doesn't matter if the actual developers cared, because Serge Hascoet didn't. Don't blame the developers, blame Hascoet. They couldn't overrule him. If they could, this wouldn't have been a problem because Alexios wouldn't exist.",1619827396

I rate Klopp more than him because Klopp has done it with teams who cannot spend  that money, has to sell their best players, We finished what 7th or something the season before Klopp came in. 

Ended up winning a CL before pep and won out first PL in 30 years.. On that budget while selling couts etc... His Dortmund team also.

Man is just on his on level honestly. 

Some very good managers out there, but Klopp just can build machines from nothing. 

Pep finally might get a CL this year but look how long its taken him, only 1 billion pounds lads. 

He's good but until he goes to a smaller team with less resources and does it, will never be that level for me. Sure some people put him above Klopp thats fine. Difference of opinions.",1619827396

Why do people like Duke?: The short answer is that she‚Äôs an interesting character. Certainly the most interesting of the Heathers, at least. She‚Äôs deeply flawed and abjectly cruel, but this isn‚Äôt without cause. I believe a lot of Duke fans see a bit of themselves in a figure who is endlessly chasing ideals of beauty and popularity while equally resenting them. I think they identify with the crippling insecurity and sense of bitterness towards people they feel have bullied or wronged them. Because, at the end of the day, all of those reactions and feelings are very human. Duke is not a good person, but she is very understandable.

Why do people not like McNamara?: I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the case that people dislike her. Rather, I think people resent the part of the fandom who want to pretend she did nothing wrong, when she very objectively did. McNamara was an active participant in the attempted date-rape set up, in both shown instances of bullying Martha, and in the public slut-shaming of Veronica. McNamara did some really shitty things. That cannot be disputed. However, most people agree that she is not beyond redemption. Hence why she is generally the most well-liked Heather.",1619827397

"Dream","t5_2qoqs","So, I cannot put everything together articulately, but I can say to you the symbolism I picked up. Light is awareness, dark unconsciouness. A light was turned off and unavoidably needs to be lit. When the light went out, the next thing to come to mind is your house that was left abandoned. Houses mean two things: your actual house and your self. Your self was left abandoned because your parents divorced, the ones that maintain your home, literally and emotionally. That is where your light must be lit. Your father and your friend are on this to help you. The dead is not really dead - something in you that is out to haunt you, because is not supposed to be dead. The dead is rolled in a rug, maybe the rug of before, the one 10-20 years old, which probably symbolizes the time of the undead itself that is twitching inside you (think of what it might be). You ignored the undead, and what you saw next is horror. Spiders symbolize psychoticism (doesn't mean you are psychotic), and its flesh and blood show their deadly power. I don't mean to alarm you, but in my best understanding your dream is concerning. Maybe you'll be able to wise up effortlessly (maybe even unknowingly), but the best advice is for you to take a hard close look in yourself, because this dream is no joke.",1619827397

Will people who are not paying attention to politics change their vote because of the riots?   I doubt it.  They will just do what their friends and family say is the smart choice.  They may show up or not to the polls based on how angry or persuasive their political friend is that keeps urging them to vote.

Those are the people that create surprise results.  People who don't really care and often don't vote, but might because they are persuaded by loved ones.

If I really had to pick a result, I'd say the insurrection probably upset Democrats more than it pleased Republicans, so Democrats are more likely to lean harder on their apathetic friends in 2022 to get them to vote.",1619827397

I'm very sorry about your situation. I'm a single guy who lives alone and works alone...so gambling has become my ""escapism"" as well. I totally get it. 

Honestly, I think you're lucky. You recognize you have a problem, but you also have a very clear and present reason to stop. Your kids are depending on you, so whenever you get that ""itch"", just take out a picture and look at them. Say out loud that you love them (even if they aren't in the same room) and that because of them you aren't going to do something that hurts yourself and them by extension.

I'm glad to see that he said ""fuck no"", makes me think the men who are actually serving don't like it. I'm very disgusted by these women (being a woman myself) and I feel that they fucked a man to get government benefits, who do these bitches think they are?!? And what kind of man would stand to be treated like this? My husband had a very lucrative job years ago and if I walked around saying ""I'm the wife of (his career)"" I'd feel like a bitch and I know he would have told me to shut up. Sometimes this country makes me really sad...",1619827398

"AcademicBiblical","t5_2w28m","Beyond the ""intent of the authors"" there is the issue of chronology.  There are various proposed dates for the authorship of the OT.  The most convincing one is the end of the 6th century, beginning of the 5th BCE.  At that time, there were many creation myths in circulation.  For example, the Greek myth of creation, written by Hesiod sometime near the end of the 8th century BCE starts as follows:

"" In the begining there was only chaos (void).  Then out of the void appeared Erebus, the unknowable place where death dwells, and Night.  All else was empty, silent, endless, darkness.  Then somehow Eros (Love) was born  bringing a start of order.  From Eros came Light and Day.  Once there was Light and Day, [Gaea](https://www.desy.de/gna/interpedia/greek_myth/titan.html#Gaea), the earth appeared....""

Thus, starting from the darkness, Light appeared.  Not really a new notion and one in circulation for centuries before the OT was written.  Of course, the Hesiod story is not really about the creation of the world, it is about the creation of the Gods (Theogony), but the notion that out darkness, Light appears and then Earth appears was in wide circulation considering the Greek colonies all around the Mediterranean and their presence in the trading routes.  I am not saying that the OT derived anything from there, but these general notions were certainly in circulation.",1619827400

As Coronavirus cases are surging in many areas we remind you to excercise an abundance of caution. Pay attention to your local and national guidelines, continue practicing preventative safety measures, do not meet anyone if you have been exhibiting symptoms, and ideally get tested beforehand if able. If you do not feel you can safely meet with someone then it is best not to do so at all. Your actions not only affect yourself and your partners, but also those you care about, the ones that will have to care for you all, and everyone for that matter. Be safe.

In some cases serfs were slaves in all but name (e.g. ""yard people"" or ""registered peasants"" (who worked in mines/industry) in Imperial Russia); in some they couldn't leave their land and paid taxes/levies but were personally free otherwise (e.g. ""state serfs"" in Imperial Russia), in some they were basically lifetime tenants (so their children could leave the landlord (but it was often undesirable because they would lose a way to sustain themselves).

Example: One of my ancestors in early 17th century Russia (when the serfdom was still forming) was a tenant on a land belonging to a monastery. As such, he had to pay 50% of his harvest to the monastery. He (and his brother) was allowed left for the ""frontier"" at Urals, on the state land, where they had to give 1/3 of their harvest to state for their ""homestead"". If he stayed, he (and his descendants) would became a monastery serf in a few decades (and stay one until the secularization of the church lands in 1764) . Having moved, they became ""state serfs"" legally but their descendants weren't ""attached"" to the land.",1619827401

"ateismo_br","t5_2xh37","&gt; Beleza, quem criou e colocou essa mat√©ria ai nesse ponto ?

Um rio n√£o corre para o mar porque algu√©m teve esta inten√ß√£o. Um punhado de fatores combinados (vaz√£o, gravidade, leito) o faz desaguar. 

Ent√£o coisas acontecem independente de algu√©m ter tido a inten√ß√£o.

Corta para o in√≠cio do Universo. Foi uma singularidade. Singularidade tem uma coisa singular, elas s√£o singulares. N√£o acontecem todos os dias. 

A √∫ltima aconteceu h√° 13 bilh√µes de anos.

Algu√©m a causou? Sem evid√™ncias. Foi o super-her√≥i da minha franquia religiosa favorita? Ele ou seu Waldemar do 604. Ambos tem o mesmo n√∫mero de evid√™ncias suportando.

&gt; Cara a teoria do bigbang √© a teoria atual que tenta explicar a origem do nosso universo, mas nao consegue permear na sua cria√ß√£o

N√£o existe d√∫vidas sobre como o Universo come√ßou. A teoria j√° re√∫ne as evid√™ncias. Falta um ponto aqui ou ali, mas a teoria j√° √© s√≥lida.

Sobre a necessidade de haver um ‚Äúporqu√™‚Äù de ter sido criado, √© uma demanda humana. Ou seja, s√≥ surgiu quando surgiu humanos. O Universo nunca precisou dela.

&gt; que ali√°s est√° se expandindo cada vez menos

Voc√™ est√° cometendo um equ√≠voco.

&gt; O seu problema √© que voc√™ pega coisas que ouviu e as repete, sem pensar, acreditando que s√£o verdades absolutas

Deste o Orkut eu ou√ßo de gente equivocada e com nenhuma familiaridade com m√©todo cient√≠fico cr√≠ticas vazias e personalistas como essa sua.

Voc√™ sai do debate da ideia e entra no debate de pessoas. √â recibo de pouco repert√≥rio.

&gt; At√© o momento voc√™ n√£o conseguiu trazer nenhuma reflex√£o valida, apenas cuspindo teorias que voc√™ nem entende nem questiona

Mais um que acha que ‚Äúteoria‚Äù tem o significado mundano dentro do escopo cient√≠fico.

N√£o tem. Se algo √© uma teoria cient√≠fica, √© porque j√° conseguiu explicar as evid√™ncias expostas at√© ent√£o. Ent√£o a quest√£o n√£o √© mais se a teoria √© v√°lida ou n√£o, a quest√£o √© de quem estudou ou n√£o.

&gt; Teorias que ser√£o obsoletas daqui a 10 ou quem sabe 100 anos.

Voc√™ j√° tinha passado o recibo sobre sua ignor√¢ncia cientifica, n√£o precisa renovar esta percep√ß√£o.

Teorias s√≥ ficam ‚Äúobsoletas‚Äù quando novas evid√™ncias surgem. S√≥ que o m√©todo cient√≠fico tem rigor o suficiente para inclusive, abrigar evid√™ncias que ainda n√£o eram conhecidas.

Por exemplo, n√£o havia gen√©tica quando Darwin comp√¥s a sua teoria evolucionista. Quando a gen√©tica foi descoberta, n√£o tornou o Darwinismo obsoleto.

A confirmou.

&gt; Voc√™ fica aborrecido porqu√™ no fundo sabe que n√£o tem resposta e n√£o tem como refutar o fato de que a mat√©ria, mesmo que inicialmente concentrada em um ponto, teve que ser criada por algo. 

Confesso que n√£o ter um resposta n√£o √© algo que me aborre√ßa. √â algo que me estimula. Para ir estudar.

Coisa que voc√™ nunca fez na vida.

&gt; Ou voc√™ acredita em gera√ß√£o espont√¢nea ?

Disse o sujeito que quer fazer o surgimento do Universo caber na sua vis√£o limitada.

Tio Nox vai te esfregar na cara a resposta, para que voc√™ aprenda e no futuro n√£o passe vergonha novamente com esta pergunta.

Voc√™ acha que o Universo precisa de um criador, n√£o √© mesmo? Ok. Ent√£o algu√©m precisou criar o criador, n√£o √© mesmo? Quem √© o deus do deus? Ali√°s, algu√©m teria que ter criado o criador do criador que criou o Universo? Afinal, nada surge sem um criador, n√£o √© mesmo?

Assim, ad infinitum. Acontece que o m√©todo cient√≠fico pede que respostas caminhem para solucionar a d√∫vida. √â um princ√≠pio natural. O criador do criador do criador n√£o √© uma resposta natural ou cient√≠fica. Porque primeiro n√£o encerra a quest√£o, abre infinitas quest√µes. Segundo, **n√£o tem evid√™ncias**.

Mas como voc√™ √© um crente obscurantista (perdoe o pleonasmo), vai dizer que em algum ponto, o criador n√£o precisou de criador.

Bom, se o criador n√£o precisa de criador, porque o Universo precisaria?",1619827401

However in the instance that you try to imprison a faction member they will all 100% rise up if you fail to imprison him because their opinion does not matter at this point.

While not really a solution just for ambitious vassals my main pproach is to either imprison them or just allow them to press their demands and imprison them afterwards, both of these with the goal to remove their title.

Alternatively you could fabricate a claim on one of their titles and attempt to revoke it which will likely also start a war but this may or may not be a easier battle since you could just raise your troops and place them adjacent to their county capitals before attempting to revoke.

If they are just being stubborn and starting factions but they are never really getting anywhere then this would generally be a non-issue.

Cousins are a useful tool as well if you have a large family or any in court to marry off but this is mostly only effective if you have a polygamous faith.

The fact they could have as many people as they wanted to weddings and funerals just before July was the issue

&gt;
&gt;Esa fue la frase de **Mart√≠n Guzm√°n** al presidente **Alberto Fern√°ndez** que defini√≥ el destino del subsecretario de Energ√≠a, **Federico Basualdo**, al que se le pidi√≥ hoy la renuncia.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El ministro de Econom√≠a sali√≥ anoche de una reuni√≥n con **Cafiero** con la certeza de que contaba con el aval pol√≠tico del Presidente para echar de uno de los funcionarios que, dentro de su propio gabinete, desafiaba su idea sobre c√≥mo terminar con el descongelamiento de dos a√±os de las tarifas energ√©ticas, uno de los temas m√°s espinosos de pol√≠tica econ√≥mica que afronta este a√±o el Gobierno nacional.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Ya este jueves por la ma√±ana, con la decisi√≥n tomada, Cafiero y Guzm√°n encomendaron al secretario de Energ√≠a, **Dar√≠o Mart√≠nez**, superior directo de Basualdo, a que le comunique la decisi√≥n que hab√≠a tomado el jefe de Estado, seg√∫n confirmaron a **Infobae** fuentes oficiales.
&gt;

&gt;
&gt;&gt; Soci√≥logo, hijo del economista **Eduardo Basualdo** e integrante de las √°reas de Econom√≠a y de Energ√≠a de Flacso, Federico Basualdo marc√≥ en p√∫blico una distancia sobre el criterio del jefe del Palacio de Hacienda respecto a c√≥mo avanzar con las subas de tarifas.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [Dar√≠o Mart√≠nez, secretario de Energ√≠a (@dariomartinezpj)](https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/3RKMnOl9c93LJf2gLLRlx5kNj7I=/420x236/filters:format(jpg\):quality(85\)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/4KRTX7POENB65GAOMZIXELL4BI.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; **Cerca de Guzm√°n fueron m√°s duros para resumir la gesti√≥n del √°rea tarifaria: ‚ÄúFue inoperancia‚Äù.** Y aseguran que la disyuntiva entre aumentar los valores de la energ√≠a y conseguir un buen resultado electoral este a√±o es falsa: ‚ÄúHay un desequilibrio en los subsidios y eso le puede pegar a la brecha, y eso termina en la inflaci√≥n.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Hace pocas semanas **Bernal** hab√≠a confirmado ante **Infobae** que ‚Äú[los servicios p√∫blicos de transporte y distribuci√≥n de gas](https://www.infobae.com/economia/2021/04/12/aumentara-el-gas-en-mayo-el-gobierno-confirmo-que-las-boletas-tendran-una-suba-de-alrededor-del-6-por-ciento/)por redes tendr√°n un aumento en factura para 2021 **del orden del 6% para residenciales y menor del 4% para pymes‚Äù.** Desde Energ√≠a afirmaron ante **Infobae** que, en rigor, esos aumentos tambi√©n podr√≠an ser de 9%, como con la luz.

Love ve is not hiding in proof of the genes, it is all within the brains or us all.

The actual test may not be necessary, just mention to bio mom about the test and gauge her reaction.   Her reaction will give you your answer.  But do the test regardless, get it over with. You are still your fathers child, he is and always will be your dad, no matter what.",1619827402

I guarantee I have more of a frustration out for billionaires than you do, or you have just let the cons slip wool over your eyes your whole life.  Billionaires got richer during a pandemic?  Yes, the billionaires that made those profits, have companies that work in a sense that requires NO CONTACT purchasing of goods.  This makes sense, people do not want to go to stores as there is a deadly virus spreading....  So far the federal government, has done as much as they can to prevent POOR PEOPLE and SMALL BUSINESSES form starving to death.  I am not sure where you are from, but many places in Canada have done a good job of shutting down.  But the public health measures are decided by PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS.   For instance in other provinces, everything closed but essentials like groceries, in Ontario, we have a buffoon running things, so he shut down all small businesses and allowed big box stores sell everything for the majority of the pandemic.  This allows those large corporations to then have a monopoly on ALL SHOPPING!  This plays a large role in making billionaires richer.  I can't imagine what your reaction would be if Trudeau had demanded that you cannot purchase anything non-essential, in doing so, he would have had to invoke the emergency act and you would likely be on here screaming that he is a dictator!",1619827403

&gt;Alberto Fern√É¬°ndez resiste la presi√É¬≥n del kirchnerismo para imponer un cierre total por 15 d√É¬≠as y se inclina por un cambio m√É¬≠nimo en el esquema actual, con algunas nuevas restricciones y m√É¬°s controles.
&gt;
&gt;M√É¬°s all√É¬° de lo que hace trascender la Rosada, en el gobierno de Axel Kicillof y en la c√É¬∫pula del kirchnerismo duro sostienen la idea de ir a un cierre muy duro por 15 d√É¬≠as para bajar la curva de contagios de manera dr√É¬°stica y darle aire al sistema de salud.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; [Larreta le dijo a Alberto que las restricciones bajaron los casos, pero Kicillof insiste en cerrar los colegios](https://www.lapoliticaonline.com/tools/redirect.php?t=3&amp;i=133746&amp;s=c6e64cf5a5529c6089ca1a7504b669bd)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En el kirchnerismo dicen que las actuales restricciones son _light_ y alcanzaron para frenar el crecimiento de casos pero no para bajarlos, que es lo que se necesita.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; En el kirchnerismo muestran datos de las √É¬∫ltimas dos semanas para mostrar que las restricciones sirven y justificar la idea de un cierre mayor para bajar los casos y no solamente enlentecer el crecimiento.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El viceministro de Salud bonaerense, Nicol√É¬°s Kreplak, explic√É¬≥ que el sistema necesita ""bajar mucho la cantidad de casos, a niveles m√É¬°s bajos de lo que empez√É¬≥ esta ola"".
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Por lo bajo en el kirchnerismo tambi√É¬©n cuestionan la estrategia del Gobierno de anunciar controles m√É¬°s duros cuando no se sabe cu√É¬°les son las medidas.

The first use of that skill is a small radius aoe direct damage, the next three uses in 10 seconds are single target and the third one stuns. Like what the fuck.  
No skill cost reduction or reliable passive stamina regeneration increase, you get resources back by using Ultimates so you are kinda forced to use it as soon as possible instead of waiting for a good opportunity, or risk running out of stamina when you would need it the most to stunbreak. No good class healing skill that scales off your stamina/weapon damage (Cauterize is utter shit).

All the other classes have more and better stamina based skills. MagDK is okay though.

I will say colour me fucking surprised so far from observation I like the pacing you don‚Äôt talk to quick or to slow you have a nice clear voice. you actually highlight stuff like the types of factions amongst other things and you go nicely into depth into each thing instead of saying yeah this builds troops and move on type thing and the subtle humour is nice to ‚Äúyeah not every city has a port‚Äù made me smirk I don‚Äôt know if it was intentional or poking on the fact these cities don‚Äôt have a port meanwhile they  are BESIDE the Mediterranean and I glimpsed through a little further and I learned about combining troops I didn‚Äôt know that and I already beat the juli long campaign and almost beat the Brutii one as I type this 

I liked your vid and I‚Äôm subbing to you, I would of never guessed this was your first one you must of put a lot of time into it 

The only critique I have from what I watched is when your going through the stuff like enhanced visuals modern features etc and it‚Äôs a list I like to pause to read but you cut immediately to the next slide as soon as you were done reading the words I didn‚Äôt have time to pause without rewinding same as when you showed the Roman factions compared to barbarian factions etc that are highlighted

Title: **The saga continues ...**

Original Post: 

&gt; Okay...in need of some legal advice here...
&gt; 
&gt; I‚Äôm going to try my best to make a long story short. 
&gt; 
&gt; A few months back, I posted about my racist, homophobic boss for some advice. 
&gt; 
&gt; Good news: She quit. (Literally walked out)
&gt; Bad new: I was left in charge of the entire store.
&gt; 
&gt; I am the assistant manager for this store, so when the store manager walked out I felt as though it was my job to step up and take over. Although not prepared, I did what I knew to be best for the store. To be honest, I didn‚Äôt even think about the pay gap between my jobs pay and store manager pay because I just assumed that at some point I would be compensated. 
&gt; 
&gt; At first, I was okay with taking over. Over time it slowly became an on going joke. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our district manager visited our store after our manager walking out. When she visited she literally tore the store to shreds because in her words ‚Äúthis store is an absolute mess, nothing is up to standard‚Äù. I went along with it, trying my best to be helpful. When she left to fly back home I was left (to I think manage?) a store that had been left in absolute shambles. I mean to the point where we couldn‚Äôt even open our back door to our break room. 
&gt; 
&gt; I instantly went from being scheduled 32 hours a week, to having to work 50+ hour weeks to keep up with the store as this was a position I had never been in, and never been trained for. 
&gt; 
&gt; I since have dealt with many different issues that have made me feel as though my personal time, and generosity have been taken total advantage of. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our staff is 3 people, after our manager walked out two of those people have 2nd jobs, thus making it very hard to keep the store open without me literally working myself to the bone. 
&gt; 
&gt; I was told multiple times ‚Äúit‚Äôs not good for the store to close the doors to take a lunch‚Äù but was never directly told I couldn‚Äôt. It made me feel as though I could get in trouble for locking the doors, however I was working full 9am opens to 7pm closes without a break. 
&gt; 
&gt; Our store now has a new manager. I was honestly so relieved when I heard we hired someone, because this job was simply too much for me to take on. 
&gt; 
&gt; (I have a second job, and a very high energy dog who needs to be worked out at least 3 times a day and throughout this entire time I pushed all those things to the side.). 
&gt; 
&gt; Here‚Äôs where the issues became unbearable...
&gt;  
&gt; Once this new manager started, I let her know that I had requested off 4 days to plan for the aftermath of my second covid shot. I‚Äôm extremely prone to getting sick from vaccines and I would rather prepare for my absence, then leaving the store screwed over by me calling out. 
&gt; 
&gt; My manager at first worked with me, she seemed so willing and ready to help me out. 
&gt; 
&gt; This was all in the first day I worked with her. 
&gt; 
&gt; Now to the following days. 
&gt; 
&gt; I had been in manager mode for a month straight, I was taking care of what felt like hundreds of physical tasks everyday. When this new manager started, she had the habit of apologizing way too much. But it got to the point where she was apologizing so much that her tasks weren‚Äôt being taken care of. I was literally running circles around her as she sat at the work computer taking care of ‚Äúmanager duties‚Äù, while apologizing for being at the computer so long. I became extremely frustrated. I never showed expressed to her my frustration, but after her multiple comments about how our store was so ‚Äúoff standard‚Äù I was shocked. 
&gt; 
&gt; That‚Äôs the feedback you have for me??
&gt; 
&gt; She continued to focus on what was done wrong during the month and a half that our store was left in the dark, while severely understaffed instead of the fact that the doors literally stayed open the entire time. 
&gt; 
&gt; I finally spoke up. I expressed to her how her actions made me feel, and she came back with ‚Äúyou seem very stressed out and you are overreacting‚Äù. 
&gt; 
&gt; I let it go, and moved on to do my job. 
&gt; 
&gt; About a week ago, I sent an email to our HR department requesting compensation for my time worked as a manager. This was there response...
&gt; 
&gt; ‚ÄúWe appreciate everyone‚Äôs efforts in the business especially when it is not fully staffed. Unfortunately, additional compensation while the position was open was not approved.‚Äù
&gt; 
&gt; Please god someone tell me I‚Äôm not overreacting lol

Using that NFL data to buy high on Robinson last season in theory is a good call, because yes that's the better data. But because you (general you, I'm referring to everyone) are terrible at making that assessment the best thing we have is still capital to assess that talent.

A√≠ voc√™ vai buscar o hist√≥rico do que voc√™ vai tratar. Busque estabelecer defini√ß√µes claras sobre o que vai abordar.

3 - Como ajuda a esses textos principais, parta para textos secund√°rios ou de apoio. Eles v√£o servir para aclarar aquelas defini√ß√µes e o que voc√™ pretende abordar. Nesse ponto, voc√™ pode trazer √† lume alguma discuss√£o que ponha em lados opostos dois ou mais autores que trataram sobre o tema. Ent√£o, explicite essa exposi√ß√£o e, depois, n√£o deixe de dar a sua ""senten√ßa"", explicando o porqu√™ do teu posicionamento.

&gt;&gt; # [Empleada judicial detenida por estafas en el Este: ‚ÄúLo hice porque le iban a hipotecar la casa a mi mam√°‚Äù | Policiales](https://images.losandes.com.ar/resizer/J45HpGB1GzKQp_XHquU_67eoePM=/1200x630/smart/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/grupoclarin/HVHWSGYILNEDNLYKAHDSAKWPFI.jpg)
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Esta es una de las explicaciones que dio a sus compa√±eros, la abogada y empleada de la Unidad Fiscal Correccional de San Mart√≠n, [**Noral√≠ Hornz (34)**](https://www.losandes.com.ar/policiales/se-entrego-la-empleada-judicial-que-estafo-a-28-companeros-de-trabajo-en-el-este/)**,** quien hoy **se entreg√≥ a la Justicia, luego de que fuera denunciada por 28 empleados judiciales** por haber sacado **pr√©stamos en seis financieras utilizando sus datos personales, acumulando ya unas 40 denuncias de este tipo.**
&gt;
&gt;&gt; La abogada ha sido[**imputada por estafas reiteradas**](https://www.losandes.com.ar/policiales/escandalo-en-rivadavia-buscan-a-una-empleada-judicial-acusada-de-enganar-a-companeros-para-sacar-prestamos/) y por **falsificaci√≥n de instrumentos p√∫blicos y privados,** ya que habr√≠a fraguado bonos de sueldos y facturas de impuestos y servicios.
&gt;
&gt;Ante esta complejidad y frente a que algunos denunciantes son empleados de la fiscal√≠a de San Mart√≠n (y todos los de la fiscal√≠a de Rivadavia, adem√°s de otros empleados del Estado que est√°n sum√°ndose a la causa), es que el expediente podr√≠a pasar a manos de la Fiscal√≠a de Delitos Econ√≥micos que cuenta con mayores recursos t√©cnicos y de personal.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; La abogada fue denunciada en las redes.empleada judicial## **La voz de los estafados**
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Por otra parte, muchos piensan que Hornz no actuaba sola, sino con la ayuda de empleados de las financieras donde, desde 2019, tramitaba pr√©stamos a nombre de sus compa√±eros de trabajo, utilizando copias de sus documentos que les ped√≠a con el pretexto de llenar una encuesta.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; El caso explot√≥ el lunes, cuando una empleada judicial del Este fue a sacar un pr√©stamo personal en el banco Naci√≥n y all√≠ le dijeron que ten√≠a dos cr√©ditos en financieras pero que ambos hab√≠an sido cancelados.
&gt;
&gt;&gt; Seg√∫n una fuente judicial, la mujer solicitaba datos personales a sus amigos y allegados para hacer una encuesta para la facultad, entonces los estafados les pasaban fotos de sus documentos.

So if they cheapest moment available is $5 then a $10 one should be worth 2 tickets. If the cheapest moment is $1 then a $10 moment should be worth 10 tickets. I do suspect that this ticket system will raise the floor of the cheapest moments though. People will just buy up everything lower than X amount and they will never drop lower until all those Series 1 packs are gone.

I do think we will see the Top Shot accounts trading in their good moments to be put into packs, but those will be extremely rare. Obviously nobody else is going to do that unless they get more tickets for it.",1619827407

Coupled with the extremely meh armor skills and lackluster slots, I'd say its really not worth it. My poison build uses the Chameleos IG with 3 Venom jewels, although the weapon itself also requires 4pts in Handicraft to reach white sharpness, which hurts the build's damage potential significantly.

The rampage skill Chameleos Soul (chance on hit to gain health/attack/etc) looks interesting on paper, however I haven't really noticed much happening on a hunt. Probably not worth it vs Attack III, but I'd be curious to see some behind-the-scenes math.",1619827407

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt; huge numbers of them converted to Christianity during the Reconquista

Exactly. They converted and were assimilated into the Spanish population, which is why they aren't a major group in Iberia today. They were converted, assimilated, and ultimately served the Spanish crown, which is why they don't exist as a major group in Iberia today.

&gt; Yes. **RATHER THAN**

And you're doing that by diverting some of your energy to insulting rather than arguing. Not sure why you don't understand this.

&gt; Arabs and Moors, their inventions, their ability, their culture within that of Spain‚Ä¶

And so were the Mongols and Chinese. Without them, compasses and gunpowder may not have reached Europe when they did. Are they, too, directly responsible for Spanish colonization? Of course not. While things they did ultimately enabled Spanish colonization, their states didn't directly engage in colonization of the Americas. Same goes for the Arabs. Any Arabs/Moors involved in colonizing were assimilated and were doing what they did under authorization of the Spanish crown.

&gt; I am giving you a whole bunch of examples and reasons why Arabs and Berbers are integral to understanding global colonialism

Sure, their inventions and innovations played a major role in Spanish colonization but in the end, who colonized the new world? Not the Arabs. History is so interconnected that of course innovations developed by one culture will have unintended consequences when introduced to a new culture. That doesn't mean the original culture is responsible.

&gt; You just want more information to fit your narrative of White Man Bad.

Considering I explained earlier that non western nations committed and continue to commit atrocities to this day, that's pretty ridiculous, but keep that chip on your shoulder.

&gt; I am indeed a Roman historian

An armchair historian, that is. Playing Civ V professionally doesn't make you a historian I'm afraid.

&gt; That is stupid as fuck. No wonder you are an idiot.

I'm glad you have the free time to focus on things which aren't relevant. Unfortunately, some of us don't have time to sit on our asses all day pretending to be historians on reddit.

Did you stick the rounds in a case gauge?

FWIW, I would bet though that you 1) have a chamber that's rough or shade tight, and 2) probably overdid the roll crimp, and that's causing a little bulge just behind the crimp.

Put some calipers on the ones which don't chamber and see where they measure differently than the others. Also, ink one up with a permanent marker and slowly chamber it a few times. You will see shiny where your interference is.",1619827409

"SexWorkers","t5_2skjk","This brings up a memory from DC last summer, smh. It was just *so odd.*

So it was I believe a hhr session at, IDK, 4 o‚Äôclock. He calls at 3:45, says he‚Äôs at the hotel, I say I‚Äôm still getting ready, call me back at 4 and I‚Äôll give him the room #, blah blah.

We‚Äôd established the 4 pm time slot, right?ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I think no more of it, finish up, he calls, comes up, 30 minutes pass, yadda yadda. 

I simply don‚Äôt remember at this point how it started. Maybe I said as we were getting dressed, ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm glad you were able to make it here today.‚Äù That sounds reasonable, we‚Äôll go with that. (Who knows nowü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

He says, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe I had to wait until 4 o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

I recall very distinctly staring at him and saying, ‚ÄúOur appointment was scheduled AT 4 o‚Äôclock.‚Äù

He repeats himself. ‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt believe I had to wait until 4 o‚Äôclock to see you.‚Äù

(Sorry, this is turning into a damn novel, my bad.)

Poleaxed but determined, I say, ‚ÄúBut you KNEW the session was for 4 pm.‚Äù

He AGAIN repeats the *same goddamn thing*. üëÜüèªüëÜüèª

I gave up and showed him the doorüö™. Normally I‚Äôd have had a showdown to see who‚Äôd have caved first - clearly I did, but his 30 minutes was up and I just wanted him gone.

It was *the oddest thing.*

"AppleWatch","t5_2wav7","Can't speak for others, but the UTC option is very helpful for meteorologists. 

At points all around the world, meteorological data via weather balloon launches is gathered every 12 hours at the exact same time regardless of global location. These specific times are hour 12 and hour 24 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT; this is a specific time zone encompassing parts of Europe and Africa). This allows the data from the weather balloons to be inserted into weather models so we can get the most accurate snapshot of global weather interacting at the same time around the word. GMT was the time convention this referred to until the 70s when it was changed to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). It is also sometimes referred to as Z or Zulu time. 

Even though these are done at the same two UTC times (again, hours 12 and 24 in the GMT time zone), the local time at which these ballon launches occur varies based on location. If someone wants to know what the surface temperature a certain weather model thinks it will be at 4pm local time they will have to select the appropriate model forecast hour based on how many time zones they are ahead or behind the most recent UTC time in which weather data was collected globally. Daylight savings time also affects this.

For example, the Eastern Time Zone of North America is five hours behind GMT during Standard Time. When weather balloons are launched at 12 UTC, the local time in the Eastern Time Zone during Standard Time (EST) is 7am (12:00 noon UTC ‚Äì 5 hours = 7am). If I want to know what a specific weather model thinks the local temperature will be at 4pm that day, I will find the model run that represents 21 UTC (4pm = 16:00 on 24-hour clock; 16+5 = 21). How do I know which model run is 21 UTC? If the most recent global weather data we got (referred to as the initialized time) was at 12 UTC and I want to know what it thinks will happen at 21 UTC (known as valid time), I will click on ""hour 9"" on a weather model's page because 12+9 = 21. The principle is the same when in Daylight Savings Time. If an area observes Daylight Savings Time and ""springs forward"" in the spring, then the difference between UTC and local time will either increase or decrease by one hour; when autumn ""fall back"" occurs it reverts back to what the difference was during Standard Time. Using the example above during the months of March through October, local time in the Eastern Time Zone will only be four hours behind UTC instead of five. The morning weather balloons are now launched at 8am instead of 7am and 21 UTC is actually 5pm instead of 4pm (21‚Äì4 = 17 which is 5pm on a 24-hour clock).

It can be quite confusing to grasp, especially at first. Being able to have the UTC time handy on a watch makes it way faster to convert the forecast hours in your head.",1619827410
"politics","t5_2cneq","That's why Wikipedia has references you can follow to see the _original_ source. The Mueller Report is an _additional_ source that showed they worked together, _but_ did not find a legal violation on this point due to lack of evidence of _intent_ to conspire, or some such bullshit.

Trump was the worst president in U.S. history. He inspired people who had never voted before to come out and vote _against_ him. The number of votes Biden received, and the number of Black votes he received are perfectly reasonable. Saying he shouldn't have received more ""Black votes"" than Obama did is just racist AF.

"Velo","t5_2s4ji","Having raced up to cat 2 and been one of the officials on the stand, I can tell you the reason to crumple your bib number, and why a lot of officials and race organizers will tell you not to.  

Crumpling it up, and smoothing it back out make the number more pliable, more ""fabric-like"" and less prone to flapping in the wind.  If you crumple it up and then pin through the paper either side of the pin holes( do not use the holes...) it will lay flat on your jersey and catch very little wind.  It will also not reflect the sunglare as one smooth sheet, making your number unreadable on camera as you cross the finish line.

Unfortunately, some riders, if not told specifically to leave the number alone, no folding or crumpling, will fold over the edges of the number until only the number itself is visible, thinking they are reducing wind area.  In fact, a dark numeral needs a substantial area of light color background to stand out enough to scan on camera or by eye at smaller events.  Also, the event organizer frequently has sponsors or their own event logo at the top of the number and they generally aren't fond of seeing it folded under out of sight.",1619827410

Food wise, we try to cook exclusively at home unless it‚Äôs a social outing. We usually spend $70 to $100 a week on groceries, 3 meals a day plus snacks and dessert. We save money by making our own seitan products in bulk. Seitan recipes are super easy and usually only 15 mins of active work. Our go to is some sort of Buddha bowl, it‚Äôs easy to customize and ridiculously cheap. We avoid premade vegan items, and just find recipes to make our own versions.

So far I‚Äôve been using Not Your Mother‚Äôs Naturals Tahitian Conditioner, Shampoo and curl defining detangler. For gel I‚Äôve been using Aussie Instant Freeze Gel. I apply the detangler and Gel while damp and I try to leave some of the conditioner in while rinsing out with cold water. So far I‚Äôve only shampooed once a week and I‚Äôve conditioned daily.

Lived in rural NW Province near Vryburg for two years, 2009-2011. Walked everywhere, rode taxis from town to town. Never the victim of a crime, though I knew other people who were. Always made sure to not be out after dusk alone, travel in friendly groups if possible, not flash anything valuable (budget cell phone etc.) People were nice.

I'd tie you up, bent over a chair so I have access to all your holes, and suff your sweaty panties in your mouth. Then I'd let you see me lube up a regulation aluminum baseball bat. I'd enjoy the fear on your face as I tell you ""a regulation base ball bat has a diameter of 3.5 inches"" and laugh as a I add that ""a human anus can stretch up to 7.""

Sure you'd struggle, but bound as you are there's no where to go. Your muffled screams would get me hard as you feel the cold metal push against you. Slowly, painfully your hole would open. Progress would be measured in millimeters, but I'd keep going, as far as I can, until it's lodged in your colon.

When I'm done, I'll fasten it in place with a custom harness, so no amount of pushing will dislodge the invader. Then I'd walk over and lick the tears off your face, and replace your panties with my cock. I'd face fuck you fully, enjoying your throat massaging my head while you think of how your stuffed from both ends. When I finally cum down your throat, and make sure you swallow every drop, I'd re-gag you. 

The final step of this humiliation is to tape a Hitachi to your leg, so it stays on your cunt the whole time, and turn it up on high. You're gonna stay here, cumming over and over with your ass impossibly full, until you pass out, or the motor burns out on the vibrator.

My guess is that if this case goes in favor of the second amendment right to carry a concealed handgun for self defense - every county that hasn't already been outright granting concealed carry permits off the bat will start adding restrictions like specialized classes - I believe my county only allows it after a certificate of live fire course, at least a year after getting a restricted permit. 

This case only asks ""is denying a permit for self defense unconstitutional"" - it ignores the permitting scheme altogether - the state will add some hoops for the permit, no question in my mind.",1619827411
"gaming","t5_2qh03","No they don't have the best track record, but reading more into the relationship between EA and its developers, it seems in majority of the cases, EA simply gave the developers enough rope to hang themselves.

This doesn't seem to be happening with Respawn. They seem to have a handle on the relationship between themselves and EA. I would even argue that they're probably EA's golden studio at this point (minus the Fifa ones) due to the quality and goodwill they've been able to foster in a relatively short time.

I still think Titanfall 3 will happen, it's a relatively refresh and popular IP. EA doesn't have many new IPs of this calibre now that the Star Wars deal is over. I mean they did a mobile card game of it, it's clear EA wants to grow it in some way.",1619827411
"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","There‚Äôs tonnes of info online, but as you‚Äôve come here to ask, here‚Äôs my quick advice:

If you want to just keep things simple, use garage band. It can test you the basics, without complicating things.

After that or if you‚Äôre braver consider Ableton, pro tools etc. 

When it comes to build a song ofc, there are no rules. Some songs are just a guitar and a vocal, others are grand and complicated.

Personally I made real progress when I did two things. 

1) I tried to recreate what I loved.
2) I thought of it like a house.
First I needed the foundations  (a song), then I need a base (the beat and bass), then I could build up the walls and rooms (instruments that glue it together) before decorating it with furniture (overdubbed parts etc) and finally the people (lyrics). 

Most importantly, watch, read and listen. Except you‚Äôll make mistakes, be patient but also not patient and have fun!",1619827411

1) For a strategic look at how to use social media to achieve your goals, I definitely recommend Hubspot‚Äôs certifications. Really well laid out, clear, and super informative. The Social Media Certification or some of their other courses focused on specific channels like Instagram would be perfect. You don‚Äôt need to be a customer of their marketing software to take the courses, you can sign up for a free account. (I don‚Äôt work for HubSpot, I just think they do a good job. I try to do a new certification every year or so just to keep my skills fresh!)

2) Instagram is owned by Facebook so I definitely recommend looking into Facebook‚Äôs Blueprint courses. The certifications are kind of a pain but there are tons of videos about lots of different topics that should help.

"imaginaryelections","t5_aaoez","In this scenario, Trump had passed away on October 3rd due to the Coronavirus. Minutes after his death, Mike Pence was sworn in as the 46th President. At the time most, if not all, ballots had been printed with Trump‚Äôs name. Days after his death, the Republican National Committee nominated Mike Pence as their presidential candidate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (alongside other party leaders) held a joint briefing stating that the electors for Trump, no matter the outcome, would be overturned for Pence during the 2021 Electoral College vote count.

Biden ultimately won the election with 392 electoral votes, flipping 10 states. While many Trump supporters denied the results, Mike Pence conceded the race to Biden days after it was called.

But he specifically didn't bother himself to try and bond with HALF the people in the game. A game ABOUT forming relationships to be popular.

And EVERY person he specifically didn't bond with, was gay.

That's a bit more than a coincidence if you ask me.

I would guess the PL2 is drastically higher. It's very normal for laptops to only be able to achieve their PL2 by drawing power from both the battery and the power supply simultaneously these days - since it's temporary, using more power than the power supply can deliver isn't really an issue.

Additionally, going by the leaked all-core turbo figures for TGL-H, it seems like Intel is going for the highest possible turbo performance instead of bringing down the 135W PL2 we saw on 45W Comet Lake H. An OEM configuring the PL2 to half the recommended value seems unlikely.",1619827415

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was 14, me and two friends decided we wanted to wander around the town all night. We told each of our parents that we were going to one of the other friend's houses, all our parents knew each other and we lived close by so it didn't raise a red flag for us to announce that we were going to each other's houses and not need a ride. 

Each of us was in charge of bringing stuff, one friend was in charge of bringing food. This is important later. 

We decided to hop the fence around my neighborhood to get to an adjoining apartment complex and went swimming. We started to hungry so we asked the friend in charge of food what she'd brought. She said popcorn. We were like omg...all you brought is popcorn? It takes so much of that to fill you up and we're starving but whatever. We open her bag expecting to see bags of Smartfood white cheddar popcorn or something but no. This idiot brought bags of microwave popcorn. 

As we're berating her in typical teenage girl fashion, thank god a guy we went to school with walked by with his dog so we could flag him down and use his microwave. We go up to his apartment, still in bathing suits and keep in mind it's like 10pm. We've got most of the popcorn popped when a bedroom door flies open and an extremely angry woman who I assume was his mom storms in screaming in another language, starts slapping him around and motioning to us. I have no idea what she was saying because I think she was speaking Portuguese but we got the hint and left. 

So we eat our popcorn, it's 2am and now realize that we're tired. We have the genius idea to set up cots using blankets and pillows on top of lounge chairs in the bathroom. Unfortunately, due to the women's bathroom having stalls, we were unable to fit more than one lounge chair inside. Instead, we set everything up in the men's room and kept the door locked so nobody could come in. 

We fall asleep and the next thing I know, I wake up to the sound of someone slamming their fist on the door and yelling. I'm not sure what they were saying, only because I couldn't hear them well over the sound of A POOL FULL OF CHILDREN SCREAMING AND PEOPLE SPLASHING. We're like ohfuckohfuck what are we supposed to do now, we didn't anticipate that we'd have to wake up and exit the bathroom the next day when the pool was actually open. 

We brainstormed for a while but really the only thing we could do was just bite the bullet, pack up and leave. We could try to stay, but apparently someone had realized that the bathroom had been occupied for a suspiciously long time, nobody inside was responding and management would 100% just come and unlock the door thinking someone was passed out inside. 

So yeh, we packed up our bags, opened the door and just casually exited the men's bathroom full of lounge chairs trying to completely ignore the fact that everyone was staring at us in confusion.",1619827416

I can't imagine any sane individual willingly taking drugs that make it nearly impossible to sleep, toiling away in factories with horrendous working conditions for nearly 24 hours a day, and all the while having the looming threat of secret police killing you and your entire family if you utter even a whisper of defiance against the Ordensstaat. The BurgSys is not meant to be an ideology to be revered, but instead showcases the horrors of Nazism and how truly evil some individuals running Germany at the time were.

As for Speer, in-game he's portrayed as a """"""good Nazi"""""" reformist, and is one of the more popular candidates to win the GCW because, y'know, authoritarian democracy is better than Nazism. So the Speer hoodie is probably just a surreal joke.",1619827416

Why? They gave everything else.

&gt;Dutch investigators or parents don't want the world to know what's on a second card (Scarlett's blog had 1 card and 1 ""personal item (withheld) on the list)

Investigators wouldn't have wanted any of it out. The parents most certainly didn't. This has stopped nothing. Scarlett's blog references the list attributed to imperfectplan and their recent works on the case. Nowhere do they mention a second card anywhere in their findings. What's more, a second SD card is hardly a 'personal item' if the first one was not. 

&gt;There was no second card at all.

Indeed. 

&gt;I only said that card swap is the next logical solution for the missing photo.

Took me a while to figure out how to pry it out safely without rubbing against anything but it is possible. Only thing you will need additionally to install the bottom fans is a screwdriver with a flexible extension (to bend around the heat sink). 

The sequence to getting it out for me (remove GPU and unplug all electrical near the fan on the mobo first) in my R10:
- with the case on it side, push the side of the radiator that is facing you in first till it clears it‚Äôs case (tubes are thick so expect to put some good pressure)
- once clear push the left side in, keep an eye on the fan headers as those pins are fragile.
Once left is in, the radiator and fan are as good as out

To get the new fans in, make sure you have the long screws for both sides:
- put in the top fan
- now fold the radiator back in, should be easier without the bulky fan. Follow the same order as before in reverse
- screw the top fan and radiator together
- put in the bottom fan and loosely screw in the top screws, use the long screws
- using the flexible screwdriver extension screw in the bottom screws and tighten the lot.
