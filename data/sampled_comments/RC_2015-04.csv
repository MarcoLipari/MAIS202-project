"LARP","t5_2rl8h","I have been prisoner of the Strones barbarians since their raid on my hometown before winter. They dragged me in combat and raids all winter forcing me to use my healing abilities to help them.

 Suddenly, in the middle of the forest they notice a group is following us. The Strones get cover for an ambush and tie me to a tree. The new group is small, but I soon realize they are very powerful. The barbarians get overwhelmed and retreat, leaving me tied to the tree. I get rescued by this new group of fighters and mages and they ask me if I want to join them. They are on their way to fight the barbarians and send them back to their lands. I am dazed, barely able to believe I am safe and free, but I decide to join them, where else could I go?.

 I spend the trip aiding my saviors the best I can with my healing, still in shock and trembling most of the time. We attack the barbarians, free a couple of other slaves. But as we progress, the group realize that they are A LOT more barbarians then they tough. Its not just little villages like mine that are in danger, the army of barbarians is so big that they pose a treat to the whole kingdom. They offer me to go back to their town, were they will organize their defenses for the summer.","1427846400"

Yes... that's part and parcel of ""postmodernism"", the (so called) philosophical underpinning of feminism, socialism, multiculturalism -- per postmodernism there is no such thing as objective reality, it's all perceptions and moreover ""feelings""; and in addition language is all ""social construct"" and subjective... so that they not only see nothing ""wrong"" (and the very concept of right/wrong is dismissed/redefined/distorted) with rewriting history, but they also *aren't* doing it in order to ""correct"" it (i.e. to eliminate previous bias towards some objective version), but to simply ""fictionalize"" it... because so long as lots of people ""believe"" something to have happened a certain way, well from the social-power perspective that is a FAR more important goal or purpose, and in the end ALL that matters to them.

Once you comprehend that... then you comprehend that they not only ""lie"" regularly, and inconsistently... but that they have so ""seared"" their consciences, that they really *aren't capable* of anything else, they truly CANNOT engage in logical &amp; rational thought about an objective reality: because they have denied the existence of all of those concepts.","1427846400"

"canada","t5_2qh68","To be honest, I was being somewhat sarcastic and not entirely unbiased in the earlier comment. Of the various options, such as legislation and policy, I don't think there's much better approach here other than to recognize and avail ourselves of the information about the market situation around us. The way I view it is that fundamentally, both the incumbent homeowner class who created the value and real estate to begin with, as well as the government agencies determining the immigration policy, have decided that it was good to ""cash in"". By that I mean that the two groups (probably, quite rationally!) chose to exploit the market forces and capitalize on the real estate demand as well as abundance of qualified and valuable immigration candidates on the human resource market. So while the ""local"" gen-X and gen-Y'ers have the generally accepted experience and perception of having to compete harder to become home owners, and generally to ""make it"", the bigger picture is that we are going through a market adjustment, and ultimately going through the tough times right now positions Canada as a more competitive and equalized player on the global scene. 

Tl;dr: to me, this is all fruits of globalization, viewed from the vantage point of a ""yuppie"" Canadian. On the positive note, the quicker the poor countries' quality of living catches up to being comparable with first world/Canada and US, the sooner things are likely to ease up for everyone.","1427846404"

I'd say it's probably looked down upon because it's almost always brought up as a way to move blame onto a cyclist when it's unwarranted, to shift the discussion away from road safety for vulnerable users (people like to say ""cyclists should be accountable too!"") and ultimately it's not a helpful or useful conversation, and because so many of the cycling deaths happen to experienced cyclists who probably WEREN'T at fault. 

Not to mention when we start discussing HOW to educate cyclists, it usually comes down to doing it through school programs for kids (get 'em while they're young) and of course, folks don't like the idea of spending money to achieve results.

"DebateFascism","t5_2v642","&gt;Clerical Fascists acknowledge the nation as having a place of importance, unlike ISIS.

ISIS seeks to establish a Global, Totalitarian, Islamic State, as supported by your statement here:

&gt; and replace them with a single religious entity, the Caliphate.

-------
&gt;unlike ISIS, which supports religion over the nation,

Except Islam is more of a Totalitarian political doctrine than it is a religion (pro-tip: all religions are wealthy cults, and all of them can and historically have functioned as prototypes to modern Political Parties). It's a religion the way Nazism is a religion, with the Quran instead of Mein Kampf.

&gt;In both Iraq and Syria they are engaged militarily by Ba'athists, I'm not convinced they agree on much.

Irrelevant. I was talking about the original Ba'athist current of thought, not the current division between Iraqi and Syrian Ba'athism.

&gt;I'm not convinced of this, I think they more closely line up with orthodox Fascism combined with pan-Arabism.

Meanwhile, it's a fact that Ba'athism is Arabic Nationalism and Arabic Socialism, with Saddam Hussein's variant taking open inspiration from Hitlerism and Stalinism.

&gt;Secularism is fairly important to Ba'athism, so this would make their philosophy not Ba'athism.

Right, except for what I said about *re-installing Islam into Ba'athist (Pan-Arabic) Nationalist Socialism, and transforming it back into Wahhabism*.","1427846406"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","These are the facts: GMC originally made the pickup and Chevy re badged it, Chevy sales grew far beyond GMC's and Chevy could lower the pick up price do to volume. The price difference today is about 1%. ($500 difference on a $50,000 truck) The GMC Sierra &amp; Chevy Silverado are EXACTLY the same truck (except for the grill &amp; head lights and rear bed fenderwells). The Sierra &amp; Silverado are built on the same assembly line at the same time. There is NOT ONE option on either truck that is not available on the other truck. The option package(s) are just renamed (SLT vs LTZ). GMC markets as Professional Grade and Up Scale just to be different, which is a marketing illusion. Recently the high end GMC Denali &amp; Chevy High Country have started offering different interior choices but still use the exact same seat bases &amp; wiring harness. If you go online &amp; build a GMC &amp; Chevy you will see exactly the same choices. When GM re-organized in 2008 GMC was considered being knocked off but that would have made all the GMC dealers now Chevy dealers and that would have screwed up the dealer locations (too many Chevy dealers on the same block) so GMC remained. The GMC &amp; Chevy part numbers are the SAME numbers in the parts catalog ! In the 1980's GMC &amp; Chevy BOTH made the Suburban because it was so popular they both wanted the sales market. Years ago GMC made large tractor trailer haulers but no longer dominate the market, though they still build them. Cadillac Escalade use the GM truck frame but has exclusive engines (more HP), transmissions, bodies, interiors ... (truly upscale) and those Cadillac innovations end up in the high end GMC &amp; Chevy trucks as the Caddy upgrades over the years.","1427846407"

I mean, I think circlejerk is just universally used as a slightly vulgar (woah edgy) term for 'I disagree with and feel like a minority in that regard'. So basically, 'what do you like or dislike that most folks on the sub would disagree with?' 

I'm all for argument and debate about the merits of a show, but threads like this that seem to just be salves for the egos of folks who feel persecuted for disagreeing are a little embarrassing. They further the whole superiority complex thing rather than encouraging folks to admit that we disagree but it doesn't necessarily mean everyone else's taste is utter shit.

My argument will be slightly undercut if this post gets a lot of upvotes, since it'd hardly be a circlejerk if folks agreed with my criticism. ","1427846415"

"paydaymeta","t5_35g8y","silent killer would be 4 points for secondary weapons and 12 for primary+secondary, and you lose the base 30% that currently exists so a silenced 40 damage weapon with good secondary stats is unlikely if not impossible. The way I think about it is an alternative to berserker, you have worse weapon until it is activated and then you have a weapon that is ~45% better until you lose the streak, berserker on deathwish is 60% so its about the same as that is currently.

I dont think silenced weapons will go well with crit builds because silencers generally have an inverse relationship with concealment and damage, higher concealment means less damage. They also don't have much for acc/stab so you have to find that somewhere else in other mods and probably will end up sacrificing additional concealment there. multiply the problem by 2 if you want both your primary and secondary to benefit. That said I haven't looked at any specific weapon builds with silencers, its just my intuition telling me it wouldn't be very good.

For SMGs I think the problem is fixed by assault rifles still being better versions of SMGs, you would need to reach the 35 damage breakpoint with an SMG for it to get 40 damage with the skill plus the 5% from a deck, they still mostly have smaller magazines, lower pickup rates and tighter mod requirements compared to assault rifles.","1427846415"

"resumes","t5_2r0bv","Hi.

To answer your initial question, I don't really see much at fault with your resume here.  I wonder how active your job search is?  I think a lot of people hit apply via a job board and call it a day.  If that's not working then you need to do something else, and honestly that something else is networking.  You need to meet people, you need to attend professional events, you need to let everyone know that you're searching, and not just the recruiters.
 Recruiters are fine, and don't give up on them just yet, check in at least once a month so that your name is on the tip of their tongue when they check in with the companies they work for, but always remember that a recruiter is not there to help you, they are essentially agents of the company and must be even more restrictive gate keepers than someone who works in the organization.  
What you need a this point is direct contact with a decision maker in any way that you can get it, conferences, linkedin groups, certification courses, professional associations, alumni associations from your school- anything that puts you in front of actual people is your friend.  Austin having a big IT market isn't necessarily to your advantage, bc that to me sounds like it's a buyers market.  They can be as picky and peculiar as they want to be if there aren't a dearth of professionals.  Lastly I always say think creatively about your search, maybe it's tough to find these proj. mgmt positions in larger well established private businesses, but easier to find them in schools, or non-profits, or media outlets. It's good to ask yourself what are the other places that might need this function that I do?  What are some of the places that are *going* to need this function that I do and don't even realize it? Identifying those opportunities can put you ahead of the pack instead of playing catch up by applying to what you see online.  

ETA:  I can't claim any expertise in IT so obviously take this with a grain of salt, the tl;dr of this is don't just apply online, network and communicate and get in front of a real decision maker as soon as you can","1427846418"

Maybe it is just allergies. 

It may help to switch to a bin cage so you can put some ventilation holes on the sides as well as the top, so there is some additional ventilation, but a 20 gallon should be fine if you and your SO don't want to switch. I would clean it more often though. Many people spot clean every 2 days (take out visibly soiled litter and replace that with new stuff) and then do a full clean every day or so.

I only got PS+ when I bought my PS4 in November and I feel kinda gypped on the types of games we're being given now. Keep in mind, I'm glad that Dishonored is being given this month, and I had a lot of fun with Injustice and New n Tasty, I just wish there were less indie games and more big AAA games that I've at least heard of.

He suggests against hot water and to use a soap that will remove the oils, consequently making the whisker stiff and easier to cut.  Nowadays we opt to use cool or cold water to achieve this effect.

This is mainly because basketball isn't a very popular sport in Europe though, that has nothing to do with genetics

Same with football (""soccer"" for you). It's not surprising that Americans are far better at basketball while Europeans are far better at football. The talent pool is just much much bigger in one region. And basketball isn't even the most extreme example, stuff like american football is basically non-existant in Europe

That's quite the ethical dilemma that I was never able to answer myself.  Is it morally right for a wealthy company from a wealthy country to export their production to a country with weaker labour laws and pay a monumentally lower wage than they would pay in their home country?

The classic example is sweat shop workers making brand name clothing.  On the one hand, they are produced in the poorest countries and sold in the richest, exploiting the lowest wage they could possibly find.  On the other hand, those very same workers often consider that factory job to be their lifeline, and without it they could be far worse off.","1427846425"

Unfortunately, you'll need a ton of these wipes to beat Narset with any consistency.

Another way to win is resource denial. [[Boil]] and the anti-white one. Blow up his mana rocks with artifact removal like [[Shattering Spree]]. Counter his spells with [[Red Elemental Blast]] and [[Pyroblast]].

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","Oh no, not yet. I've played DnD before though (second campaign is currently running actually), and I've roleplayed in various games and sites prior. So I've dealt with the various player types personally from a player's perspective, but never as a game runner.

I fell into the ""Stealing everything"" trope with my rogue, but I almost never went through with it. It was more of a running joke in the first campaign where I'd ask the DM ""But can I steal it?"". Apart from that, I just tried to balance roleplaying and playing the game.

But we did have a griefer. They seemed hellbent on trying to make the game miserable for the rest of us. There was one who would refuse to speak out of character, just to troll everyone, and would even loudly make sounds  for everything (doors, walking, horses, even chewing. The chewing was the worst).

Character stereotypes are super easy to deal with compared to player stereotypes. Plus, some of them are just plain fun (like the zealot paladin or bloodthirsty barbarian). Whether good or bad, a character can be guided into a role. Players, however, are as good or bad as they choose to be (for the most part).

EDIT: I forgot my original point! What I mean in my previous comment was that I would create a party of players, and have those created players create characters. So I'd have Min/Maxers, Griefers, over the top roleplayers, hack-n-slashers, ""Rule of Cool"" ones, and also good or balanced players. I need to know how to deal with the good and the bad (especially the bad) if I'm going to try and deal with the people I have available to play DnD with!","1427846427"

If one were shown to be false (again, impossible), then it *would* make sense to reject both Catholicism and the Bible entirely.

Essentially your reasoning is :

1. If the Bible depends on the Church.
2. And the Church teaches an error as doctrine.
3. Therefore, the Bible becomes suspect.

"bloodborne","t5_31k9i","I haven't played multiplayer anywhere near as much as some others but I've dabbled a fair bit so I can give a few pointers.

1. Connection works by ringing bells, items that can be found in the Hunter's Dream. The first is the beckoning bell, which can be found on the ground after getting your first insight point. To use it costs you 1 insight, and allows you to summon other players who ring small resonating bells. You have to be geographically close on the map as well as in a similar level range. The summon range is supposed the same as the DS formula so it's something like (Your level±10)±10%

The other bells are the small resonating bell and sinister bell, both are bought from the insight shop in the Hunter's Dream which only shows up when you have at least 10 insight, both items cost 1 insight to buy. The resonating bell lets you be summoned and the sinister bell lets you invade.

When you use the beckoning bell you also trigger a bell maiden to appear, this bell maiden spawns somewhere on the map and rings a sinister bell, allowing you to be invaded. You can kill the bell maiden to stop the sinister bell from ringing. Bell maidens also appear naturally in some areas.

When ringing a sinister bell you can be summoned by someone who has rung the beckoning bell with the bell maiden still alive or be summoned by someone else who has rung the sinister bell.

When using the resonating bell if you kill the boss of the area you get 1 insight, for the sinister bell you get 1 insight for killing the enemy player. No souls are lost when dying in the world you are summoned to.

You can fire the silencing blank (given along with the beckoning bell) to stop the ringing of a bell. It also lets you send back allied summons and lets you remove yourself from a world you've been summoned to or invaded.

Setting up a password allows you to be summoned by specific people, although it appears to still be a bit buggy in some cases.

Something else to note is that all summons have around a 30% health penalty and are also scaled down to the beckoner's level.

2. Somewhat, you just need to be within level range to be summoned, the range is bigger in higher levels. A general rule of thumb I would say is increments of 10 levels for every non optional boss. Being around that general range should ensure you can summon or be summoned. 

3. You can find coop summons pretty much anywhere, usually by bonfires/lanterns or before a fog gate

4. PVP seems to be more [popular in the later stages of the game, especially places with a terrain advantage to the Invader because monsters won't attack them. Places with the most invaders seem to be Yahar'gul (when you go there after Byrgenwerth) and Nightmare of Mensis. Note that when invading a lot of the time it's 1v2 or 1v3 plus you have a hp penalty which makes it even more difficult.

There's also chalice dungeons but cooping is extremely inconvenient there. All players have to have already unlocked the dungeon and use the same glyph code to coop. I haven't played coop in chalice dungeons so there isn't much I have to say on it.

Another important thing to mention is that when a player who is in the Executioner/Vileblood covenant summons a player from the opposite covenant, they appear as enemies instead. Not sure about Hunter of Hunter's, it may be hostile to both covenants.

"UCalgary","t5_2spfj","Depends on your field obvi, but generally it's really tough out there right now. Best way to get a job right now is to know someone who can get you an interview. I'm lucky that I can support myself working full time at my job I worked throughout my undergrad. I know many other people who are in this same predicament and continue to work at their same jobs they had throughout their undergrad. 


Advice: go to job fairs, look at the joblink EVERYDAY, keep your ear on the ground for openings, and don't give up. Prepare yourself for applying for 50 jobs and not hearing from any of them back. Make sure your resume/cover letter is supreme - people who are hiring look through thousands of resumes every day, make sure they don't toss yours out for something as seemingly as trivial as formatting. In the meantime,  if you are able to, volunteer somewhere in your field/where you would like to work/somewhere you can learn a skill. I know lots of people who would volunteer for an organization and then get a job for them.

"dwarffortress","t5_2qyn1","&gt; CHIM is most definitely divinity.

I suppose it depends on how you interpret the Walking Ways; I see them as paths to Amaranth, not to divinity in the context we've been discussing (which is a *lesser thing* than Amaranth). CHIM is, in my view, a path that bypasses established formulations of godhood rather than incorporating them like enantiomorph or mantling. Parallel to divinity, but not equal. On the other hand, from the average mortal perspective that's definitely splitting hairs!

&gt; ""Waking up"" isn't a danger

I'm very certain I remember MK remarking on their being two ways to fail at CHIM, and zero-sum was only one of them. I've been very certain of wrong things before, but that's my memory. :)

&gt; Molag Bal never knew CHIM, only of it.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","edit: as usual, supporters of other parties so set in their ways they can't hope to debate. So they downvote and move on. Suppress alternative opinions right? Scumbags, this is precisely why less and less people vote 

Sure man,  have you read their manifesto? When you ignore media spin against most parties and do your own reading and don't just listen to buzzword insults like Marxist, (labour), racist, rich bankers (cons) etc it all becomes much more human. Anyway the ukip manifesto is very common sense. The only single solitary policy I could disagree with was that of the climate change questioning. Farage doesnt get as much of a platform because idiots shout him down and cut his airtime short. But honestly,  objectively watch some of his interviews on YouTube. I like the man,  I like 99% of the policies.  In this country we cry out for change and plain spoken politicians doing common sense things with common sense policies.  So it is so amazing to me that a man who unashamedly embodies that bluntness and friendly honesty is so heavily refuted by supporters from the two main parties as if his existence was a personal insult. Or perhaps this is precisely why. 

I could go into detail for any aspect of you would like? I don't mind. I try not to be factionsl with my voting. So this year I want to vote ukip to try and force a coalition or at least a minority government here they have a voice on things. The conservatives would probably be best this time to continue their economic work.  As it is truly going well. In 5 years time we can then probably vote in a labour government to then spend some of the surplus on groups that may need it most.  Once that 5 years is up,  back to another government to tidy up the economic side and so on,  depending on what is needed. I don't like the idea of people getting closed minded and only voting one way.  A bit about me. I'm in my late 20s. I've lived in over 10 countries so I have had a first hand experience in seeing what works and doesn't regarding a lot of policies. I have a computer science degree.  I'm pretty well off now after graduating and getting a good job but I come from a family that was terribly affected by the financial crisis and was for a few years very poor. Though I had a pretty amazing education abroad so I can't complain. 

Anyway one thing I always stress to people.  Britain has a huge issue with political correctness. People who call ukip racist are doing it to silence discussion. British doesn't mean white anymore,  but more importantly there is a concept of having skilled migrants and unskilled migrants. The former are great,  they are your Syrian doctors and businessmen, physicists and economists. The latter are a waste of space in Britain. It isn't racist to want to limit the unskilled migrants. I could have a pretty deep discussion about this and also point out that surveys say unskilled migrants haven't made unemployment worse,  but that this fails to take into consideration that when they take unskilled jobs it means that they fill a position an unemployed person could have had,  thus they don't make it better. Further instead of citizens getting paid more when a crap job with crap pay comes up and nobody will fill it. Companies can abuse our system to farm in someone desperate and unskilled from abroad who will simply put up with it. As a result wages in Britain are crap. ","1427846436"

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","&gt;I wouldn't mind seeing the Downtown Streetcar Project resurrected, though I imagine spending regional transit money on that would be controversial, and it might fall on City of Vancouver to build that all on its own.

Until there end up being local buses as packed as the 99, I certainly don't hope to see streetcars.  They cost a great deal to build, and they cost a great deal to operate.  You *might* get a lower running cost per seat, but if buses could have handled the ridership you have then you're probably offering lower frequencies, which is all-in-all a service downgrade.  You're not going faster than a trolleybus.  

If we do ever build streetcars, I would rather not see the downtown streetcar plan revived either. Streetcars have many disadvantages, but the big advantage that they have is rail bias and capacity. So if you've got a relatively crowded downtown bus route (say, the 3, the 5, or the 6), and if you calculate that people like trains enough that you'd fill street cars at the frequency you run buses, then perhaps they'd make a reasonable business case, especially if you ran them in separated lanes. the NPA streetcar plan, was more about building a tourist tram to shuttle people to Granville Island and Pacific Boulevard and *that* strikes me as a waste of money, and one which I would hope the region would not be asked to support were it to ever surface again.

Not only verify the amount/weight you are measuring but verify the database entry.  With good record-keeping like yours, it's not going to be the rare thing you eat but the common thing.

That is if it's the log at all.  Could be your logging is totally accurate and it's medical.  If you're leaning in that way, I'd start to get the MD involved and start checking things.  You're already eating less than you should, cutting further back makes no sense.  Print out a few weeks of your log and the MFP charts (consumed calories).

Try the Society of Janus booklist for some resources: http://soj.org/bdsm-educational-book-list

I always recommend Dossie's topping book (and bottoming... To learn about the other side) and SM 101... The two authors are very different with different perspectives so reading both will give you depth of viewpoints as well as good basic info.

Also, talk to her! Ask her what *she* likes about being dominated. What parts turn her on, what doesn't interest her, what scares her in an exciting way, what she wants to explore or learn more about. No dom is a mind reader, so experienced submissive women will be accustomed to having conversations. She isn't expecting you to magically know what she wants.

My nesting partner/top came to me out of a vanilla marriage and had never played rough. He was intrigued but worried and told me he wasn't sure how he felt about some stuff I liked. Now he regularly indulges all my kinks and has discovered some new ones for us to explore together. So being new doesn't mean you can't be what she needs.

 [**Gambler's fallacy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s%20fallacy): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __gambler's fallacy__, also known as the __Monte Carlo fallacy__ or the __fallacy of the maturity of chances__, is the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during some period, it will happen less frequently in the future, or that, if something happens less frequently than normal during some period, it will happen more frequently in the future (presumably as a means of *balancing* nature). In situations where what is being observed is truly random (i.e., [independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_independence) trials of a [random process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_process)), this belief, though appealing to the human mind, is false. This [fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) can arise in many practical situations although it is most strongly associated with [gambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling) where such mistakes are common among players.

* Friends

Also, I know that you didn't mention podcasts, but Jon Oliver co-hosts a podcast called [The Bugle](http://thebuglepodcast.com/). It is absolutely amazing! He and Andy Zaltzman host it together. It's one of those shows where you quickly can decide if you love it or hate it. ","1427846444"

You're also correct its unlikely that the war would have been won without the US but the same can be said for Britain and Russia. Try liberating Europe without staging from England or the invaluable intelligence provided by the breaking of enigma, try invading Europe with the entire German army on the western front because there was no eastern front, but also try liberating Europe at all without the technology and manpower the US brought to the table. The war wasn't won by one nation and every nation in the world suffered because of it, if you want to give credit to one nation for the allied victory of ww2 it would probably be Germany due to the terrible and insane decisions made by Hitler.

World war 2 was not won by the United States nor by any other singular nation, it was won by the collective efforts of all the people in every nation that was brave enough to stand up and help, nobody spits on or belittles the US contribution (Doing so would be as wrong as saying the US did everything) especially not the sacrifice every single soldier, sailor and airmen made, but this is the same for every nation that was involved in the second world war. People do however find it insulting and unwarranted when Americans (or anyone from any where) says country x is the reason the allies won ww2 even when its simply implied - Its nothing more than dick measuring and said person trying to take credit for the actions of the people who actually made the sacrifice.

PPW is juxtaposed with insurrection and is based around building a people's army (""Without a People's army, the people have nothing"") and fighting the bourgeois army on your own terms.

&gt; but is all development good?

If it correctly answers a problem, I think yes.

&gt; I think there's plenty of other living Marxisms outside of Maoism that are worth study.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","nMom did several things that may have contributed to issues my with appearance.  Whether or not they were intentional is beyond me, but here's the list:

- My brother and my father have straight hair, while I was born with curly hair.  She went out of her way to make me feel like crap about this, be it with the comments she made or how she had my hair cut.  The day I was finally allowed to decide how my hair was cut was one of the happier days of my life.

- She bullied my father into taking me to a psychiatrist when I was about 11 or 12.  Rather than trying to find a reasonable explanation for the issues I was having at home (which were entirely her), she insisted I be put on medication.  She pushed for me to be put on Depakote, which has the nasty side effect of weight gain.  I was consistently 275 lbs from age 13 to 18.

- She would commonly buy me very unflattering clothes.   They were usually baggy, and the colors typically clashed.  It wasn't until I was out of elementary school that my father intervened and the ""sweatsuit phase"" ended.  When I finally lost a huge amount of weight as an adult, she'd still attempt to buy me clothes that were 2 or 3 sizes too large.  I eventually had to forbid her from buying me clothes.

Riot wants to make sure people very rarely achieve higher ranks than they are capable.  As a result they built a system which supports that mentality.","1427846450"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Here's some stuff I picked up along the way in chronological order. Mostly a lack of explaining basic vocabulary similar to what was the case in the Dota For Your Mom pilot. Might be worth at least giving people a brief glossary-like brief explanation like when you hover over the word Tango. Or make someone make some cutesy scribbles that showcase the most important terms you should have remembered after a paragraph, which could also break up the drier parts of the read (I'd volunteer, but you probably got loads of contacts for that).

* ""You win the game by destroying your enemy's Ancient building or Throne before the enemy team destroys yours."" - To a new player this may sound like destroying the Ancient and destroying the Throne are two separate win conditions. Maybe change it to ""(also called ""Throne"")"" instead, if it's even necessary to mention at all

* could be worth mentioning that Heroes are the characters you play as. It's everywhere ingame, but since this chapter is called Dota Basics, might not be bad, maybe a friend just linked them the guide and the newbie's reading it while downloading 10 gigs of hats.

* ""with little experience (which give you levels and stronger skills"" -&gt; change to ""experience points""?; ""and little gold (which buy you items that make you stronger)"" -&gt; ""which buys""?

* ""There are three lanes that spawn creeps every 30 seconds at the :00 and :30 mark for the entire game..."" - ""Creeps"" as a term hasn't been explained yet, but you're already explaining what they're good for. Newbies probably won't be familiar with that terminology yet or have filtered out which of the funny creatures' names on the map are worth remembering. Some people might also not know what ""spawning"" means in the context of video game mechanics, depending on their prior experiences.

* "" This is the first thing that you will have to practice to become a better than average Dota player."" Sounds like a sentence that made more sense before you dropped in the clarification sentence just before it. Maybe replace ""This"" with ""Last Hitting"" to refresh context.

* ""the gold advantage that allows you to buy the items that wins you the fights that wins you the game."" -&gt; ""the gold advantage that allows you to buy the items that win you the fights that win you the game."" ?

* ""When you accomplish this, an exclamation(!) point will appear over their head, showing that you did deny that creep."" First time Denying is namedropped, so maybe followup with a short explanation that introduces it as a formal term and clarifies that it refers to Denying the enemy XP and Gold from Last Hitting your Creeps.

* might be worth mentioning that the standard way of Denying and attacking allied creeps is to A+leftclick those units, since I don't think there's any formal documentation of that anywhere in the client, including the tutorials, so it's the kind of secret black magic tricks people will want to squeeze out of these kinda guides.

* Maybe formally introduce Early Game and how players divide the game into 3 stages depending on how much time has passed and how much XP/Gold has been accumulated - or just don't use it at all and write around it until you reach the Phases Of The Game chapter.

* ""Unlike a game like League of Legends"" -&gt; ""Unlike in a game like League of Legends""; ""at the start of the game so it's important"" -&gt; ""at the start of the game, so it's important"" ?

* ""Jungle"" as a term hasn't been formally introduced yet. I think the only documentation of it ingame is ""Jungler"" as a hero roll from one of the dropdown search menus from the all pick hero select screen, and ingame the Jungle looks nothing what you'd expect a jungle to look like.

* ""My favorite advanced method to deny your opponents of gold and exp gain while enhancing yours is to Kill Them."" good humor break from all the dry basics.

* Maybe formally introduce Harassing as a technique of dealing chip damage to the enemy hero opposing you in lane while avoiding taking too much damage from their creeps that will try to protect them.

* Formally introduce the term Regen Items/Regen since it's player lingo and the closest official equivalent would be Consumable Items.

* If you're gonna introduce Feeding as a term, might as well do it while explaining it's referring to the metaphor of you being so easily killed it basically handed the enemy a lot of Exp and Gold on a silver platter, which will make their heroes grow into bigger threats.

* ""it's generally best to throw your stun or slow"" - kinda colloquial, newbies might not know that it's neither referring to a stun grenade item nor a Slow ability you can swap for your Glyph (like in certain other MOBAs), but that it refers to a spell that can stun or slow the enemy. Maybe just cut it entirely and just tell newbies to towerhug; to exhaust your usefulness before doing so is kinda advanced gamesense considering the very basic gamesense you're trying to convey is ""if you're weak, leg it"".

* I know it's part of the joke, but I find it kinda weird how Kill Them and Almost Kill Them is capitalized like an actual term whereas the real terms like Creep and Deny are not.

* Seems kinda odd to introduce the Fountain so late. Maybe explain the playing field before diving into mechanics? Not a read everyone might care about tho, so if you do that, maybe make it its own thematically closed-off section.

*  'yo go zone that offlane hero' Might just be a throwaway joke, but from a newbie's POV I don't think I'd be able to appreciate it since I don't know what an offlane is and it's not a term used ingame and none of the other newbies I'm playing with has heard of it either.

* ""This is a bit advanced for a new player because you'll more often than not just feed your life away, but that should better teach you your hero's limits, 40+ minutes of pain at a time."" - kinda conflicts with the bolded DO NOT FEED and cry for caution just a few paragraphs above. Play it safe or the proof is in the pudding, which is it?!

* I don't think there's any official documentation for what Auto Attack is, might be worth establishing as the basic attack a hero can perform without using items or spells by rightclicking on a valid target.

* that lane explanation minimap looks amateur as fuck next to all the production value of the new site and videos, and unlike with the SUPER FAR minimap it doesn't seem to be part of a joke either.Maybe just nitpicking here, but it stood out to me. Also either don't mention Rosh at all or give him a proper minimap title, cliffhangers for no reason just distract and you're already throwing a ton of terminology at your average video game player here as part of the ""Basics"". For consistency, might also be good to change ""mid"" to ""midlane"" on the minimap and put it on both the Dire and Radiant half of it, and maybe give Dire and Radiant different framing to reinforce the idea that they refer to two halfs of the map divided at the river, not lables for the two bases.

* Newcomers might be confused about Off- and Safe Lane being referred to asif they're separate lanes but ingame there's just one pathway and since both teams will huddle around the creeps in the same spot, they might not know why the situation should be any safer for them than for you.

* ""A creep wave is where the two spawning creeps on each side of the map meet to fight."" - kinda sounds like only 1 creep per side spawns. Probably gonna get glanced over after a brief period of confusion, but might be worth rephrasing anyway.

* Creep Balance hasn't been formally introduced before you've started using it like a normal term (but Equilibrium is explained a few lines afterwards - maybe refer to it as either Balance or Equilibrium to minimize how much vocabulary you're throwing at people.). I guess Creep Wave is kinda self-explanatory in context, but it might be worth repeating it instead of the casual ""wave"" to hammer in some new vocabulary.

* Offlane is briefly explained as the ""dangerous lane"", maybe formally explain all the lane names around the minimap introduction to establish a general infrastructure.

* ""The reason creep equilibrium is so important is because in the Offlane, or dangerous lane, you want your opponents to be as far away from the safety of their tower as possible."" In the 2-1-2 symmetry of almost all pub matches without junglers, that applies to both offlane and safelane duo. And if there's a jungler, there's about a 50-50 chance the solo laner will be safe lane.

* might be worth explaining the benefits of wave positions graphically, since... well it's quite visual ingame as well.

* ""Gank"" might be more easy to remember if you explain it's a portmanteau of ""gang kill"".

* ""or to hurt your opponents ability to predict"" -&gt; ""or to hurt your opponent's ability to predict""

* ""If you show up mid briefly with two extra heroes to gank the enemy mid"" You're using ""mid"" once to describe the Mid Lane and once to describe the Hero that is busy acquiring Gold &amp; XP in the Mid Lane, might be confusing since the words aren't even distinguished in a ""mid/midder"" kinda way like with ""offlane/offlaner"", which would be much more self-explanatory.","1427846450"

"52book","t5_2s935","I've read all of the Farseer trilogy this year and I've really enjoyed it. I was a bit on the fence with the pacing of Assassin's Quest though, I think that if I hadn't been so invested in the characters (and their interactions hadn't been so well written) then I might have gotten a bit bored at a few points. I read the first book of the Tawny Man trilogy last week and it follows on in a very similar vein, so if you enjoyed the Farseer trilogy then I'd definitely recommend giving it a read. 

I suspect that one of those four are probably also my favourite book of the year so far, but I'm not really sure which one.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","&gt; If the physical appearance of people is such a primary concern to both parties then the relationship has other issues as well - shallow, self centered personalities.

no, it doesn't work that way. weight loss and strength training tend towards better health and bearing, and higher testosterone. works pretty good when the problem is that she's lost some attraction. it also works when you're mopey - if you're depressed, exercise is a fairly effective way to deal with it. 

also, i find it offensive to suggest that being less attractive to your hubby when he's unhealthy and out of shape is shallow. everyone is like this to some degree.

anyway, you're right - it isn't a magic bullet. it is generally a good idea, for many reasons, and i'd say that it works pretty well for a lot of people. 

&gt;  I think that many of us in long term DB will attest to the fact that it's not the appearance of the SO which is the problem but rather the behavior in terms of connection, concern, closeness, etc.

and those are harder problems to solve. getting rid of some fat and being stronger with more energy is a good way to demonstrate ability with something simpler. so you solve something smaller, gain confidence, and tackle other things. 

&gt;  I'm betting that most of the folks here are like me, a bit older, somewhat fatter, have somewhat less hair than when they started the relationship

yeah, but you don't have to be fatter. you can also keep taking care of yourself.","1427846452"

You are kinda like me in that my longest streak lasted only one month. In my past about 2 to 3 years ago (Before I was inclined to stop) I would do the same like 3-4 day streak every week. 

You should really read up on the physical benefits of quitting. It can help you want to be a better version of you!

You are free to make your own decisions. Generally on a forum to help people stop an addiction saying that it's ""bad"" is almost a motivational tool for people to think and want to keep quitting. 

Clearly you want to quit or else you wouldn't be on here!!
Try finding some more motivation in other success stories. Always helps me!  ","1427846458"

Many of them don't even understand what it means, and think they ought to be free from moderation, from criticism, and even from downvotes.

"betterCallSaul","t5_2u05j","Why not? Jimmy was a criminal long before he tried to become a lawyer, so we know he had it in him. Even without Chuck's interference he still would have done criminal activities as a lawyer; taking the bribe, trying to scam the Kettlemans, and paying a criminal to break and enter into someone's house were actions that had nothing to do with Chuck. Also, Chuck would have never been kidnapped by Tuco and almost killed. If it wasn't for Chuck, Jimmy wouldn't even have tried to straighten his life out in the first place and would never have become a lawyer, so I guess in that way Saul wouldn't exist without Chuck, but Jimmy 'broke bad' without Chuck and I don't see why he wouldn't continue to do so. Chuck's actions sped up a process that in my opinion was bound to eventually happen. Also, we're assuming that this is the moment that Saul becomes Jimmy, which we don't have any evidence for yet and will doubtless be a massive oversimplification of Jimmy's arc. 

I think Chuck 'sabotaging him at every turn' is a bit of an exaggeration. He never would have got into HH&amp;M originally regardless of Chuck's presumed interference, so the only time in which Chuck's jealousy got in the way of Jimmy was this episode. Before that he was very supportive of Jimmy, at least on the surface, and mainly just wanted Jimmy to get success through his own work instead of piggybacking off the success of his brother. He could have been a more supportive brother, but the only time he's had a negative effect on Jimmy as opposed to not having as positive effect as Jimmy would like is this episode.","1427846459"

* The one for killing a unit with a unit that has 1HP left is *much* easier in vanilla as units have 10HP instead of 100 (you can get the achievement with DLC but just a heads up if you're struggling).

* Adopt every policy - in vanilla/G&amp;K Order, Freedom and Autocracy are policy trees, so you'll need to play without BNW to unlock those.

I am in the exact same boat and I wish I had something good to say.  But here I am 2 years later and nothing has changed.  I am still carrying the department while my boss comes in late and leaves early.  I prefer that he spend less time in the office since about 20% of my time is taken by fixing his mistakes and stupid proofing our systems.  All I hear all day long is people complaining about him and why upper management hasn't done anything about it yet.  

I have 4 pages of dirt on this guy, dirt that I would fire someone over but I can't say anything due to sour grapes reasons.  To make things worse, he is the very definition of the Dunning-Kruger cognitive bias.  We all have to hear all day how great he is at his job and how he knows everything but that he is too busy so we can do it.  Yet, we know that just about every project he has ever completed at previous jobs was outsourced.  

I mean, his primary home email is AOL.COM!    ","1427846462"

"thewalkingdead","t5_2rygv","The fact that this is a fictional setting makes it the more relevant to the point I am making, as it makes it easier for those discussing to drop their filters and grapple with Rick's problems in a way that more closely resembles their own world view. Fiction like this serves as a tool for us to tackle real life dilemmas and philosophical problems. The questions asked in the show are just that, and that's why we have characters with opposing viewpoints - Rick being ruthless, Michonne wanting to ""not be out there"" and save their humanity, Carol being about survival, Gabriel not wanting to kill, Herschel previously not wanting to kill, Morgan talking about life being precious. We view and grapple with the dilemmas these characters are facing through our own world view, and the things we say are representations of how we make sense of the world.

So when people overwhelmingly support Rick's actions, it is telling that they believe that there are certain things we sacrifice in the name of safety. When they continue to support Rick in the face of alternatives (The Alexandrian lifestyle being one of those alternatives), it shows an implicit dismissal of a system of beliefs that closely resembles what our society looks like today.

The writers haven't been perfect, as Alexandria is still a dictatorship (Deeana decides), though it is clearly represented as a society with democratic ideals (Deeana uses buzz words like creating a great society, working together, transparency; there are obvious references to Alexandria being utopian, and there is a 'forum' to discuss Rick's fate). And writers and fans alike wholeheartedly agree with most of Rick's decisions.

When Rick and Carol began to undermine Alexandria, it made me question my allegiance to the two of them. Afterall, nobody has really mentioned that Alexandria has survived just like Rick's group has, and if anything, is in better shape than Rick's group. Real danger only manifested itself in Alexandria once Rick and crew arrived. Should Rick and cos philosophy/worldview/beliefs not be called into question at that point?","1427846462"

What you need is a good managed ethernet switch with port mirroring. You plug your modem into port A, your pi into port B, and the rest of your network off of any other port. You then mirror port A to port B. Then you put the pi ethernet port into promiscuous mode so that it will pass all traffic up to the network stack so you can use one of the many tools listed in one of the other comments to count traffic that is hitting the pi. You will need to have a tool that can be configured to know the difference between traffic sourcing from your internal network or destined for it. But you will get an absolutely accurate count of the traffic passing between your network and your modem. Graph the throughput over time and you can see the ups and downs.","1427846463"

[Some light reading](https://www.gci.org/bible/matthew517)

""The law remains valid until it reaches its intended culmination; this it is now doing in the ministry and teaching of Jesus. This verse does not state, therefore, as it is sometimes interpreted, that every regulation in the Old Testament law remains binding after the coming of Jesus. The law is unalterable, but that does not justify its application beyond the purpose for which it was intended""

I've seen this verse used many times to legitimize use and abuse of superseded OT laws by Christians, even when they're laws expressly clarified by Jesus in the latter parts of the Sermon on the Mount. There are several acceptable interpretations of the passage you quoted (hence the ""potentially"" in my opening line), the most commonly accepted of which is given in the link above. Anyone holding this view is not simply convincing/deluding themselves, but rather [treating the Bible as it teaches](http://ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Bible_Authoritative.htm) - it's a book that's been translated many times by fallible men, and should be carefully weighed to determine the intended meaning. As such, there's a perfectly acceptable and Biblically defensible view that Jesus did *not* preach ""the same hate filled vitriol"", but was, in fact, a thoroughly decent human/God hybrid and his Golden Rule of ""love God, love other people"" is a code worth living by, whatever ""God"" means for you.

Just offering an alternative for those who might be convinced by your authoritative stance on an ambiguous scripture. I'm always wary of anyone who claims to know exactly what a given passage from the Bible actually means, Christian or not. It's referred to as a ""living book"" for a reason - it often (rightly so) inspires lively debate.

Anyway, I just like playing Devil's advocate (or in this case Jesus's advocate. huh)

I remember DFW using balletic more than a few times in Infinite Jest. It's an unusual word, so it struck me as odd. He did the same thing with another word in Broom, but I don't remember what. Avian or avionic or something. Anyway I disagree that using it twice is OK because it looks like an accident. That's bad. That looks like you think it's a cool word and just want to use it. Three times looks intentional, like you're purposefully using it because it has a deeper meaning than semantics. Four times is probably excessive, though.

It seems to have arisen as a common Greek word rather than a technical term in philosophy, and its typical meaning one of godlessness in the sense of profane or impious, rather than in the sense of denying God exists.

that really isn't what she said. I know b/c it was one of my favorite lines in serial. She said, based on what we know, not what we think we know...she would have to vote to acquit even if in her heart of hearts she thinks he did it b/c that is the job of the jury. basically she is saying we can't convict b/c we think he did it if there isn't enough evidence to prove it. 

It was not a 12 hour long commercial to free Adnan...please. She wanted to figure this thing out like we did. She may, due to having gotten to know him, hoped as most of us would in the situation that he didn't do it-but in the end, she herself said she 'nursed doubt'. Jay also claims she 'demonized' him. Hardly. These are characterizations of the podcast-not actual facts. Here is exactly what she said-judge for yourself if  you think it is being properly characterized

****************************************************************************************


*****************************************************************************************
&gt;While I appreciate Adnan’s blessing to take a powder, I’m not going to. Dana’s right to be sceptical. What are the chances that one guy got so unlucky? That everything lined up against him just so. Because yes, there’s a police file full of information, circumstantial information that looks bad for Adnan. But let’s put another file next to that one, side by side. In that second file let’s put all the other evidence we have linking Adnan to the actual crime, the actual killing. What do we have? What do we know? Not what do we think we know, what do we know? If the call log does not back up Jay’s story, if the Nisha call is no longer set in stone, then think about it. What have we got for that file? All we’re left with is, Jay knew where the car was. That’s it. That all by itself, that is not a story. It’s a beginning but it’s not a story. It’s not enough, to me, to send anyone to prison for life, never mind a seventeen-year-old kid. Because you, me, the State of Maryland, based on the information we have before us, I don’t believe any of us can say what really happened to Hae. As a juror I vote to acquit Adnan Syed. I have to acquit. Even if in my heart of hearts I think Adnan killed Hae, I still have to acquit. That’s what the law requires of jurors. But I’m not a juror, so just as a human being walking down the street next week, what do I think? If you ask me to swear that Adnan Syed is innocent, I couldn’t do it. I nurse doubt.","1427846473"

I am kinda hoping I get picked for it since a couple users found a pretty major exploit in-game a while back, and I took the time to use that Exploit and see what exactly could be done with it, only to found out there was a high chance of losing your current Save File you were on.

In a way, it sounds kinda wrong, but in the end, it's always fun to see what the end result is, and then let the company know all the exact details XD (I'm referring to the Exploit with the Colosseum if any one follows the Steam Discussions for Re;Birth1)

Even if I don't get picked for it though, won't matter. I just hope the Testers that do get in get a lot of stuff fixed by letting IFI know, and i'll be buying the Game regardless any way since I love the Series XD

"Smite","t5_2stl8","Assault is also really good for learning how to think critically when it comes to your character, your team, your enemy's team, and so on. Like... today I ended up with a 4 mage team + Loki. I was Isis, and we had Hel, Poseidon, and He Bo. Out of all of the mages I had the most CC (slow, stun, silence) and the hardest chance to burst (Isis does pack a punch, but not as much as her buddies, and her circle of NOPE is easily dodged out of), so our best chance of winning would be to have me be tanky and offer a lot of CC and utility to set up our super-extreme, super-fast burst.

Ended up losing because they had Ymir, Anubis, Ra, Thanatos, and Cupid (so a perfectly balanced team), but we had them pushed all the way up to Titan before Anubis showed up with stupid amounts of damage and Ymir just couldn't be killed fast enough.","1427846479"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Games have seem to forgotten this. It should be a challenge to complete a game. It should feel amazing that you beat the final boss. It should at least take more than 5 attempts to beat the last boss.

A game needs to be fun and easy at the beginning to entice players into playing and learning the mechanics of the game at first. Introduce innovative ideas with the controls to show how deep the gameplay can go. Then after that, it should really let you decide the outcome of your own play.","1427846479"
"DotA2","t5_2s580","* ""You want to ensure your lanes are collecting more gold and experience"" This is probably just nitpicking, but using the terms of lanes lanes and heroes on those lanes interchangeably could be confusing for people with heads still whirring from so much new vocabulary.

* ""Always remember that two to three weak heroes is almost always stronger"" -&gt; ""Always remember that two to three weak heroes are almost always stronger""

* I don't think you've mentioned what Neutral Creeps are yet, how they're different from Creeps, or that they live huddled together in so-called ""camps"" in the jungle (which in turn I don't think you've properly introduced yet), some of which are called ""pull camp"" because they're close enough to your creep wave to successfully lure Neutral Creeps near your allied Creeps to make them fight each other. 

* ""The last advanced method is called pulling."" This doesn't feel like it belongs into the Dota Basics chapter at all. Call me a pessimist, but it's probably just gonna make newbies screw up a looot since they're not familar with gameplay basics yet, so their creep equilibrium's gonna be screwed, they'll get very little XP since they'll not stand in lane (waiting for the next creep wave to come) and won't get many successful pulls off, while also confusing their lane partner (that probably didn't read your guide) and will probably either face a dual lane alone or try to last hit creeps under their tower.

* ""(this is called pulling aggro)"" - if you really think that term is necessary to mention at all, might want to mention it above when you talked about Harassing since it'll make you draw aggro from enemy creeps. Which in turn could be a chapter worth of explaining what aggro means, what it refers to in terms of exploiting the simplistic AI, and why the fuck attempting to deny friendly units resets aggro.

* changing ""stack pull"" to ""stack and then pull"" or at least ""stack-pull"" might eliminate some confusion. Some might think you meant to write only one of the words.

* ""unlike I did in this clip"" ...maybe re-record the clip? I mean this is your fresh reboot, right?

* ""Myself and most players time when to pull by eyeballing it, you predict when the lane creeps will arrive at the pull opening, and what time the neutrals will die. Each neutral camp is slightly different, so practice on this will make perfect!"" - not really helpful imo, I'd at least give them the ""until the pull camp's creeps have lost about half their combined health"" rule of thumb on the way.

* ""lane equilibrium"" - for simplicity's sake, I'd just use the term ""creep equilibrium"". It's not like the lanes are going anywhere.

* ""It's much harder to connect the pull on the dire side, so be extra careful on dire."" -&gt; capitalize Dire for consistency

* ""Pulling is a really good way to get levels in the early game, and an okay way to get gold."" -&gt; again for consistency, I'd change ""levels"" to XP since XP and gold is what you get, and levels and items is what you eventually get with enough of those resources.

* section kinda needs a closer, might be a good opportunity to review all of the important vocabulary, since newcomers reading through this will most likely get really insecure about remembering all that lingo, so addressing those concerns directly should come as a big relief.

* It's 2AM so not gonna continue for Phases of the Game and beyond, but I think my overall opinion got through. And that's just that after 10k words, one opinion. Best of luck in the future, Purge!","1427846479"

* Life drain deals pure damage and its damage/heal is recalculated to consider a percentual of the current life of the drained/healed unit, so it can become relevant for late game .

So when he said that, I went hmmm wait what? Im no *Im* pretty sure I am not. But he explained it. I really didnt want to be ""that"" so I think maybe i had a ~~little~~ lot of denial because I really liked how I felt when I was up and thought I was happy when I had the ""high"" moments. My dr. was like ""hmm yeah thats when you're too happy"". Me: how is **that** a thing? lol

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","**Location**: Canada

**Budget**: $100-$250

**Source**: iPod Nano 7th Gen

**Type of Headphone**: IEM

**Preferred Tonal Balance**: Flat, ones that lean towards bass are fine too, somewhat flexible here. And as a side note, clarity is something I value quite a bit.

**Past Headphones**:
 * **Klipsch X7i** - Like how these ones sounded a lot, the reason I'm looking to buy a new pair are because one side recently stopped working. They lasted me a good 4 years

* **V-moda M80** - I use these every once in a while, but they don't isolate very well and I don't like bothering the people around me. I do like how they sound

* **SL99 Soul by Ludacris** - My first pair of ""high-end"" headphones. Didn't like these at all, too heavy on the bass and too muddy.

**Preferred Music**: Asian Pop, Rock, Metal

I've already been considering several options, the first of which are the RHA T10i's, since I've seen quite a bit about them recently and they've made a lot of Top X lists, though I've never had or heard much of anything from RHA and don't know what to expect. I've been looking at the Jaybirds BlueBuds X as well, since I've heard so much about them, but I've never owned a pair of bluetooth headphones and heard that they typically were pretty bad in the sound quality department. And lastly, I've just though about just buying another pair of X7i's, but I feel like I might just want to try something new, as I could always find something I like better.","1427846492"

But, unless you somehow grant Obelisk of Urd flash, you can't cast it without letting the Purphoros triggers resolve. That means you'd have to pass priority to your opponent first and hope he has no response. If he wants, he can kill the goblins now with bile blight.

There is a good chance though that he doesn't see the Obelisk coming and lets the triggers resolve (that means he passes priority back to you). Maybe he wants to see what else you play and kill something when you start combat or in your end step.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;So why is it linked to angular momentum instead of being its own separate quantum mechanical property, like color?

The thing is, I don't think there *is* a ""why,"" other than ""because that's what the property is.""  Just like color is linked to the strong interaction dynamics that it is, and mass is linked to the inertial kinematics that it is.

I mean think about it this way ... ""why is mass related to inertia?""  You could say ""because inertia is proportional to the total energy, and mass is a form of energy.""  But this doesn't tell us anything particularly new or interesting.  Likewise, for your question, you could answer ""because spin is a component of the total angular momentum,"" but again that's really just a restatement of what spin is.

And not to repeat myself, but ... if it wasn't that, we wouldn't call it spin.  We'd call it color, or mass, or electric charge, or unobtanity -- whatever else it would be instead, we'd come up with some other descriptive name for it.  The name we give to each property is immaterial of what the property itself is, and does.  In this particular case, it simply happens that the most description we can give about the property is that it is ""intrinsic angular momentum.""  It's linked to angular momentum because it *is* angular momentum, and it's *not* linked to rotation because it's *not* orbital in nature.  And we call it ""intrinsic"" because it is an existential property of the particle which is not related to its dynamics with respect to other systems.","1427846495"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Looking right now at the top 10 items on the front page of that sub

And that's definitely what I do when evaluating a subreddit. So that's a valid way to evaluate TwoX. And under this method, you're right. I'm wrong. 

&amp;#8710;  I'm thinking this may have to do with the way I operate when browsing Reddit. I go to the /new section of any given subreddit and *never* participate in a comments section that already has over 100 comments. 

So when I see TwoX threads, there are only a handful of comments. Usually there are 2-3 leading comments, all of which are negative and up-voted. Usually there are 2-3 responding comments countering the devil's advocate, and those are downvoted. 

But I'm embarrassed now and am debating deleting this entire CMV thread, because now that I go back to the top 10 posts on TwoX right now, the comment trend is reversed. Comments that used to be downvoted are now upvoted, and vice versa, in a way that DOES reflect the spirit of the subreddit. 

I guess it just takes enough input from the community to make it reflect the community, and my style of browsing only exposes me before there is enough input to counteract the trolls that I see at the start of a thread's existence. ","1427846496"

I was suicidal, I hated the world, etc. and I felt I was justified in feeling that way. I may have, in some ways, known it was the depression talking but I couldn't break myself of that. Just like how I can't completely break myself of my OCD tendencies because it's telling me that if I don't do my rituals something bad will happen. I *know* nothing will, but the anxiety is overwhelming.

She's not right, but I get where she's coming from. That's assuming there *is* something actually wrong with her, though. For all I know she could just be making it up for attention and doesn't want to be ""fixed"" because then she can't play pretend anymore.

So, if MRAs really want equality for men, they should call themselves feminists instead of calling themselves something that means ""no equality for men.""

On the one hand, this sounds negative, but remember what this means: most feminists really do just want equality and are perplexed by the idea that there could be a gender equality movement outside that simple definition of feminism.  They tend to treat people like Atkinson, Daly, etc as outliers and misguided extremists at worst, misunderstood at best.

They're also afraid that any gender equality movement that's not feminism would leave women behind.","1427846498"

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Is it an option to work with a veterinary behaviorist?  My dog has similar issues to yours, and I've found that medicating him has made the biggest difference in his issues.  He feels less anxious ALL THE TIME now, so his anxiety is less likely to explode in stressful situations.  Also, he is NOT sedated all the time or anything like that.  He's on an antidepressant and an anti-anxiety med, neither of which turn him into a zombie.  He is still himself, just without the weight of the anxiety he's had to live with his whole life.

I think with all the hard work you've done with behavior modification (great job, by the way!) is fantastic, and you will definitely need to keep it up, but medication may be the next step in helping your dog improve.

And, I totally understand where you're coming from regarding the SO thing.  My dog is superglue bonded to me, and occasionally growls at my husband (this has majorly improved, but he is still protective of me), but thankfully my husband loves my dog almost as much as I do and is willing to help me put in the work to help the dog get better.","1427846502"

Additionally, heavy raid damage means any damage that can be mitigated by the tank is beneficial in the long run. There's no opinion about it. Mastery is far better for survivability (and thus better for progression tanking) than crit. 

People can play any way they want. Hell, I forgot to swap my DPS gear for tanking gear on a boss the other day (still downed it thankfully). I could say it's my ""I like to not play optimally"" build. Doesn't mean it should be included in a guide as a recommended way to play. ","1427846503"

"canada","t5_2qh68","[Here are the personal](http://www.nwtel.ca/personal/internet/packages) (business are more expensive for less speed/bandwidth) plans.

Just yesterday I upped myself to the highest plan - $140/month for 300GB. I've had the one step down plan (200GB for $111) for quite some time, but went over this month and received a notice that the 20GB so far over is costing me an extra $50 this month. So, this month for about 220GB (plus yesterday evening and today) I'm paying about $160.

What did it to me this month? I've watched a few seasons of a few shows on Netflix (medium quality), updated a bunch of systems (Windows 7, OSX, Android) and I do some minor website work.  I don't stream music or anything. I have started watching a few TV shows online as well this month. I hardly consider myself a power user - I don't game or anything.

I don't really care about the speed (new plan is 100Mbps). My mom lives in rural Ontario with a Bell DSL plan (fastest available where she is - 5Mbps down/1 Mbps up) and she pays $65.96/month for UNLIMITED bandwidth.

If I were in Ontario I'd choose their Internet 25 (25/8) for $75.95/month UNLIMITED bandwidth.","1427846503"

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","Yes, concrete wicks moisture and is very vapor-permeable, so if a vapor barrier wasn't put under the slab originally, putting one over it is a good idea.

If it's humid in winter then that generally means too much vapor is being generated -- vapor coming in from the ground, or cooking/showers.

If it's humid in summer, that can indicate too much air leakage, as warm summer air contains a lot of moisture (unless you're in a desert), and air sealing the building will help.

If it's humid in the spring/fall, and/or the above measures don't solve the problem, and/or you're not willing/able to pursue fixing them further, then you have to either run an air conditioner or dehumidifier more, to wring more water out of the indoor air.

Indoor humidity above 60% is a mold risk. 50-60% encourages dust mite growth, although this only matters to certain people. Anything under 50% is safe, but comfort-wise you may prefer to go lower.","1427846504"

I think his character would have been better served going after the Authority/Rollins like Ambrose did and waited until next year for the mega push. Give him a solid US/IC title run first. This didn't happen so plan b.

Plan B would have been to accept that the WWE wanted to jetpack Roman to the top and it was inevitable. In order to do this, you have him run roughshod over his opponents like Lesnar does (obviously not to the same degree) and it would at least make it seem like he deserves to be there. Instead he was losing via roll up on Raw but kicked out of 3 F5s. The whole build up was pathetic for a man the WWE wanted people to buy into beating Lesnar and being champ.","1427846506"

Obi-Wan has less experience with rage, but he still has the capacity, as seen in Episode 1. The key factor here is that he would take that rage and keep it under control, strategically besting Anakin. And if it comes down to raw dueling skill, he outclasses Anakin there.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","This is all rather interesting to me, even though I disagree with a number of your points.  They make sense from a Catholic perspective, but not to me who has never actually been a Catholic.

With regards to obeying Rome... [Cardinal Raymond Burke](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/pope-francis-demotes-anti-gay-bishop) is (assuming he hasn't confessed, etc., of which I have no knowledge) living in mortal sin?  I haven't much followed the story, except to have taken note of it.  Just a side curiosity.

The things you're saying ring familiar from what I learned in school, and are some of the many reasons I wouldn't make a good Catholic, based on what I believe to be true and right.  That doesn't make them *wrong* by any means, just observing that they are significantly different from what I personally believe, though useful for fleshing out exactly what it is that I personally believe.

Five centuries of people who arguably are Christians are grave sinners because they worship in a different fashion and view God differently?  I have difficulty reconciling that concept with the God of the NT.

I'm in no position to be slinging about judgement based on single verses out of context, and I don't mean to come off that way, but 1 Chronicles 28:9 comes to mind.  Generally, if you seek Him, you will find Him.  It speaks not to a method of seeking, and the only hard and fast rules about worship that Jesus himself set out is found in the Lord's Prayer.  Everything else seems to work out to a set of ""best practices"" - prayer in public is acceptable, so long as it's not to gain the admiration of men, but the best practice is to go into your closet, for example.

With regard to Baptism, it's difficult to steal something that isn't exclusively owned in the first place.  Baptism *necessarily* pre-dates Christianity - otherwise, John the Baptist would have just been plain John.  Obviously it was practiced differently, but it existed nonetheless, and it existed as a dedication to the same God. (As well as others, arguably, but that's not really relevant.)  The Jews may be mistaken about the Law, the role of Jesus, and a thousand other things, but they follow the same God, and they claimed ownership of general baptismal practices long before the Catholic church was in existence, for example.

The entire concept of a loving God rejecting all but a given form of worship, praise, and mission honestly does not make a great deal of sense to me, but I understand generally why such beliefs can and even must exist.

I suppose that, to me, the concept breaks down when any two given denominations claim to be the one and only true way.  Somebody has to win that, somebody has to lose that, and that doesn't equal forgiveness and love in my mind.","1427846508"

Stuff to remember:

1. **Titles make the post.**  
 Good titles are critical to quality content.
 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

If you're good with the conditions above, go ahead and post it on /r/StreetFighter using the link below.

I've been dealing with IBS-C for about 3 years and have tried nearly paleo fix you could imagine.
Each time I come across a new scheme I think I've found the missing link but it's never the case. I've tried Dr BG's SIBO treatment, Paleo Mom's Autoimmune protocol, Keto-paleo, SCD, High carb paleo low fiber paleo, low fodmap, low soluble high insoluble fiber (and vice versa), resistant starch etc and nothing ever worked.

I think the low carb or high fiber approach worsens the SIBO problem and you should look at removing fermentation in your intestines instead.

What's working for me is keeping sugar high, keeping fiber and starch as low as possible, balancing gelatin with tryptophan/cysteine and only eating saturated fats (~50g a day). DOMS has notably lowered ever since increasing sucrose too.

I know this contradicts the standard paleo protocol but that wasn't working for me and now that I've tweaked mine my digestion is nearly back to normal and rosacea has disappeared.","1427846509"

I initially thought this was a discouraging sign, but fortunately this practice seems to develop my ability to concentrate, even outside of meditation.

In your case, my hypothesis is that you don't feel strong in visualizing because you are already visualizing so much, and this wears down your ability to focus. However, it's also possible that you're trying to visualize in a way that is not intuitive to you, but it is difficult to advise on this issue without the benefits of self-insight.","1427846511"

The next 2 months are basically end of year exams, then flights. If I break up with her now, I might fuck up her exams. If I break up with her just after exams, we have to go on the trip anyway and she might hate me.

Oh, you mean like, UFC or whatever?"" and then I have been totally blown away by some people's response when they genuinely brush it off with something like ""I don't watch pro wrestling, it's so fake/gay/etc."" and even when I have tried to correct them by explaining that the UFC/MMA is not pro wrestling, that it is in fact real and actual competition, and that I'm not a fan of pro wrestling either, etc., they say something like ""whatever, it's all the same"". Honestly, I wouldn't have believed it unless it had happened to me on multiple occasions with different people. And for that reason, even though I kind of thought it was cool to see Ronda and the Rock perform together, I still hate to see anything that could encourage that type of confusion between pro wrestling and MMA.","1427846514"

Bingo. except I explicitly said that.

&gt; ""So even though I think you're making the clearly false argument that labor unions are good because the buyers now may purchase in bulk and therefore get labor for cheaper, the only other interpretation of what you've written appears to me to be that labor unions have the ability to drive up the price of labor. If that's what you're saying... congratulations; you've said something everyone knows already.""

And as someone who has to labor for my day, I have a vested interest in this process.

The vast majority fit this category, so why the fuck do a large chunk of the population act like unions are evil? I don't fucking get it.

While the meta is still settling, I would say this deck is free to experiment with some of the optional slots for the deck.
Last night at my LGS we had a 16 man competitive standard tournament where I came 3rd playing this list:

4 Elvish Mystic
3 Rattleclaw Mystic
4 Scaleguard Sentinels
4 Goblin Rabblemaster
4 Fanatic of Xenagos
2 Ashcloud Phoenix
4 Thunderbreak Regent
4 Stormbreath Dragon

4 Crater's Claws
2 Draconic Roar
2 Lightning Strike

4 Wooded Foothills
4 Temple of Abandon
1 Rugged Highlands
2 Mana Confluence
6 Forest
6 Mountain


Sideboard:
3 Destructive Revelry
3 Roast
2 Wild Slash
2 Twin Bolt
2 Outpost Seige
2 Xenagos, the Reveler
1 Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker


My matchups were: 2-0 vs RG Atarka's Command, 2-1 Mono Red Aggro, 1-2 Mono Red Aggro &amp;amp; 2-1 Sultai Control.


[[Scaleguard Sentinels]] is a really powerful 2 drop for  this deck and is amazing in an aggro heavy meta. In my experience it comes down with the +1/+1 about 70% of the time.


At FNM last Friday I ran Boon Satyr, but again found him outclassed against the aggro decks like Mono R, GR Aggro &amp;amp; BW Warriors. I'm running [[Fanatic of Xenagos]] in its place as its a better blocker, the trample is relevant and it's better positioned in my current meta.


I'm not a fan of [[Twin Bolt]]. I never drew it yesterday, but 1 for 1 with Dragon Fodder seems kinda bad. I think in this slot it's better to play more mass removal in my aggro-filled meta. I'm contemplating running [[Seismic Rupture]] even though it wipes my dorks.


I'm also considering moving Xenagos, the Reveler over Ashcloud Phoenix in the main. I'm yet to see Jeskai at my LGS and he is just pure value.","1427846516"

I wouldn't say it's theorizing in a vacuum though. Here's how I get to big conclusions about sociological/political stuff. I'll notice something small, hypothesize why it happened, and test out the hypothesis against future observations. If it checks out, I have a mini theory. ('Observations' include reading other people's theories, but it's just as important for me to experience something.) But I have to connect a ton of mini theories together before I can say something like 'I'm a feminist.'

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","Erie? Or further south? My mom's from Erie. :)

I moved from your neck of the woods to Winnipeg a while ago. Most of the commenters  have hit my main points already, so I'll focus on crime...

When I first moved here, I was a bit freaked out listening to the news: murder capital of Canada, tons of violent and property crime. Being from a smaller town, where we simply didn't have that kind of shit, I spent a lot of time looking over my shoulder and feeling very unsafe.

A fair amount of time here has helped me put things in perspective. First, Winnipeg does have a lot of crime when you compare it to other Canadian cities. But the overall crime rate in Canada is way lower than in the US. Compare Winnipeg to someplace like Pittsburgh, Youngstown or Cleveland, and it's very safe. Big cities have crime, and most of them have some kind of gang activity. But I remember there being whole neighborhoods in Cleveland that were no go zones, especially after dark. Even the freakiest part of the North End in Winnipeg is nowhere near that bad.

Plus, a lot of the violent crime in Winnipeg seems to be amongst people who know each other. I don't know how many stabbing news stories I've heard that start off with ""A house party got out of hand and-"" or ""A group of friends were drinking last night when-"". I'm not saying that random crime doesn't occur, and it's a tragedy when it does... but in a city of 650,000+ people it will happen occasionally. It just won't happen at the same frequency that it does in the States. [Relevant comment from a while ago.](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2e8qt7/it_rained_a_lot_in_winnipeg_today/cjxdslb) Just don't be dumb, keep your head up while you're downtown at night, and don't go to random drinking parties.

Anyway. I think the differences you'll notice more are: 

* Things cost a lot more, but wages are generally higher than in the US, so it balances out. Some things cost a lot more, though, like gasoline and wireless.
* Winnipeg doesn't get nearly as much snow as you're used to, and it's shitty snow at that: dry and powdery, and mostly just blows around. Also, cold.
* Lots of great parks within a quick drive, and even more within the city if you like to go walking. We even have [a hill](http://winnipeglovehate.com/2010/09/14/storm-looming-over-garbage-hill/).","1427846517"

Almost all the comments completely disregard the idea of subtle sexism.

[Students protest ‘sexist’ billboard: Students gathered in Newtonville to protest a billboard featuring a kitchen they claim to be sexist. The billboard was posted by Teakwood Builders Inc. It features a kitchen with the text “Your wife wants me” printed on the sign.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/30ergx/students_protest_sexist_billboard_students/)  Here students are protesting something, and the majority of the comments are calling it stupid and pointless. 

Finally, the one that prompted me to make this post - my comment in response to an article about Keira Knightly. Knightly asks [""Where are the female writers and directors?""](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/30zb11/keira_knightley_where_are_the_female_directors/) My comment was quoting and then agreeing with Knightly, and then mentioning a similar example of Reese Witherspoon, but is currently at -6 downvotes.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","This is 100% accurate from personal experience and from friends.

As an example, a friend of a friend (let's call him friend A), who participated with his challenger friends in a lan tournament in canada.    Against another full challenger team.   The hilarious thing about that tournament was, friend A who was plat 1 but who didn't play a lot with roughly 100 or so games.   Dominated their challenger mid in a best of 5 on multiple match ups.    This friend A was diamond 1 last season.     Obviously this is a side example of things, but this is an example of this thread.

Personally, I've struggled in this elo, I have been demoted and promoted again over the last while.   While I think I can still improve a lot, but a lot of these games are so far out of reach within 6 - 8 minutes of the game, it's not even called a game.    Let's say you have a game where I'm the ad, and my friend is the jungle, we are both 3 0 , 4 1, type of score.    You then find your solo laners 3 levels behind and going 0 6 in 9 minutes.     It's beyond frustrating to have those type of games for an extended amount of time.    

In fact, in the streak that I've been demoted, I had on average kda of 3.5, of something like a 13 game loss span.    While my partner had 3.5-4.8.     On my streak of getting back to diamond, included multiple games where I didn't have to do anything, cause team was winning that hard.     This elo is definitely too random and is a massive struggle...

I'm sure riot knows the problem.    I hope they can do something about it, but I don't know what can be done.   It's unfortunate, all I can do in the meanwhile is just to enjoy playing this game and improve.    We'll see what happens down the road.","1427846524"

"thehunterprimal","t5_3564h","I'll just post this from the Steam user Coeco:

This is one of my favorite alpha games ever to hit Steam.. And It's a damn shame I have to stomp it into the ground because during the estimated 1-2 years of work I expected this game to take before beginning to reach a finished state, the developers had a stroke of genius and decided that it would be a good idea to call this HEAVY ALPHA GAME a FULLY RELEASED TITLE after being on Steam for only 5-6 months. Doing so, Avalanche Studios have yet again showed the world that they do not give a damn about actually delivering a polished product to customers and fans alike and instead falsely advertise &amp; release yet another unfinished glitch-fest onto Steam like a big, flaccid díck onto your dinner table, expecting a price-tag of 30€ for an experience you can expect out of a glitchy tech demo.

I mean holy hell. They JUST spewed out a new dinosaur with this ""release update"".. AND IT HAS NO TESTING DONE TO IT WHATSOEVER. If you still insist on buying this garbage, kindly make note of the following issues the game currently has:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Animations for both dinosaurs and players are on a ""Proof of Concept"" level at most, and when combined with point 2, It makes for a disgusting game-play experience as far as immersion is concerned.

2. The AI is absolutely atrocious. All dinosaurs can get extremely stuck on certain hills, get seizures or freeze up indefinitely if you decide to go up on a rock, the T-Rex can use you as a surf-board and stand ontop of you indefinitely without being able to attack if you go prone and have him not see and ""aggro"" you directly (Realistic, right?), The smallest of dinosaurs can take 10+ shotgun slugs to the head (and smash their skulls to thousand pieces) and still be alive &amp; charge your person endlessly with no difficulty or signs of being stunned whatsoever, T-Rexes can with a 100% accuracy pinpoint your location If they hear you, say, walk at a steady pace 500 meters away, they WILL rush your location and insta-gib you unless you log out. Fun fun fun!

3. The game has a disgusting lack of realism. Building on the previous statement of the dinosaurs having nonexistant AI in regards to stun or reactions overall, the game does not allow you to do VERY basic things like jumping while also having an absolutely broken ""Hit-detection"" system whereas you can know the exact angle and 3d space of say, a raptor's heart, shoot it with a shotgun slug.. And have the bullet either go through him completely, missing all organs or hit another bodypart. It's disgustingly random and sometimes, you can even get one-shot-kills without hitting any organs - and have no damage show up in the dino death re-cap window. There are also another giant design problem and that is the way that foilage works in this game. Dinosaurs do not say, leave grass bent or otherwise moved when they pass through it. It's like they're ghosts, so every time you chase or otherwise look for a dino where foilage is thick - you WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE IT. EVEN IF YOU KNOW IT'S RIGHT INFRONT OF YOU IN THE GRASS. It is one of these GIANT design issues that force you to avoid grassy areas all-together and it really brings light on how much of an alpha game this shít of a title really is.

4. The game is very unoptimized. Most PC's struggle to run this game and while I didn't have any particular big problems myself, the forums speak for themselves though and following the numerous complaints I saw, I made a closer inspection and did infact see that my G-Card had a tendency to being extremely hot when playing.

5. The developers do not take advice or read the forums. Ditto. It took them literally 3-4 months to notice a typo in the forum section called ""Thoughts &amp; Suggtesions"" or something like that and that's just a depressing realization as there are literally hundreds of posts made - Not ONE of them has seen their ideas/suggestions been implemented into the game.

6. There is legitimately no goal in this game. You roam around like an idiot (sometimes for a whole hour or more if you're unlucky), looking for dinosaurs with a shoddy bow and If you want to have different weapons, you HAVE TO &lt;-- go to a pre-defined location and rummage through larger crates... Or die and go to the store that have rétárded level restrictions on all weapons &amp; ammo that can sometimes require you to kill literally hundreds of dinos before having THE OPTION &lt;-- to spend your own points to spawn with the gun you want next time you die. Crafting? End-game? Goals? Plot? Story? What's that?

7. Sounds are downright broken and extremely confusing. Your own footsteps can make stomping noises with that of a T-Rex if you take small steps and listen carefully while certain raptors simply have no sounds to them at all except the standard ""chop"" attack bits while others have loud yelping calls, aggro noises, etc etc. While It certainly has jump-scared me a few times to get my buttocks suddenly chewed on by something that didn't make even the tiniest of noise, having some raptors suddenly become Batman in the Jungle while the rest are akin with that of howler monkeys is not a good as far as gameplay consistency is concerned.

I hear people talking about wellfare, etc.. how bad it is for an average person to take welfare.  They don't realize that companies like IBM and Oracle are the biggest welfare whores on the planet.  They get all kinds of contracts from the govt and provide very little value.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Pure aluminum doesn't glow very much because it has a low emissivity. Aluminum oxide is much brighter. 

Copypasta from here: http://www.debunking911.com/moltensteel.htm

&gt;Several times over the last year I have been asked to comment on a photo of one of the Trade Center Towers. The photo shows a molten flow from one of the windows. The flow falls down along the building. It appears orange and turns to a gray color as it cools. 

&gt;The questions usually want me to address ""Is this photo a fake?"" and ""Is the flow steel or aluminum?"" ""Is this situation possible?"" 

&gt;First, I will address the temperature range, then the color of the flow. 

&gt;I am working in imperial units and temperature in degrees F [To convert to C use this link]

&gt;Metals lose about 50% of their strength at 60% of their melting temperature. This is common knowledge and may be found in any undergraduate text regarding ""Fracture and Deformation of Materials."" 

&gt;If the approximate melting temperature of steel is 2750 F the the material would be plastic at 1650 F. Even assuming a safety factor of 3, you would expect the bolts or other structural members to deform and fail near this temperature, especially with the additional weight if a jet air liner. I would assume that the live load calculations did not include the typical office equipment and an airliner plus a factor of 3. THEREFORE I assume that the flow is not steel and that the temperature of the steel members at the time of the photo is less than 1650 F. 

&gt;Assuming that the flow would be molten aluminum from the airliner and the color of molten aluminum is silver then why is the flow orange? 

&gt;The color of pure molten aluminum is silver, It has an emissivity of .12. Steel has an emissivity of .4 and appears orange in the temperature range of molten aluminum. 

&gt;The emissivity of aluminum oxide is .44 and also appears orange in the melting temperature range of molten aluminum. 

&gt;The emissivity of plate glass is .937 It begins to soften at 1000 F and flows around 1350 F. Silica has an emissivity of .8 

&gt;Copper oxide also has an emissivity of .8. however I will assume that their effect is negligible. 

&gt;Aluminum oxidizes readily in the foundry under ideal melting conditions. Large surface area relative to thickness, turbulence, the presence of water or oil greatly increases the oxidation of aluminum. A jet airliner is made of thin aluminum sheet and most probably suffered considerable oxidation especially in contact with an open flame and being in contact with jet fuel. If you don't believe this, try melting a few soda cans over coals or open flame. If you are lucky you will end up with only 50% aluminum oxide. However, the cans may completely burn up. 

&gt;The specific gravity of aluminum is 2.7. The specific gravity of aluminum oxide (Al2O3-3H2O) is 2.42 the specific gravity of Si = 2.40 and Glass is 2.65 these are all very similar and likely to be entrained in a molten aluminum flow. Don't believe it? lightly stir the dross into molten aluminum. The surface tension is so high is is almost impossible to separate them. 

&gt;THEREFORE assuming that the flow consist of molten aluminum and considerable oxides, and assuming that the windows in the trade center were plate glass and also in a plastic state and that they were also likely entrained in the molten aluminum. I would expect the flow to appear to be orange in color. Especially since both the entrained materials have emissivities equal to or more than twice that of iron. 

&gt;Also since dross cools to a gray color and glass with impurities also turns dark. I would expect that the flow would darken upon cooling. 

&gt;I would also suggest that not only is the photo possible, but entirely likely. 

&gt;Summary: The flow is not steel because the structural steel would fail well below the melting temperature. The flow is likely to be a mixture of aluminum, aluminum oxides, molten glass and coals of whatever trash the aluminum flowed over as it reached the open window. Such a flow would appear orange and cool to a dark color.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","DirectX is a standardized language that different computer parts speak. In particular, the main computer tells the graphic card what to display using it. 

New versions of DirectX essentially add new words to the vocabulary. At first it was ""draw a red triangle here"", and that's it. Then the added words for ""draw this picture here"", then they added words for ""draw water here"" then they added words for ""here is how I want water to look"" then they added words for ""make a bright glowy effect here.""  I don't know the details of what new words/concepts they added in 12, but the general idea is they add ways to describe new things or to describe old things in newer, faster ways.

For instance, before ""draw water here"" people had to calculate the blue triangles and spots for on-disk images to be displayed to look like water. This was hard for most developers and was slow for the main computer to calculate. So water looked bad, and took up precious development time. Now, it's relatively quick and easy to make basic water-like effects, due to the new language constructs added in more recent DirectX. ","1427846530"

"kansascity","t5_2qngc","Uh, maybe I'm alone here, but does this post kind of smell like astroturfing to anyone else?

We have an easy-to-fake screenshot of an automated email, and a flippant response that allegedly comes from a representative.

The email that was sent to this rep was an autogenerated email sent by clicking a few links on an Uber site. The rep in question likely received thousands of similar emails. If he received so many, he would likely not have spent the time going through each individual message and typing out a response. If he was familiar enough with the internet to understand that ""sending an email back"" is a meaningless gesture, then he wouldn't have known enough to send out massed responses to everyone who sent in the automatically generated email.


Not to mention the fact that it's the only link submission from an account that's existed almost unused for six months.

I'm not usually the one to start shouting conspiracy, but this whole post just smells fishy. From everything Uber's done in the past, I wouldn't put it past them at all to submit something like this as part of a smear campaign.","1427846531"

It's hard for me to say what I would do in your situation. My first Paragard IUD expelled after about 6 months, I got it replaced ASAP, and I haven't had any problems with it since. I didn't feel mine expel either, but it was right at the end of my period, so I didn't experience the same deluge that you did (as far as my periods on Paragard, that's a slightly different story). I also paid for my first one out of pocket, but by the time it expelled, I had insurance that covered the new one in full. However, even if I had to pay for the new one out of pocket as well, I still would have. It was worth it to me to have hormone-free, super effective BC. (I have no experience with hormonal BC either, but I chose Paragard because the idea of hormones makes me uncomfortable.)

I guess overall, I would say to not necessarily be afraid of giving it another go, although I would understand if you were given your experience. I can't personally speak to the Mirena, but I know a lot of people like it because it lightens their periods, and I think it has a *slightly* lower expulsion rate than Paragard (but not by much, I don't think).

Good luck with whatever you decide to do!","1427846532"

"DynastyFF","t5_2umu4","Just my opinion but I'll put them into 3 categories:


**Keep: Watkins, Matthews, Allen, Robinson**


**Look to trade if you can get good value: Bryant, Moncrief, Adams**


**Cut: Patterson**


I think the WRs to keep are either very talented or will be hard to get the value you want in a trade (Watkins is both, Allen might not get you the return you are looking for). I would try to trade Adams and Moncrief to the owners of Nelson and A. Johnson if you can get a high 1st or the equivalent in value. With such shallow rosters imo it's not worth waiting the 3 years to have Nelson/Johnson to go away and who knows if those teams draft another WR by the time they even would theoretically get the chance to start. Also I believe that the Colts wouldn't have signed AJ if they had so much faith in Moncrief and the same with Cobb and Adams. Bryant reminds me of a taller Mike Wallace and only has appeal as a WR5 for me as a buy week fill in. He relies too much on the big play for me to put faith in him as a consistent weekly starter imo. Patterson has frustrated me because he has the talent, but may never put it together, and may just become a Devin Hester type. I'd hold him if it were a deeper league, but since it is so shallow I'd probably just drop him.","1427846532"

Just accept everything as it is without adding anything of your own to it. 

When you are sitting looking at the floor just sit and look at the floor. You aren't making anything if you know the color or if its cold but you are making something when you create a story about it. You may love it or hate it and that's great just love it or hate it but don't attach to it and create a narrative, let that go and just feel it either way. 

Whatever you are doing just do it. Its simple yet hard. Fundamental zen stuff.

Everyone here wants to understand Zen but people are trying too hard reading and thinking too much and making so many things all day. History is fun but what master said what, what is real zen and what is not, I like this practice but not that, I like religion or not. Endless faffing about but really if people want to understand Zen they need to just do it, its actually nothing special.

Stay salty.

and you replied:

&gt; Really counting Season one worlds four years ago? Really? Christ man, stop living in the past.


I'm just correcting your mistake of saying EU only outperformed NA in season 1. Plus is season 5 now and with completely different meta.

There isn't any point in bring up ANY seasons to make judgements this season.

The only thing we have to go off on the NA vs EU debacle is the last IEM and since no eu team faced an na team and Sk went 1-1 with Flashwolves and flashwolves also went 1-1 agaisnt tsm but later it turned into a 2-1 due to the fact that they played one more game since it was a best of 3s we can't really say if TSM is better than SK.

Though i think until SK shows that they can perform even with lucian+Graves ban TSM is better, doesn't change the fact you were still wrong to say that EU only outperformed NA in season 1. We have performed better in 3/4 seasons and that was my only point :)

Plus you can't even use an argument to say that TSM is an NA team since half their players are EU, TSM is more like a hybrid child at this point lol.","1427846537"

"CollegeBasketball","t5_2rj3j","The complaint I've seen the most is that the shot clock in college allows defensive minded teams to hold the ball to reduce possesions so you end up with a slower game with many fewer attempted shots if a team wanted to do that.


I'm not sure I like the idea of mandating a certain style of play with a short shot clock, especially if its for TV viewership and not for the good of the game. 


This feeds into the unwatchable comment I've heard from multiple NBA fans because they are so used to the very fast shot clock and better shooting skills.


The question on whether shortening the shot clock would ""fix"" the game is for a higher level of knowledge than me.

 Although... I am concerned that a ""good"" CBB rulebook is in the eye of the beholder.","1427846542"

1) Fight intelligently. When a disagreement is getting out of control, take a break to calm down and evaluate whether it is really worth arguing about it. Revisit the issue in an hour. Also stick to the topic at hand. Keep an eye on resolving the problem, rather than one-upping the other person and bringing up what they ""always"" or ""never"" do.

2) Realize that love isn't enough and maybe this relationship has run its natural course. Everyone thinks the relationship they are in at the moment is the best one they've ever had and the most intense love they've ever felt. Especially when it has only been two months and it is all still new and exciting. But the fact that breakups are a thing and everyone goes through several tells us that feeling rarely matches up with reality. Know when to call it quits.","1427846544"

It's a wierd planet, in supercruise from a distance you can see the light spot with the shadow of the planet behind.  The ring itself is light on the middle+outer but the inside where the two RES's are is pitch black even on the light side of the planet.

I tried a rares route I found on here from a while back with something like 12+ stops on it, but considering the downtime with supercruise &amp; mailslot over and over again it ended up only making about 200k/hr when it was quoted at 1.5mil+/hr.

Just finding that bounty hunting constantly is getting boring, but the alternatives don't stand up in terms of $$/hr.

FYI I've got an ASP &amp; Vulture atm.

He tried to commit as much of it as he could to memory, and hoped that if he compared notes with Maester Gordon and Ned later, they might be able to reconstruct it in its entirety. 

Symond rose and moved away from Cassana to give the Maester room, and gestured toward the guards in the room. 

""You two. Fetch a bier and help the Maester move the Lady Tully to her rooms.""

""And you,"" He said as he singled out another guard. ""Run and find Lord Tully with all haste and tell him what's transpired here,"" he said as he made his way to the door, and left the icy laboratory behind. 

His long legs gave Symond Frey a long stride and a quick gait under even under ordinary circumstances, but there was no mistaking the fact that the Lord of the Crossing was in a hurry as he made his way from the keep of Riverrun to the Sept in the River.

I haven't really read anything regarding how that's changed since the Mechanicum became the Adeptus Mechanicus but yeah, at least that's the organizational structure in the 30k universe.

it seems to me a little awkward that AdMech is coming out so close to the start of Mechanicum in 30k, because fans of Mars, while currently elated to the point of disbelief, most likely have the means to work on only one army or the other (personally I might buy a couple Admech sets but nothing serious until I finish my Mechanicum force) and also I feel like GW and FW now have to sort of step around each other so as not to step on each other's toes by coming out with different versions of the same model within a few months.","1427846552"

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","This is all nonsense man. 

He's just piling on mathematical/game theory language in an attempt to overwhelm and distort your understanding of his position. He could've explained what he meant much more  in straight-forward terms if he actually wanted someone to be on the same page as him (or related what he was referencing directly to his position), but he doesn't want anyone on the same page as him. He just wants to dazzle with complex, unfamiliar terms to give an impression that his ideological viewpoints are somehow ""mathematically sound"".

He's saying ""just look at ___"", ""readup on ___""......even though there are varied conclusions that could be drawn from what he's referencing. Instead of explaining exactly how A proves B, he rests on the average person reading this to not understand A, therefore having no concrete argument against B that relates to what he said. It's language masturbation, and somebody who forms arguments like he does is not trying to promote an open dialogue. He's buried so many ancillary terms and references in his writing that to properly unravel even his most simple points, you would have to understand game theory or mathematics. 

It's classic /r/iamverysmart material...he throws around tons of smart sounding language/references without actually forming a sound, well-explained argument. His post only even attempts to disprove the concept that ""a stateless society is beneficial, and hierarchies should be avoided"", which shows a very oversimplified understanding of anarchism.","1427846552"

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","Jay is definitely involved. This fact is indisputable. This eliminates all random killer(s) such as Roy Davis, Ronald Lee Moore, Mr. S or Space Aliens.  Jay is either the killer or knows who the killer is.


Jay has no motive to kill Hae Min Lee.  Jay and Hae run in completely different circles. Hae has moved on.  She’s not trying to get even with Jay for “stepping out” on Stephanie. She’s not involved in a drug deal going wrong.    She has fallen in love with a new guy.  She’s thinking about college and her future.  She has no time for Jay.  Jay isn't killing Hae out of fear or revenge or to frame Adnan Syed.  Jay has a busy life and it doesn't involve Hae.  He has several part time jobs.  He has a small time marijuana dealing operation.  He is dating Stephanie.  Jay has nothing to do with Hae, not on the 13th of January, 1999, not ever.



Jay has no opportunity to kidnap and kill Hae Min Lee.  Jay is happily driving around in Adnan's car.  He is making marijuana deals on Adnan's cell phone.  He’s playing video games with Jenn’s brother.  He’s buying a present for Stephanie.  He’s going to the mall. He’s going to Patrick’s house.  He’s picking up and dropping off Adnan.   He isn't planning to murder Hae or even running into her accidentally and killing her in a rage.  The logistics are impossible without an accomplice (e.g. multiple cars, multiple locations, phone logs, tower pings, pickups and drop off of Adnan, shovels, clothes).



If Jay is not the killer then he knows who the killer is. Jay is a black kid admitting to being involved in the murder of a popular, intelligent and gifted, girl with a bright future.  He would only get involved if he knew the person directly.  His motive is to help from afar. He isn't a killer.  He separates himself from the actual deed.  Whether it’s money, fear or a sick sense loyalty to the killer, Jay feels obligated to help.  He needs to insert himself into the situation, but why and for whom?



The direct connection between Hae and Jay is Adnan Syed.  Jay is dating Stephanie.  Stephanie is friends with Adnan.  Adnan is dating Hae.  Jay is either an accomplice or accessory for Stephanie or Adnan.  Again, this is not a random murder.  This is not a robbery.  This is not rape.  The killer knew Hae. The killer strangled her.  This is a very up-close and personal way of killing someone.  You are staring directly into their eyes as life leaves their body.   Adnan Syed is the only person with this much anger towards Hae.  Adnan was deeply and emotionally hurt by the love of his life, his first girl-friend, his first kiss and only sexual partner (at the time). Knowing that Hae had moved on so quickly AND was potentially having sex with Don was too much for his ego.  Adnan was disappointed with the situation and acted out in stereotypical fashion. He killed Hae because he felt betrayed.  It occurred in Hae’s car with Hae kicking and trying to get free.  Adnan Syed has motive, means and opportunity to kidnap and murder Hae Min Lee.



There are many that disbelieve Jay because of the inconsistency of his stories.


In all his versions, he never changes his accusation that Adnan killed Hae Min Lee. He doesn't breakdown and confesses. He doesn't say someone else did it.  He never says he just came across the body. He doesn't blame anyone else. He implicates Adnan, potentially endangering himself if Adnan has an air tight alibi.



In all his versions, he never changes where he see Hae's body. It's not slumped over the steering wheel.  It's not in laying on back seat.  It's not on the floorboard covered with a blanket. Adnan always shows him Hae’s body in the trunk of Hae's car.



In all his versions, he never changes what they do with the body.  They don't bury it in Patapsco Park.  They don't dump it behind Woodlawn High School. They don't throw it into a dumpster in back of the F&amp;M. Jay and Adnan bury the body in Leakin Park.
I understand the need to accuse Jay in order to lift suspicion from Adnan, but Jay being the killer just doesn’t fit.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Let's take that thought and run with it. First of all, it would end up being a lot of assembly routines: true, most operating systems use some assembly language code to accomplish things that are so hardware specific even C code can't handle them, but if you replace C with an even higher level language, more assembly will be required. A lot of memory management, I/O, networking, and system call tasks can be completed with C but not with, for example, python. So already you're making your OS less portable and harder to maintain.

Secondly, and more importantly, if you pause GC and then run some code, you lose memory safety. It is very hard to ensure that the assembly code can't and won't affect the GC's ability to manage objects. An assembly routine can alter the stack, change reference counts, make unreferenced copies, and so on.

Here's an example: you need to copy a string of bytes as text from hardware. You use a GC string object where the string length is stored as a separate variable, and one that's already allocated with a string that you're overwriting (say we're in a for loop or something). The GC pauses, the assembly routine copies the raw bytes from the hardware, and overwrites the old string. But what if the old string isn't as long as the new string? If you update the length value in the GC object, the excess bytes from the old string will be forgotten and never get deallocated. If you don't, the information in the GC string object is wrong. Sure, there's a way around it, but it involves essentially writing another GC to handle cases like this - only this time, in assembly. You end up having to manage memory often enough anyway that the high level language is more trouble than it's worth.","1427846555"

&gt;  are you arguing it's incoherent to argue that ""while i support gay marriage there are legitimate arguments against it"" because that's what you really need to do here.

Every argument against gay marriage is an argument that because someone personally disagrees with it, they should impose this disagreement upon everyone else and prohibit others from getting married for no reason other than their own personal beliefs. I find this argument to not be a legitimate argument. Feel free to give me an argument that isn't necessarily ""I believe this is wrong so no one else should be allowed to do it"" and I'll admit there are legitimate arguments. Again, the intolerance of gay people such that they should not be allowed to get married for no other reason than because some people think it is wrong and that they have the right to impose their will on others is why they are bigoted. Not simply because I ""disagree"" with them.

&gt; but if i disagreed with you i would say your victimizing them.

I understand your argument. But regardless of the reasoning or whether you agree or disagree with me, I do not see how my choice to not patronize their establishment is in any way victimizing them. That is the part I do not get. My choice to not eat there *does not victimize them at all*. 

&gt; anyone telling you these laws are a license for everyone everywhere to discriminate as much as they please is lying to you.

The Indiana Law explicitly broadens the scope of the law in such a way which gives a license for people to discriminate against others. That's the problem. We're not talking about RFRA laws in general, just the Indiana law.

&gt; it's not fair as in not right aka being an ass aka violating the social norms of NOT protesting people you disagree with politically. when you protest someone you don't just disagree with them you very strongly disagree.

Since when is it a social norm to *not* protest or boycott that which we politically disagree with? It's most definitely a social norm to refuse to patronize an establishment with which we strongly disagree politically. That is not being an ass nor is it violating any social norms. So again, how is my decision to not patronize them ""unfair"" in any way?","1427846555"

Then also comparing it to how different it is to any other game community ive come across**


Honestly i can't give you numbers, i may be giving a biased opinoin, but it is an opinion i have developed over many years of rs2 and old school. Over the length of old school i still happen to be talking to people that I met primarily in the pking scene of rs 2, even more specifically the pure pk clans. The general consensus i got through out rs2's life was that a large number of pkers hacked. Most of the pkers had mains, or eventually throughout the death of rs2 gave up pking and played some other aspect of the game. Effectively dissolving this niche group of players that tended to hack through out all of of the rs community and its different types of players. Talk with some returning old friends over the years of oldschool gave me the impression most of these players migrated to oldschool too.


I'm not really trying to disprove that these games dont have hacker groups(league kinda threw me off though, what are they hacking for exactly?) or major rule breakers, but that they arn't concentrated enough(probably due to most players knowing they arn't going to go unpunished) to be referred to as the community.

My overall rs career has led me to believe that the RS community is extremely cluttered with an excessive amount of hackers, scammers, botters, you name it. Whatever this community feels it can push and get away with, it will.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","It's fairly simple and quick, but takes practice to perfect it.  Here's the method off the top of my head: Cook the spaghetti.  While that cooks sauté the bacon in a pan that is large enough to hold all of the ingredients, then remove from heat. Mix eggs, cheeses, salt and pepper together in a separate bowl.

When the spaghetti is done, use tongs to put spaghetti into the pan of bacon and fat. [Save some pasta water.]  Quickly coat the spaghetti in the fat and bacon. Temper the egg mixture with some hot pasta water, then immediately add to the hot spaghetti. Mix fairly quickly so that the egg and cheese mixture fully cooks and coats evenly.  It should be very smooth and creamy and steaming hot. And I can't emphasize enough that everything must be done very quickly.    

I'm probably better at making it than explaining it.  Hopefully this helps though. 

Couple notes: The pan should not be too hot or you may get scrambled eggs - that's why you remove it from the heat the second your bacon is starting to crisp.  All of this is done very quickly to ensure the pasta is hot enough to cook the eggs.  Also, this is a dish that should be served immediately.  It's still good left over, but the pasta soaks up the creaminess over time. Lastly, many people suggest adding other ingredients like garlic, or herbs, etc., but imho it's much better without the extra complexity of flavors.","1427846558"

&gt; A Muhrim should not carry weapons with himself/herself even if they are cold weapons or firearms, but it is a precaution not to use defensive weapons like shield etc. **But in the cases of necessity, danger and fear from thieves, ferocious animals and enemies, using any necessary weapon is permitted.**

Furthermore, here is a verse from the Qur'an 4:101-102:

&gt; *And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer, [especially] if you fear that those who disbelieve may disrupt [or attack] you. Indeed, the disbelievers are ever to you a clear enemy.*

&gt; *And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let a group of them stand [in prayer] with you and let them carry their arms. And when they have prostrated, let them be [in position] behind you and have the other group come forward which has not [yet] prayed and let them pray with you, taking precaution and carrying their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so they could come down upon you in one [single] attack. But there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or are ill, for putting down your arms, but take precaution. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment.*

&gt; **Context of verse:** *""...They were experiencing some difficulties in offering their salat during the expeditions to some places where no water was available for performing their ablutions, etc. In such cases they were allowed to cleanse themselves with pure earth and to shorten the salat or to offer the ""Salat of Fear"", when they were faced with danger.*

But they are allowed to compete in something they love while getting a free education, most of their expenses paid, and a ton of other benefits (e.g. free tutors, equipment). And yet they need to be paid in addition to that? Not to mention...where is that money coming from? Who has all this leftover money? Don't answer, because the answer is NO ONE. No one does.

I wasn't a twig like some teenage girls, but I was by no means too fat for age-appropriate clothing as she claimed.  The assumption that flattering clothing is somehow ""not for me"" has followed me into adulthood: I was 25 before I bought my first pair of skinny jeans because I thought my legs were too short and fat to possibly look good in them. I lost a lot of weight when I went to college (about 10-15 lbs, all I had to lose) because I was terrified of living up to my mom's prediction that I would come back obese. It decreased the mockery a bit, at least. In hindsight, mocking me for gaining ""the freshman 50"" before I'd even left for school was really cruel.","1427846565"

also replacing a mount with a defensive teleport means that it becomes harder for him to join team fights during pushes, which can be a deal breaker.

I appreciate you trusting me with your rough draft and letting me in on your creative process. However, since this is an unfinished rough draft, I don't feel that my criticisms will be helpful at this point. Most of my thoughts on the draft right now pertain to typical first-draft stuff that you tend to iron out over time, so I don't think it's a good use of our energy for me to give you feedback on that. I think we'd both be better off if I sent you feedback after you have completed and edited your first draft. That way I am catching things you haven't already polished. I value our relationship and strive to make it as effective as possible. Let me know what you think.

In the meantime, I'm happy to talk shop or be a sounding board for ideas.""

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","In works of oral history, a certain amount of exaggeration and inexactitude are to be expected.  The frequency and amplitude of these errors depend greatly on the subject (e.g., heroic stories tend to compress time but expand danger/heroism).  In this case, the short oral ballad ""King Tut"" falls into the established category of farse or comedy in the traditional meaning.
   
Taking these issues into account, the best current academic consensus is that we can safely conclude that King Tutankhamun was born in or around an area that would seem to contemporary listeners (contemporary to the ballad, that is) to be like Arizona, and that he, at some point thereafter, moved to a region in the approximate vicinity of Babylonia.  I've done a good deal of personal research on this issue, and my current working theory, based on the lyrical structure of the song, the lyrics themselves, and a close study of the subject, is that King Tut was born in a housing development near Barstow, CA and spent most of his life living in what is modern-day Syria.","1427846567"

Other melee/close range characters such as WW barbs, zealers, etc with comparable price range equipment will probably beat you PVP more often than not.  
  

That all said, I would recommend enigma and FCR gear since dragon flight is slower and not as effective. 65FCR is a good middle ground since 42 and 102 are your other options. Max claw mastery, venom, fade, then after that there are a few options. Checkout ""Bui's Ghost Assassin"" for some more in depth details and ideas. It's the perfect WW assassin so don't get too caught up in it. Maxing Mind Blast wasn't a great idea IMO.  
  

This is a specialty character that takes some practice to master for sure. If you have a good bank or are just tired of making the same generic characters you should try it out for sure. I have a semi-built WW assassin if you want to check it out.","1427846568"

What do the studies show between non adopted children vs adopted to gay parents? It would be great if we all could have a loving mother and father, but reality is that isn't so. Many children are raised by single parents, and the studies I have seen show gay parents do better than single parents.

As for arena, it may be a decent way to earn gold but it takes way too much time. First, for it to be at least decent in terms of gold value, you'll need something like 5+ wins. That means at least 8 games for a single pack. To complete a 100 card set, you'll need anywhere between 110 and 230 packs. With two card sets, that's anything over 1900 games of arena. That's even assuming you'll get at least 5 wins per arena and decent packs.

Of course, for a ""competitive"" deck, you need significantly less but that's not the point. The point is that in Hearthstone, the ONLY way to get any currency is to win games, and 10 gold per 30 games is just so frustrating to grind for. ","1427846573"

Also, it's a matter of compliance costs. It's expensive, particularly in terms of time and effort, to deal with a new insurance company. If you're a doctor and you primarily deal with 3 or 4 insurers that cover the 90 percent of your patients, you probably don't want to learn the ropes of a new insurer just to get paid for the one or two patients who might come in with that insurer.

TL;DR: Yes, he'll still get paid. But it might not be much, and getting paid could be such a pain in the ass that it's just not worth it.","1427846575"

I have one category in my Short Term Goals group that gets renamed based upon the particular goal, e.g. New TV, 1K rounds of 5.56, 4 day bender in Vegas, etc. Every month I contribute to the goal until I reach the target. Once the target is reached, that money gets subtracted from the short term savings goal budget category and gets budgeted towards the actual category it is going to spent against, e.g. Other Entertainment for the TV, Hobbies for the ammo, and Vacation and Travel for the bender in Vegas. Then I track the purchases just like I would any other in the relevant category.

I swear, I take pride in being a geek, but the misfits, forty-year-old children, the maturity challenged, borderline sociopaths, and just the socially retarded just make me think that ""gamer"" is a tag that's going to take a few steps backwards in respect, after it has come such a long way from being something that just children do.

The gaming community needs more people, not less, people of all kinds, except for the toxic. If you are competitive, you should be able to hold your own against ALL comers, not just males. If you get beat, take it like an adult and admit it. If you win, win with dignity and humbleness.

edit: As an anecdote, my university has an eSports league. I attended one of their meetings and I decided it wasn't for me because they were going to watch tourneys and official games, which is not really my style, I prefer to play than to watch. Also they didn't really support Company of Heroes 2, which is my main game. Anyways, I went to one of the meetings and someone in the crowd just openly asks if they discourage or look down upon trolling or flaming, which they did, but it made me feel ashamed and embarrassed to be a gamer. Why would you just openly and blatantly ask that? I'd much rather lose with a supportive and friendly team than win with assholes and rejects of society.","1427846579"

Other than that we really have no idea if he even had a fruit. I personally like the idea of Roger climbing to the top without any Devil Fruit.

EDIT2 just shows that you don't even have to use the internet to get registered by Facebook.

Yes, Facebook is not the NSA (it's a valuable tool for them though). It's not necesseraly surveillance (I still think data miners are simply sexually attracted by information), but it's what surveillance is made of. And that's scary. And I know what you mean - website owners should be aware of the stuff they put on their page. Same goes for scripted ads. But that's not the point. You said we still can choose not to use the internet. But I want to. Under the conditions I stated. And it's not too much asked, because it's for the good.

Big Data can be good, but only if completely anonymised, and only used for stuff like medic research or something.

Big Data gotten from Data Mining without the permission and complete control by the person whose data is taken, is bad. Always. Profit doesn't justify this. If your company relies on data mining to make profit, then you should go do something else. It's a buisness model the world doesn't need. Do something valuable, I dunno, play an instrument or something. I mean, you don't necessarily have to serve the community, very few of us do, but at least try to keep your dignity. Don't mine data.

No, it is not. It's not up to you to judge that person in this place, once more you should NOT be focusing on the other person at all. You did it and you messed up, the fact you don't want to own it does not reflect poorly on the moderation, you were so clearly belittling your opponent that you can't even come up with a plausible situation otherwise.

&gt;Being sympathetic towards someone is not an attack on them.

A show of condescension will not make for an acceptable excuse, there's no plausible scenario at face value where this was construed as otherwise. Now you can claim foul all you want and even try to deconstruct the offence as a failed attempt to lessen the meaningfulness of context, but this is very clearly no misunderstanding and your excuses fall flat.

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","Actual worst was probably a friends copy of ""Tarot: Witch of the Black Rose."" It was the worst possible combination of demeaning (to the characters, the reader, and the medium) and pretentious.

Most annoying, I think, was Mark Millar's run on the Authority. So much I dislike about it, but the main thing is that he missed the point of the Authority. They lived in a world with consequences, and they never seemed to face any in his books. (That said, I haven't really run into a Millar comic I enjoyed, so it might just be that he and I are on a different wavelength.)

One that did the most damage to my enjoyment of comics: The first collected volume of Spawn. I avoided comics when I was a kid because I grew up during the grim and gritty era and found it really annoying. I had heard good things about Sandman and about Spawn. A friend had Spawn, so I borrowed it. I didn't look at comics for a few more years after that. (When I did, it was reading Sandman to impress my girlfriend, now my wife of 14 years. I should really send Neil Gaiman a card or something.)","1427846580"

Add to that of all the different AKs I have handled in sales it was the rifle with the least amount of issues (believe it or not it is Saigas which have the highest number of canted front sights).

For a first timer a WASR-10 is the best option hands down unless something further is wanted that is specialized (russian style triangle or folding stock, milled receiver, higher end wood, different caliber such as 5.45 or 5.56).","1427846581"

There are cops that I feel might be *dodgy.* I've never seen them do anything wrong and if I did I would act on it. My feeling is entirely on the basis of how I percieve their attitude.

The more people there are who will buy something, the less you can afford to charge for it and still make a profit. Since not everyone who buys the game will buy the DLC, it's going to be relatively more expensive than the game itself.

That being said, value is subjective. If you don't believe that 4 characters and 15 costumes are worth $30, you're entitled to that opinion, and you don't have to buy it.

By the way, you can actually get the Kombat Pack for $20 if you buy the $80 bundle that comes with the game and the Kombat Pack. I don't know if you can still buy that physically, but you can still get it digitally.","1427846586"

One time I took the car seat on the plane when I only had one child and it was a pain in the ass. Getting through the airport was a pain, getting it in the seat was a pain and then my son was not used to me sitting next to him when he was normally in the car seat so he kept wanting to get out the whole time. He landed up sitting on my lap almost the entire flight because there was no place to put the car seat if he isn't going to sit in it.  Neither of my kids love their car seats so I should have known he would not suddenly love it on a plane.  We do make sure they are buckled at all times in their seats.

Companies mostly care about profits. True, it has always been like this and in the past was much worse.

Companies follow no moral code in order to achieve their goals. True, it has always been like this and was much worse in the past.

This part you got it, the part you are missing is that you, me and everyone else, as a voter, a customer and an employee has all interest in spreading the word and make pressure every time you consider things are getting dubious. That's also part of the system, it's that part that made the things that were much worse in the past get better to present day.

It's the  apathy, so common this days, that  ""meh it's their job to make money so let them"" that's  not helping.

If people in the past acted the same way we would still be working 12 hours a day to receive a paycheck that was just barely enough to feed, depending on a family of 5 or more workers all starting their jobs at the age of 10 to get just enough money to be poor and working in terrible conditions.","1427846587"

So they weren't really taken seriously and had something of an obnoxious fanbase. I remember some internet discussions around the time *Advance and Vanquish* came out with metalheads who thought that 3IoB was a joke band and was making fun of metal rather than actually honoring the classics.

In the 2nd half Switzerland continued their impotence towards creating chances. After Altidore's send off Switzerland took full control of the game and could or even should have scored 3-4 goals.

it's funny because i pmoed 5 days ago, and since almost the same time i'm in a relationship and i'm doing the exact opposite of you, i kiss her everytime and make out a lot, we didn't have sex because she has a cast which is annoying in bed. ( Which gives me more time )

The only thing i'm affraid of is having PIED with her, i had this before it's literally the worst feeling i've experienced.

But kissing, making out, even foreplays are the way to rewire with your sexuality.

Everything right now is a combination of hearsay and extrapolation from other psychedelic research. Most of it's based on Fadiman's work, which begrudgingly lacks rigor and amounts to a collection of anecdotes with the odd mention of some relatively related and for the most part unreplicated pilot studies. I would be dishonest not to admit that I'm being a tad cynical about dear Fadiman here, but there really is a lack of research--and he'd definitely align with me on that.","1427846589"

Deuxièmement, je ne crois pas que le privé laisse occupé des terrains vacants sans rien dire, il y a quand même la notion de responsabilité du propriétaire dans tout ça.

Troisièmement, si une Ville voudrait développer ses terrains vacants, on impose un taux de taxe beaucoup plus élevé qu'un terrain non vacant pour l'obliger a développer.

"dailyprogrammer","t5_2tj45","J makes a lot of good design decisions.  It can be a challenge to read your own code, and so you need to largely make your own software engineering practices for large projects.  Some design examples:

      double =: +:
      double 1 2 3
      +: 1 2 3
2 4 6   NB. beats syntax such as map(double (1,2,3))

The symbols tend to be preferable for writing.  You would normally prefer + to 'plus' in code.  Haskell has a lot of ""weird"" operators that are weird mostly because its complex to understand what they do rather than what word you might replace the operator with.

J has relatively few simple parsing rules with no operator precedence (other than verb, adverb conjunction).

Rank is indeed a key concept.  It makes it possible to match array sizes/shapes as arguments

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","Will humanity leave behind religion? I'm thinking that it probably won't, at least not on any time table short enough for me to make meaningful predictions.

I think that a lot of people are financially or socially reliant on their religions. Hearing the case for skepticism isn't going to help because they have bigger problems to deal with. A person who is working hard every day just to keep their family alive isn't thinking ""I better work on becoming more skeptical about my religion."" A person who is just trying to get through the week without relapsing into substance abuse isn't going to think ""The biggest problem in my life is that I am not doing enough critical thinking about the claims of my religion."" In short, while religion causes a lot of problems, it also solves or prevents even bigger problems in some contexts. These circumstances will need to change before the religion is even worth addressing. 

I think religion in more sparsely populated areas will start to resemble religion in larger population centers. Small town religion differs from big city religion in that the small town people are rarely forced to coexist with people who think very differently from them. As we become more interconnected, people in small towns will begin to come into contact with people from other areas more often. I believe that this mixing of people will have a pacifying effect on rural religions. Metropolitan values will become the norm, even outside of big cities. This won't eliminate religion or magically make everyone more liberal, but it will mean that a vast majority of people will no longer grow up without being exposed to ideas outside of their community's religion.

Will skepticism continue to rise? I think so, although I don't think the rise of skepticism will mean an end to religion. The panacea that will cure the affliction of bad ideas is access to good ideas. Simply by virtue of being right, skepticism will spread wherever it cannot be censored effectively. In a world where everyone has the Internet in their pockets, decentralization of media has irreparably hindered religious institutions' ability to engage in censorship. Of course, skepticism does not mean an end to religion. Plenty of people who are generally pretty skeptical still harbor some religious views. After all, skepticism is a method of thinking, not a set of conclusions. Skepticism may eventually lead to atheism, but that's a big ""eventually.""

To sum my view up, I think that skepticism will increase as access to outside information becomes more common. Rising levels of skepticism will reduce the influence that religion has. This will not lead to the elimination of religion, due to the fact that not everyone will become skeptical and not every skeptical person will automatically drop their religion.","1427846594"

Added Relics. New unique, soulbound items with really powerful effects. There's currently 6 of them along with 2 extras.
Added the ability to enter the Alfheim dimension through the portal if you have a specific item...
Added fluid mana that you can store in railcraft, buildcraft, and so on, tanks. The conversion rate isn't 1:1 if you do it both ways.
Added multiblock mana pools, 3x3, 5x5 and even 7x7. They store way more than normal ones, as expected.
Added radius viewer functionality to the Manaseer Monocle. While looking at a flower with it equipped one will be able to see the flower's effective range visually.
Added the Black Hole Talisman. It's the unlimited cobblestone works. Wait, that's from thaumic tinkerer. STOP STEALING CODE FROM YOURSELF VAZKII YOU SCUMLORD
Added the Resolute Ivy, an Ivy item similar to the Timeless Ivy that lets you keep the item it's attached to through death.
Added the Reverse Mana Fluxfield that transforms RF to mana. Again, the conversion rate isn't too generous so get your big reactors dusted.
Added the Spriggan Mana Tablet, an upgrade to the normal Mana Tablet using Dragonstones that holds 10x as much.
Botania tile entities no longer register non-prefixed names (eg, ""pump"" rather than ""botania:pump""). This fixes incompatibilities with mods that have similar names. Since both names were registered previously, transition will work with no problems.
Changed the Gaia Guardian to be able to be killed by fake players after I got spammed with requests for it.
Edited the Thaumcraft Integration page to tell the user that the Botanurgist's Inkwell needs to be charged when created.
Entries that come from botania addons will not have the ""View Online"" button.
Fixed Ancient Wills rendering on a Terrasteel Helmet that has Phantom Ink.
Fixed double flowers being able to be duplicated through bone meal.
Fixed glimmering flowers being able to be bonemealed to create double flowers.
Fixed the Hyacidus, Pollidisiac, Tigerseye, Narslimmus and Medumone having their range be lower in one side.
Fixed the Phantom Ink recipe working if more than one piece of armor is put in the grid.
Floral Powder can now dye sheep.
Moved the Life Aggregator to the Ender Artifacts section and made it require two Bottles of Ender Air.
Redid all the flowers, spreaders and pool HUDs. They now show exactly (in numbers) how much mana the blocks have, are producing and are receiving.
Removed the cooldown on Thermalilies and returned their production rate to the original speed they were at before.
The Mana Pump will not stop outputting a comparator signal once it stops pumping as long as it has a cart on the rail.
[API] Added IManaFluidContainer and IRFManaAcceptor for compatibility.
[API] Added IRelic, IWireframeCoordinateListProvider, ISequentialBreaker.
[API] Added RELIC EnumRarity.

"Sissies","t5_2t2rd","I'm not really a sissy - I'm a cd with occasional sexual fantasies of sex with men. I find this sub is better than gonewildcd for discussions, which is why I lurk here.

When I roleplay online I usually take, and prefer the submissive role (although dominant can be fun), but the moment someone gives me orders I tend to get a bit indignant. I like taking the submissive role, but part of the turn on for me is that I've *chosen* to do it.

I'm also mainly turned on by feeling like a woman, so I'm not interested in any kind of ""master/daddy"" or slave stuff, because it doesn't match my idea of what feels ""female."" (Daddy also freaks me out because the last thing I want to think about is my dad!) I don't see women acting like that in real life, and I certainly don't see femininity as inferior to masculinity, so I don't really associate humiliation with feminization. 

So to answer your question directly, I don't want to be ""loved"" as in a relationship (it's purely sexual), but I do want to be treated like an adult woman. However, I'm not really a sissy  - I take the submissive role, but within the boundaries of fairly vanilla sexual activities (as much as sex can be vanilla when one of the participants is a man dressed as a slut). I'm indifferent to humiliation, but certainly don't see what's humiliating about dressing as a woman, and I do not like being told what to do by strangers. ","1427846597"

That fear got me through the early days, and keeps me motivated to stay sober. It makes my top 5 list of motivators.

You'll find a wealth of urge fighting tips among the community here. 

Things that helped for me were:

* routine - having things to do got me through a lot of time.
* sparking water (stocked up). Could drink that like a fish, an easy substitute to make. Plus teas (green in the morning, herbal later).
* A list of my motivations. I memorised the most important ones for quick reference.
* rest, early nights (not that I was sleeping so well early on), minimising stressful situations and triggers.
* distractions - a book, a film, netflix, gaming, a walk with my spouse. Just doing anything else.
* Breakfast set me for a good start to the day (porridge/weetabix + green tea). A light lunch, and a healthy dinner, with dark chocolate as a treat. Nourishment is good, comfort foods are ok, I know a lot of folk get cravings e.g. for sweet stuff and that's fine. 

I found CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) useful to work through. Some mind support is good, it can come in different forms.

One backseat motivator for me was a desire to quit *once*. I'd heard of kindling, and how withdrawals can get worse with repeated attempts - I don't want to go there. I'm aware that relapsing could make my resolve difficult to reestablish, cross the line once could weaken my resolve - I know it's not necessarily the case, I just don't want to go there. I also felt it was my time, my eyes were more open than they had been in a long time. 

I know a lot of folk draw strength from ""I won't drink today."" For me, future goalposts helped (as review points). My goalposts progressed 30 days, 90 days, New years, February. By January, I was ready to fully commit to life-long sobriety. ","1427846598"

Stress can also shorten your life and cause health problems.

Unless someone is harming another, leave it alone and mind your own business.  ","1427846598"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Will probably get buried, but I did this recently to a co-worker, drove him absolutely insane and took the assistant IT guy awhile to sort it out.

First thing I did was inverted both of his displays so they were upside down and switched left to right-- minor annoyance, but for someone who's not particularly tech-savy this would be pretty irritating. Next I simply set the mouse pointer to always look busy. (so it made it look like his PC was constantly hanging, and made it rather hard to click things)

However the coup de grâce was using windows 'task scheduler.' I set up 2 different tasks that repeated indefinitely. One that would open a random webpage every 5 minutes and another one that would pop up with a window saying some nonsense technical jargon every 10 minutes but included his name-- so something like ""John Doe PIPELINES MET CRITERIA NOT FOUND."" I did this in the evening after he left work and delayed the tasks to go off around mid-morning when he got in. (so he didn't come in with a bunch of windows/webpages)

Only took him a minute to fix his display resolution, but he went about 3 days without saying anything to the IT director. (the IT guy is your stereotypical 'oh what's wrong now? type'-- he avoided telling him until he absolutely couldn't take it anymore)

The first night he made the mistake of just *locking* his computer--when he came in their were somewhere over 150 webpages open and a similar amount of nonsense message windows. He spent the first hour of that morning trying to close everything only to have 1 more window pop up after 5 minutes, and then a random message pop up every 10 minutes.

When he finally told the IT director, his assistant (who doesn't know much about computers--more of the warehouse guy) spent the better part of an entire workday running virus scans, etc only to come up with nothing. He *finally* figured out that it was just *settings*, nothing related to a virus and changed the pointer back and deleted the scheduled tasks. To this day I haven't told anyone at work. (in fact on the 3rd day when the IT guy started working on it, the employee actually has me to thank for a half-day; since it was taking him so long to 'fix' the guy was able to go home a lot earlier-- I don't dare tell anyone now as I effectively wasted two people's entire day lol) Whenever I talk to that particular employee sometimes those few days he was going insane come to mind and crack me up.","1427846601"

I love writing code, but I'm pretty tired of the politics - including the bros who get offended by my attempts to get more women into STEM, and the women who think I'm an idiot for thinking it's more than just a pipeline+""lean in"" problem.

Best bet is to wait,  keep your money out of the bank, and act poor.  Shield assets,  401k and other retirement accounts are immune to judgement.  Allstate don't know you plan on going into medicine,  don't let em know that.  Act poor,  if you get a reasonable offer,  pay.  If not, and they want tens of thousands,  bankruptcy is good.  Threaten em with that if they are unreasonable,  and they will capitulate. Understand what assets are immune to being touched in bankruptcy, what it will cost in the end, and make sure you take advantage of all of them to shield yourself.

We show up early (as soon as the gates open if we can) and set up our chairs then go walk to get something to eat.  Haven't had anyone mess with our stuff yet.  It's always a fantastic time. Some people even bring couches!  I remember one game (vs Montreal I think) where Kunitz had a shot at a wide open net but completely missed the puck. EVERYBODY went nuts and thought it was in, jumping up and down, until we realized the puck was on the other end of the ice.

My only complaint is when people show up late (6 or even 7 for a 7pm game) and decide to set their chairs in that small gap in front of you that you were leaving for your feet.  That hasn't happened often, you just have to make sure you don't leave too much space that someone else thinks they can squeeze in.

But that's true of all New Yorkers, honestly. I also felt like they were...I don't know how to put it succinctly, a little easier to deal with? Slightly more well rounded human beings?

I noted with someone else in here for instance, I had a higher proportion of dating experiences in NYC where I didn't feel like the girl was blatantly just angling for free food/drinks. Sure, NYC dating is notorious for involving going through a revolving door of people, but I felt like more of my dates at least resulted genuine mutual enjoyment (even if that just meant having sex on the first date and not seeing each other again, although I actually also got more second dates in NYC than I did here).","1427846611"

It helps that you've only taken 2 Aerospace classes like I did so at most you'll only gain a semester from switching, which is normally the biggest deterrent to switching majors. If you don't know much about Civil Engineering and are choosing it just to switch from Aerospace then I suggest you do research and get to know what you would do as a Civil Engineer and how the program at Tech works. The Civil advisers are extremely helpful and friendly (Don't remember if Rob or Mary are still there but their replacements are probably just as good). Go to them with any questions you have about the program. It might help to talk to your Aerospace adviser too, although from my experience they will mostly tell you to get out and stop wasting their time if you have doubts.

All in all, the switch is big but not as daunting as it seems. If you have any more questions feel free to PM me.","1427846614"

I'll clarify a little
Say your home network is 192.168.0.0/24, your WAN router is .1
On your cisco LAB router, interface fa 0/0 faces your home network, assign the IP 192.168.0.254/24 to this interface, fa 0/1 faces your lab, assign this say 10.0.0.254/24

On your WAN router add a static route for 10.0.0.0 with subnet mask 255.0.0.0 with your next hop as 192.168.0.254.

That's pretty common knowledge, since pretty much every dev team previously has said that they couldn't release this version or that until they tested on devices which they didn't have. I remember the iOS 6 jailbreak being delayed for that reason. So 100k, minus the several thousand for all the devices they have to buy, divided by 4 or 5 people, and we're going to hate on these people because they may have made $10-15,000 each for something they provide for free, and that we'd all be incredibly unhappy without?

NO. But I have seen them change tactics. 

&gt;Or is it far more likely that he is bullshitting me and has something more insidious up his sleeve?

DING DING DING DING DING!!!!!

I'll be honest, my ex did the 180 all the time when his current crazy making didn't work out. He would magically get reasonable to try and pull me back in. When it finally wouldn't work anymore, that is when it got REALLY BAD. I'm talking stalker dangerous bad. 

The rabid dog stopped growling. That doesn't mean you should pet it. If you are worried it would turn violent, you are worried most likely because of a valid reason. I'm concerned he is trying to get the kids alone, and is using his mother as the ploy. It would be extremely easy to get alone with them with her around. She is *his* mother. I'm sure she is convinced he would never harm his children, and as such, is more than willing to let him do whatever and go wherever. Because ""he is their father!!"". The family excuse is rampant and widespread.

My personal view is that to take the author into account when evaluating a book is a disrespect to the book itself.

Frankly, for myself, those two things make me less likely to buy a book from her; a reason why I personally try to avoid a dialogue with an author. When I hear whining like this it makes me lose respect for the author and so affects my perception of her books without even having read them.

I honestly don't understand the point of this post though. Authors are people too? Who cares? It's her choice to be social to sell books. It would be nice if everyone was nice to her, but that's not the world we live in. How is her experience more valid than anyone else's?

Also you crossed a line with screwing your daughter,  and it probably no longer exists for you or her. What is to stop your daughter from having a baby with her kid? Or what is to stop you from doing it with her kid if it is a girl? Respect? You can't have respect for that line if you didn't have respect for the first one.

It is a bad idea, if you are actually fucking your daughter to have a kid. Your wife is insanely cool for not destroying your life already for fucking your daughter though I obviously don't know the circumstances, it would be insane to ask her to put up with you having a child with another woman, even if it is still all in the family.

Are you supposed to all live together forever? Are you expected to split your fatherly time between them? Care to explain to the child that you are their father and grandfather?

Also this part might not make sense but I think it is insanely narcissistic to have a child with your kid. Your kid is already half you, that kid will be 75% you. How close to fucking yourself do you want to get?

* How did Pete get Michonne's sword? I first guessed that maybe Michonne had put him up in her house for the time being, but that seemed unlikely. In any case, Michonne had better keep it with her since bad things happen when she leaves it on the shelf (bad pun intended).
* The Father Gabriel thread seemed a little too unrealistic. I totally get his urge for suicide-by-zombie or the later suicide-by-Sasha, but leaving the front gate open, which could have potentially killed everyone? All that after telling Deanna that Alexandria is a special place and to kick out Rick &amp; Co.? So, is he a traitor, a madman, or a sociopath? Thank God the acting is good, because that character makes no sense right now.
* Poor Reg. I guess they never aired Season 4 in Alexandria.
* Morgan is dope, but I could do without the kung fu. I would understand it if he were a new character, but it just seems unplausible that he'd learn martial arts *along the way*. He went from being a scared dad holed up in a house, to a gun wielding, motorcycle helmeted badass clearing blocks of zombies, to now being a Shaolin Monk, complete with bo staff? Did he enter the 36 Chambers or something? 
* I dug the whole night-time forum thing led by Deanna to discuss Rick's fate. I love how they juxtaposed their naivete with Rick, getting his hands dirty to keep them safe and Glenn, fighting for his life against an Alexandrian. Rick's message was clear: **Look, we want civilization just like you guys do. But you guys have no clue what it will really take to get there.** 
* Steven Yeun's acting. ""You're trying to kill ME?!?!"" I'm surprised Nicholas didn't start weeping right then and there.
* Aaron and Daryl. When he lights up that cigarette and tells Aaron to make a run for it...wow. The acting was perfect - I was really sold on the gravity of the situation and how much Daryl was willing to do to protect people he considers family (before Captain Morgan came and saved the day). Powerful scene.
*  I didn't buy the whole Food Truck trap. It just seemed like a lot of work to occasionally capture 1 or 2 people. Were they trying to accumulate zombies or something? Obviously, they are psychopaths, and maybe this will come into play next season...
* Great episode, great finale. Proved to me that the writers didn't need to incorporate a character death to give it a punch to cap the season and leave us excited for Season 6. ","1427846621"

The question of do you want AD is far and away the easiest question of the offseason. Of course we do. However it's another question entirely with his current contract. If we can work a deal where he's willing to take a pay cut then you have to pull this trigger. Imagine some of the 25+ yard runs Murray had last year taken to the house with AD carrying the rock. He's the exception to the rule and if we can find a way to make it work then the FO needs to pull the trigger. We're in win now mode. ","1427846622"

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","I don't know if the build would work for you, but since she's a fairy she *needs* to use dex for her attacks.  The first few levels are spent getting fencing grace and weapon focus.  Since she's a swashbuckler, at level 5 she gets the bonus of Improved Critical whenever she uses a one-handed piercing weapon (rapier), which ups my crit range to 15-20.  Since her damage isn't all that great the crit wouldn't do me good, but I have a feat called [Butterfly's Sting](http://www.archivesofnethys.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Butterfly%27s%20Sting).  Basically, if I confirm a crit I can forgo the crit damage and give it to the next ally to hit that target with a melee hit.  Not only do I still deal damage (albeit regular damage), but their next melee attack *is automatically confirmed a crit*.  All they have to do is *hit* them and they get a free crit.  A barbarian that totes around a 4x crit weapon is the best partner for her.   It needs you to worship Desna but it fits the character- both her and her mother believe fairies that succeed in life become stars in the sky, so it makes sense they'd worship a god of the night sky.  


Hm...looking at it again, it doesn't say anything about having to use a melee weapon to activate the sting, it just needs to be a crit....well, if you have a character who has high crit rate but not all that great crit *damage* you could use this.

"mypartneristrans","t5_2t187","I'm sorry to hear that has been your experience. I definitely think things could improve for you two, but it may take him accepting that he may need help. Now I'm not in his head and don't know him personally, but it seems like there is more going on here than him being demisexual/ mostly asexual/ graysexual. I personally find the part about it can be hard to even hold hands as possibly a sign of unresolved trauma. From my experience with asexual people, a lot of them have romantic attractions and still engage in some form of intimacy. They just don't have sexual attraction/desire. Intimacy and sex are not the same thing. I have dated an asexual woman before, but we still had physical intimacy, just not sex. Things like cuddling, messages, holding hands, dancing together, and we even got into a kink (she got no sexual enjoyment out of it, but she found it enjoyable for I guess entertainment purposes)

Therapy really can help. Not only can I understand both sides of your situation, but I have witnessed a very similar situation with my best friends (a hetero cis couple). There relationship was great, other than intimacy issues, and my male friend never wanting sex. The female, like you, was hurt by the constant rejection and told him he would have to initiate from then on. He never did. The lack of physical intimacy eventually had her ready to end things right then and there, despite her love for him. This caused him to agree to see a therapist, which helped him to finally address his issues, and bring regular intimacy and sex into the relationship. They are still happy and in love several years later. So it is possible, but it can take work, like any intimate relationship.  

Lastly, I want to say that I genuinely hope things work out for you two but if you eventually end up needing to break things off because you need intimacy in your relationship, you should not feel bad or guilty. We are biologically set up to seek out intimacy. This post is already getting too long so I won't get into it, but if you have time you may be interested in looking at the biological effects of intimacy, which will help to explain why it is both mentally and physically so important for the majority of people. I would also recommend looking up oxytocin, which is a hormone released during physical intimate contact (and during times of high stress).","1427846625"

I think there is a difference between a ""good"" solo-queu player(think:azingy) who definitely does not have a high rate of professional success, and someone like incarnation who's solo-queu sucess is more closely related to a group of people who really have all gone on to be very good pros. Incarnation isn't some player who is regularly top 20--he's someone who is regularly #1, and 2, and 3, ect. Only WT, Faker, Apdo(the anomoly), deft, weixioa and others in the elite class can really make that claim.","1427846627"

Playing video games isn't like any other hobby. It won't make you an interesting person in social situations. It's not an interesting topic for most people, no one will be impressed with your video game achievements. It's like saying watching TV is a hobby.

Fighting a protracted war with the Krogan would have been a disaster, their rate of reproduction and hearty physiology gave them too many advantages.

I could, though, see a couple of reasons for “wanting” it for myself (this wouldn’t apply to a partner who said they are completely and permanently uninterested in sex so maybe this is not at all relevant in any way), at least theoretically:  
- I plan on getting better. I *know* that someday, hopefully in the not too distant future, I *will* be better. My libido will be restored, and things will go back to normal. I used to be quite sexually adventurous, and definitely into multiple partners. When I get better, I might be into that sort of thing again. If I finally really want to fuck a lot again, I want to be able to fuck anything I want! LOL    
-  If my relationship had gotten to the point where my spouse seriously wanted an open relationship so he could go out and solve his sexual problems and the emotional problems attached thereto with other people, I think I would want the same opportunity. I don’t think it is him. But, I want to get better. And if we weren’t trying to get better together, I too would want the opportunity to get better with other people.

I guess bad being suffering in this case.

And to learn that certain things cause suffering for others, I suppose you'd have to try and see it from their perspective, to put yourself in their shoes in order to evoke that empathetic emotion in us (mirror neurons?).

-----
For me, I learnt it from the arts - stories - from tv shows, cartoons, dramas, films, books. 

I think cartoons in particular had a big influence, like you'd see a kid being picked on for their appearance in ""hey arnold"", and you can see how it makes that character sad/suffer. 

This is good too I guess as it's not too direct like an experiment in class, like that blue eyes vs brown eyes one which may cause controversy. So to me, it seems stories &amp; broadcasting is to be cherished.","1427846637"

 [**Angle of repose**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle%20of%20repose): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The __angle of repose__ or the __critical angle of repose__,  of a [granular material](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_material) is the steepest angle of descent or [dip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_and_dip) relative to the horizontal plane to which a material can be piled without slumping. At this angle, the material on the slope face is on the verge of sliding. The angle of repose can range from 0° to 90°. Smooth, rounded sand grains cannot be piled as steeply as can rough, interlocking sands. If a small amount of water is able to bridge the gaps between particles, electrostatic attraction of the water to mineral surfaces will increase [soil strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bearing_capacity).

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I can see Troll Warlord doing well because he has great versatility with his Melee range Swiching mechanic, like Jayce does, and has a very long ranged slow and a global ult. But in general, the people in Dota who auto attack are VERY reliant on auto attacking for roughly 99% of their damage. And to do so they need vast quantities of items, because they very rarely have the kit to do anything without them. They actually very rarely have any nukes or damaging abilities at all.

Sniper could possibly do well lategame with a BotRK and a few Zeal items (that Headshot would make it very difficult to launch a frontal assault on him if he gets attack speed) however his range means that he'd probably outrange everyone on his own team, leaving himself completely isolated to being tunneled on by a Rek'Sai.

Shadowfiend does a button of damage per hit with his Necromastery, but it'd be difficult to stack without denying in place, and without shadowblade then his ult would be almost impossible to land.

I'm not seeing Juggernaut doing very well, pretty much everything he can do Master Yi can already do three times as well as.

-----

The Dota carries who could probably hold their own in LoL would probably be some of the weaker ones in Dota. Medusa immediately springs to mind because she actually has a nuke which restores her mana too to make her laning easier. Gyrocopter has a lot of utility with that stun and teamfight ult. And Weaver would actually be the one OP one possible.","1427846638"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I always get downvoted for saying this, but the draft is usually a wild guessing game, and aside from the rare top two or three picks, the draft order almost always looks comical in a few years time.  I can't think of a single year in history when at least 75% of the draft didn't look like ridiculously bad choices within a few years.  

The best guys in the draft are usually picked 2 through 5, and superstar hall of fame players are often drafted in the middle to end of the first round.

Anyone who tells you they really know which players will become great NBA players, is lying.

If you ever want to see how silly the draft actually is, look at a few articles from the draft from a few years ago.

You'll see long articles about how great and wonderful this player is, and how he has the potential to be a franchise player, etc., and the player in question is Michael Kidd Gilchrest.  Or you look at the ""ceiling"" for each player, and one guy's ceiling is listed as being ""the next Tim Duncan"", and the player is Jordan Hill.

With the rare exceptions of guys like Lebron, the truth is, no one has any idea how any of these players will turn out.

I think the idea is that the giant laser becomes irrelevant if the wheelchair already disqualified him on account of a pre-existing condition.

Whether you agree with the author or want to lend his/her list credence is your choice, I just think its a bit ignorant for some of the other commentators in the thread to say things like ""I stopped reading when he said Inca isn't tier 1"", and ""Venice is god tier cause you can cheese a diplo under specific circumstances"".

This is why I really don't get these protestors. The RFRA doesn't just let businesses discriminate freely. All it does is allow the above shepherd test as a legal defense. The test clearly wasnt designed for court proceedings where the government isn't party to (like discrimination suits). This could make things VERY ugly for religious business owners who want to not serve gay folk depending on how the interpretation goes. In any event it will require some dumbass Christian to go on the stand, under oath, and rationalize his religious beliefs into why he couldn't serve kyle and Steve because if they did it would have utterly devastated them.

This is also gradually becoming the case in Indonesia.

2. The Chinese influence. The race quotas on university entrance in state run universities in Malaysia mean that the only practical option for many Chinese in Malaysia is an overseas education, not to mention the social preference. Any ethnic Malays who make it are generally quite well-off, or on scholarships. The majority of overseas students from Malaysia (and a lesser extent Indonesia) tend to be ethnic Chinese.

Back in the day, the British encouraged talented people to study in the UK. Indonesia didn't have the same relationship with the Dutch, but a Dutch education was a marker of wealth for a long time.","1427846653"

The fact that you dismiss any instance... of any consideration to other ideas contrary to what your mind is interesting... Reference the SR story from today for interesting twists to realities.  It's not rational to dismiss that the western world at least is moving towards digital payments and something as this would provide it's end users as well as the government multiple benefits.  You do take a radical stance on suggesting that the government maliciously released a digital currency solely for the fact of spying.  Never once did I say I think this is what has happened, but that the thought crossed my mind.   Releasing an anonymous project as a means of gauging global response, and short term outcomes of a  brand new digital payment system and technology as a whole doesn't sound completely illogical.

I was totally oblivious for months that either were gay, infact I only found out the manager was gay when I went to report to him that the 2IC was a ""queer"".

Prior to my discovery it was pretty common to go out for Friday drinks at a near by bar, talk shit about sports, cars etc.

I'm ashamed to admit it took me a while to see them both as people again, but they were both pretty cool guys, everyone else in our workforce had accepted them, and I was the odd one out for not wanting to associate with them outside of work.

"Astronomy","t5_2qhor","Sorry that some people are being rude to you - I'm not sure why they think it's so obvious, or why it's ok to be condescending about it.

A lunar eclipse, as others have said, occurs when the earth is between the moon and the sun, so the earth blocks the sunlight that would normally be illuminating the moon.  When it occurs, it looks like a dark red shadow moving across the face of the moon. That part is pretty straightforward.

The confusing part for a lot of people is wondering, “Then why doesn’t this happen every month, when the moon passes behind the earth in its orbit? If the moon is in earth’s shadow when it’s opposite the sun, how can we see the full moon?”

The answer is because the orbit of the moon is inclined relative to the Earth and sun (by about 5 degrees).  During a normal full moon, the moon is behind the earth, but either a little bit 'above' or 'below' the tip of the earth’s shadow, so none of the sunlight is blocked.  We only see a lunar eclipse when the full moon happens while the moon is crossing from ‘above’ the earth’s shadow to ‘below’ it.

"pharmacy","t5_2qjl3","I have a good deal of experience from both sides of this issue if anyone would like an insight on the current situation. I've worked in harm reduction and as a medical research scientist, on top of struggling with addiction for a period of time.

One thing I would ask of pharmacists is to pay a little attention to large ct bottles of loperamide, since it is used by addicts to manage withdrawal symptoms. I don't think you should limit access in any way, since its one of the few available therapeutics to partially relieve the agony of opiate withdrawal and can make or break a persons recovery BUT most of these people will be taking loperamide in massive doses, potentially in combination with p-gp inhibitors.

Loperamide's lack of CNS activity is mediated by effective p-gp efflux (as i'm sure most of you are aware). Given the prevalence of meds with varying degrees of p-gp inhibition (even *substrates* for p-gp can be problematic at high doses of loperamide), its quite possible that a person attempting to get clean will take enough to overload their p-gp efflux capacity and overdose. 

I would ask that anyone looking like they're in withdrawal, purchasing loperamide in qty, be asked if they're taking any other medications that might inhibit p-gp and issue specific warning to anyone buying tagamet and loperamide together about their potential interaction.

The main principle behind UKIP is to regain the sovereignty of the UK, similar to euroscepts all together. Joining an economic bloc allows for some aspects of sovereignty to disappear but not alot or all. Based off my observations, EU member states are quickly losing any aspect of independence. The whole EU national anthem, the EU Army proposals seem just downright insane. It does generally show that the EU is not about economic cooperation but about the projection of European power previously lost after colonial times and WW2.

Most drivers then carefully follow the orders of heavily armed federal officers and turn around without getting into more trouble. In this case, authorities say the men ignored instructions on how to leave, and ended up stuck behind barriers. Police ordered them to stop, and then things escalated quickly.

Why not put the 'shoot to kill zone' behind a second set of gates say 100 feet past the first set?  It seems dumb to let all lost and confused drivers   enter a 'shoot to kill zone'.","1427846660"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I think this depends on what your definition of ""dead"" is. When I think of dead, I think of games that have almost no crowd whatsoever. There's still a community in the RTS genre, but it's very tight niche now compared to what it used to be. When I think of dead, I think of games that have almost no crowd whatsoever. There's also plenty of people perhaps like you and I, that used to adore the RTS genre. I wouldn't certainly be against it if a new big RTS title came and knocked me off my feet, but as of now I have no obligation towards the RTS genre until it gives me reason to come back.

Again, Kickstarter projects are a bad example. I loved Kickstarter, backed several video games and indie devs, but now companies are using it to profit before games even come out. It has taken the challenge away of making a legitimately good product, in order to gain money &amp; with money already made they could make a steaming pile of crap, but still profit in the end. I'm not saying that's always the case, but you can definitely find plenty of instances of scams and devs that have all the money they need to make it, but just want more. Which, as an early adopter of the whole 'crowd-funding' gig, has really disgusted me and pretty much made me almost turn away completely from it aside for those few diamon in the rough projects.  

Forsaken Fortress can attest to this, it made a superb flashy 'demo' trailer &amp; made over 100 grand. The game was complete trash. They admitted that their ambitions were ""too high"", trashed everything that sold people on the trailer/demos &amp; gave the backers a watered-down, glitchy, un-inspiring game. Thankfully, I didn't back this, but a friend had given me the game just to show me how bad it was and it was terrible. Planetary Annihilation as well; That game was just completely average, but they hyped it up to the point where people were throwing money at them non-stop, so even if they didn't make a great game they had peoples' money anyway. 

Crowd-funding has almost become like pre-ordering a product, but they just give us more incentives and make us feel 'apart' of something by helping devs fund their game. I love the idea, but just like any good idea, it can be perverted to work differently from what it was meant to be.","1427846660"

Really? Chuck did a lot of backstabbing, a lot of bad things, but:

1. He bailed Jimmy out in Chicago (and probably more often than that)
2. He got Jimmy a job at the firm
3. He let Jimmy use his house to store stuff and do work
4. He negotiated a juicy deal for Jimmy for the class action
5. He encouraged Jimmy to go out on his own
6. He worked on the wills and on the shredded documents
7. He cares about the client above all else

I'd not say ""bad"" but ""mixed."" Look at people in the BrBa universe and tell me Chuck is worse than most (or even many) of them. Hank would have *killed* Walter; he was hunting him for years and we think of Hank as good. Walter was ABSOLUTELY a bad person but we loved him as viewers. Hank and Chuck are two characters in the BrBa universe with principles, and who don't break the law. (You could argue several criminals on BrBa have principles, within the context of their world of crime.) 

Jimmy ( and I love him dearly) was a thief and con-man and turns into a criminal murderer (by association).

I actually don't see Chuck as undermining Jimmy. Jimmy was NEVER going to get a job at HHM (as OP notes) at least not in a realistic, real-world HHM. Chuck helped him with the case and arranged for a lucrative payout. Yes, Chuck did backhanded things, but he did what he thought was best for both the case and for Jimmy. He just wanted deniability (blame it all on Hamlin) but Jimmy figured it out.

Chuck is a good person who did a terribly dishonest thing to try and maintain a relationship with his brother while still holding on to his principles. Maybe he should have just been honest to Jimmy and said ""you're a fuckup kid, later"" but he wanted his cake and to eat it too.","1427846661"

My bad. I read the article quickly, and missed this detail:

""Police said there was another traffic incident involving the two drivers shortly before at Devon Avenue and Sheridan Road that was not captured on the video.""

My impression was that the whole thing was caught on camera. Hence my point of view. If anything, the article is badly written: The first thing on the page says:

""ROGERS PARK — With a nearby surveillance camera **recording it all**, two feuding drivers launched into a violent and extended battle ...""

But all of that aside, I'm pretty sure ""Vigil"" wouldn't have gone apeshit with his car if lightshirt guy didn't follow him, and then go insane punching his window. We can't hear what he's saying ... He might have been saying: ""I'M GONNA FUCKING KILLYOU!!"" which would be kind of an overreaction to a minor traffic accident. Obviously Vigil reacted badly as well ... and he was clearly in the wrong for leaving the scene of an accident.

For clarification: I am not on Vigil's side. But i'm not on lightshirt guy's side either. I'm sure the righteous reddit vigilante mentality will probably disagree with me, but all I really see in the video is bad behavior by pretty much everybody except the little girl on the scooter. :)","1427846662"

2. You **never** consulted the South Sudanese people on this. There is no democracy in your actions.

3. Salva Kiir Mayardit is a great man, but not the current president of South Sudan. Our country, unlike yours **respects** democratic elections.

4. A solved conflict? LOL. You never solved anything, you said it yourself: ""The ethnic tension in the building is high, and all of the groups look ready to abandon the talks at any moment and begin firing.""

5. Congress does **NOT** include South Sudan, we have our own congress, you don't own us. WE'RE FREE.

6. You just condemned a government **literally** for being democratic, not wanting to be invaded, and not bowing down to your barbaric imperialism.

[He said he would not even run for re-election] (http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/21/sudan.bashir.re.election/index.html?iref=allsearch). Even if he ran again, no one would vote for a leader who has an **arrest warrant** on him by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in the region of Darfur, where war has continued since 2003.

It's like telling a poor white person that white privilege exists. They're often offended because it sounds like you're calling him a piece of shit. I mean, if you're poor and white and hard working and suddenly someone comes along and tells you that you've had some sort of advantage, that's hard to swallow.

After crunching some of the numbers, I will recoup the DSC fees in about 2.5 years solely based on the reduced MERs from switching from my current mutual funds to TD e-series funds.

Based on your reply and the reply of others, I will look more closely at contributing to opening a self-directed RRSP and allocating some funds to this. I believe I have about 25k of RRSP room. A large jump in salary is not a sure thing in the next few years. I was never really informed how to determine when the best time is to contribute, but the tax-free growth seems like more of a sure thing than waiting for a jump in salary for a secondary benefit. Any suggestions on how you would change the location of the TD e-series assets if I was to contribute to an RRSP?","1427846664"

That there may be millions already out there does not make one more any less important.

I'll spend 15-20, 30 minutes at the absolute longest here (prowler sleds and Airdyne are my favorite). When that's all over I'll do a little stretching and foam rolling to help with my recovery. After that it's I pack a bowl and eat some food. On longer days such as this I'll bring some snacks into the gym. Nothing big, just something to curb the hunger (protein shake, protein bar, almonds).

"HomeImprovement","t5_2ql97","If you have baseboards, you could try pulling those off and running the cable behind them.

If you pull off the baseboard, you can drill a hole there to run the cable up to the hole you cut for your outlet box. Then reinstall the baseboard to cover it up.

Sometimes, you can tuck the cable into the space below the baseboard. Maybe that's good enough to hide the cable from point A to B and then once it's behind the TV stand or whatever, it can just pop up from under the baseboard. 

You could try [powerline adapters](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MRVJY2U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) and bypass running the cable.

&gt; ... it's likely I'll have to do a lot of drilling through studs?

Probably, unless they used metal studs that already have holes in them. You should drill new holes, anyway, you don't want your ethernet cable up against a 110v line.

&gt;  For the insulated bits, would it just be easier to cut out an entire horizontal strip of drywall, put in a conduit, then re-insert it?

If you want to run cable and you plan on being in the place for a while, find how much it would cost to have a pro come reinstall the drywall.  Then, cut that strip, drill the holes in the studs, install boxes, and have them come finish it.  It'd be a good opportunity to change the paint color if you so desired, as well.

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","I'm a Dad (sorry, not a Mom) of three boys, and all three were NICU babies!

My oldest was so big they had to induce a week early before he burst through my wife like the Incredible Hulk through clothes! This led to a heart problem and a NICU stay. My twins were straight up 6.5 weeks premature, and one had lung problems, so they hit the NICU too!

My first kid was the worst for us. He had a PDA, basically a heart valve didn't close because he was a week premature. He was massive, ten and a half pounds! It was so funny seeing this enormous baby compared to the other peanuts in the NICU. We would joke that he was there because he ate one of the other babies! ;)

Man, we felt so cheated. We were ready for that moment when they pull out the baby, then hand it to the Mom, and everybody is beaming like a Norman Rockwell painting! Instead, our baby was taken straight to the NICU. My wife didn't see him for more than 8 hours afterward. She was so sad.

So the moment you have waited for your whole life, when you should be swimming in love, is replaced by literally the worst thing that can happen to you, your child's health is in serious jeopardy! When they told us to go home and get some sleep, we were heartbroken. We are leaving the hospital without our baby? What the fuck? It felt so unnatural. Every day it seemed like he should be getting out, and every day they found a new complication they had to monitor. I appreciated the overabundance of caution, but man, I wanted my baby!!! Not attached to a bunch of wires!!! (We called him Electrobaby. We made a lot of jokes. You have to.)

After 11 days, we FINALLY got to take him home! No wires attached!!! Oh my God it was the best! He was the first kid for either of our families, so he was worshipped like a Golden God! He was a difficult child at first, not a good sleeper and always having to have his way, but over the years he got better and better.

Today, he is 6 years old and still a big boy, 95% for height, 99% for weight. He had his heart checked the other day, and they said it is indistinguishable from a normal heart! His favorite things to do are dance and jump on the trampoline. He is smart and athletic and literally so nice that we don't know where he came from (my wife and I are assholes by comparison!).

So when we had the twins, we were no strangers to the NICU. The twins were 6.5 weeks premature, but for 6.5 week preemies they were massive (6 pounds each)! But by human standards, they were in the 1% for height and weight. The older one was stable, the younger one was severely hyperventilating and had to be rushed away.

One of the nurses called me down, and said my wife is sad because she didn't get to see the babies AGAIN right after they were born! I went to the recovery room to see her. She had a tear coming down her cheek.

Her: ""I didn't get to see my baby again!""

Me: ""You didn't get to see our oldest one right away either, but you definitely got to see plenty of him over the next few years! And hey, while they are in the NICU we have really expensive babysitting! Let's use it and get the last few precious nights of sleep we'll get for two years.""

Her: ""Oh, right.""

And we were both good after that.

The twins were good. They fixed the hyperventilating on the youngest. They are two years old today! We saw them go from 1% in height and weight to 95% height and 97% weight! They are big thriving boys who are endless piles of energy!

The hardest part of the NICU is the loss of control over your kid's fate in such a dire scenario. You just have to have faith that these doctors do this shit every day. It's special to you because it is your kid, but for them it's just another Tuesday. They know what they are doing, because they do this a few hundred times a year!

You have access to the best healthcare in the world, let it do it's thing, and you do yours. Watch after yourself and your spouse. Get some sleep. Take some deep breaths, or meditate if you are into that. Have a drink or a smoke. You have earned it! This is likely to be the roughest shit of your life, and it's going to be okay. Today I laugh and tell stories about my NICU boys! And so will you.

Good luck!

TL;DR Enjoy the most expensive babysitting in the world, and let the doctors do their thing!","1427846670"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","&gt; Why does growth have to be extrapolated linearly? What about the idea of frogleaping technologies?

The rate of growth they extrapolated is already based on the highest levels of growth we've seen in the poorest parts of the world. 

&gt;Let’s assume that we can maintain the fastest rate of income growth that the poorest 10% of the world’s population have ever enjoyed over the past few decades. That was between 1993 and 2008 – after the debt crisis of the 1980s that crippled much of the developing world and before the banking collapse of 2008. During that period, their incomes increased at a rate of 1.29% each year.

Unless you have some compelling reason to believe that economic growth rates are going to skyrocket in the next few decades for the world's poorest people, I don't see what's wrong with their extrapolation techniques. If anything, it's too optimistic, because it doesn't factor in recessions and other economic downturns occurring in the next century.

&gt;Even this extremely optimistic, best-possible scenario does not account for the slowdown in income growth since the financial crash. It doesn’t factor in the spikes in food prices that have effectively wiped out the incomes of the poor over the past few years, or the fact that climate change is already unravelling development gains across the global south. It imagines all of this away, and assumes that no further economic or ecological crises will happen in the next 100 years – which is a very big assumption indeed.

While I could see the argument that advances in technology can increase growth rates, it would have to be one hell of a technological innovation to not only offset any recessions, but also sustainably outpace the highest growth rates that these demographics have already experienced. 

&gt;And why the bottom 10 percent? What was growth in the bottom quintile over this period? 

Why does it matter that they focused on the poorest 10% rather than the poorest 20%?","1427846672"
"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","It's not a valid argument in my opinion and I've detailed why in the original post and in multiple comments after.

Nobody has convinced me that because ""some piracy leads to increased profitability"" that all piracy is justified. Nobody has convinced me that end-users are capable of determining when piracy will help the creator. I also don't believe the end-user is pirating content with the intent of helping the creator. They are doing it because they don't want to pay for the content or exert the effort of obtaining it traditionally (aka going to the store).

My contention is the content creator can read opinions like that and come to the conclusion that progressive distribution methods including pay what you want and such is profitable and choose to do it. If the creator chooses not to, it's wrong to download the content. The way to send a message to them to change their perspective is to not buy their product.","1427846672"

The internet has given an outlet to marginalized and fringe communities to interact with each other and convince each other that their behavior &amp; lifestyle is normal. Combine that with the rise of social media, and you have the recipe for SJW agendas to gain traction. 

Reddit is an online community that has always been left leaning, with athiests and far left liberals. Plus its based in San Francisco, meaning it will be run and administered by SJW faggots. ","1427846672"

Yeah i know most ""body cleanse"" things are just quick money making gimmicks for companies. The pink sea salt flush that I have been doing on and off pretty much just makes me eventually, after several bms,  pass lots of water while it is supposedly emptying my colon of impurities. Which I thought may be a good thing if there's nasty stuff hanging out up in there. 

And yes there have been complaints of the smell. My longest job that I had last year i began hearing complaints and was randomly let go for ""reasons"". My latest job, which I quit because of this problem, I heard coworkers saying it smelt funky, or like farts. And this was in a kitchen dish washing room, so it had to be pretty bad for them to be able to smell it over all that. Also my friends have told me. It's most definitely not psychological. Though, the stress and anxiety of it is most likely only making it worse. 

Are you usually able to ask for a different doctor though? The place I go to only has one male GP and when I first when in for the depression issues they assigned me to a female GP. I have no problem for female doctors, I just reallyy would feel more comfortable talking to a male doctor about this stuff.

Looking at the photo, it seemed the noise was pretty wide spread. I'm hoping that was zoomed way in and we were just seeing spread spectrum, 'cause otherwise, perhaps increasing the emissions to get a much wider usable range than the Hydra had might turn around and bite them.

I'm assuming they decided to immediately test emissions with all transceivers off, a single transceiver, and three transceivers. I'm also assuming they've decided to invest in their own emissions tester (not for self cert, but just to test ideas... Lot cheaper than paying for a second round of failed tests).","1427846673"

You seem very caught up with prestige (both your own and that of the companies), but there are a lot of very high quality companies out there with very smart people you can learn a lot from, and you may not have heard of them before. Cast your net wider and start doing interviews at other places. Your reputation won't be ruined by working for a year or two at a company that's not a big name. You can still go on to work for a big-name company later. Your first job is not your final job, it's just a stepping stone.

I will also add this though: subarus check engine lights are notoriously finicky. I have a 2011 outback my check engine light comes on every time the weather warms up...Like it is in FoCo right now. I took it to the shop the first couple of times it did this and basically turned up nothing....After doing some research I found that a loose gas cap often causes this to happen on subaru's and there can be a delay in it going off again. My guess is the warm weather expands the fumes in the tank just enough to take the cap pressure off that sensor.

Secondly, ease of viewing information: if you run PlexFit on your wrist you can easily glance to see how many steps you have been walking today. You don't have the same ease of use if you run it on the phone. You have to unlock your phone, opening Google Fit, wait for it to load then see your steps.

Others (myself not included) find that the Parker 24c shaves better than the Edwin Jagger.

But you've already got a decent entry-level razor. Maybe the 24c (or 26c) would make a significant difference, but the others seem likely to offer marginal improvement at best.

For a razor with conventional cutting action, you may want to consider something like the Standard razor or the iKon ShaveCraft 101.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","To point something else out, there are a large number of pet owners that don't know how to take care of their pets either. I have one in my neighborhood and he takes his dog for walks frequently without a leash and lets it pee and poop on the sidewalk and doesn't clean it up.

The dog itself is mean and probably should be put down. It is a medium size dog that is some sort of husky looking breed, or some sort of mutt. I am 6' tall and it stands above my knees. I went to go get the mail once and that is when I met this creature and its haggard owner. The dog started barking its head off out of nowhere and scared the crap out of me. It then started circling me and I thought it was going to attack me. Had the asshole owner not come around the corner, it probably would have. It backed off when he said 'Thank you for your patience.'

I then told the owner to keep the damn mutt on a leash. I didn't provoke the dog, and it almost attacked me. I can't imagine what he treats it like at his home.

Also, it depends on how long you've been on the meds. There are many other options than Zoloft, so I'd really suggest talking to your doctor again and even explaining what you've written here.

Say Harden shoots 4/15 from behind the arc, and 8/10 from a the rim, for a total of 12/25, or 48% from the field .* Now say Harden had 10 more drives to the basket, which ended in fouls where he missed the shot. Say if he wasn't fouled, he would have shot 8/10 again on those drives to the rim. That would be a total of 20/35, or 57 % from the field.
Pretty simple math, and also it I used a pretty realistic scenario. Obviously numbers can fluctuate, but things like the fact that he gets fouled a lot when its not called will offset things like the times where Harden takes a bullshit shot just to get the 2 shots.

*Just for the sake of simplicity, I'm only doing 3's and drives to the rim, which are Harden's two main shots anyway, but those don't even really matter, we're talking about FG%.","1427846680"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","Note that it would take a minimum of [4.37 years](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri) for Earth to be informed, so any specially outfitted expidition would be at least 10 years out, probably closer to 11 or 12 if they need to produce something especially specialized from stratch.

A one month resupply schedule would require at least 138 ships, which is improbable (11.5 year round trip = 138 months). A much longer resupply schedule is likely. I always assumed a fleet of 14, 12 in transit and 1 at each end, loading and unloading. 

A 1000 person RDA army with proper air/mech support would be a force to contend with, but landing that many soldiers would take a long time. A [Valkyrie](http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Valkyrie) landing ship can only carry 60 outfited soldiers at a time, it would take at least 17 trips to land that army. Unless additional ships were brought to Pandora, landing would take far too long. And if the sole remaining landing ship were destroyed or rendered un-flyable, the RDA would be SOL. 

That is to say nothing of the supplies, personnel, and vehicles to support them. Also keep in mind that [Dragon assault ships](http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Assault_Ship) and  [Scorpion](http://james-camerons-avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Scorpion_Gunship) gunships are not landed whole, but in pieces. They would completely lack air support until they got a decent base and manufacturing facility set up. 

Without a secure beachhead to work from, invading the existing RDA complex (or assaulting the Na'vi in general) with normal equipment would be unlikely. The earth forces just wouldn't be able to get enough heavy firepower in place before a Na'vi attack wiped them out. 

In short, the Na'vi and other humans on Pandora would likely have more than a decade to ready themselves. Plus, the remaining humans would have full run of the RDA complex and all existing materiel on world with which to make defenses. I'm willing to bet they'd have a pretty decent chance of fighting back if it came to that. ","1427846682"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Yes, but you're just saying that. I'm sure some scientists know less than they outwardly represent.

Oh, some scientists will be very candid, but it's the political messaging that they all agree that is the problem.  

&gt;But if you draw conclusions in a scientific manner from the available evidence we have...

Yeah, and what does that conclusion tell you from the observable data?  That the world is warmer...on average...than it was in 1880.

They're trying to use temperature data to show a total energy input vs energy output.  If the world average temperature rises by 0.5 C, I can't even see how that makes a drastic difference.  Daily variation, seasonal variation, and regional variation completely vary more than that across the board.  But a 0.5 C average increase over the course of 100 years is catastrophic, whereas a daily variation of 15 C is not of a concern.  

So, using temperature as a proxy for total energy isn't even exactly proper I'd say...average world temperature is practically a useless statistic in itself.  

&gt;{warming oceans} is conducive to more common and more intense hurricanes.

Except that has been at odds with direct observation.  

&gt;Then I'm going to need some convincing because ""scientists don't know what they're talking about"" doesn't convince me.

Well, that's why I wrote the post in the first place.  And the point of my responses.  I have no expectation of actually convincing anyone though.  I'm just putting my view out there.

&gt;But I'll point out that ice core samples demonstrate the composition of the atmosphere, which can easily be applied to the world at large during whichever time period it corresponds with.

There's a point to be made, atmospheric composition varies regionally to some degree too.  But the Ice Cores are used to determine world temperatures.  Antarctica is probably not a good proxy for the rest of the world's temperature over the course of a year.

&gt;This shares a few of the problems with arguments against 'carbon dating,' 

Well, carbon dating is much more scientifically sound than something like a tree ring temperature proxy since it relies on measurable decay of carbon isotopes.

&gt;How do you think anomalies and outliers are treated in any other field?

Differently.  I'd need an example...you'd have to get into specifics to really answer a question like that.

&gt;No, CO2 isn't the singular cause of global warming

It is claimed to be.  That's why everything is talked about in relation to carbon.  Methane is a known strong heat retention gas, I don't dispute that.  Climate scientists claim that CO2 rises drive other factors (like increased water vapor) to create the total heat load they expect.  

&gt;uniquely rapid increase in global temperature within the last 50+ years

How do they know it is unique?  They have no observed scientific data to compare that against.  They have one data set going back a mere 140 years.  Heck, looking at the Vostok Ice core wouldn't give you the idea that a rapid rise for a short burst wouldn't have occurred.  

This also opens up another issue of the Land temp record.  The values published by places like the NCDC are not raw data values.  They manipulate the data...including historic data.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","This is a tough one.

I did some searching. The piece is called ""Sad Romance"". It is credited either to Thảo Nguyên Xanh or to Jyi Peuong. ~~Possibly the former is the composer and the latter is the violinist, but I was not able to find definitive information.~~ EDIT. It seems likely that ""Thảo Nguyên Xanh"" is the name of a Vietnamese film, and Jyi Peuong is the composer of the piece.

The piece is said to have appeared in the game *Final Fantasy X* (however, it is not on the soundtrack album for the game, so who knows). It is also said to have been used on the South Korean TV series *Over the Green Fields*.

Quite a nice piece, I must say.

----

EDIT. Some links.

* [YouTube video of the piece being performed by the Konya University Chamber Orchestra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhr97nCUSi4). Credit given to Thao Nguyen Xanh. Later on the page, a comment says that ""Thao Nguyen Xanh"" is the name of a film, and Jyi Peuong is the composer.

* [The piece available for license from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006KIWNLK/). Credit given to Jyi Peuong. *Over the Green Fields* referenced.

* [Sheet music for the piece](http://www.scribd.com/doc/14079741/Thao-Nguyen-Xanh-Sad-Romance) on Scribd. Composer listed as Thao Nguyen Xanh. *Final Fantasy X* referenced.

* Some webpages state that the piece is called ""Keep on Smiling"". This is almost certainly incorrect. The name appears to be a reference to a [My Little Pony fan video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bDSrt6hYV8) that used the piece as a soundtrack.

* Some webpages state that the piece is the ""Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet"", played by André Rieu. This is certainly incorrect (although it is possible that Mr. Rieu is the violinist). [Here is a video of Rieu playing the Love Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHyR4ZzA2R0) -- definitely a different piece.

* The piece was used as background music for ""[Sincerely Abbey (a Love Poem)](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GXS6J4Y)"", a track by rapper Semaj the Poet. However, it is pretty clear that the piece did not originate with him.

EDIT 2. [This sheet music](http://www.scribd.com/doc/82977240/Sad-Romance-Piano) on scribd says that ""Thảo Nguyên Xanh"" is a Vietnamese rendering of ""Over the Green Fields"". I have been unable to verify this using online translator sites, except that ""xanh"" does mean ""green"".","1427846685"

Id concentrate on hobbies, work, school etc.. even a new tv series to distract yourself and find something to get excited about. Consciously trying to maintain an optimistic outlook can really help and I recommend seeking help if you are feeling depressed or are considering self-harming. Read up a bit on it, seek help from family, friends even the NHS has wonderful support options!

"trees","t5_2r9vp","That's the way most people look at it, unfortunately, and that's why weed is illegal. You can always make an argument that something is bad for more people than it is good. The philosophy of the enlightenment which culminated in the founding of this country was that there are only two alternatives with respect to ownership over a human being's life. Either the individual owns it or someone else does (the collective, society, the pope, the dictator, the tribe, etc). Despite the obvious contradiction of slavery (which required the deaths of hundreds of thousands to correct), the point of the founding of America was that you have a right to your own life. 

It's true that your actions affect people in all sorts of ways. What determines where to draw the line is physical force. If you choose to smoke weed, then you're not spending that money on charity. You might have even hurt their feelings if they hoped you were going to give them that money. You have affected other people, but it is exactly your right to smoke weed however much you please because you have not actually caused harm to or defrauded anyone. Not serving someone at a restaurant is the same thing. You may hurt someone's feelings but you have not caused them physical harm. Rights aren't meant to protect freedoms to action that everyone agrees about- otherwise we wouldn't need rights because everyone would agree they're okay. The very reason we need to assert our individual right to smoke weed is because it's not popular. That's what rights are for. Anyway, that's how the founding principles of America would treat these issues. Also, anyone who doesn't serve someone because of their sexual preference or race should be boycotted.","1427846688"

If it were a truly free market, then yes, people could discriminate and the market would decide if that business will succeed, but it's not. Which businesses should be allowed to discriminate? Hospitals? Utilities? What happens when that business sells the only goods or services a customer requires within 10 miles?

If you open a business, you're open to the general public. Sure if someone is disrupting your business, you have the option to tell them to leave, but if they're in there buying a dipstick for their car and you tell them to leave because you don't serve ""their kind"", you're being an asshole.

Being discriminated against is fucking soul-crushing. To have it happen all the time wears  you down. Your life becomes a little hell where people constantly chip away at your well-being and esteem.

**The combat in destruction flows much more natural**, since there are no random flags on the map you need to capture to win, although capturing does help you win a game by **gaining you income an advantage**.  Airborne assaults do not work on that map (which is one of the **worst destruction maps**, since it is really hard to attack and we are no playing ~~king of the hill~~ conquest). It is also to open, promoting arty spam. **Destruction (td no time limit) is a very offensive gamemode**, where losing a zone causes you to lose income and that leads to losing the game, due to the opponent having more forces.

"Calgary","t5_2qn40","Here's the thing. If you trade down you're getting strictly the wholesale value(""rough"" in CBB, ""wholesale"" in NADA, Kelly bluebook isn't in Canada so I have no idea why other commenters are using that terminology - do not use KBB in Canada as anything more than a barometer)

When you trade down, the dealer can't even play shell games and take some money off the new car to bump the trade price up like they would otherwise do to get you above wholesale.

I don't have an auto subscription anymore, but CBB and NADA are probably calling that at like $7K-$8K wholesale depending on trim, etc.

That would mean you have to work past at least $3K of negative equity to get another car, and are going to be moving in to a car that's worth $3K-$4K depending on how the dealer calls it, after GST you're likely to have $2,850-$3800 of purchasing power. 

That is obviously not really an ideal outcome.

What I think you should do, as someone who has been in the vehicle sales industry for 5 going on 6 years is sell the Matrix and go buy a car with the cash from that sale. 

Here is how you do that:

1.  Go ask your bank for an unsecured loan, or line of credit, you are going to pay a lot more interest than on your secured auto loan but that is OK because it is going to be paid off much quicker.

2. Go sell your car, in all likelihood you'll get less than the $11,000 you now owe, and that's something you're going to have to live with.

3. Go buy a new car for as little as you can while still remaining comfortable with the reliability you can expect.

4. Take all of the cash you now have, make sure your new car is as reliable as possible, and put all of that cash down on your new unsecured loan.

5. Work hard, pay unsecured loan off much faster than initially agreed term.

You can probably be out faster than you would by waiting, long term it will cost a bit more but this is how you minimize the loss ou're going to incur.

For the love of god OP, do not trade your car down at a dealership, there is literally no way you don't give up 60%-80% of the value of your car doing that.","1427846692"

&gt; For something as important as the option to secede or not, we should not be relying on interpretation.

There is no choice in that matter.  
One thing is clear, though, and that is the powers granted to the federal government in the constitution. There is a very strong constitutional case to be made that at the time the decision on secession should come from the president, which it did, and was ignored, hence the designation of their secession as illegal.  

&gt; I simply don't believe that a state does not have the right to secede if it's done in a peaceable and reasonable manner.

I said this before but I will say it again.  This is simply impractical.  We'd have as many countries as we do citizens.

"comedywriting","t5_2sj66","Tinder uses real names. I know you wrote Tindr, but it's going to be pronounced the same, so either call the app something different or drop the names. My vote is for dropping the names. Even if a site has profile names, people introduce themselves before meeting. 

What would you say the premise of this sketch is? It's a little muddy right now. It could be ""a date where both people have scheduled two dates at once."" It could be ""two people look for new dates while on dates."" Either premise could work, but together they're fighting for stage time. (Your premise is not ""A man and woman on a date in the Swipe Right era of love and Tindrness."")

My vote is for a date where both people are actively looking for something better.  

One thing that's important to ask yourself when writing a sketch is this: ""What's keeping this person from just leaving."" Most people in most situations they don't like will just leave.

The first two people you see in this sketch no reason to stay. Sure, they're on a date, but neither seems interested by the other person, and the only thing they talk about before one leaves is how they lied in their profiles. People are going to assume the girl left to escape out the window.  

Normally, I would say get to your premise before the fifth line, but because your characters don't have an established relationship, and that relationship is important to the rest of the scene, you can give it more time to develop. 

You want at least one real exchange that shows that they like each other. You want to establish that they've found something good, but they still think they could do better. 

Then, when they betray each other to find better people, that betrayal will actually mean something. 

And finally, a five page sketch is only short for SNL. 

If you don't want to change all those things, I could see your sketch working as a reality show, using Kroll show as a model.

I found this on the ffxiv forums.

""Built atop the peaks of the Xelphatol Mountains, the city of Ishgard stands as a symbol of Elezen pride and honor. It is said that a millennia ago the Goddess Halone appeared before the most courageous Elezen, Thordan, and bade him lead Her chosen people to the peak where Ishgard stands still today. But there stood a great chasm between Thordan and Halone's chosen peak. So they set to making a great bridge to cross.

It was then that a great shadow descended upon them and the land darkened under the shadow of the great wyrm Nidhogg. Courageous Thordan took up lance against the colossal Nidhogg, but the power of the dragon bewitched Thordan's men and they betrayed him to the dragon, casting him into the chasm. Overcome with anguish over what he had done, Haldrath son of Thordan, broke Nidhogg's spell and took up his sire's lance and hurled himself at the great wyrm. With a mighty thrust, Haldrath's hand, guided by Halone, plunged his sire's lance into Nidhogg's eye, prizing it from the dragon. With a terrible roar Nidhogg took wing and fled to the skies. And so it was, the first Dragoon was born.""

- Excerpt from ""The City States of Hydaelyn"" by Scholar Sounsyy.


This is a pretty deep story, Nidhogg's power is all consuming. I feel that Estinien is continuing the circle of his past ancestor at the conclusion of the dragoon quest (Estinien to kill his mentor/Thordan casted into the chasm). But, somehow the Warrior of Light stopped that from happening, a big tease for sure. I cant wait for the Heavensward continuation. ","1427846695"

"bloodborne","t5_31k9i","Damn, I forgot to talk about 30% health decrease as well. This is an interesting one and I am glad you reminded me. I do think that this forces you to have a minimum of 40 Vit which is unfortunate for build variety. 50 Vit is obviously ideal, but my two completed builds only have 45 and 47 and have yet to ""one shot"" by anything. Maybe a buffed cannon could, but definetly not a parry, and I have yet to one shot anyone (I have come close, but it seems those people had very low resists/hp to start with). The 10% (and 15%) Vit rune, helps negate this by giving you 100-200 extra hp to work around, which is roughly 7-10 stat points. Being the invader **needs** to have a down side, this isn't dueling PvP like Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2. There is no Arena and no summoning of invaders, it is only forced invasions. I think this is an important point to understand, and while some people may want to duel many will not. The main thing is, while it does suck to be so set in stone, it isn't that big of a sacrifice to go to 40 vit on every build and if you want to sacrifice a bit of damage or endurance you can go higher to 45 or 50.","1427846695"

I think the most flexibility you need is with your dress but if you are willing to buy off the rack or pay for rush chargers you should be totally fine.

"diablo3","t5_2qjhk","Step 1. Normal to torment 1.
To do this, you basically just want rares with 'correct' affixes. Mainstat/Vit/CC/CHD/All resis. If you use a resource spender build try to get a decent 2h.
How to farm this? Normal rifts would be fastest, full clears or RG clears - up to you. Full clears spend less keys while RG clears give you more bloodshards. 
If you are softcore, don't be afraid to try torment 1 asap, even if it is a little slow. The reason for this is that you just want to get a greater rift key.
The reason we do normal is because there is no legendary drop difference until Torment 1 and up (which also enables class sets as drops). 

Step 2. The greater rift trial key
Once you have found your first rift trial key from torment 1 you likely want to get as much out of it as possible (presuming T1 is still slow). To do this, you start the trial and immediately teleport back to town (Get a GR1 key). When you do this GR1 key, you want to wait until the timer says 4:30 left OR LESS. Doing this means that the rift key will only go up one level, allowing you to get many Leg. gems in the process (about GR10 is Torment 1, netting you 10 legendary gems).

If you want to spent your time efficiently meanwhile, make a townportal in the greater rift trial and go do bounties meanwhile. To exit the bounty without removing your town portal in the rift, open your MAP (M) and teleport using that. Then you can take the GRift townportal straight back to the boss.

Which legendary gems to use? I suggest anything that is WeaponDps% at this point. If you went with a resource spender build and have a very slow weapon (1.0) it will make you jump up in torment quite quick. (Toxin, Pain Enhancer, that kind of stuff)

Step 3. Getting that T6 going
Basically at this point you could farm T1-T2, gamble away and hope you get your set (flavour of the month) soon from #KADALAWIFE so you can run T6. However, if you want to gear up through the levels instead, then here's some tips:
3.1: Get Recipes from T1 Rifts. You are looking for Asheara, Aughild, Sage, Sunder, Arcane Barb, Devastator, well... anything that it good for your build. Going with sets, craft 2 of each part, ie. Shoulder Asheara, Chest Aughild, Gloves Sage, Pants Captain, Boots Asheara, Belt Captain, Bracers Aughild, Helm Sage. Try to look for the same affixes as earlier (Mainstat,vit,CC,Crit). 
3.2: If you before 3.1 or after 3.1 feel comfortable with T2, feel free to go do bounties again. T2 has a 50% drop chance in caches for a legendary, T1 has no such benefit. If you want a RORG, do it now on T2 or later on T6. If you did 3.1, a RORG would give you the lvl 3 benefit of all your sets.
3.3: Goldwrap + Gem of the Hoarder + Averice band (act 3 cache) OR Harrington waistguard. The first combo will give you immortality on a torment level you can clear comfortably, getting you trillions of sheet toughness (get avarice band on T2+ aswell). Harrington gives you 110-130% damage bonus for 10 seconds when you open: Loose stone, corpse, chest, 'insert clickable thing that does not smash'. For most maps with a decent speed you can keep this up 100%.
3.4: If you have nothing better for the slot, Warzechian Armguards (bracers). With some AoE, these bracers can give you great boosts of speed so you can run your rifts faster. Other noteworthy bracers to look for would be Nemesis (Swap-in at shrines). 
3.5: Getting the first 200 paragon means that you no longer have to look for movementspeed on boots. You will get this eventually, but if you find a decent pair of Custerian Wristguards you can use them with Hoarders. If you are dependent on something else (reapers, gungdo gear, Warz Armguards) then just forget about it - at BEST it's a 10% exp increase. Also, avoid rubies in helm, that is only multiplied in GR's (in T6 it is only around a 1-4% increase~ give or take). Monster EXP through, that is multiplied by torment level and is very nice- but not mandatory or needed in any way. Focus on killing speed versus higher torment. You only want to hit each mob for a split second and speed through your rifts. 

4.0 - Why am I still not T6?
Basically, to run T6 comfortably you should have some kind of build or sets in mind that will take you there. Some classes will be able to get to T6 before others: for example - Demon hunters can run T6 with only 4 piece marauders while Wizards likely need 6 piece firebirds. Crusaders could do a cooldown reduction focused build without Akkhans to go semi-perma akkarat and get up there aswell. 
However, sets are super-powerful and you likely won't run it comfortably without one. To get it: Gamble different pieces at Kadala until you get the set piece and then move on, I would likely gamble slots that share other pieces which could serve useful first. After this, you can either go the highest chance route: For raekors this is Pants, Boots, Gloves, Helm, Chest (I believe). Otherwise I would likely gamble for the more important slots (Gloves, Helmet). These slots roll up to 750 main stat rather than 500 on other slots. 1000 if they are ancient. If you happen to find another one while killing stuff, then it is -fine- in the way that you just had an extra chance to roll a very sweet item. 

Keep your class sets even if the pieces are super-crappy, as the bonuses are insane. For 2.2 there will be even more sets, so among these you should find something that can get you higher up in torment.

5.0 - When you can run T6 remember to take your gems up to level 25.
and the final ever-asked question, should I farm in GR's or T6? 
My take on it is: T6 if you have Harrington. That belt is just so good, so so good. And it does not work in GR's. If you do not, then the rule below applies:
Does that mean you should not do GR's? No. Do them to upgrade your gems as needed. I would probably switch to only GR's when I no longer need: Gold, Deaths breath, blue/yellow mats and GR trial keys while also being in gear that would make it possible to comfortably run a GR (until RG) as fast as T6 with the harrington. (I.e. can I run any level between 26 and infinite within 3-5 minutes? If yes, then GR's could be considered. The higher you go, the higher difference between loot and exp to greater rifts).","1427846698"

Down syndrome is named after a doctor in the UK named John Langdon Down. Originally, it was referred to as his syndrome – Down’s Syndrome. In the UK, Europe and many other countries, the correct term still remains “Down’s Syndrome.” In the U.S., it was changed to Down syndrome (drop the possessive) as to emphasize that it was not Dr. Down who had the syndrome nor was it his.

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; IMO no one can judge a series without experiencing it in the totality but I guess this is one of those times we must agree to disagree.

On most occasions, I would 100% agree with this. One of my friends watched the first 3 episodes of Steins;gate and said it was boring and he didn't want to finish it. I told him ""just watch the whole thing, I promise it will pay off"" and now it is one of his favorite series of all time. 

In this case, however, I watched the first 5 episodes and found absolutely nothing that I hadn't seen before. Everything (from the plot to the characters) was incredibly generic and bland, and completely uninteresting. The last episode that I ended up sticking through I recall actually laughing at how bad certain scenes were that tried to come off as really serious.

The main difference is that these two anime are different ""kinds"" of anime in a sense. Steins;gate is widely regarded as one of the best anime ever made, so naturally there has to be a reason why so many people think so highly of it; in this case, sticking with the series is clearly the best thing to do, if not only just to see what all the hype is about. Akatsuki no Yona is an airing show, and with so much new stuff coming out each season I (along with most people I would imagine) really have to budget their time and pick and choose which series to keep up with each season. I gave Yona a chance, and after 5 episodes it failed to deliver on anything that I look for when watching anime, so I dropped it. I've also heard from some of my friends that stuck with it for much longer than I did that it stays just as bad as at the point when I stopped watching it, so I really didn't think it was worth my time in the slightest.

"ArgentumAge","t5_37fxj","I like the word ""Pacify"" for this.

So, as I understand right now, creatures can have activated abilities that count as their action (and result in them being exhausted, and require them not to be exhausted to use) and they can also have abilities that don't, and can be used freely after attacking or something. I don't know of any creatures that we actually have though that have the second kind.

(Roughly its analogous to MTG abilities that say ""tap the creature"" vs those that don't require this.)

Right now we have two statuses, exhausted and sleeping. Sleeping prevents the second kind as well as the first kind.

Neither of them disable passive abilities, or armor or things like this, that would be removed by the ""silence"" spell.

What I was thinking for yogi was that he would just make you exhausted. Instead, he could make you sleep for the rest of your turn.

A stronger version would make him temporarily silence you, so that if Janus killed a Yogi, she would temporarily lose her armor and all the units' health would change. But I wasn't envisioning that.

Edit: I misread your post I think.  
I was only intending that the Yogi prevents your movement for the rest of the turn. So the idea is, if he's the last line defender, the creature doesn't get to occupy the hex where the Yogi was, so you can still summon a creature there the next turn. I guess he could prevent two turns worth of movement, but he's more powerful then. I think it's more useful that he prevents movement into the hex where he was than that he sleeps you for the whole next turn.","1427846702"

Then some bean counter looks at it, sees it took 3 years for someone to pop the first one, and in 10 years, there was only 2 deliberate abuse, and only 1 age-related failure.

The deck was developed as an attempt to get Griselbrand banned in legacy, though it hasn't been successful. The name comes from an episode of Sealab 2021, which had fake commercials for a fake restaurant named Grizzlebees, which sounds similar enough to be a nickname for Griselbrand. The episode was framed as an ad for a movie called Tin Fins, so that got adopted as the name of the deck.

There's also a thing about naming combo decks after breakfast related items I dunno where this comes from. I think Trix originated it, but there's also Cheerios, Eggs(this one actually has more reason to its name), Sunny Side Up, and probably others I'm not aware of.","1427846704"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","I guess this highlights the difference between a good and bad realtor in a seller's market.  Your realtor should have told you that you're going to be at a significant disadvantage in the DC area with using a non-conventional loan.  There's simply too many folks in the area who can qualify with traditional financing (or in some cases, pay with cash), that you're going to consistently come up against folks who have a financial situation that presents less risk to the seller.  

I managed to snag my current home (in the balt/wash corridor) away from a buyer who had a home-sale contingency, 30 days into their 60 day window.  We later found out another couple was trying to do the same with an FHA loan, however, the seller found our offer more attractive simply because we were using conventional financing and didn't have the FHA inspection as a closing requirement (even though the house was immaculate).

The one place you'll be less disadvantaged at is in new home sales.  However, in the DC area, those are almost always exorbitantly expensive for what they are, which is cookie-cutter built junk homes by Toll and every other major builder.","1427846706"

&gt;My dad would always make fun of me. He used to call me racial slurs when he was drunk and would always try to wrestle me to establish dominance. 

What does it mean to have an ex-military white dad who calls his Half-Asian son, a Chink, Jap, Gook, Zipperhead, Slope, Slant etc? It doesn't sound so bad when you say ""racial slurs"" casually. But lets remember what those words of murder actually are. Those are words you use on your enemy and not your flesh and blood son. A Black man would never call his son a Nigger, and an Asian man wouldn't call his son a Chink. This is what comes from being a colored son to a white man. 

Most Hapas have experienced racialized bullying, but your tale of racial taunts from your own white dad, is ironically probably one of the worst experiences here. 

&gt;My dad stopped messing with me (I was just purely bigger/faster/stronger than him) and I was just a lot more confident.

This would be inspiring if it was about standing up to a HS bully, but its tragic and sad, when its your own white father. 

Reading your own personal story, makes me wish that every Hapa in the world could visit this subreddit and read all the posts, including your own. ","1427846708"

Vander is much better than Fufu in every aspect of the game other than playing Thresh maybe, just because Roccat underperformed doesnt mean Vander is bad suddenly. He was top 3 support in EU last year and he is consistent this year, you probably dont watch his games to be honest.

Lemon is not about his gameplay, he is about analyzing opponents being calm and mature in game and roam/vision control. I really see you watching Fufu's good Thresh plays and thinking he is so good ","1427846711"

In addition, Riot said that on multiple occasions Jensen ""publicly and unapologetically"" **admitted to committing a series of DDoS attacks**.

Be sure that if the police stops you, they might recognize your name and search you (depends on what country, speaking from my own experience). Always act polite in front of and towards the police. 

A guy i know was ratted and the police searched his home, found 4g of weed. He ratted me and my friends and told the police that we sold him 25g earlier (not true, he was a terrible and stupid person, we avoided dealing with him). Police got a warrant and searched my friends home, found nothing. Took him to the police for questioning and searched his phone (ALWAYS HAVE A PASSWORD) and found very incriminating pictures and msgs.

One extra squirrel or rabbit in your freezer you forgot about, felony. A fish you weren't fishing for or allowed and died before release, felony. Trap vandalized and rendered illegal before you can check it,  felony. One extra round in your firearm, felony.

evtPlayerAttackMoveClick= [Button 1], [Shift] [Button 1]

If the line is not there add it in. The second portion with shift is optional and just there for my personal preference. (other options are just attack move (requires a click command after input to do anything) or attack only click (if you aren't targeting something you can agro onto, the click will count as no command given, otherwise it is an attack command.)

evtPlayerSelectClick= [Button 3]

This is for what your left click used to be. Mine looks much different but this will set it up for middle mouse button, add other options as you desire. A shift/alt/ctrl + button would look like [shift/alt/ctrl] [button]. Otherwise just enter into the [button] what you desire.

[HUDEvents]

evtOnUIMouse1 = [Button 3], [Button 1]  

evtOnUIMouse2 = [Button 2]

evtOnUIMouse3 = [Button 3]

evntHudMoveableSelect =[Button 3], [Button 1]

This will let you control map and move items correctly. [Button 3] is whatever you had select click set to up above. The [Button 1] allows you to attack move on the mini map and to interact with certain parts of the Hud with left click.

If you chose to change your select click to button 3, you should also add in

Quite the opposite - I've gotten lots of feedback from both sides. Conversely, hanging out in an echo chamber like /r/bloodborne isn't going to give you the perspective of people who tried it and didn't enjoy it.

&gt;when I walked down the stairs and saw the werewolf, and dodged for 30 seconds with no weapon equipped, that put me in a state of helplessness - I cannot kill this guy

Again, you're speaking from the perspective of someone who's been conditioned to expect this type of thing. In virtually every other game out there, the first enemy you face is either a pushover, or a fight you're intended to lose. As I said, based on the fact that this death is treated differently by the designers, this is obviously a fight we're expected to lose.

&gt;The Souls series has always rewarded exploration.

I haven't played the Souls series, and as I discussed, my experience with Bloodborne discouraged exploration.

&gt;It's not exploration if the game gives you a waypoint/map as you requested in your critique

Read it again. I specifically said I did *not* want that.

&gt;the Souls series almost always has a certain 'clicking' moment where players realise it isn't a tedious grind - it's a challenging yet rewarding game that tests your skills with a controller to the max.

It's interesting to me that Souls fans can keep insisting this while simultaneously saying ""it's not for everyone."" Which is it? Will *everyone* have that clicking moment, or is it going to remain tedious for a large portion of the people who play it.","1427846719"

The cases included a [lynch mob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynching_in_the_United_States) before the suspects had been indicted, a [frameup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frameup), [all-white juries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-white_jury), rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is frequently cited as an example of an overall [miscarriage of justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscarriage_of_justice) in the [United States legal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_legal_system).

&gt;On March 25, 1931, several people were [hoboing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo) on a [freight train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_train) traveling between [Chattanooga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chattanooga) and [Memphis, Tennessee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Tennessee). Several white teenagers jumped off the train and reported to the [sheriff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriff) that they had been attacked by a group of African-American teenagers. The sheriff deputized a [*posse comitatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posse_comitatus_(common_law\)), stopped and searched the train at [Paint Rock, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paint_Rock,_Alabama) and arrested the African-Americans. Two young white women also got off the train and accused the African-American teenagers of rape. The case was first heard in [Scottsboro, Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsboro,_Alabama), in three rushed [trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial), in which the [defendants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendant) received poor [legal representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_representation). All but twelve-year-old Roy Wright were convicted of rape and [sentenced to death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentenced_to_death), the common sentence in Alabama at the time for black men convicted of raping white women,  even though there was medical evidence to suggest that they had not committed the crime. 

&gt;With help from the [Communist Party USA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Party_USA) (CPUSA), the case was appealed. The [Alabama Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabama_Supreme_Court) affirmed seven of the eight convictions, and granted thirteen-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a [minor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_(law\)). Chief Justice John C. Anderson dissented, ruling that the defendants had been denied an [impartial jury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impartial_jury), fair trial, fair sentencing, and [effective counsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ineffective_assistance_of_counsel). While waiting for their trials, eight of the nine defendants were held in [Kilby Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilby_Prison). The cases were twice appealed to the [United States Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Supreme_Court), which led to landmark decisions on the conduct of trials. In *[Powell v. Alabama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powell_v._Alabama)* (1932), it ordered new trials.

Aaaand now there is a legitimate market, and vendors can blend some illegal ivory into their legal stockpiles and thus create whitewashing opportunities...

And of course there is a social signal. If there is a legit way to get ivory it may be even more accepted, leading to higher demand again. ","1427846719"

I was like you once and didn't take it seriously and failed the first exam. Then I did what I mentioned above  passed intermediate accounting pretty easily.By focusing on learning the key concepts, I was able to spend less time on studying for the exams. I probably spent 5-10 hours doing the practice exams to prepare myself, but this was only possible because I learned the key concepts which made it easier to recall journal entries, etc.","1427846720"

He didn't have the incredible hands or speed, but he could shoot and had pretty good positioning in front of the net to knock in rebounds and tip-ins. After various core/lower body injuries and surgeries, he lost any speed that he might have had and just couldn't get back into his zone.

It's easy to joke about Cheechoo (hell I do it from time to time), but he does get a lot of unfair criticism. The kid scored 28 the year before Thornton showed up. Without Thornton (or injuries), he probably would never had gotten close to 50, but I could see him still contributing 20-30 goals a year. Also he has a really fun name to say.","1427846720"

I found out that my ever so wonderful edad had multiple affairs. One was with my nmom's sister (who is also a massive N). Some of the women came to our house and I was introduced to them as friends of the family.

It broke my heart. He's such a supporting dad and has always been there when I needed him. I just rested in my SO's arms and cried. And when I could find words to speak I told him everything I knew, how I felt and went through my thought process with him.

So you're not alone. You're going to feel alone, but trust me you're not, my friend. Eparents can be just as bad, sometimes worse than Nparents... because they're letting the Nparent be an N. They let you be abused. They see you hurt and they comfort you, but they do it in secret. The secret part is what makes them potentially worse... because they know if they stand up for you in front of the N they would be targeted, too. They allow you to take the fall instead of them.

And on that bombshell, I hope you know even though things like this happen, we will be there for you. &lt;3","1427846722"

"HeroesVoDs","t5_33ocd","I'm gonna try and do a very quick overview on the games of every post that gets done with the VOD's that I casted. So here is the first one for the ESL EU Go4 #17.

This was one of the first tournaments on the newest patch so some of the picks may be a little be funky. I apologize if you wanted to see the draft, but if I were to include it, each video would be 50+ minutes. 

Some teams were trying out new things to see what worked, others were sticking to the older meta and see if it carried over. One team found something that worked for them and stuck with for a while.

If you are to only watch one game from all of the above, I recommend watching the quarterfinal match. It had some awesome team fights, so back and forth and the ending was spectacular. 

Again, I welcome any feedback you may have for my casting as I'm always looking to improve. Especially when it comes down to the later rounds where I solo cast the games. 

Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy the games! NA games will be up over the next few days.","1427846723"

The case was excellent for a first time build, mostly because it had lots of space for cable management, and built in standoffs were convenient. I did have to struggle for a few minutes with closing the case on the side with my cables but that was from poor planning on my part, but I got it to close in the end. I went with the Gigabyte card for two reasons, the first being that it seemed to run cooler and the second being that it was all black, which matched the color scheme I was trying to go for, although the motherboard has some red, but it's subtle.

There are some other questionable cards in there but I guess they're kind of preference.

You might want some more Dullahans, and then Fallen Angels (coming pretty soon). Kinka-Byo isn't half bad for getting a Dullahan out. 

Parade is a pretty good searcher that you can play another field spell over once you've searched to your heart's content. Don't underestimate it. Terraforming will help you reach it quickly.

Ghostricks do a lot of their special summoning on the opponent's turn, so Pot of Duality isn't out of the question.

Unfortunately, in a continuing effort to slash our acceptance rate in order to maintain our ""elite"" front on the college stage, we had to reject 99% of our applicants and sacrifice your sense of self-worth in the process.

We acknowledge the countless hours you spent weeping bitterly into your keyboard when your essays just didn't meet the perceived notions of our standards, and we commend your efforts. Find solace in the fact that since you chose to be a high school student and not research a cure for cancer during your free time, the quality of your essays never mattered to begin with. 

We sincerely wish you the best of luck at the second-rate university you will attend. You will receive an equally fulfilling experience and education elsewhere, anyway.

Especially since our classes had no more than say 35 to a class so it was an intimate setting.

Night classes had more students in my age range and/or older. That helped a bit.  But all in all, I was able to identify with them more as I was once them.

To clarify the differences, the Bolsheviks went with a hierarchy democracy that they copied from revolutionary France that copied it from ancient Athens.  The idea is local councils are elected and they appoint representatives in higher councils, there was no election for Lenin he was appointed by those elected in local soviets (if you still can't grasp the concept imagine if every city council in the USA voted to appointed the US president), the idea is it is democratic because those appointing are elected officials.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","It started in 2008 when I got my gaming PC back then. It's specs were:

Core 2 quad q9600 @ 2.6 Ghz;
Pretty nice thermaltake copper cpu heat sink;
2GB DDR2 ram;
nVidia 9600 GT;
Lame Foxconn motherboard with only 2 slots for ram and not listed on their website so no drivers at all.

I didn't know a lot about computers back then, living in Bulgaria so this PC seemed good bang for the buck. Fast forward a year full of glorious PC gaming and the video card broke down. Luckily it was still in warranty and they didn't have this model so they sent me a more powerful ATI HD 4850. After that I got another 2gb stick of ram, because games staters to require 3,4 GB of ram with the graphics turned up. And I was set for 2 more years. Then my PC started to make a rumbling noise and it turned out that the fan for the cooler had broken so I bought another one. A year later the HD 4850 was just not enough to run the then modern titles so I got a huge upgrade - Sapphire HD 6950 2gb version with a new power supply since it requires more power. And all games were running really great. And this was my setup until 1 month ago when I decided that I need more ram since games I really enjoy like train fever or watch dogs simply didn't run well on 4 gigs so I went and bought a used higher-grade 775 socket motherboard and 2gb more ram. So I'm at home switching the motherboards and I find that my cpu cooler just isn't compatible with the motherboard since it stays in a weird position and I was out of money. So I decided to ghetto up my build and used zip-ties and a piece of wood to tie the cooler to the processor. :D And to my surprise it actually worked and it worked so good that temps were down 10 degrees from the usual. I realized by then that I'm going to have to change the PC sooner or later so I decided why the hell not I'll overclock the processor. And this is how my PC is in its current state:

750W Power Supply;
Core 2 Quad q9600 overclocked to 3.00 Ghz;
6GB DDR2 ram;
Sapphire HD 6950 2gb;
Gigabyte GA-X38-DQ6 motherboard;
500gb green WD and 1TB black WD hard drive;

 And so concludes the story of my PC which can actually still play new titles at acceptable frame rates and popular ones like world of tanks-30-40fps, league of legends - smooth 60, both on very high/ultra. Thanks for hosting the giveaway!

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","If the person's feelings are that they are scared to walk home alone in the rain at night, possibly for miles, then they might feel like they don't have a choice. And that's what matters. Not whether you think they had a choice, not even whether they really did have a choice. If they feel like they didn't have a choice, then the choice has been effectively taken away from them.

And there is probably a line at some point where it's no longer reasonable for the person to feel like they don't have a choice. But if you drive someone miles away from their house in the rain, and then tell them you won't give them a ride back unless they have sex with you, and that person is a girl who is scared of walking several miles in the rain, because she doesn't have an umbrella and she doesn't feel safe walking alone that far (which in my opinion are obviously reasonable fears), then undisputedly you have effectively taken away that person's choice.","1427846732"

"DFO","t5_2s417","Where are you getting your numbers from? Show me how i'm understating the impact on farmers, overstating damage to players and overestimating how effective gold farmers are? You are just touting random shit. Of course there will be impact on farmers. Will it matter in the long run? No. With reason we can make these assumptions. Is there a gold farming problem in asian releases of dfo? Yes. Is there a problem for nearly every game. Yes of course. The difference is most games have much more efficient systems in place to counter these problems. 

    and completely ignoring external factors like banning, gold sinks, alt characters, and pvp.    

Well considering there is a gold farming problem in the asian DFO's and just about every game that has these things, it's not something  a shit broken system like FP is going to solve. That is especially more so when global dfo has a measly 10 people working in the office. Do you really think they will have the manpower to ban swiftly? Of course not. Let's be real here. 

    It is not just some anti-player limiter that's only meant for Koreans that westerners are somehow above.   

Besides putting words in my mouth, this statement is so absurd that it's humorous. Westerners above koreans? Laughable strawman.

I don't know how people have a hard time grasping a simple concept that certain systems thrive well in certain areas. Just because that is the case doesn't mean they will do well in other areas. Just because FP is working okay in asian countries, does not mean it will work well or be well received in other markets. This is eco 101 shit. Take some time to research the market you are entering. Everybody wants this game to do well, but when you turn off a large portion of your consumer base the first day they play, well that's a pretty dumb plan of attack. 

Do you honestly believe FP system is strictly for gold selling/botter countermeasures? No because that would be a gigantic failure of a system. There are other reasons it's in place, and those reasons are  mostly irrelevant here in the west, until a statement is made that explains otherwise. I'm not a veteran DFO player, so i'm giving insight based upon that. I can glean several reasons the FP system might be in place, and i've read other people's reasons, and they all culminate to the same answer. It's a terrible solution to the problems. 

I don't have inside information though. I don't know what the companies who implement this system have in mind when they use it, but what I can tell you is it is not strictly for countering gold sellers and stabilizing the economy, because that would be a very poor solution. Some transparency from the companies would be great to help newer players cope with the shit broken system at the very least.

I think we are overpopulated in our prisons already. The problem with the prison gap isn't that we under-incarcerate women, but that we over-incarcerate men.

They had five beers on, flight allows you four, and I enjoyed two and ended up ordering a pint of the nitro black. Most of the styles they currently have on aren't really my cup of tea though, so I'm not surprised I didn't enjoy them all. I've heard exciting things about large amounts of space for them to really experiment with their beers, and I think taking on Andy Schwartz as the new head brewer will mean good things for them in the future.

It's *exactly* about modern technology, and it's not about escaping from fires when they happen so much as it is about ensuring that fires don't happen at all, and and about systems that put them out and prevent them from spreading when things go so wrongly that they do.

That said, the fact that people have *battery* operated smoke detectors (rather than the kind that plug into the electrical system directly), and appliances that *CAN* cause fires is kindof an atrocity.  Those things are easy to make in a fashion that they can't cause fires.

In short, we absolutely have the technology to remove fires as anything other than a absolute critical failure.  Instead, I see and hear firetrucks heading to massive blazes *every single day*, and that should not be the case in a developed city in the 21st century.","1427846737"

They aren't trying to replace the shipping infrastructure they have - it would be unbelievably expensive. It will be akin to the $3.99 ""1 day shipping"" option they have now, but instead it will likely be more money.

The thing is both the FAA and Amazon have a vested interest in not having these things fall from the sky and kill people. It's unlikely that they will release something that has risks even marginally close to the risks involved in 3 ton trucks driving around. 

The point, though, is that if you compare the risks, it would be *incredibly* difficult to be as dangerous as a truck. Can you imagine how many drones would have to hit people in the head to kill 39 people? Drones would have to be purposefully flying where humans are walking or driving, just to start. They would then have to be falling out of the sky at a pretty regular rate. Finally, they would have to fall very often right above a person. None of these is statistically likely. The point is that the danger *starts out* being way less than what we already have, simply because these are small objects not often directly above a person. It's not nearly dangerous enough to be preventing the company from trying to make it work.

Frankly, I'd be more worried about making sure the damn things are quiet. I can just imagine being woken up by BBBBBBZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ every morning.

That's only true from a deterministic viewpoint. Not only is not literally untrue, it's *provably* untrue. Indeed, most of the history of pollution is predicated on no one thinking before acting. Those people certainly effected controlled what they were not measuring, even if they were not fully aware of it or did not care. Perhaps you mean something different than what your words suggest.

Regardless, I can't begin to see how the Kardashev scale is relevant to this discussion. It sounds to me like you mentioned it just so you could be seen mentioning it.

We can absolutely control our environmental impact without measuring it. Measuring it is *better,* but not *necessary*. We *know* that certain human activities are damaging, and just be reducing those, we make a positive difference. You don't need to measure that to know it. You certainly don't need to measure it in comparison to anything like the Kardashev scale for those results.

Read the Imperial Engineering Corps official report on the Death Star incident - the rebels exploited a design flaw in the structure that gave their torpedo a direct path to the station's core, initiating the massive hypermatter explosion that destroyed it. It didn't have to ""melt"" any part of the  superstructure, steel beam or otherwise. Nobody serious in academia supports any such inside job theory, nor have they for decades, because the evidence just isn't there. 

Furthermore, *every* available source from the period shows that this flaw was not present in the plans that Palpatine signed off on, but were introduced later by a subcommittee headed by Grand Moff Tarkin to reconcile engineering problems that arise during the construction phase.

It could certainly be argued that Palpatine shouldn't have delegated that task, but the man did have an entire galaxy to run. Not to mention, as we now know, a massive extra-galactic invasion to plan a defense for - a task he never lived to finish, to the next generation's regret. 

Not that i expect to be very popular for mentioning that last, since so many ideologues and slaves to dogma refuse to accept the evidence about Palpatine's true reasons for orchestrating his infamous coup, and it's connection to the Yuzhan Vong invasion that wouldn't occur for another six decades.

"AskVet","t5_2sx1m","I think seeing a vet in person is always superior to the internet (says the person on the internet). You can give someone all of the information in the world through the web but nothing beats actually getting your hands on an animal to do a physical exam and a face to face conversation between vet and owner.

Secondly, as for cost (I'm responding to some of your comments in your thread with /u/Urgullibl), where are you getting a cost of $5.50/day from? How much would you be feeding each cat every day? When you factor in your time and effort with food costs, I would argue that it's probably going to be about the same cost (although $5.50 seems a little pricey? I could be wrong...)

Finally, as for your inherent distrust of the pet food industry. Why? What makes you not trust them? (This is an honest question, feel free to PM it to me if you're worried about bad feedback) I've got several friends who feel the same way but none of them can give me a reason why they are distrustful. Hill's and Purina are responsible for a vast majority of all of the research done in veterinary nutrition. The diet that your veterinary nutritionist is going to give you is going to be based off of research done by these companies (most likely). Every food product (even the small brands) formulates their food to the nutrition standards established by feeding trials conducted by Hill's and Purina (they're pretty much the only companies that spend the money on actual feeding trials for their food products). Obviously I trust them. But I'm genuinely curious why you don't.","1427846741"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","*It was the pear soda*. Walking down the corridor, I tried to mentally go back. What had changed? All I could come up with was the drink. She had struck me as different from the moment I laid eyes on her. Her hair was different. Expensive. The other nurses had simple hair cuts. Easily maintained. A thousand-dollar hair cut is wasted on a nurse. A normal one, that is.

""Drink up,"" she said. And she looked at me as I drank up. That also surprised me. She was in no hurry. The other nurses acted as if I were a dial to be adjusted in a big, complicated machine. As I poured down the pear soda she smiled, and the next thing I could remember was waking up. And feeling *different*.

""You're good to go,"" the doctor had said. I didn't understand. Yesterday I was dying, and today I was 'good to go'? I tried quizzing him, but he stuttered some complicated nonsense and couldn't stop fidgeting. As I walked off he looked at me as if he'd never seen a patient walk before in his life.

Something had *changed*, and the only thing that made any sense was the soda. Which didn't actually make much sense. How could a soda cure bowel cancer? Yet, I wasn't one to argue. As strange as it was, I had gotten my life back.

The first thing I did was to call my father. I had expected him to be ecstatic. His son had just walked out of a death sentence, after all. But no. He was silent for the longest time, before asking me about a queer story from my childhood. I had left my Jimbo--a stuffed monkey--on a ferry while on holiday, and treated it as a class A emergency. In my grief I had called the police, and later received a stern warning about the proper classification of 'emergencies'. I remembered, I told him. ""Really?"" he said and probed me further, ""how about the time we took you to the zoo? You fed the animal and it took your cap, you know, the ..."" 'camel', I answered. *Why was he asking me this?* Then I heard the strangest thing. Here I was, alive and well, and I could hear my father sulking. Had he been glad to be rid of me? Was there something I didn't know? ""Take care,"" he told me, between sobs, and hung up. I was more than a bit annoyed, and wasn't paying attention when I walked into traffic.

The driver was drinking some sort of soda. I would have laughed, if I had had the chance. He had a week-old beard, a dirty cap, and was drinking from a soda can when he came towards me at full throttle. He looked as if frozen in time. I could only compare it to the feeling one gets when getting your tongue stuck on a pole in winter. The ice bites and tears. I had expected hot fiery combustion, but I felt kissed by icy cold death instead. My skin tore. The second the truck hit me a frost ran through me like nothing I'd experienced before. The impact was less of a surprise than the shock I got when I looked at my arm. The skin had broke, but I wasn't bleeding. Cold hard steel was exposed where muscle and fat should be. When the driver had stumbled his way to me, he must have been quite as surprised, for he couldn't keep his drink in his shaking fingers. Standing directly over me, he spilled the contents. And then I felt quite different. Sparks of electricity surged through me. I was being fried, and I could taste it. There could be no mistake; *it was pear soda*.","1427846741"

If he isn't interested in pursuing that with you now due to your pregnancy, I don't think he's really worth the miles anyway. Not saying he isn't entitled to feel that way, but I'm just saying there are guys out there who will give you that amazing passion *and* also take the entire package deal with you!

I had the same issues when I fell pregnant this time around. I had to make some really hard choices initially and I have also had moments of 'if it wasn't for this pregnancy, this would have worked better or I wouldn't have lost this' and so forth. I always felt guilty for feeling that way, but acknowledgement of those feelings and knowing I was making the right decision was helpful. 

Also, in hindsight these things tend to matter less. The loneliness during pregnancy sucks though. I experienced this with both of my pregnancies, so I can relate there. Self empowerment will help free you from that sense of needing fulfillment from anyone other than yourself. 

You are not a bad person. These are all normal feelings and don't contribute towards your capabilities or potential as a Mum whatsoever.

But in all honesty, a lot of the young up and coming guys absolutely won't go against Vince because they're afraid of getting heat and potentially losing their spot. So in all honesty Roman's hands were really tied there and there wasn't much he could do. He could go out there selling the effects of the match like crazy but he'd get the ire of Vince by doing that even if we loved him selling the match.

Though the only guys I can think of in recent years who legitimately stood up to Vince and creative are Roman, Seth and Dean. I believe Seth talked about this with Jericho on Jericho's podcast. If they didn't like something, they'd confront the people who wanted to run with it and tell them that it's a terrible idea and that they should change it. But I do doubt Roman would have the balls to do that now, though Seth might considering he's one of Triple H's golden boys and seems to be pretty well protected by Trips.

Ive noticed that, when Im with other males, I tend to relax and feel like Im in a family, full of brothers. I feel influenced by their humor, jokes, stories and relaxed outlook on life.

I also have a high IQ (I speak German, Spanish and soon Chinese) so, me seeing to many details also affects me. I analyze everything.

I will follow your advice.

Thank you!","1427846745"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There's a lot of controversy about Nielsen ratings and how accurately they capture the demographic of viewers, but that's a different discussion. 

First, ""horrible"" and ""amazing"" are very subjective terms. A show you and your friends consider horrible may be widely loved by others and vice versa. The content of a show isn't decided by Nielsen ratings, rather, a show staying on air or not usually is heavily influenced by viewership and ratings. 

To a television network, shows are viewed as potential income, and that's it. They ""compete"" with other shows on different networks, so that's why some time-slots move around a bit. If NBC's show has half as many viewers as the competing CBS show, NBC will probably cancel that show in hopes of replacing it with another that will gain more viewers, and thus they can charge advertisers more.

However, TV today is moving away from this model since Netflix, Hulu and similar services are becoming prevalent. ","1427846746"
"confession","t5_2qo2a","I agree with AAL314 on his points about looks aren't everything.   Some people are simply lucky and win at the genetic lottery, (being absolutely beautiful of any race), and others have their gifts given through strength of character, intelligence or even patience and kindness.   

The world of people will always look down at one group or another for things they cant control and it's never fair.  Discrimination is sadly part of being human.  The best of us can look past it, the worst can't.  The best we can do is improve the traits that we can control, mainly through education and hard work.  These traits are what I find absolutely necessary for real commitment.

I did not mulligan today (but I did mulligan the previous 2 days while my quest log was not full).

I completed a single quest, no new quest. I relogged, no new quest. It appears that even if any of your current 3 quests were rerolled this will not work (i.e. rerolling does not ""clear"" the buffer, but rather if any current quest has ever been rerolled it invalidates your ability to queue up hidden quests).

So apparently this hidden quest buffer is only for those who go MIA for 4+ days.

The more likely thing is the backlash of this law on the state is going to be so great that they repeal it or amend it to protect gay people. I believe the governor is already making moves to do this as a lot of companies are making moves against Indiana. Hell they might be banned from college athletics next year. We will see if Indianans like Jesus or basketball more. 

The other thing that could happen is this will open the flood gates. This is a religious freedom bill not a Christian or freedom bill. This is Mormons practicing polygamy, this is Rastafarians smoking refer wherever they please, this is satanists opening up sacrificial goat slaughter stores next to elementary schools. When all this happens the Christians will be begging to out the genie back in the bottle.","1427846749"

Owa is strong as hell and specializes in setting the edge against the run and having a relentless motor.

That said there are many different arenas where people are celebrated simply for the positions they hold rather than for critical thinking. You won't see very many sports fans or partisan voters encouraging someone who agrees with them to think about anything any more than they already have.

Sure that kind of thinking doesn't fly in academia, but there are many environments where it does thrive. I think for most people it would take more effort to find a place that rewarded critical thinking than it would take them to find a place that didn't care so long as you held the same beliefs as everyone else even if you don't count religious settings.

"Barca","t5_2s561","Oh definitely deservers more minutes, he performs really well when playing, and is a very solid all around center-back.

The second question would be, **is it better for the team if he plays more often?**

As great as Bartra is, his strengths aren't **as strong** as our other player's strengths. Mathieu and Mascherano complement Pique better (who's untouchable the way he has been playing recently).

That being said, Bartra is as close to ideal to have (for now) on the bench, since he can fit in for basically any defender on the team (even if there's generally no need to play him anywhere other than CB or -maybe- RB). 

Personally, a less than stellar Pique, Mascherano or Mathieu deserve to be benched by Bartra, who if nothing else is quite consistent in his performances, and has a lot of fire.","1427846760"

The T2 has very weak armor and should be played like a scout.. And scouting happens to be the most difficult role in the game. You can't play it the same way you played your T1 tanks. Google a bunch of scouting guides/videos

Number 1 rule with any high mobility light tank is to make it to lategame. Be cautious at first, scout and back off. Light tanks are the strongest tanks in the game when there are only a handful of players left.","1427846761"

Greed brought this product into our view. Whether it works is up to the market to decide now but something is being attempted.

Quite frankly I can't see anyone making this argument about Apple when they go buy their new laptop. But the idea that a few millionaires are getting richer while providing a service seems to annoy them while they spend time making all sorts of billionaires and billion-dollar companies more valuable.

You think they all sit around and go ""oh, someone is making that product, I'll not interfere even though I think there's a space on the market because I don't want to be greedy""? Did you get an iPad because Apple saw that Microsoft made a tablet first and decided not to innovate because they'd look greedy? Did you get one of the most iconic brands for smartphones and tablets  , shaping all other companies (go find me a flip-phone instead of a solid vaguely-brick-shaped solid, monolith phone) out of pure altruistic concern?

"Thetruthishere","t5_2sntx","I've always had a sense of impending doom in the woods. People say they feel at home in the woods. Not me.

It's not because I'm unadjusted, either. I did a three-week backpacking trip before and it was beautiful, and I hiked dozens and dozens of miles, and saw nature in a whole new way. I go camping a lot. I don't hate the woods, and I can respect them for their beauty, I just don't find them welcoming in any way. I find them unilaterally foreboding.

Whenever someone in our group falls behind or gets ahead of the group I'm always inwardly worried they'll disappear and try to put myself in the middle so as to not let them out of my sight.

In the woods I feel like I'm profoundly not alone, but definitely not among friends either. I think people who say they've ""mastered"" the woods are naive. No matter how much of a rugged mountain man or survivalist you are, the woods will never be your friends. Things watch you. It's like going into someone else's house.

Maybe this is why deforestation has never bothered me. I'm encouraged by Johnny Appleseed, too. I feel like trees are meant to come and go. Old ancient forests where the trees rule the scene are just eerie. I feel like something is breathing down my neck in the woods, and making my hair stand on end. It's as though I'm being allowed to tromp through their territory for generosity, but not to take my presence there for granted.

The woods give me the perpetual feeling of an angry farmer not afraid to blow off a few shotgun rounds when you step over the edge of their property. 

It doesn't help that the great majority of creepy things I hear about happen in wilderness areas just as often as in city areas, only in wilderness you're less likely to run into a friendly presence willing to intervene.","1427846765"

Whenever the crazy-huge Sentinel destroyed Genosha, she was the sole survivor of the building that collapsed on her while she was ""teaching"" her Telepathy Class. When the building went down, her secondary mutation erupted forth and saved her by concealing her body in organic diamond...but at the same time, she was extremely traumatized by the event and when the dug her out, she was in her diamond form and carrying the *very* dead body of the student she had hated most; she continued on to tell everyone her name and how she will be a credit to her species, and handed her over to the EMTs so they could ""make her feel better"".

It's my theory that the secondary mutation came forward not only to save her physically from the building collapsing on her, but emotionally/psychologically as well by blocking off any emotional/psychological pain that she would have felt from the destruction of Genosha...and as a Telepath, in order to completely cut off her ability to feel, the secondary mutation would also have to block her primary mutation from working so that she truly couldn't empathize with people by picking up their emotions.

Second, it's easy to play some pretty facile game where we look at the repeal of Glass-Steagall and act like that's somehow causative.  Though that completely ignores the major failures that brought the financial markets to the brink were things Lehman, Bear Stearns, and AIG (which had somehow become the world's biggest prop desk)--you know, things that weren't even commercial banks and wouldn't have been affected by Glass-Steagall.  

Things like lack of regulation or backing for triparty repo (or perhaps overregulation driving shadowbanking activity depending on your economic views), the lack of a vehicle to resolve liquidity problems within major financial institutions or wind them down because of the deadweight loss of the bankruptcy process and loss of value of SiFis as a going-concern, and a fundamental misunderstanding of systematic risk w/r/t housing markets were deeper causes of crisis.","1427846766"

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","McGregor said it best, I think, when he said that Aldo was a poor kid from the favella's and he was a poor kids from the streets of Ireland.  Scumbags and thugs come in all nationalities.  

Also, you seem to have a short memory.  Every time a Diaz brother/Melendez/Shields fight happens, those guys show their ass and act like scumbags and thugs (although the Anderson/Nick fight really shocked me how polite and respectful Nick was in reference to Anderson).  They get called on it every single time by the MMA community.

If you think about it logically though, **most** fighters do not come from good areas or good backgrounds (BJ Penn, Rich Franklin, Randy Couture, Brendan Schaub, Lyoto Machida and several others excluded).  **Most** fighters fight because they have to and have no other real life skills to get a decent job.  I don't discount the fact that **most** fighters have heart and genuinely love to fight, but I think many would do something different if they could.  While people can cry all they want about the state of the economy in the US, Brazil has things MUCH worse.  Most of Ireland does as well.  Fighters from very poor areas will have fans like everyone else, and those fans will generally act the way they normally act.  

For what it's worth, I don't think anyone would have to point out that most of the commenters/question askers from the crowd were scumbags and thugs.  I only enjoyed the conference for two reasons.  1. seeing a Brazilian getting the same treatment that every other non-Brazilian fighter gets while in Brazil.  2. seeing the sheer joy and childlike wonderment of McGregor during the whole thing.  He is usually businesslike trying to sell the fight while talking shit.  But, he was genuinely proud (for better or worse) during the whole thing.  He is very proud to be Irish.  Aldo (and every other Brazilian fighter) is proud to be Brazilian.  Very few Japanese fighters in the UFC even mention the fact that they are from Japan.  If you stop to think about it, very few American fighters bother to mention anything about Murica (as an American, I feel that I can use this slander without incurring any wrath) either.  It's actually nice to see people proud of where they are from, as long as it doesn't get obnoxious...which Ireland and Brazil clearly have yet to master. 

I think the one commenter from the crowd that brought up the fact that McGregor is simply pissing Aldo off to the point where he is going to dismantle McGregor and try to seriously hurt him has a great point.  I tend to enjoy McGregor's shit talk, but him grabbing the belt was entirely unnecessary.  He has crossed a line between selling the fight and simply being obnoxious several times.  This is what happens when a fight that isn't even happening for 3 months gets a world tour press conference run.  The fighters just want to fight.  They are being forced to face each other all the time with all of this nonsense and tensions are clearly running high.  As others have pointed out, this is as much the UFC's fault as anyone else's.  I think if McGregor wins, it will simply be that...a win.  If Aldo wins, he is going to try to seriously hurt McGregor to send a message to the next loud mouth that tries to disHespect (sorry, I had to) him.  I can't say that I blame him.","1427846771"

I am not asking for the right to slaughter a pig in a synagogue or mosque or to relieve myself on your ""holy"" book. But I will not be told I can't eat pork, or that I cannot mock religion. I, too, have strong convictions and beliefs and value the Enlightenment above any priesthood or any sacred fetish-object. I often find myself disgusted with the sermons of Billy Graham and other religious leaders. However, these same principles of mine also prevent me from wreaking random violence on the nearest church, or kidnapping a Muslim at random and holding him hostage, or violating diplomatic immunity by attacking the embassy or the envoys of even the most despotic Islamic state, or making a moronic spectacle of myself threatening blood and fire to faraway individuals who may have hurt my feelings.

As for calories I just made sure I ate as much as I could in the morning so it would be easier later in the day, hence the heavily calorific shake which had about 1600 calories. One thing that helped me was at every meal, rather than drinking water or other drinks I drank whole milk, I try to buy a pint of whole milk after gym workouts also for those extra calories. It's wonderful for putting on weight since I find it hard to eat. My estimate would be around 3000 calories daily, but that is a very very rough estimate. If you want to put on weight, just eat, eat anything, who cares about what is at our stage, we just need to put on weight. Eat until you're full and just keep eating, I know it's hard but it'll get easier, I promise.

Nope.   Disable iMessage on your iPhone first though.

Yup.

No.  2G only.   Your phone supports:

GSM850, GSM900, GSM1800, GSM1900, UMTS900 (B8), UMTS2100 (B1)

Of which, only GSM1900 is used by T-Mobile.  I'd suggest you get another phone.

The campaign raises awareness for girls and funds initiatives through Plan. Last year Plan helped 164 million people (80 million of which were children) get access to the basic necessities.

Sometimes I worry I made the wrong decision; I'm dreading the first few newborn months, and I'm already missing my independent lifestyle. But I have to believe that everyone who says having kids is awesome isn't a total liar, and remind myself that I generally really like slightly older kids and that my husband and I are great together especially when working on big projects (like raising a kid)!

I can't tell you what to do. But I took a leap of faith, and I'm hoping I made the right decision.

 When you critique a game, especially one with previous sequels or games their is nothing wrong with comparing it to previous games.

That being said, a game also has to stand on its own and you have to critique those aspects independently. 

OP simply combined both critiques as are many other people.

Except houses can also be built, thus expanding the supply.  If housing prices go up, housing construction also goes up, and prices can stay roughly normal.  Only in areas where expansion is constrained (either because transportation infrastructure doesn't exist or new housing can't be constructed) do you see prices rise precipitously.  And in these regions, constraining lending doesn't matter, because the only people bidding on the skyrocketing prices already had substantial wealth.  The folks that lose out are the ones pursuing new housing starts in other geographically less-constrained regions.

&gt; Our government has decided to make sure banks make money by guaranteeing the loans banks make to students.

We actually stopped doing that back in 2010, and now administer loans directly.  It's one reason why debt relief has gained steam.  Student loan repayment is functionally equivalent to taxation, given that both are inescapable and go into the same coffers.

&gt; That's irrelevant if banks won't give you the loan in the first place.

Private unsubsidized bank loans exist, believe it or not.  You can get a student loan that is completely divorced from any federal backing or subsidy.

&gt; As opposed to assuming the government is good?

As opposed to assigning moral alignment to a morally neutral bureaucracy.","1427846784"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","""I love you but I'm not sure I want to be with you"" I'm sorry to say, usually means I don't love you. Love is about powerful feelings, one of them being a deep sense of commitment and friendship down the line. Part of that comes from truly, deeply caring about the other person, and not just what the other person does for you. Once people get to the 2+ year mark, when the thrill of the novelty of the other person wears off, people either feel ready for it or they don't and then they bail. It might be that you're not deeply compatible, or it might have nothing to do with you, might be tension between what your BF has been told by television and movies have told him this should be like, might be that he doesn't want to have to work for it. Think about the things he's said. If it's one or three then it's over. If it's two, and he doesn't make a decisions before long, he's still being unfair to you, and it's probably going to be something he has to learn by that thing he's been told should be there just not being there again and again and again. Nothing you can do. It might be the first thing in an even older relationship; people, especially young people, transform as they experience, and what they change into isn't always right for the other person.

His thought was that if he tried to copy the melody, all he would make is a shitty version of the original.  So he keeps working at his own melody until it captures that original *feeling*.

In order to do this, obviously you need to understand *why* the original melody worked.  You need to figure out the scale, the kind of patterns, and the techniques used (call and response, etc).  But after you do this try taking this knowledge and messing with your own riffs while having your only goal to capture whatever you *felt* when you heard the original track.","1427846790"

This process would repeat itself fifteen more times over the course of the Loptyrian Empire, for it was the death of Galle XVII in the year 648 that would spell the end of the empire.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","Well, I think that is too general. Someone who ""believes"" in gravity is not on the same footing as someone who ""believes"" that 12 leprechauns live in his eyeballs.

Aside from the obvious aspect of varying degrees of certainty - beliefs that emcompass evidence are different from beliefs that are solely faith based. I suspect that if we examine this issue more thoroughly, we would be able to identify other kinds of ""belief"" in this context. 

If a belief is simply defined as ""something I accept as true"", then... I am defining my opinions in a binary manner. I will seek to in some way convince or convert others to my point of view, as I will consider it ""correct"". 

This no longer adequately describes my personal philosophy of life in many ways... but if I think about it (and I have not been solipsistic,  and I'm sorry if I gave that impression) - we could use a practical moral belief... um... that I believe that homosexuals are entitled to equal rights, and that religious discrimination is harmful. That seems to be a good example. 

In thinking about this, where I would have previously categorized this as a belief position, I really see it in a very different light now. It is not about right and wrong, or an absolute and defensible position; but rather it is a position born of an acknowledgement of society and history of the evolution of human rights, and about the observation of personal suffering. It's not a dogmatic position, but an organic and evolving opinion based on a living reality.

So you see, in this way defining it as a binary ""true/false"" belief is so over-simplistic so as to not really apply. Something more simple like ""I am alive"" doesn't really do either I think... as it is a simple reference to an observation, and not really a position or opinion.","1427846792"

This is stupid. Being gay is not dependent on you wanting to have a gay marriage. You want to have a gay marriage *because* you're gay *and* because you want to get married despite being gay. There are plenty of gays out there who do not want to be married, and in fact (like /u/Hurrah_for_Karamazov, the OP in the original thread) is himself gay and because of his religious conviction, does not want to get married.

&gt; Let's say there's a caterer that specializes in Jewish marriage ceremonies. So they serve typical Jewish foods and decorations. It is discriminatory if they refuse to serve non-Jewish people, but not discriminatory to offer a Jewish- oriented product.

That's exactly the point you're denying right there. replace ""Jewish"" with ""Catholic"" and ""non-Jewish"" with ""gay"" and it's the same argument we're making. You're talking in circles here...","1427846794"

That is, if you have two collections of numbers, and you can map each number in one collection to a number in the other collection, and vice versa, then those collections can be said to be the same size. This allows you one way to compare infinities.

Oddly enough, this means that natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4...), even numbers, and ratios (1/1, 1/2, ..., 2/1, 2/2, ..., 3/1, 3/2, ... ...) are all the same size, but decimals are bigger. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elvOZm0d4H0) explains it pretty well.","1427846794"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).

It's also important to note that he did not validate your feelings. Validation just shows that he understands and acknowledges your feelings without necessarily agreeing with them. Instead he basically implied that you are not being ""strong"". This is a very important aspect to relationships, and can be very damaging to the self esteem if you are not validated by your partner.

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","Thanks! Good point about the hat. I kinda forgot about it, just selected something good enough and moved on. But yeah, something's not right there. Also need to put some stank on the pattern, little boring with all straight 8ths and 16ths. 

The snare I love though, at least in the intro. Something about the snap and width just tickles me. I sampled it from an uncluttered portion of [Dabrye - The Lish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYCwx54AGUg), his percussion treatments and glitchy stuff have been a huge influence for years... however, there's a second snare layered on top that comes in at :45, is that what you mean? I'm really conflicted about it. It's got a bit of delay and it adds a little thickness, but I think I need to get rid of it or pick a new sample. I'm probably just going to axe it now that you bring it up...

Anyway, thanks again, good notes :)","1427846802"

"AldnoahZero","t5_31e15","Keep in mind though, Muv Luv is primarily a Visual Novel, so expect it to focus mainly on the relationship (and even dating) aspects of the game. In addition, the only part that was adapted into an anime was a spin off, Total Eclipse, so you may be a little confused if you simply jump right in. If you don't want do go through 3 whole VNs to get the main storyline, here's a quick summary of each part (spoilers ahoy!)




SPOILERS:

Muv Luv Extra: The beginning of the series. Thought this was a VN about mecha? Ha! Welcome to school life, where you meet girls, date them and get into wacky hijinks, all with every highschool trope applied. Our MC is Takeru, our everyday guy that he made a promise of marriage to a girl in the past, and in the end, must find out who he truly loves. While this part has nothing to do with war or mechs, it sets the basis of the characters, introducing you to who is who.

Muv Luv Unlimited: Our MC wakes up one day in his bedroom, but with one difference: Everything is destroyed, the city is in ruins, and most importantly, there's a carcass of a mech right outside his house. After getting over the shock of what the hell just happened and messing around with the mech (because playing with a broken down mech only gets this fun), he wanders around before being arrested by some soldiers, and is brought back to their base camp. There, he realises some of these soldiers are his friends, including his love interests and even teachers. However, none of them can remember who he is, so he decides to keep his mouth shut as he is conscripted as a soldier (and eventually a pilot) and finds out just what the hell happened: In the alternate world, during the lunar landing in the Cold War, mankind discovered a hostile life form on the moon dubbed the BETA. After slaughtering what troops Earth sent up there to try and stop them, the BETA make planetfall on Earth and begin to strip mine its resources, mercilessly slaughtering its people and armies. While normally Earth's forces would have the upper hand, especially when it comes to air superiority, the BETA, who despite being organic life forms and almost no technology to speak of, have the ability to use lasers in their specialized units. These lasers are so accurate, that aircraft, missiles, and even satellites in low orbit are vulnerable to attack, rendering most air support unviable. As a response, mankind invents the TSFs, mechs whose superior speed and melee capabilities allow them to dive into the BETA hordes and tear apart their troops, while being able to fly at a low enough altitude to avoid laser fire (at closer ranges anyway). At the end of Unlimited, I won't say what happens specifically, but shit goes down, and the human leaders make the decision to abandon Earth, nuking whatever remains of the habitable zones to prevent the BETA from obtaining their resources and leaving those who were left behind to fend for themselves. TL;DR, BAD ENDING FOR EVERYONE.

Muv Luv Alternative: The finale to the series, Takeru wakes up and finds himself back in his room. He initially thinks that everything was a dream, but soon finds out that he was sent back in time to the beginning of Unlimited, but with one key difference: he remembers everything that took place in Unlimited, including the BETA, the people he met, his TSF training and most importantly, how it all ended. Unable to accept the ending of Unlimited, he is determined to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself. Everything is on the line as Takeru tries to change the outcome of the war. He won't accept any more deaths, any more meaningless sacrifices, any more tentacle rapes.

You could actually do a LOT with the pre transforming story. There's a whole tale to be told about how he got to the point where he was ready to transform because of:

* Depression setting in and he wants to end it, the transformation gives him a new lease on life and a whole new perspective.

* The character finally accepted that they aren't who they were born as. They either science themselves into the new form or do some kind of elective science procedure at the hands of some way out there mad scientist.

*  Some mix involving both where the human is built up as a very upset individual and in a bit of a rut. They decide to break out by trying some kind of magic ritual/science procedure to help them find a new perspective but something goes wrong and now they're a muscular panther lady with guy bits. 

*Guy gets visited by some sort of divine entity who makes him into this form because it's his ""perfect self"" and instructs him to use the form to some end or another.

There are a TON of ways you could go on with this character and I'm actually kinda looking forward to whatever you come up with.

Sorry to put it so frankly but if sex is important to you then you have to walk away from this one. You Americans seem to have this semi religious zeal that you have to make it work no matter what- that you love each other - that sex is somehow 'bad' and a silly reason to have issues over.

Sex is one of the central pillars of an intimate relationship.

Just walk, it might be an uncomfortable conversation but you ""don't need to make it work"" - you can just go. ","1427846807"

However, we have to respect the juries decision and carry out the appeals process regardless of how we feel about the case.

I do agree with the reasonal doubt. I wasnt there though, and this article sure as fuck doesnt offer enough evidence for any one of us to know either way.

My issue is I am a cynical prick who has had enough contact with humanity to know that people are fucked up. the fact that she went to a dumpster and not the hospital tells me she is probably guilty.

Should she be convicted? depends on the actual evidence and not some vague fucking article from overseas.

So I am on the fence about this as far as the conviction is concerned.

But honestly, and I'm sure I'm not alone here, they need to shake up a helluva lot more than just ""guns"" for the next game. I know this is unrealistic, but as much as a surprise and delight the original game was; that is also what they need to recapture for the next game. 

It seems unrealistic, to me at least, because the original was just something out of nowhere in what it did and how we played. The different guns, and endless ways to acquire them. It was a grind of sorts, but nowhere near the grind of BL2. Meaning, you could find anything almost anywhere at any time in the original. You felt rewarded for checking vending machines and such. BL2 = dungeons = bosses with loot table. 

Now it feels tired to me, the formula that is. It's been very well refined by this point, and the next game will definitely have to take a big leap. Almost MMO in scope, in my honest opinion. But only just ""almost."" I'm just not clever enough to come to a clear idea as to what this ""almost"" may be.

Machines would not have any motivations, and would not spontaneously have one.  An AI would not become self-aware unless it's actively running - meaning it's executing instructions and using up CPU time.  It would not be actively running unless it has instructions to run.  If it isn't actively running, it cannot become self-aware.  It would just be pieces of metal and semiconductors, literally.

The idea that anyone can avoid being objectified is an empty morality trick to remove agency and independence from every person.  You don't need to be protected from the objectifiers, you don't need to live in fear.

I agree it's inconsistent, and the cracks in that dichotomy are starting to widen as modern feminism excavates and reinvents the same debate that has been happening for fifty years.","1427846817"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Yup, I remember! While I'm at it, here are *another* few things to consider in the context of your post there:

- Say that *x* := 0.00000000...00001 *were* a legitimate real number. How would you write *x*/2 as a decimal? If you had finitely many preceding zeroes, this would be clear; for example, 0.01/2 = 0.005. But if you have *infinitely many* zeroes preceding that 1, then you can't really talk about ""infinitely-many-plus-one"" zeroes preceding the 5 as being a different quantity of preceding zeroes.

 Ah, but then considering these decimal expansions this would give you that *x*/2 = 5*x*. So if such an expression made any sense, it would therefore force you to conclude *x*=0, which defeats the goal that *x* should *bigger* than zero.

- By a similar argument, say that you multiplied *x* above by 10. Then the final zero gets dropped, but you still have infinitely many zeroes preceding that final 1. You end up with 10*x* = *x*, which likewise forces you to conclude *x*=0.

""If"". Whether people will actually pay that 6-10% rate is a different story.

&gt; Try /r/investing or /r/business, and explain to them why a rapid repayment of debt is good for the lender but a long, drawn out repayment is not.

Once you have programs like IBR/PAYE churning away, you're not getting much of a repayment. So the government as lender effectively gets much of the blow of default anyway.

The interceptor changes probably had an effect to, as they made it much harder to ""secure"" a region by camping chokepoints. This made it a lot easier to gank ratters/miners in space relatively close to Empire/NPC compared to space that's farther away (drones). The abundance of perfect reaction bots in drones probably caused people to stop trying to roam drones, which only made it more attractive to bots.

'RoK Update Alpha 9
Were doing a small update on the game today. Servers do not need to be wiped for this update, however, be sure to update your community servers so everyone can connect to them. This should help keep your lobby lists functioning with an previous copy incase the live lobby server is swamped. A good portion of the team was attending to the lobby server during the DDoS attacks, another portion of the team is attending to the Easy Anti-Cheat integration, so this update isn't very big or exciting. 

Changes:

- Clients will now save a copy of their last successful lobby query. When a query fails, this copy is loaded for reference.
- The lobby will now allow you to connect to other game versions, however the server will still deny the wrong version. (See above)
- Sorting the lobby by player count now favours online players over capacity.
- Console messages are now limited to 128 characters.
- Symbols have been removed from chat. Colours, bold, underline, etc... 

Design Changes:

- Wood blocks now 40 wood.
- Log blocks now 80 wood.

Fixes:

- Flask no longer tethered to left hand after gathering water
- Its no longer possible to capture throne after dying next to throne while still in a capture pop up menu

Guys like Daquan Bowers and arguably CJ Spiller have been disappointing though.  It seems like the biggest disappointments have been pass rushers.  With Anthony, I think people pretty much know what they're getting.

But who knows, Anthony might be really solid, and maybe Vic Beasley too.  Brent Venables has done wonders with the Clemson defense the past couple years, so will that have an effect?  Hopefully.  Plus, people were skeptical of Rodgers because he was a Tedford quarterback so you never know :)

He is NOT an Infantryman until he has passed his Infantry course.  Like you, you are not an Electrical Tech until you've completed *ALL* your courses. 

From the CFRC's job description for your trade:

&gt;You’ll become familiar with naval history, terminologies and traditions, trained in seamanship, shipboard duties and responsibilities as well as safety and emergency response in damage control situations.

&gt;Once you’ve completed your BMQ and NETP, the final step before being assigned to your first ship will be your E Tech occupational training.

&gt;This will be the first level of training for your E Tech Occupational Qualification.

&gt;Over nine weeks of trade-specific training, you’ll cover mathematics, electrical theory, marine and industrial / electrical safety, power generation and distribution.

&gt;Once you’ve completed your Occupational Qualification you’ll be assigned to your first ship in either Halifax, Nova Scotia, or Esquimalt, which is near Victoria, British Columbia.

"TYT","t5_2s63j","Edit: Well that ended up being half an essay. Oh well.

The guy who made the video at one point says something about a straw man Cenk supposedly erects. If you ask me the video is fucking plastered with straw men by him and the point Cenk makes is very valid, because it's imperative to know who the enemy is and entirely too many politicians and less-than-neutral news sources don't just misrepresent the enemy, they actively mislead their viewers.

Nobody needs Cenk to tell us that terrorism is bad and that the Muslims who do it are horrible people and that their absurd faith is a vital instrument for some sick demagogues who use them through their faith. Those are the points that are very clear to everyone with half a brain.

The more subtle and interesting facets of these stories are how populist politicians use these incidents to create an us vs them scenario just to unite the people under them in order to gain even more power. This effect needs to be countered somewhere and in my opinion Cenk does a good job at it.

Saying this is somehow apologism for Islam is the ultimate straw man. Cenk has always made it very clear he finds religion to be nonsense and often harmful at that. He simply identifies lies and deception in these cases.

PS I especially find the following laughable: ""...Like the other day, there was two 10 year old girls in Nigeria that Boko Haram sent out into a crowd, exploded them. They killed a bunch of people. Horrible Act. And the scorn for this event does not go against a word: Extremism, Radicalism, Fundamentalism. It goes against Islam. And not specifically... Well the blame starts with the Muslims, who committed the act and then instantly after that it's the reasons the Muslims did that act, which is Islam which is the doctrines and the teachings of a paedophile Warlord..."" 

I mean nobody places blame on words what is that even supposed to mean. The blame is on the concepts or rather those who use them to have obedient soldiers and those who let themselves be abused because it's easier to accept those ""truths"" some respected guy preaches. Placing the blame on Islam (which is also ""just a word"" as it stands there, by the way) is really short sighted and has it's roots in exactly the problem Cenk is trying to fight against. People think this mostly has to do with the specific Religion but in fact the monotheistic Religions as well as National Socialism or Communism or the concept of ""bringing Democracy"" can all be abused about equally well for demagogic causes if you just ramp up the populism enough have the charisma to pull it off and manage to unite against an enemy which can largely be a product of fantasy. It is important to see it as it is, demagogues can use different ideals to lead their people. Some ideals might lend themselves to abuse more easily and I think Islam might make it easier because the texts are often violent already. But in the end the problem is not Islam itself, Islam is an instrument.

The maker of the video either does not understand this point or rejects it because it might be subconsciously simpler to place blame on a less abstract more defined target. Humans after all tend to be sceptic of the unknown and always in search of a scapegoat. Also feeling superior because you managed to ""see through people"" is always taunting.

Edit2: Also this guy goes on an on about how Cenk tries to make these attacks out to be non issues because it's not representative of a majority. As if that was ever remotely close to what he said. No one is claiming it's not an issue. Just that it's not a good idea to lump it together as Muslim attacks, because these people are very different, have different motivation and different goals an need to be dealt with in different ways. There are not a unified enemy, nor sould they be made out to be a *unifying* enemy.

Edit3: Just a finishing remark. What a smug fucking asshole. He understands nothing, makes false equivalences all the time and almost runs out of straw along the way.","1427846824"

Then the Company's interworkings, and sales, and connections. Then the flow of traffic, filled with individuals each with comprehensive stories. Each a statistical impossibility that our paths should ever come so close, and or ever again.  Like two grains of sand on a beach.

That this very minute there are millions of people born, and die. That our planet is spinning at 1,040 mph, that the sun is _just_ an explosion/reaction that has in a mortal context, always existed.

Just the human emotional spectrum is being experienced to it's fullest, every day.

That everyday, someone poops, the record-sized poop for that day, and they'll never know it.

Are you sure? Iranians dislike Arabs. Using the Arabic script is different from using its actual language. The biggest sign of cultural imperialism is imposing a different language. 

&gt;Arabic is **very** important. Don't take me as some Arab lecturing you on this, I'm not an Arab, as I've said, I'm central Asian and even I recognize this.

Fitness copypasta aside it is definitely my favorite lift and I think it is the most beneficial to the rest of your lifts. 

Rows are great though, I usually do them with dumbbells for some reason. 

I would strongly urge you to work on your DL form and work back up to 315. Doing 315 for reps instead of 225 would be a great weight to stay at for maintenance. 

If you want I could help you if you record a set or something! Girls are all about a big back and it adds a lot to your overall mass. 

I could see DLs being hard to like if you think your form is bad. I've done them with bad form and it is very unpleasant, when you get the form down the feeling of pulling is totally different. ","1427846830"
"OpiatesRecovery","t5_2tkk8","I agree with what your saying. But in my defense I told her everything I have done in my past except for that last relapse. She knows about the heroin use two years ago, she knows about the oxy and norco use that continued to november until I quit. I have always been honest with her and she has always stood by my side.

She has no idea or grasp of addiction, she thinks it is a simple as saying no. I tried to educate her but she doesn't like to talk about it. The only time I have not been forthcoming about my use was this last slip up. Is that wrong? Absolutely. But everything inside of me wanted to quit. I felt guilty but didn't pull the trigger until now.

Perhaps it would be best to tell her about this last relapse. Is that what you are suggesting? My problem is I love her to death. I really do. I know she is my soul mate. I met her sober and dated her a year and a half sober. Then I got into opiates for ""fun"" thinking I wouldn't get addicted. Through all my slips up, in the end she has stayed with me.

I don't want to be that guy who is going to enter into wedding vows on lies. I am a huge advocate of loyalty and honesty. But I truly love her and she is so happy right now, I don't want to break her spirit. And her positive spirit right now is what is making me quit so easy. I have nothing to complain about. Nothing to escape. I'm 28 and done with drugs. I have made strides.

Did that make sense? I can tell from your message you are intelligent. The last thing I want is to enter this marriage as a liar. That is one of my biggest motivators. That and being able to be the man of the house. I want to be the man I know I can be. And I know I don't need opiates.","1427846830"

"FurryArtSchool","t5_2tfdm","First off, furry isn't a style of art. It's more of a subject matter like human portraits or mountains or I dont know, birdfeeders. There are tons of furry artists that draw in countless styles, including some similar to what is seen in manga. (End pet-peeve rant) That being said, your question really depends on where you are in your art skills. Beginner? I suggest you put aside worries of drawing in any particular style and practice the basics of form, shading, color, etc. Past the basics? I suggest drawing in *your* style and work on bettering your skills. Your style will come out naturally as you improve your skills. You're not limiting yourself to one style, you're evolving into how you go about drawing. If you like the style in manga, when you are looking for tips and tutorials on how to draw something, you probably naturally gravitate towards those done in the style you like. Most of your references, besides the ones from real life, will probably be from great manga artists. You're always free to experiment with other styles and pick up new techniques from those experiments. Don't focus on trying to be a jack of all trades when it comes to art styles. Focus on becoming so fantastic that people will want to emulate your style. Those manga artists you love didn't become famous for trying to do their style and that of Adventure Time and my style and Blotch's style and... ","1427846831"

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Thank you for responding.

This is the type of information I was looking for.

My impression was that iPods and mp3 players (and laptops, even) are more designed for portability rather than high-end performance for audiophile-grade headphones. As such, they might perform reasonably well at powering basic consumer earbuds, and would be designed to match the impedance of said buds, but might not work very well with more demanding headphones (due to impedance issues).

HOWEVER, I made the assumption that headphone amp sections/headphone outs on everything from your basic $150 Sony stereo receiver up to a Yamaha AVR or Technics or NAD or better integrated amp would be able to suitably drive high-end headphones because:

1) I imagined that such amps/receivers are just ""naturally"" more powerful than a little iPod or whatever (because of better circuitry, transformer power, etc.)

2) They would come with a more desirable impedance range suitable for high-fidelity headphones as a standard feature across the board, since people have been using high-end headphones with their stereo amps for decades - for much longer than small portable devices have been around. And therefore the problem of properly amplifying quality headphones would have been something that was resolved a long time ago, and would be implemented in even the most basic stereo amps or AVRs.","1427846831"

We were almost alone on the highway save for a truck carrying a load of those desk-chairs they use in school, the really heavy ones that you'd need a sledgehammer to break. The load was unsecured and a bunch of the chairs fell off. 

If the highway hadn't been so empty, we would have at least hit a car when swerving out of the way. My school at the time was full of those chairs, so I knew if we'd hit them hard enough the car could have been torn apart. We dialed 911 and told them where we were and about what happened, but I don't know what happened to the truck beyond that. ","1427846831"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Nobody takes Pacific Rim to be a serious movie - it's honest about what it is.  In my experience, the type of people who really like ""icky romances"" take them very seriously (not just women, by the way.)  ""They're about real life!"" ""It's a beautiful story!"" Etc.  The problem with *Titanic* isn't that it's a romance, but that it isn't a good story. Cameron was so interested in making a ""spectacle"" (good word, SPacific) that he forgot to include an interesting plot, likable characters, or even good dialogue.  And, of course, infamously the entire romance between Jack and Rose gets shoved right out into the ocean to freeze to death because the writer got lazy, basically.  A plot hole really can ruin the plot, especially when the main character's entire motivation revolves around it.

That's not to mention the movie's many other sins...  My point is that being a romance isn't the problem with Titanic; being a bad movie (that made a billion dollars anyway) is the problem with Titanic.","1427846832"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I sank, the panic in me took over at first, my lungs struggled to breathe while the adrenaline in my system told me not to, my hands struggled against their cuffs, my legs paddled to get me back to the surface.

But it was no use, the cuffs held firm, the bricks were too heavy, I gasped for air that was far above me.

The pain in my throat and lungs burned me into unconsciousness, at this point I thought everything was over.

Then I woke.

Lungs full of water but feeling no pain. I was still alive. Do you know how laughing sounds like when underwater? The irony of my invincibility in such a situation was unbearable.

I bent down and untied my feet from the brick, it was pitch black at this depth, but I had enough freedom in my hands to get rid of the brick.

Did you know there's a point when the human body has neutral buoyancy? With a lungful of air it's actually quite hard to sink, but even without, there's air trapped in a body. You probably won't sink to the bottom of the ocean, you'll hover somewhere halfway.

Without any sense of direction, I decided to swim, which lead to another problem, people do go in circles when they have no reference for direction. Going in a ""straight line"" wasn't going to work.

I thought up another process though, the drunkard's walk. I took 5 strokes in any direction, then chose randomly and took another 5. It may seem pointless, but the average distance you are from the starting point gradually increases, and that's all I needed, time wasn't an issue after all.

Then I saw a slope, a floor, I could walk rather than swim, I crushed the remains of my cuffs under a rock and marched to shore.

Do you know how heavy a body feels when you've been underwater for so long you have to start using mathematical theories to make your way out? The bricks on my legs back then felt nothing like my legs did then. I collapsed on the beach, and considering I forgot to breathe again, I found myself in the morgue the next time I woke.

It seems like I'm good at waking up at the most opportune moments.","1427846832"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","They sound like Doomwake Giant and something like Bloodfire Expert so I'll use those as the examples.

Doomwake Giant enters the battlefield and its triggered ability is put onto the stack, where it waits to resolve. Before it resolves, the controller of Bloodfire Expert plays an instant on Doomwake Giant which triggers Prowess. That trigger is put onto the stack where it waits to resolve. Things on the stack resolve in the reverse order that they were put onto it, so the Prowess trigger would resolve and make Bloodfire Expert a 4/2. Then Doomwake Giant's trigger would resolve and give everything -1/-1, making the Bloodfire Expert a 3/1 again. 

At the end of the turn both the +1/+1 and the -1/-1 would fall off and Bloodfire Expert would go back to being a 3/1.","1427846832"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","1)  So one of his first claims is that stimulation to the visualization of a new person is conducive of faster ejaculation?

I don't have all day. I'm horny for no reason. Porn and my hand, 2-4 minutes and done. I fuck my wife, and I want it to take time. We want to be intimate, and enjoy each other. Don't you want to satisfy your girlfriend/wife?

2)  The second point this lecturer makes is that internet porn promotes:

-Alone

-Voyeurism

-Clicking*

-Searching*

-Multiple tabs

-Constant Novelty

-Shock &amp; Surprise

Well, I like to be alone when I watch porn. And I think many, if not most men would agree.  I think, I don't know for certain, but peeping porn is a small genre among other titans like fucking, oral and anal.

""Clicking"", ""Searching"" and ""Multiple tabs"". This is a new phenomena, and this is mostly unrelated to porn. Sure they are somewhat related, but if I want to learn about the Prussian Incursion of 1806 I may: click, search and have multiple tabs open to find out that—there was no such incursion. 

""Constant Novelty"" and ""Shock and Surprise"".

The speaker seems literate. I hope he is. This means the same thing. I am using multiple tabs to confirm. 

&gt;nov·el·ty
&gt;noun
&gt;1.the quality of being new, original, or unusual.
&gt;""the novelty of being a married woman wore off""
&gt;synonyms:	originality, newness, freshness, unconventionality, &gt;unfamiliarity; More
&gt;a new or unfamiliar thing or experience.
&gt;plural noun: novelties
&gt;""in 1914 air travel was still a novelty""

Surprised by the novelty? 

3) ""Are We the first generation to masturbate left handed?""

No, no we are not. Left handedness is genetic, it has been shown. I do it for a thrill. I assume my grandfather did it, regardless of the nuns hitting him with a yard-stick whenever he did something with his left hand. Mostly because: I doubt they would stop hitting him for jerking with his right any more.

4) I cede this point. Real sex involves two people as his points...point out. 

Courtship

Touching

Being Touched* 

Smells

Pheromones 

Emotional connection

interaction with a person

5) ""Lajeunesse, PhD could not find any college age males who[m] had not watched porn. 

Crimes are down in all categories in the US (where this guy is based)

6) ""Imagine if all guys started smoking at age 10"" 

Many South East Asian countries have lack regulations on smoking. Their average life expectancy is around 62 ( sum average life expectancy of the countries/population) and their average smoking rate is starting at 14, with a 61% overall average (same metrics). The US is at 79.6 years. 

If we all start smoking, or at least most of us, we will die sooner. If we all continue masturbating, we will die about the same as we are. Since you say we do it anyway. 

I could continue, but I am bored and have other things to do today. So I will not criticize the last 12:37 of this 16:29 video.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Wilson was in his vehicle after the weapon discharged for the first time. Afterwards Brown broke off. It is at this point that the incident could have ended. Brown was no longer a threat. Then Wilson exited the vehicle. I think that Wilson fired at Brown's back. Brown then turned moved towards Wilson and was fatally shot.

I don't think its the police's responsibility to maintain order and authority. I think it is their responsibility to protect and serve. I don't care if Wilson's pride was hurt because he got beat up by a black person. I think that pride is a sign of a weak mind. I don't care if the police look weak. I don't think ""suspects"" should ever be pursued with deadly force unless they are being pursued for killing someone. I don't think police officers should exist as an offensive force. I do not think that Wilson's life is more valuable than Brown's. I don't know if police should live outside the districts in which they serve. 

I like the idea that had Brown gotten away with beating up Wilson that the people of Ferguson would be less afraid of the police. I don't think scaring or hurting the police is a reason to die. The system for disciplining and prosecuting police in the US is fundamentally broken.

&gt;2. Players will abuse scaling to find easier ways to beat encounters. There are a ton of solutions here - encounter design is already certainly attempting to account for this, and I have not seen or heard any meaningful examples of players attempting to play around head count in the other difficulty levels (which, presumably, would be just as present in Normal guilds trying to 'game' Heroic encounters beyond their ability as it would be with Heroic guilds working on Mythic, or whatever).

The consequences of having flexible raiding at the highest difficulty are many, and this guy is a fool for assuming so much of Blizzard *and* the players. People have been 'gaming' compositions ever since the general population found out the more players, the easier healing. You have more cooldowns at your disposal, and more players to perform sideroles. It's true that you don't have ""magic number groups"" like we had in SoO, but that's only because they changed that system midway to be ""x chance to get an extra ability per player"", evening out the curve in some unmeasurable way only known to Blizzard.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt;Maybe it would be more apt to describe as a scifi Les Mis? Exploring the human condition over a lengthened period of time in a bleak manner with an overall optimistic tone.

Yeah, that sounds about right. That's a good way to describe the tone of the movie. An overall optimistic message with a sort of bleak or depressing feel. I think Nolan wanted to make this movie because he felt like people were losing that drive for exploration. I seem to vaguely remember him talking about it when NASA was being defunded a few years back.

&gt;Probably one of the biggest nitpicks though would be the whole water world fiasco. Considering the time dilation, they should've known that the message would've only been a few hours old, and I still don't understand where the main ship was hanging out for decades without being affected by it. Not to mention them being able to grow food in space but not in a biodome.

I think the answer is twofold:

1) They didn't know the extent of the time dilation of the planet before going through the wormhole. It's an oversight that these few people didn't take into account that she hadn't been there very long.

2) The fact that she just got there isn't an automatically damning thing. It just offers an explanation for why the thumbs up was still being sent after so long... because from her reference it wasn't ""after so long."" But the thumbs up was still sent.

Overall, in a perfect movie this probably would've been handled better. Just have some line where they factor it in to their decision about whether or not to go down. But again, stuff like this doesn't really ruin the movie I don't think.

&gt;The vast series of improbable events in the film add up to break my suspension of disbelief. It was so contrived from top to bottom that you just kinda have to go along for the ride. I guess if I could do that better then there would be higher ideas to think on, much like Prometheus. I would probably view both of them as ambitiously flawed, although I'd rank the former above the latter, along with the first 2/3 of Sunshine.

The improbability of the events don't matter because of the bootstrap paradox. The only reason the tesseract was put into the blackhole is because he was going to decide to fall into the blackhole. I think it comes back to the fact that the 5D beings have mastery over time in some unfathomable way and they manipulated events in a way that created this infinite loop. If that's the case, the fact that the events have to happen exactly the way they happened doesn't matter at all.

But let me just say that I KNOW that this is all very ""wibbly wobbly"" and kind of ruins the magic and is less satisfying when you have to answer these questions just in order to be ok with how the movie played out. Obviously the people who enjoyed the movie didn't know or think about a lot of this while watching it. They just enjoyed the ride and so they trusted the movie did things right, and unfortunately the people who didn't naturally enjoy the ride are left digging into these things. I know I keep harping on this, but again it comes down to you either liked the movie and give it a pass, or you didn't like it, so you (the universal you) nitpick. For instance, I know people who disliked Interstellar because of the bootstrap stuff, yet they loved movies with similar types of problems (Predestination). Or they disliked Interstellar because of some alleged plothole, but they loved Looper, despite comparably ENORMOUS plotholes. I really think a lot of the people (not necessarily you) who don't like Interstellar and are criticizing its ""mistakes"" are people who didn't like it for some personal preference reason (probably the ""love"" thing), and then are complaining about anything they can get their hands on.","1427846837"

It is not whether or not she has a penis that determines the orientation. It is whether or not she has a vagina.

The breed standard says that the size preference for females is 18-21"" for females and 20-23 for males. If the male was only 18"" he is significantly smaller than what the breed standard calls for.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; All that said, I'm not very knowledgeable about biology, and I hold it's impossible to prove or disprove God's existence with science alone.

""A"" god, sure. But you can easily disprove gods that are claimed to have done certain things by showing those things do not exist. You can show there is no god that flies the sun across the sky in his chariot. We can show there was no god that flooded the entire world and killed every living thing on the planet but what was on a single boat. Things like that.

&gt;The idea is some things, like an eyeball, are only useful when fully developed, and evolution would require too many intermediate stages of non-useful mutations, which would have been filtered out by natural selection.
&gt;While interesting, much of the scientific community says these complexities aren't truly irreducible, and that Behe misrepresents the current state of microbiology. I'm not a scientist, so I have no opinion.

Which is true. Behe has been destroyed on irreducible complexity. It was easily shown how an eye is more than useful before fully developed and how many things he claimed were such were adapted from simpler and other purposes.

To me, the best refutation of life is too complex and must be created is simple, if we are too complex and need a god...then god must be more complex than use because it can create life and a universe...so if we require a creator then so must any god..unless special pleading.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to work at an in home daycare in college. The lady was absolutely insane and I quit after 3 months of torture. I should have known something was off when I went to interview and she pressured me start the next day even after I told her I couldn't start for a month. But I needed the money so I took it. The first day she asks for proof of my for certification and forms. She never once told me I needed any of these things.

The lady was absolutely psycho and forced these kids to do the exact same thing everyday and yelled at me when anything changed. She barely let the kids play because they could ""hurt themselves on the toys and the parents would yell at her again."" 

She lied to the parents about what the kids did and ate. Even when the kids were awful she would tell the parents they were angels. She fed the kids pasta or donuts each day but said they had fruit and vegetables. 

She would tell me that she was too tired or in pain to do anything and would sleep while I watched 10 kids aged 3 months to 2 years. She would tell at me for EVERYTHING. I would get yelled at to do a task that I was about to do because she assumed I would mess up or forget about it. 

Even when I quit she would call and text every morning at 6am asking when I could come back and even made me a new schedule and betrayed me for not coming in. I did call child services and they came and did an ""inspection"" but I wouldn't doubt that she laid them off because she got amazing reviews.","1427846850"

You don't have to buy a dog bed specifically. Those can be expensive and sometimes cheaply made, so even just an old blanket or comforter could really help. 

I also want to say I am very sorry for the situation you are in with your dog, but also, depending on the relationship you had with your mom, you and your dad are probably going through a very tough time as well. From my experience, emotions can run high at this time so if the dog bed doesn't get bought don't stress yourself out, there is only so much you can do.","1427846850"

ANYWAY instead of our friends (owners of the dog) getting the dog under control and teaching him to relax. They kept petting him saying ""It's ok, Duke, it's ok"" pretty much embracing the shitty dog behavior. I'm so glad they only have a little rascal of a dog because if they had a pit or anything bigger they would probably be on the news.

"WaltDisneyWorld","t5_2te6p","Try to relax a bit - so far, you're doing everything right. You've gone to a travel agent for help, and you're researching dining well before the 180 window. You've already identified two priorities: BOG and character dining. You'll have to book BOG 180 days before your trip starts, preferably online first thing in the morning. I suggest trying to get it on the last few days of your trip (fewer people will have been allowed to make reservations the later you go in the window). So that's one decision made.

Character meal: that narrows the field considerably. You can look at your options and pick the best (insert number of character meals you want here) for you. You will still want to book most of these 180 in advance, too.

I'd also suggest one signature restaurant for a romantic evening. Again, like character meals, you've got a narrower field of options. Artist Point is my favorite, but there are a lot of great choices out there.

If one restaurant sticks out in your memory as a great place, go for the nostalgia factor. And that's four table service meals at least. I wouldn't recommend doing one every day - making it toa reservation each day 10 days in a row can be stressful. Give yourself a few days off for spontaneity and counter service at Epcot.

Last tip: for a long vacation, I prefer lunch reservations. They're cheaper and a great beak in the middle of the day.

It implies that eating an avocado and drinking a large cup of Coca Cola (both around 300 calories) would have the same effect.

But a lot of people combine calorie counting with a certain type of diet. (Like keto, paleo, southbeach, vegan, whatever.) And then it makes a bit more sense. Then it could help them to choose certain types of food that work for them. It's a bit like learning to ride a bike I guess.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","You are, self admittedly, not educated. Beyond academics your responses lack maturity, insight and any personal accountability.

This is beyond evident by your instant assumption that I was female because I didn't agree with and subsequently take your misguided side. Completely ignoring my user name AND tag, you want straight to the defensive. 

Calling a girl a princess because you didn't get the response you wanted is pathetic. You interrupted a complete stranger, regardless of how meaningless you feel what you interrupted what she was doing was, and didn't like the response. I'm going to guess by how butt hurt you are getting from other peoples comments that her response was not nearly as dramatic and off putting as you make it seem. 

It's obvious that you have a very, VERY, high opinion of yourself. You note that you have a successful career, own a home outright and have no debt. At 34 that is very admirable and no doubt it took a lot of work. I would suggest you channel some of that drive and energy into making yourself a better man.

You hit the nail on the head with that, as for finding IDD's and IDC's, this used to be hellish, the commands [`allDisplays`](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/allDisplays) and [`allControls`](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/allControls) added in *1.38* make this **so much** easier.

    _IDC = { if (ctrlText _x == ""RESPAWN"") exitWith {ctrlIDC _x}; -1 } forEach (allControls findDisplay 49);

The drive from Blackheath down to Megalong is also worth doing if you have the time, you drive down the valley through a lush rainforest that covers the road.

That's an accusation that is in no way true. In case you didnt notice in that diatribe tmbcake13 made a fallacious argument even after it was pointed out numerous times.

&gt; Are you implying that writers, filmmakers, artists, and the many other roles that don't involve STEM don't have a valid stance on social issues because they don't understand science?

Shouldn't that be obvious? How can you have a true understanding of something if you can't interpret the evidence behind it? You are simply taking someone on blind faith at that point. Look at Matress girl, UVA, Duke Lacrosse, Mike Brown, etc How many celebrities have come out of the wood work before the facts were in on all manner of topics? Shit, half of hollywood still supports roman polanski and hes a child rapist.

Or if you need one more current Ellen Pao. They are still saying it was discrimination even after a gender/race balanced jury found the defence not guilty. Still spreading lies like ""women are not allowed on the ski trip"" even though women testified that was just what she was told because no one wanted her there, or that she ""landed big deals"" when employees testified she was taking credit for shit she didnt do.....yes I'd say it's pretty clear that from stem to stern anyone that engages in activism is short on facts at best and willfully ignoring them at worse.","1427846863"
"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","They're labelled realistic because they take real-life anatomical features, combine them and apply them in a realistic setting. That's how many creature concept artists do the same for live action movies.

What you've described is essentially making the Pokémon character 3D with some highly rendered textures. That wouldn't make it realistic. The anime eyes etc. are just silly when you place the character in a real world context. 

Since many Pokémon are based on animals, it would make sense to reference animal anatomy and combine them. It is also more creative and interesting interpretation wise than what you described. Yes, some are grotesque, but not all. I don't make my realistic pokemon grotesque for example but the real-life animals I reference tend to be a bit more wrinkly or scaley than their anime counterparts and so this freaks people out.

Depending on the severity of the imbalance, the issue you have described is normal.

This being said, I would hate for you to be without your interface when it is operating within specifications. The solution is, as you described, turning the level down in the software, and turning up the headphone control.

Possibly for some fields. But computer science is really about your skills and experience. If you have a valuable skill set, you can find great jobs. If you don't have marketable skills, you won't. Certainly somewhere someone in an HR office might pull a Dartmouth resume off the pile because of the name, but that's the exception rather than the rule.

Its's really not worth the cost. Any career benefit will be marginal and not worth even $10K, much less over $100K.

Watch yo self...

I just stated a logical reason why I think ieatbugs's weight was criticized in addition to her dreadful behavior concerning this sub.

&gt; other people can read that sort of jibe and be hurt: it has no place on SCA.

I disagree. ieatbugs was the leader of this sub and many people trusted her and the other mods to responsibly moderate this sub. I think a lot of people felt betrayed and their feelings swung back in the opposite direction. I'm having trouble explaining this, but my point is that people deserve to make their feelings be known, whether they're appropriate or not because the person-in-question was one of the most involved people on this sub (r/SCA). I didn't explain any of this very well at all. Whatever.

edit: stuff

edit 2: I think I'm getting downvoted because I didn't explain myself well at all earlier. Basically, what I meant was that people have a right to be so angry with /u/ieatbugs and they have a right to voice their displeasure with what she did. It's just human nature. Personally, I am the vengeful type, so I have no problem with other redditor's comments about ieatbugs's weight, especially since she allegedly posted mean things about overweight people pictured in /r/fatpeoplehate. And I understand that I probably see this whole situation much differently than a lot of people.

**However, I admit that I was wrong for saying that SCA-ers have a right to post their comments whether they're appropriate or not. /u/Firefox7275 is right that all the stuff from /FPH has no place on our sub.**

I guess I'm just still angry at you-know-who. I need to meditate. *Woooo-saaaa...*

As I said to someone else, if you went round telling every man and woman they were bad for masturbating you'd get laughed at. If you tried to make a SO feel bad for doing it or owning sex toys and exploring their sexuality. again, you'd be called narrow minded.

I've written about the in-person audition [on my website](http://www.dmleach.com/doku.php?id=jeopardy:audition). A few things I don't see mentioned often are:

* Getting past the online test involves a great deal of luck. In 2011 100,000 people took the test and 2,500 were invited to audition. Don't be discouraged
* Once you get to the audition, I think it's better to wail away on the button in the mock game even if you don't know the answer. By then I think they're looking to see that you know how signalling works and that you have the timing (wait for the lights!). They've already tested you on the trivia twice; some wrong answers won't hurt. I was way too gun shy in my first audition and I think it hurt me
* Keep the mock game moving! Be ready with the next category and dollar amount - don't wait for them to prompt you
* Have fun! Joke if you get the chance. Show them that you're relaxed and comfortable in front of an audience
* Have a good answer ready for ""What would you do with the money?"" Sure, we know you're going to pay off some debt and go on a trip - everybody is. Here's another chance to stand out. Your answer doesn't have to be true, but it should be genuine.

Above all: have fun with the audition! If you're enjoying yourself, you're going to shine. ","1427846871"

I could feel the razor wire digging into my arms, wrists, and legs. I saw and felt my blood running down my limbs. My boyfriend came up and put his hands on my shoulders. I could feel his hands on my shoulders, but instead of seeing my boyfriend, I saw the kidnapper. I could hear him speaking to me but his words were unclear and I thought the kidnapper was talking.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt;Yes it was unwise to sell the stock. I was young and naive about finances and it was a slippery slope. However it was important to both of us for her to be with the kids as long as possible instead of daycare/nanny.

I am addressing this because pf is largely about behavior and it is important. You did not need to choose between selling the stocks and your wife staying home. You had to choose between selling the stocks, your wife staying home, and living a moderate standard of living. That is fine and your choice, but your wife could have stayed home without doing so. Don't pretend otherwise. Your income lowered and you wanted to continue at a higher standard of living than you could afford.

&gt;Stop living beyond my means. Agreed, but we are both smart people and should be able to get back into the combined 150K income realm to balance things out - getting back to that level has taken more time then anticipated.

So why are you even here? You don't seem to want much in the way of advice. This is the only answer, lower your standard of living. If you can easily get back to that income, then spend that much when you actually earn it.

&gt;In the interest of full disclosure I do come from a relatively wealthy family and will likely inherit a 7 figure estate when my father passes. As a result I'm not as much concerned about my retirement and schooling for my children (I know this is unwise - nothing is set in stone, but I need to prioritize for the immediate situation unfortunately). This is also how I mistakenly justified the selling off of my personal stock.

Are you reasonably sure about this? If you are, you still need to ask yourself the question of whether you are content to simply live off the wealth of your family to depletion in order to sustain your standard of living, or to grow/maintain it in order to bless your kids and grandkids. Be honest with yourself.

On the track you are on, you are going to fully use up the family money you have and leave your kids with not much in the way of an inheritance and even more importantly a terrible lesson about managing money. They won't have the luxury of relying on an inheritance if you deplete all of it.

&gt;As cliche as it sounds I really think I could benefit from some sort of consolidation loan where I can just budget for a single payment with a reasonable interest rate. Then cut up the AmEx and Visas and force ourselves to live off checking

Personal finance is overwhelmingly based on behavior with a relatively little amount of knowledge involved until you learn to control behavior. Your example is wonderful, as it demonstrates that even a large inheritance and high income estate tax discussions are not necessary because you spend everything you make and everything you get from family.

You need to cut your standard of living and start paying off this debt. Sell the stock to pay off the credit cards. Sell the cars and the toys if you have them.

At this rate, the only way you are getting better is with the beginning of discipline or a seven figure inheritance big enough to outlast your lack of discipline. Given your willingness to spend beyond your means, I am not really sure that will save you. You may end up like those lottery people.

EDIT: How old are you and the kids and when do you expect the inheritance? ","1427846873"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;I was talking about individual income tax, not corporate. Not sure why you keep wanting to go there.

That's a fair point, but most of these individual's wealth is in ownership of corporate entities.  That is, Warren Buffet owns huge amounts of Berkshire Hathaway, and that's why he's worth so much.  So ordinary personal income tax isn't going to be a big number for the hugely wealthy; their wealth comes from investment, not salary.  Recall Steve Jobs' salary was $1 a year.  As a result, corporate behavior is hugely, hugely, hugely important.  We need to design a system that allows people to keep what they earn (so they don't use inversions and all kinds of shit to keep their investments overseas, and starve the American economy), but also recoups enough from these people in taxes to fund important stuff.

&gt;my earlier hypothetical 90% federal tax rate above 100M would create 6.6M more in revenue and the billionaire would probably not miss that

Here's the thing about this. There aren't a lot of billionaires.  In fact, there's like 550 or something like that.  The number of people making over $100M in a year is very, very small, and compared with our federal budget of like $3.5 Trillion, any revenue you extract from them would also be small.  You won't solve income inequality with this proposal; you will instead make sure that clever accounting ensures no one gets paid over $100M in a year--what the fuck is the point of that when you are going to lose 90% of it?  Instead, their compensation will come in some other form, probably in stock or options or anything that isn't taxed at 90%.

That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to do *something* to combat inequality, but it does mean that billionaires simply don't have enough money to balance the budget of the United States for any long period of time.  Pretty sure the net worth of all the Forbes 400 is like $2.2 trillion, so if you took all of those people's *wealth* (their incomes would not nearly be enough), you could fund ~60-70% of the federal government (and 0% of state and local governments) for a single year, and then you would be out of money.

2.  Daily i use a mech or regulated box with a dripper, and my daily work vape is an mvp2 + a nautilus mini.
3.  I started vaping because I started smoking late (18), shortly before lung cancer took my fathe rfrom me and it has weighed heavy on my conscience ever since until I quit.  I know that I had only been addicted for around 6 years so if people could quit after 25 years i could do it.  It was also a huge waste of money.

"woahdude","t5_2r8tu","I think I see the argument, but perhaps the analogy fails enough that I cannot agree with it at all. 

As I see it arguing that ""consciousness"" is a ""fundamental property"" of the universe ignores vast swaths of well established science. Sure, it makes for a neat story that can provoke some thought, but it simply cannot be an accurate reflection of reality. 

There are a very small number of fundamental forces in the universe. All of those that can affect the universe on our scale have been discovered. We can say this confidently because the models that have developed as a result of the data thus far preclude any as of yet undiscovered forces that do not fit one or the other confines:

1) It is a large force that can act only on distances much shorter than the size of a quark

2) It is a force that can act at a very long distance but it is extremely weak to the point of irrelevance

An example to put them in reference. 

1) The strong interaction exerts a lot of force but fades to nearly zero outside the radius of an atom. This is why larger atoms become more unstable. There are theoretical limits to the size an atom. This is part of why we try and make new elements: to test the model that predicts this. And it is holding up exceedingly well. So any new forces would have to be either stronger but act on a shorter distance than the strong interaction or weaker to act further. 

2) Gravity is a force that has an infinite range and the force declines to zero asymptotically. So yes, the Andromeda galaxy has an effect on our tides, but it is beyond negligible

And the key now is that the universe is fundamentally *stochastic*. This is what quantum physics has shown us and what we are now beginning to understand ever so slightly better. So when the force is strong but acts on short distances it is the aggregate force of vast quantities of interactions that then produce the effect on the next scale up. 

Consciousness is an *emergent phenomenon*. Unless, of course, one happens to believe the ideas of the likes of Deepak Chopra or Rupert Sheldrake, the notion that consciousness is its own separate force that interacts with the matter inside a human calvarium* is not tenable. It is the *product* of the interactions of billions of neurons and trillions of synapses producing complex behavior. It was what the brain *does*. In the same way the kidney make urine, brains make consciousness. 

So yes, of course consciousness is just like any other natural process. Which is precisely why it *can't* be that ""we are all manifestations of one consciousness"" - we *know* that the way consciousness arises is by the processes of the brain, thus each brain *must* be a separate consciousness as each brain is a different physical entity.

*And other animals, to differing degrees. Which is itself a further piece of evidence in support of consciousness as an emergent phenomenon following the same pattern as all other discovered forces: it exists on a continuum","1427846875"

"DarkFuturology","t5_2vva3","&gt;Progress is woefully slow because to date the only strategy for reducing poverty is to increase global GDP growth. Politicians, economists and the development industry all have no other ideas. But GDP growth doesn’t really benefit the poor – or the majority of humanity, for that matter. Of all the income generated by global GDP growth between 1999 and 2008, the poorest 60% of humanity received only 5% of it. The richest 40%, by contrast, received the rest – a whopping 95%. So much for the trickle-down effect.

&gt;To eradicate poverty global GDP would have to increase to 175 times its present size if we go with $5/day. In other words, if we want to eradicate poverty with our current model of economic development, we need to extract, produce, and consume 175 times more commodities than we presently do. This is horrifying to contemplate. And even if such outlandish growth were possible, it would drive climate change to unimaginable levels and wipe out any gains in poverty reduction.

&gt;It’s a farcical proposition – a cruel joke played at the expense of the poor. And, as if to add insult to injury, to achieve this level of GDP growth, global per capita income would have to be no less than $1.3 million. In other words, the average income would have to be $1.3 million per year simply so that the poorest two-thirds of humanity could earn $5 per day. It’s completely absurd, but shows just how deeply inequality is hardwired into our economic system.","1427846877"

The insulation is likely where the mold was found... and the lack of vents in the roof is why there isn't sufficient air flow to properly (per current code - not 25 year old code) avoid future mold growth. 

I understand your frustration and your hopes to protect your parents. In this situation, the inspector's comments make sense. I understand the unused attic space seems silly for the buyers to push back on, but this concern is not complete BS. 

Sorry. 

I don't know how much your parents house is going for... or what % the $10k is as part of the total sale price. But I would say that $10k is reasonable for the work they are defining. (depending on where you live)

They will likely have to replace the insulation - add ridge and soffit vents to the existing roof - possibly replace the entire roof if the existing one is near 10 years old... and if they do that they could be looking at closer to $15k in work (depending on your regional prices)

Overall being on the pill has been pretty great for me. They put me on it bc I wasn't having a period, and it's dangerous to not have your uterus shedding its lining. Before the pill I had the body of a 12 year old and now I feel like I actually look a bit more womanly. My hips expanded and I actually have boobs now, so that's a plus.

That's the exactly the point.  The last half of my post is paraphrased from Glenn Beck's own words, as quoted in the wikipedia article.

&gt; Beck had stated to U.S. Representative Ellison, ""No offense and I know Muslims, I like Muslims, I've been to mosques, I really don't think Islam is a religion of evil. I think it's being hijacked, quite frankly. With that being said, you are a Democrat. You are saying let's cut and run. And I have to tell you, I have been nervous about this interview because *what I feel like saying is, sir, prove to me that you are not working with our enemies. And I know you’re not. I’m not accusing you of being an enemy. But that’s the way I feel, and I think a lot of Americans will feel that way.*""

Beck asked a sitting congressman to ""prove"" that he was ""not working with our enemies"".  Turning that sort of underhanded rhetoric around on Beck seems only fair.","1427846882"

A view that removes the problem with both combines both views in a certain way. If we accept the monist view, but understand that the subjective experience is actually just another physical law, we get around the birth/death problem. But we also inadvertently accept a type of non-temporal reincarnation. That is, that every viewpoint is subjectively the same entity doing the 'viewing'. Which is certainly the viewpoint endorsed by reincarnation.

This seems to be the most accurate view with no flaws. And supports a wide variety of worldviews. While the other two options have various problems that need to be accounted for (namely that of identity).","1427846885"

Sweet, yes, but I think she was a little freaked out I was getting married and said it a few too many times and eventually it *could* have been taken as a slight against him. When I brought that up, though, she was so embarrassed I ever could have thought that. 

The other is that my dad did slightly try to pressure me into having a Catholic wedding, which would have required my atheist husband to go through a freaking conversion/confirmation classes. Not to mention I'm an atheist as well, although not a very loud one. A little inconsiderate, but more towards both of us than just him.

"spacex","t5_2srow","/u/TimAndrews868 and /u/sailerboy both gave good answers that covered the main point--cantilever loads needing to be supported by heavier, more rugged structures.  A few things they didn't cover directly though.  Firstly, not all payloads can be horizontally integrated.  As /u/sailerboy noted, often this is in relation to satellites with specialized optical instruments.  Things like special mirrors that can't handle loads in that direction for extended periods of time without warping, etc.  Other things that could preclude it are things like size limits to still fit inside LV fairings, having cryogenic propellants onboard, and S/C access needs during closeout work on the pad (there's probably others I'm not aware of).  Those issue aren't directly on point to what was being discussed though, as that type of satellite usually couldn't be retrofitted/redesigned for HI.  

The point they didn't quite flesh out is that, compared to a lighter satellite with the same engines, heavier satellites need to use more propellant to achieve the same delta-v for stationkeeping or orbital maneuvering.  If you look at the [rocket equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation), you can see how this affects the mass ratio.  Hence, more propellant is needed for the same operational life.  As you've now added both dry mass and propellants, the total launch mass can be significantly larger (the physical dimensions of the craft may also have grown as well, which can affect its ability to fit under a fairing).  This means that the same LV may not be capable of lifting it or it would only be able to lift it to a less optimal orbit.  A less optimal orbit could require the satellite to do more maneuvering post insertion, requiring even more propellant, etc.  ","1427846886"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","It shouldn't be hard at all to stick with your plan while writing, if you're doing it efficiently.  

You probably start writing, looking for evidence as you go to slot in.  Ie, you write a sentence or paragraph then search through your sources for something to cite, and if you can't find cites restate what you said.

Instead, try pulling out your cites while you research, not while you write.  After you have a pretty good idea what you're gonna write on, when you do your research open a doc called Essay Notes and pull out citations you think you might use.  Don't just flag or highlight in the source, actually type out something you can cut and paste.  These will help you structure your outline and save you from having to go back and re read the source.

You shouldn't start actually writing that paper until you have a full outline and a good sense of the sources you'll be citing.  You'll be surprised how quickly the actual essay can be written once you have all that stuff.

Note this advice is only about trying to get an A.  If you're trying to shit something out for a B last minute while sobering up -- which is how I spent most of college -- this is not advised.","1427846887"

Every abuse situation is unique; my professor looks at the bigger picture and factors in all the details **before** jumping to any conclusions. (Sometimes, yes, it is an accident and not child abuse). 


However, those 4 words spoken by an adult regarding an injury suffered by a child, is usually a bad sign. Even more is the stories of how the child received the injury not matching up. 


I worked in a hospital at one point in time in the emergency department. A child was brought in for a shoulder injury by their parent. The two were separated and spoken to individually. (common practice in cases of suspected child abuse.) The parent stated the child ""*fell*"" and ""*it was an accident*"". The child stated their parent got mad and threw them to the ground, but was told to say they ""*fell*"". (Kids, gotta love them. Honest as fuck.)  ","1427846888"

Yeah they never get anything wrong.

&gt; It's not, both calls were missed, but the narrative that a well-called game would have given you a result is a bit silly, as it's pure speculation.

Please explain how a missed offside directly leading to one of your calls and a terrible call directly disallowing one of ours is speculation.

The only speculation going on here is that you're assuming you would have won the game if we had gotten a red card. And yes, that's an assumption.

&gt; Are you saying that a 17th minute red would maybe have impacted the game?

The game would have been different, but a red card doesn't guarantee you goals. The calls that went against us inarguably had a direct impact on the scoreline.

&gt; It's pointless to play the what-if game.

What do you mean what-if game?? There is no what-if about an offside and the ball crossing the line.

&gt; In fact, my whole point is that RSL **was** the team that had calls go against us in this one.

1. **Titles make the post.**

 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt;after an event that happened months after gamergate. 

\&gt;GTAV Target AU ban

\&gt;after gamergate

Well, it's become evident you don't know shit about Gamergate.

&gt;when you're called out on gamergate not attacking AAA games, suddenly gamergate ""overlaps"" with unrelated groups.

Except there's overlap with plenty other groups, especially with PCMR and TB's fanbase.

&gt;Are you going to claim gamergate overlaps with Kotaku? They called out 1886, Watchdogs and Shadow of Mordor far more than gamergate did.

Nice joke. PCMR has been taking piss out of Ubisoft ever since on nearly a daily basis. As far as 'Shadows of Mordor' goes: TB blew the whistle and Gamergate picked it up. WB picked up on it, dealt with the matter promtly (by un-hiring the offending PR company). The issue was resolved long before Kotaku even realised anything is happening.

&gt;You really expect us to publish a story like ""xternal7 hates Depression Quest for no good reason!""?

That would be grossly misleading at best, so yes, I do expect it. 'Gamers are dead' article have also set a precedent with articles that weren't that much different from what you described at their core.

And no, saying 'DQ is not a game, but rather a chose-your-own-story novel' doesn't mean I hate DQ, just like saying 'Smaug in The Hobbit movie isn't a dragon' (and he isn't, least of all by cannon. Dragons have 4 legs and 2 wings, movie Smaug was a wyvern) doesn't mean I hate the movies or Peter and just like saying 'MB in Windows isn't a true megabyte (10^6 is a megabyte, 2^20 (or 1024*1024) is a mebibyte or MiB) doesn't mean I hate Windows or Microsoft. And when I say Windows(The Hobbit movies are utter shit (because — let's be honest — they are and I could easily write an essay on why while stoking my neckbeard and tipping my ~~Fedora~~Manjaro) doesn't mean I hate Peter or Microsoft.

&gt; For people to be a part of gamergate, which has been shown to have been born out of an effort to harass someone into committing suicide

In-co-rrect.

&gt; If you're not going to tell that story, we're not going to believe you.

And if we're going to tell that story, you still won't listen because truth and fats often don't make a good clickbait.

&gt; And yes, you are I liar, I caught you lying about gamergate still harrassing Zoe Quinn on twitter.

Emm you're so full of bullshit you could fertilize all fields in a smaller country by yourself. [When I go to twitter/hashtag/gamergate, see all and spend next 10-20 minutes scrolling down the page until my browser starts to lag as fuck because displaying over 1500 is no laughing matter on a 5 year old dual core. And when I ctrl-f that 1500+ tweets (about 8 hours worth of happenings) and '@thequinn' pops up exactly once... And even that tweet isn't harrassment. Well, turns out you don't have much to stand on.](http://youtu.be/EhUE3oPFN7A)

Quit your bullshit, really.

&gt;Even in the reply you try to proclaim that you don't attack Zoe Quinn, but you can't resist saying it's not a real game in this very reply

See above. Saying DQ isn't a game but a chose-your-own-adventure story isn't an attack on anyone. Furthermore, the fact you pretend it is shows you don't really respect the chose-your-own-story novels as a medium. Maybe you should... I don't know, adopt a healthier view or something?

&gt; you claim gamergate isn't attacking Zoe Quinn on twitter; you say you looked on twitter and didn't find anything - I have twitter up, I can do a search and find those tweets again. I know you are lying; I can see it.

Well I have twitter up, sort by gamergate/real time. Capture tweets until browser starts lagging. [1500+ tweets and only a single one is directed at @thequinnspiracy, and even that one isn't harassment](http://youtu.be/EhUE3oPFN7A ). So as I said, quit you're bullshit.

&gt; Why would I believe you when you say you don't attack Anita? You're a proven liar.

Well for every tweet that attacks Anita I could find (in theory, in practice my hardware couldn't handle it) over nine thousand that don't. 

&gt;I know you are lying; I can see it.

I know you're full of shit.

&gt;If you don't like Tropes vs Women; don't watch it.

Welterweights are anatomically different from Bantamweights, Heavyweights are anatomically different from Lightweights, and men are anatomically different from women. we all know this, that's why they aren't fighting each other. but the fact remains women are perfectly capable of achieving the same level of technical skill as men and fighting (each other) with the same level intelligence and intensity and to suggest otherwise is just plain sexist and incorrect. the fact that you don't find them as entertaining as men is not evidence that they're shit athletes that's just your opinion.

don't try and twist this around on me now, you're the one making unsubstantiated claims here all I'm doing is refuting them and as the saying goes...

""What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence""

and before you even say it, just saying the word FACT at the end of all of your claims isn't evidence.

""People exaggerate. Everyone does it when they speak or type, to convey intensity or to simply have voice and not speak like a robot.""

if you have to exaggerate everything you say just to make your point then you're clearly not that bright.

"buildmeapc","t5_2t7ly","This is from the ~~PCGamer~~ expertreviews review: 
&gt;&gt;the AOC G2460PG is a terrific monitor in its own right with superb colour performance, great looks, excellent build quality and lots of USB ports, but the premium that G-Sync levies is just too steep for us to be able to recommend it.

You need to decide for your self whether ori not G-Sync is worth the extra $50 premium
 over the non-G-Sync monitor, but keep in mind, that it was closer to a 100$ premium when that article was written.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt; this can be true. but only because the woman knows that the guy is so beta that he will accept it, or she will try it and quickly realize it's the wrong path because she withheld sex and now she's sad. She wants to be happy again like before, so she puts the dick back in her mouth and things go back to happy. You think any mother wants to go from a nice secure position to a single mother who now has to find someone else to help raise the kid? All over something as simple as sex?

yeah I saw a post around here sometime ago where this guy was dealing with a dead bedroom for like 4 years. The one thing that changed it for him was threatening for divorce. Suddenly she became sexual with him again...

I'm basically all she has and I can't bring myself to abandon her.  I would feel too guilty.  But I basically never start conversations with her.

Alternatively if you need a lot of different pieces to be separate static meshes, you can group each of them (or more than one, if you want a few to be together) with Ctrl+G. Then when you export the FBX you can switch Batch Mode to Group. (It's at the bottom of the export options.) You'll get a bunch of FBX files, each containing its own static mesh, which you can then import into Unreal. This is how you can put together modular sets in Blender.","1427846892"

One thing I have noticed is that the teacher makes a world of difference in how stressful a class is or how much work it seems like there is. I've noticed that students, like myself, who go the extra mile to schedule classes only with highly rated professors tend to do better (or at least do less complaining about stress and difficulty) than people who choose the not so wonderful teachers.

If your buy-out is a reasonable number compared with what you can buy a used one for locally, then there's nothing wrong with that option.  Typically it should be a little less than what you can buy a similar model, but look around autotrader.com for listings and compare prices.  Since you know the history of the vehicle, it's even better.  If you're going to buy it out, there's no reason you can't continue the lease until the end and then buy it.  You'll get almost no discount for prepaying the lease now so you might as well use their money.

The new Accords are a big improvement over the '12 and a new LX should be right around $20k before tax at a volume dealer.  You need to know actual sales prices though and not payments.  Who knows if he's quoting you a 60 month or 72 month (or longer!) loan.  

If the buy out on your lease is a good deal based on your research, then that's the cheapest option.  You've already paid for the biggest chunk of depreciation and you'll just start over again with a new car.  ","1427846896"

I was quite close to being hospitalized, most probably. The worst part was the nonstop heart racing for at least 10 hours (I still had a fast heart beat even 24 hours later), and that led to anxiety and fear of death.

However, I think that too often, local community voices are hijacked by small groups of commercially interested entities (down here, it is charter fishermen who aren't interested in sustainable fishing). I understand why the NOAA defers to local support, but at the same time, I wish it didn't lean on it as much. But, education is everything.  Many Americans still believe that overfishing is a completely isolated problem from the effects of climate change; they don't understand that a healthier ecosystem free from land run-off/pollution, overfishing, physical damage to coral reefs create a much stronger marine environment that is better able to weather the effects of climate change or ocean acidification. I think at the local level, we need aggressive tackling of all of these problems in addition to well-placed, well-managed Marine Sanctuaries. ","1427846896"

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","What you say about being overly obsessed with your work fits me exactly. Weed was/is only one small problem in my life. It's finding a larger purpose and sense of meaning that is the struggle. Right now, all I do is go from work to home and vice versa. My only ""other"" activity was smoking weed with stoner people. It's hard to start up a new hobby given how complacent the work life can make us. Especially if you can make your own hours like I can, any time is a good time to work and I don't need to be on a strict sleep routine and can afford to sleep in on weekdays and stuff like that.

These are all really good suggestions. Before I became a super heavy stoner, I was into the martial arts. I was pretty active. I think if I can get adjusted to living again without weed, eventually I will find my way back to the dojo. I also really like the idea of volunteering. Thanks so much for taking the time to write this. It really means a lot.

Besides, if Luffy could harden the air around him with his Haki, Luffy and Zoro could have made a big ball of Haki around everyone to protect them from the gas on Dressrosa.

Usually if I edit a LP its because, other than these yea I thought it would be best to keep in all the recording.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","I'm sorry about your family situation I really am. From the sound of it you're not any better off with your other *"" family ""*. That I can accept. Now if you do choose to go no contact you might want to consider going no contact with the *"" aunts / uncles ""* to which you're close with. If only for the reason that if you don't they could undermine your attempts to get your life in order. I am not accusing them of intentional malice. However I am saying that the road to hell is paved in good intentions.

I also agree with you while your *"" mothers ""* various abuses are horrible they aren't an excuse. If she truly feels they're an issue then maybe she should seek help. There's a ton of sexual abuse / mental clinics / therapists that specialize in that field that could help her. The best you can do in that situation is point her in that direction and make sure she's getting the help that she needs.

As I said her past abuses aren't an excuse. If she's unwilling to change her behavior and or seek therapy that's her choice. However in that instant I'd recommend you going no contact with her and anyone that would undermine your choice either with malice or good intention. As your life is yours and you should be free to live it.

In a worst case scenario you still have your family from your marriage. I say get to know those people. See what they are like. At the very least you'll have someone to keep you company when you're feeling lonely.

I don't know if this means anything to you but you and your *"" mother ""* have my sympathies. No one deserves to be raped like your *"" mother ""* was. You also don't deserve to be treated the way you are. It's a bad situation all way around.

This is not something new. I had the same experience when I bought the Galaxy Tab S last summer -- and it was a terrible experience, especially compared to my twice as cheap Nexus 7-tablet from the year before.

I'm not saying this to shit on Samsung. I love their hardware, and their displays are to die for (they are 1 year in front of everyone else here). But their software is shit, and ""covering it up"" with amazing hardware-power doesn't fix the problem at hand. I'm sorry.

Do you honestly think the S6 will give you a smoother experience than HTC One M8, M9 or the Nexus 6? We can agree that the S6 is a better phone overall, but its achilles heel, as it always has been, is Touchwiz.","1427846903"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","So, there is no general way to solve polynomials of degree 5 or higher analytically (e.g. using algebra).  This is the [abel-ruffini theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem).  It might so happen that this polynomial is a special case which CAN be solved analytically, but it's not obvious to me that's the case, and figuring out how to solve it would likely be exhausting.

So we've ruled out analytic methods, but don't lose hope!  There's an entirely different way of solving math problems like this known as [numeric methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis) which typically rely on numerical computation (e.g., plugging in a value of x into the left hand side of the equation and seeing what you get) combined with iteration (using what happens for each value of x to rapidly find a value of x which comes close to solving the problem).  The solution will only be approximate but for a great many problems, an approximate solution is good enough (additionally, numeric methods generally work in such a way that you can get as much precision as you want, so long as you're willing to invest the computer time).

So, now that you know you should solve this problem numerically rather than analytically, the next question is ""what numerical method should I use?""  This is a broad question as there are a ton of viable methods- a reasonable starting point for this kind of problem is [newton-raphson] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method).  I'd recommend starting there if you want to read more about numeric methods and maybe implement something yourself. 

Personally, however, I'm a fan of doing things the easy way when possible, and in the case of numeric methods there are already pretty good implementations in a variety of mathematics software packages.  Plugging the following statement into Mathematica gives me a list of the complex x values which approximately solve the equation you posted (""approximate"" in that they are decimal values rather than exact; they all solve the equation to extremely high precision).

       NSolve[Sum[x^n, {n, 1, 52}] == 25000, x, WorkingPrecision -&gt; 20]

I'd rather not list all the complex roots since there are quite a lot (52), but the real roots are 1.1708562644102110476 and -1.2289897411217587853.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","First: Please speak with someone about how you feel at Planned Parenthood. That is their job. They signed up for that job for a reason and it is to help. There is absolutely no shame in seeking assistance in your time of need. 

Second: Almost one year ago now, I had the same procedure done. I was 8 weeks when it happened but my breasts were swollen and I was even showing. The hardest part for me is when they did my ultrasound and I saw that little bean inside of me. I know it was part of me and part of my boyfriend. That for me is what hurts the most to this day and, to be honest, if I could do it all over again I wouldn't. 

For me, being aware of my decision has helped me cope. Knowing why I did it and where it has lead me to makes me realize that being a mother is not right for me at this point in my life. Nor do I ever want to go through that ever again in my life. Never doubt your reasons for your decision. You have grown as a person and you will continue to grow. You deserve nothing but happiness in your life. You and I, as many other women's decision to have an abortion should be a reminder of why you need to put you and your priorities before those of another human life dependent on you. 

An abortion is nothing to be hateful of yourself for, you should be proud for standing for yourself and making a rational, reasonable and intelligent decision that a lot of people do not consider. Love yourself. You did the right thing. ","1427846905"

I've tried white and black primer and both had pros and cons to how they affect the layer colors. Ork colors are so varied that any 1 primer color won't make your painting any easier. I just use clear as it is neutral (grey primer would give similar results).

I would paint the models before you attach the arms as getting the straps when a Shoota is in the way sucks.

I still haven't figured out a good way to paint ""face/body paint"" that Deathskulls are known to do. To help make your Boyz look like proppa Deathskullz is to find your friends and ask for any spare bits to use as trophies. Heads, helmets, weapons, shoulder armor, spiky bits, scraps of armor, etc are great ways to snazz up your loot happy boyz. Ask that each Ork victory can earn you some unneeded bits to take as trophies. Paint the bits up in their army colors for added effect.","1427846910"

Or maybe- just, maybe- the miraculous, unreliable, untestable, never-seen-before-or-ever promises of god's power superseding physical limitations were a sham devised by primitive civilisations who didn't have the tools to investigate reality that we do now.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I grew up in a religious environment and didn't realize I was gay until 18 years old. Over the next few years, I just came to the decision that this is something that I have to deal with, and find happiness later in life. I wanted financial independence, so I stayed in the closet until graduating and getting a job. That worked for me, and I'm the happiest I've ever been before, however I do regret not going through college without dating anyone...  
If you're going through real depression, I'd get some professional help. Just talking it out with someone makes such a huge difference. I know being gay is frightening sometimes, but it's only a small part of you. Work towards your future happiness, and I think it will help you overcome your struggles.  
Coming out now or later I think is just a decision on which one will induce less stress, and depends on the situation. For you, it might be better to come out now, because you'll be missing experiences that you'll only get when you're young. But that doesn't mean you can't have fun or be happy later.

I guess what worries me the most about the office job is the amount of time in my day that I will lose. Working from 8am until 5pm and accounting for commute time, I am going to be devoting a minimum of 10.5 hours out of every day to my job. 

Next I don't like the idea of being locked down in the area I live in. It is a dead area and the closest family is 2 hours away, friends included. 

I also, obviously, like the freedom of self employment and not hating my life every morning before having to go to work. 

My debt is certainly a major player in this game. I owe somewhere around 100k to various loan providers, 80k of which is private loan.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Path of Exile is pretty amazing. Think of Diablo 2 with a Cthulhu twist. Their build tree lets you 100% customize whatever 'class' you chose to play.  Want a Wizard that doesn't need to actually cast but can clear a whole room by being hit once? How about a class that leaps around like a frog and does splash damage? How about a stave wielding rogue with the ability to summon pets? [Path of Exile Skill Tree](https://poebuilder.com/)

Pros: Gameplay, Online Co-op, Story, Mechanics 

Cons: Medium Graphics, Sluggish response from servers, Once you spend points you can only go back a certain number to correct a mistake; or wait until a patch resets skill points, Clunky social UI.  

TF2 is pretty swell as well. The 'cap' seems pretty low, because people are always bashing on their hat based economy, but it has strong FPS mechanics, and is a nice get away from the aesthetically monotone shooters(how everything blends into EVERY surface in games like Battlefield and Call of Duty) with interactive classes(they talk shit to each other. Funny stuff)

Pros: Gameplay, Online Player-vs-Player or Co-op, Funny, Customization through mods

Cons: Smaller community, No serious competitive scene

Dota2 is the cut and paste(sorta*) copy of Dota, the predecessor(sorta**) of every MOBA we play today.  If you've played League of Legends, you've played Dota(also sorta, just keep reading if you don't already know), if you've played Heroes of Newerth, you've played Dota! ETC ETC. The only difference is that Dota2 has mechanics that only few MOBAs retain, as many have streamlined their base game play to more fit their model of the game. For instance, in Dota2 you can deny your own minions from being killed by enemy forces. In games like League of Legends, you cannot do this(used to be able with Gangplank WAY back, I know...)

*Some base values, stats, character models, names have been changed, as Blizzard Ent. owns all of said above and didn't want steam to make a profit from their(sorta) idea.

**Aeon of Strife, an addition to Starcraft, was the first. Dota was added when the Frozen Throne and Reign of Chaos expansions for Warcraft were released.

Pros: Highly competitive, A boastful games/hour played(last I saw, more than League), Interactive environment; Heroes have unique dialogue for their rivals/friends/monsters in the jungle, monsters in lane, towers going down, etc etc. It's redic to say the least. 


Cons: MOBAS should be spelled Toxic Social Experiment vs Video Games. ","1427846914"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","Please ignore everything else people are saying to you, because they're wrong. Everything that has been written on this topic has been extremely misleading, and it's frustrating to those of us with an understanding of law. While this law has very real problems, it will likely not be used in the way that most people think that it will. 

You need to know the following:

1. There is a federal act that the RFRA is modeled off of, though there are many differences. The boundaries of this federal law are well-litigated and reasonable, but people get extremely upset over the very idea of its application. The purpose of this law is to provide a defense to the federal government's intrusion (under federal law) upon your right to the free exercise of your religious beliefs. There are some very staunch limits to this, and while people like to run willy-nilly with their hypotheticals, almost all of them would not qualify for protection under this statute.

2. The federal law does not apply to individual states, thus necessitating the Indiana RFRA and other state statutes like it (there are 19 others), to protect the free exercise of religion by  Indiana's citizen's from being intruded upon by Indiana state law.

3. The language of the Indiana statute is **extremely problematic**, because while it is modeled off off federal law it includes provisions that allow corporations to claim that it has religious beliefs, and also allows for the use of this as a defense in actions between private parties with absolutely no state involvement. (Don't try to make sense of that, because it doesn't make any sense. Traditionally the federal law and other state laws only apply when the government is the party inhibiting the free practice of a someone's religion).

4. People are misinterpreting this law as allowing discrimination against gays, but it is really not that clear. Every state has anti-discrimination laws that prevent discrimination against different protected classes within their state. Right this very moment in Indiana, the LGBT community *is not* designated as a protected class in Indiana's Civil Rights Act, so there's pretty much free reign to discriminate against them in almost the entire state, regardless of the passage of the RFRA. Because of this a few more progressive-minded Indiana townships/counties/municipalities/what have you have enacted laws to protect LGBTers from this sort of discrimination. 

5. Subsection number 4 is where things get difficult, because it is not clear what the interplay between Indiana's state law and these regional ordinances will be. The ordinances are expressly subject to Indiana's RFRA, but that does not mean that they will be invalidated before a court if it were to come to that. My understanding is that there is case law on analogous statutes that expressly does not allow for discrimination based on religious beliefs, but that is just my two sense. 

6. This particular problem can be solved by simply including the LGBT community in its protected classes. If they do this, this law will not be upheld to protect discrimination against LGBTers because a federal court will hold that Indiana's state government has a compelling governmental interest in curbing discrimination against that community, and therefore has met the standard spelled out in the statute. 

Because Indiana passed this law at a time when they'd failed their fight against gay marriage it looks bad.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","I wouldn't say that it is hard to explain to someone else, but challenging to explain to oneself. It just takes time haha. I mean, a lot of people are just being them, you know what I mean? Going with the flow. Life is fluid. But, if anyone takes the time with themselves--kinda like me, who just went through an Existential Crisis, and an Identity Crisis (Turns out, they aren't tethered to one another, you can have one without the other, I just happened to have both at the same time haha)--{and not that anyone *needs* an Existential -or- Identity crisis to figure themselves out}--can find a way to articulate their identity as they have explained it to themselves, building the foundation for their future existence that has a bit more of a direction than just going with the flow (which is totally alright, I'm thrilled that we live in a present where you *can* just go with the flow!).

Anyways.

No. I would not consider myself Gender neutral. Neutral implies that I am 'unbiased' [but to tell you the truth, to me, bias is inherent and cannot be eliminated]. My presentation *is* biased, however, because it falls and leans on the Feminine side of the spectrum. 
(Masculinity--Androgyny--Femininity)
(Femininity--Androgyny--Masculinity) 
Just so it doesn't look like I'm holding one over the other xD

I don't care about pronouns regarding myself. 
I **do** care about pronouns in relation to another persons identity. 
Everyone is entitled to their own meanings, and so, should they desire to be referred to as one or another, I'll be happy to oblige.
But I'm not going to treat anyone as if they have privilege because they fall on one end or the other of the spectrum.
They're human. I'll treat them as a human. I'll hold the door open for a person. I'll get out of my seat so another person doesn't have to stand. I'll never hold anyone to an archaic stereotype attached to their masculinity--femininity projection, because they're a person.
[Ha, don't get me wrong, like, Pregnant women *should* receive particular respects because then you're dealing with **two** entities in one--but let's save that can of worms for when we're fishing in a different lake]
 
I consider myself Transcendent of Gender. This doesn't make me better than anybody--it allows me to just live as myself, as Mila, without worrying about what people refer to me as.
Just get my name down!

We have inherited a hyper-defined binarized society. We didn't ask for it, we are products of circumstance. So, it's understandable that when that binary is being challenged, for a lot of confusion and questions and uncertainty to bubble up. 
Being Transcendent of Gender allows me to set an example for myself, and take certain worries out of my life that I feel, had a tendency to at one point or another, inhibit me living my life without distraction. Gender is fun and all, but ah, there are many other things that are going on in this fleeting existence of mine.

Society may at one point consistently refer to me as ""She"", or ""Her"", which is fine. 
But if people look at me and say ""You're a boy because you have a penis,"" I'll say ""Sure"". 
But if people look at me and say ""You're a girl because your body is very feminine,"" I'll say ""Sure"". 
If a persons bewilderment rolls into ""What are you?""
I'll say ""Human""
If they ask me ""Who are you?""
I'll say ""Mila.""
If someone asks ""Can you produce a child?""
I'll say ""I can produce the seed for one. Wait. Maybe not. The hormones may* have killed that off. Oops.""


However, I do identify with biological women, and have always wanted to be one, not just emulate one. However, I know that some things are just not, even if the plumbing gets a re-haul, I will *never* be a woman. I'm not discrediting, disagreeing, or criticizing bottom surgery. That information and decision is *ENTIRELY* left to the discretion of the identity belonging to that person.
 

Society runs on this framework of having a gender binary because in the past, it has distinguished particular roles based on biology. It has fueled countless stereotypes. It has also reinforced an imbalanced power structure that is now, and has been re-arranging through equalization.
I don't disagree with the Trans* gender. But even Transgender* creates a framework. Even Transgender* is a classification that can breed stereotypes, even lead to the repression, and subjugation of identities.

Where there is a large amount of focus on what someones gender can and can't be, there is less focus on where these gender frameworks are irrelevant within the construction of society, and where particular attention is being overlooked and people are getting killed. I believe in a Binary because there will always be the biological absolute, at least within this lifetime. The women who can produce a child, and the men who can produce the seed. 
But we shouldn't just say ""Gender doesn't matter, combine the prisons!"" or ANYTHING of that nature.
But we also shouldn't subject a Femme, Trans* criminal body to a Masculine, predominantly biologically Male prison. Vice versa for Masculine, Trans* criminal bodies.
The same kind of issues exist with shelters, and bathrooms, and and--!
I'm getting ahead of myself. Like too deep.

Here's the gist. The more you think about gender, the more it can make you crazy. I'm not saying to not pay attention to it, but don't try to find an absolute. We're going through a shift. The world has never seen this before, and with medical coming into play, rhetoric is going to be rising and falling for awhile. 

Be you. Understand you. Love yourself.
Have friends. Understand your friends. Love your friends.
So long as more, and more people begin to empower themselves with knowledge, and understanding--humans will start to drain the abscess of Intolerance and Ignorance.

Edit:
And ah... Yeah... I don't really get that either... Like... Clothing has been tailored to gender, and so have colors...
Clothes are clothes, right? I mean, anyone can wear what they like--but like... I mean... Fashion, right?
Not every man wears a suit just because he's a man? Not every woman wears a dress just because she's a woman? Yes, some things are tailored to accentuate biology--but clothing is clothing... they're just fabric... and other materials... objects xD ","1427846918"

you can level like you used to, sure, but post 85 it gets mega grindy. like not stomachable grindy. like 8 hr a day grindy to get anywhere. buying xp runes really speeds that up, cause with about 100 USD you can have something like 5 hrs of 9x xp per day, which significantly reduces the cost of levelling in sheer SS alone.

subclass is like having a whole other class except not an alt. you dont have to log out to be your subclass, you can literally switch it whenever you want. so if you are Tyrr and want to be othell you can add any othell based class as subclass and level it. you cant use abilities from both, only one at a time, but you can switch anytime (but you lose all buffs). you start on your sub at level 40, and you may get it to 80. once there you can get another sub, or make your current sub a dual class which means you can get it to awaken. your other subs must remain maximum level 80, you do this on Talking island.

just an aside: regarding p2w. while it technically isnt the case, realistically you have no choice. there are no drops or quest rewards worth any money until you get to 90. you will need to play the events by buying ncoin and spending it, to earn any significant part of the adena required for your r95/99. realistically raising the 3.5 billion adena you need for basic 95 you just can't do with drops.

What I do have a problem with is that sometimes you get like 3 gold-level players on your team. My past 5 games on ESEA, 4 of them had at least 2 people who couldn't save/buy properly. ESEA is still preferable to MM since last thing you want is to play Vs. someone cheating, but I think after today's string of games, I figured the chance of having a better competitive game on MM might be a bit higher than ESEA.

Like, I don't mind if you miss shots, but blatant disregard for some quality CS play is annoying and it sucks having to put up with it. It's really the only downside I have with ESEA at the moment.

ESEA needs to find a way to get those guys to play with eachother. Maybe the playerbase on ESEA just isn't big enough... ","1427846920"

They were staying in a hotel, in a different province then they reside, and they were travelling to a work related activity after leaving the hotel...for which they needed their firearm.  The firearm was secured in accordance with the law inside a locked vehicle.

There's no ""requirement"" that says you cannot stop off at Tim's on your way to or from a range.  

The ATT states that ""Firearms must be transported by a route that, in all circumstances, is reasonably direct"".

It says ""reasonably"" direct, and that's important because legally, the word ""reasonably"" is a modifier, which means there is some room for interpretation.

So I ""can"" stop at Canadian Tire to get ammo while my firearm is securely locked in my vehicle.  I ""can"" stop at Tim's to go to the bathroom and get a coffee if I want while my firearm is securely locked in my vehicle.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The row of chairs wiggles in time with my bouncing legs and the lady at the end shoots me a glare. I make the conscious effort to stop, but know that I'll start again in a minute without even noticing. I hate waiting; I hate sitting still. 

Third period is my check-in period. Everyday, right after lunch, I report to the Counselling Office for my CI. I don't mind so much, I just don't like talking to someone everyday about how I'm feeling. I get it, we're in high school. Emotions are high, hormones are flowing, small matters can seem extreme. Just last week Ashley Scott dropped dead in the cafeteria when Dan Cruz broke it off with her. That's why we're banned from dating till we're 21. Dating lowers your inhibitions, makes you not think straight. It can be dangerous. 

If they had found out about Ashley and Dan, they'd have been separated and calmed. I don't know what it's like to be calmed. They've never prescribed it for me. I've got a perfect record.   

""You can come in now Mr. Belmont.""

I get up from my seat and walk towards the open office door, ignoring the looks form the woman still sitting at the end of the row. What a bitch. 

I know the drill. I walk straight to the lounge chair, take a seat and swing my legs up while lying back on the headrest. I've got a woman today. You can tell by the way she sits with her legs crossed and how the white coat she wears bulges a bit at her chest. Like all of them, she has her face covered with a white mask. 

She wastes no time. ""How do you feel today?"" 

""Fine."" Until you're 18, you have to have a CI meeting every day. I'm 17 now and will leave high school this year. My CI grade is the highest in my class. No stress, no worries, no fears. When you're of age, you're only required to have a CI once a month unless there's trouble. Sometimes they make you go more often. Sometimes the prescribe calm.  

""That's good. How are classes?"" 

""Fine.""

""And family? Friends?""

""Fine and fine.""

""Good good."" She types something into the screen in front of her. Records are kept by the federal government. Everyone has a file and a score. It's hard to get hired with a bad score. You're considered a risk. 

""What have you been doing lately?""

""Nothing.""

""No trips? No nights out? No parties?""

""Nope""

""Good.""

People are discouraged from doing anything that could cause stress. No one is allowed to move homes without permission. Events and parties are all registered through the local municipality so that a Calm Agent can be present. It's best for everyone. 

""Your record indicates that you were accepted to college and your CI scores are certainly high enough to for you to receive permission. Are you nervous about leaving for college next year?"" 

""Not really."" 

""Are you scared? Excited?""

""I'm not anything."" 

""Good."" 

I'm not excited. I've trained myself to not feel. That's how you do your best in CI. They want you calm, they want you plain. It's best if you don't feel. It's best because then nothing matters. There's nothing to get worked-up about. There's nothing to make your heart race. There's nothing that causes worry or fear or stress. There's nothing. 

There's nothing. 

Nothing matters. 

I want to die.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","&gt; The point here is that as you said yourself, underneath those bad decisions is a normal person who made a bad choice. 

And the question surely is who should pay the consequences of that bad choice, the one who made it or society at large. Those who fall more towards the left of the political spectrum tend to take ""society"" as a given, and therefore cast the debate, as many in this thread have, as being over what form of mitigation is most cost-effective, but that ignores the crux of the actual argument.

&gt; The third friend was a bit of an oddity... he did meth and cocain 10+ times and just stopped cold turkey. I asked him how he was able to do that and he said ""ya it's fun, but my life is great without the drugs... I really just don't need them"".

Actually, that's not really odd. Despite the prevailing myth of addiction as a disease or pathological condition that requires treatment, research shows that most addicts eventually recover on their own.Essentially it is a form of refusal to deal with the other problems in their lives.

&gt; In the end they're all people like you or I or your friend, every single one has the potential to be an amazing friend or lover and contribute to society.

What are you basing this on? Would you say that every single person has the potential to be an Einstein or a Mozart? If not, what's the difference? Also, even if this is true, then doesn't that make them *more* responsible for failing to live up to that potential than they would be if they didn't have it to begin with?","1427846922"

""No matter what you do, there will always be someone who doesn't like you, and there's nothing you can do "" ... ""what should you do if someone is bullying or trolling you? just block them"" ... Yet she had previously just talked about how she can't wait for there to be laws prosecuting people who ""stalk"" (lmao, no one is forcing you to read comments that hurt your delicate feelings), 'bully', and 'harass', people online. 

These SJWs have no concept of freedom, freedom of association, freedom of choice. 

They very much want to make it illegal for you to criticize them, say things they personally find offensive, or even say anything they don't like.

She makes no distinction between criticism and ""harassing"" she even said she'll block anyone for ""harassing"" her-- yeah like that person who posted on her twitter the a legitimate about the etsy and she blocked.. must have been 'harassing' her.

Do you not see the authoritarianism? SHE doesn't like reading comments that hurt her feelings, so she thinks people should be thrown in jail, that laws should restrict people from hurting her feelings online, etc. If she can't deal with people not liking her, then she can literally just stop reading comments, as most youtubers do.

We found that active clubs usually meet at a fixed location, so eventually, the map will be more useful in the sense of representing an actual club location.  And we'll also have the option to filter for active clubs.  So, a work in progress, but it's getting there, but we appreciate the feedback!","1427846925"

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","Really most mousepads aren't really different. Solid colored cloth pads are best for LED based sensors (Optical), while flat hard surfaces are better for Laser sensors. There are some different textures with both types for control vs speed. With cloth, stitched edges prevent fraying and peeling so it is worth the investment. For CS and other FPS games you should be looking at XL size pads if you have the deskspace. 

Steelseries makes fan favorites(QcK+, Heavy, etc) but they are only really worth it when on sale.

I would say that [this](http://www.monoprice.com/Product?c_id=114&amp;cp_id=11401&amp;cs_id=1140105&amp;p_id=9279&amp;seq=1&amp;format=2) is the best bang-for-buck XL pad. If you want a thicker pad check out the [Signstek](http://www.amazon.com/Signstek-Gaming-Mouse-Non-slip-Rubber/dp/B00F4PRN1K/)

L took chances, but they paid off. Near on the other hand seemed a lot less impulsive than L; unlike L he didn't reveal himself until he was playing his final hand. He didn't take as many risks as L and Mello, and although he was the only one of the 3 to survive the story, he also relied on their information. That said, Near was all but impervious to the Death Note; no-one knew his face, name or location.

It's an interesting all-or-nothing arguement, because if seceding is legally allowable, you're right that people would use that precedent to secede their house/neighborhood/town, regardless of whether that is actually legal too or not. I can agree that Lincoln's reasoning might be practical reality, but does not change my opinion that upholding that logic in the example of the Civil War would feel horrible morally. Or any case of a large-scale population wanting to secede. Maybe something tied to the level of population required to form a state in the first place? That would make some sense, legally.

You're definitely right about the world being better for it in the case of the world wars. But then you're basically saying that it's okay for the South to have suffered if the rest of the world was better for it. Bit of a tricky position as an American isn't it?

"PucaTrade","t5_31rkw","I really want you to read my first post again before condemning my account. Yes I used Soul flayer because this was the easiest way for me to move points from their to my account. I could have used other cards, I could have used the 50 common and land cards i actually gave away and that would have taken me 2 hours to do as I do not keep track of all my swamps and uncommon goblins. 

This is not a fraud, the fact is that real cards were traded here, and using one card to move points was really the easiest way for me to do this and as i looked into the rules there were no problems with this. Are you telling me that if i just used soulflayer and a couple of other cards this would not have happened? What would be the difference? And yes we are all anime and gaming fans, If you guys really need to dig deeper to believe me please take a fast look on facebook and you will find all of them have real names and are friends with me. This is not a fraud, but yes the cards we traded today is not 10 soulflayers but about 200 cards that I did not want to import into puca just for doing some simple Real Life trades. They needed beginners cards, I needed puca points, its as simple as that. 

I suggest that keeping the integrity of the site is done some other ways that instant banning accounts with value on them. When banks have suspicion of illegal money in users account they freeze the accounts until the case have been resolved, it is not right to instant ban an account with values on it, my commons today I could have given away for free if i wanted. Not that big a deal. But the other cards i have sent to users that i have drafted in the dragons prereleases and sent away. All the points for these are gone, taken, stolen away from me and to even talk to admins i have to seek help here on an open forum having an open disussion on the internet. 

Please take a second look on my case and see that this is no frauding attempt. Hopefully we can resolve this case so that both parts can have closure. I really do not want to blow this up more than needed, but I will if needed. My case is an example that needs to be discussed, this is not a simple case of closing an internet account. This is an account containing real currecy and should be treated that way.","1427846933"

Stream boxes and gaming consoles have a lot of artificial limitations set by their makers.

I don't even know yet if these Chrome sticks can be unlocked to run Linux. I would actually just buy an Asus Chromebox myself, and put Linux on THAT instead. Since the Chromebox is x86 (not ARM), we already know it can be unlocked to install any x86 OS (probably not Windows though), and runs with a Celeron or i3 CPU which is pretty powerful for such a small and cheap TV attachment.","1427846937"

Only difference is a invisible creature can re-hide and move while the halfling is screwed if he looses his spot. Same thing as a fight between an elf and a human in a room of darkness. The elf could hide but unless he puts forth effort to not be noticed the human can hear him.

**You're also talking past me and aren't addressing what I've put forward.**

&gt;and while some in Parliament spoke of ""free trade,"" they publicly and obviously rigged the whole affair to take Irish rights (like right to one's own grown food) away

Privatization of land is necessary for capitalism, and this was a long-term goal of the British, both the government *and* merchants and industrialists (capitalists). They worked in concert with one another, with the latter pushing the former onwards. Of course it helped that they *hated* the Irish and considered them subhuman, but capitalism must be indicted as well.

&gt;Capitalism--the system of private investors--*was not a factor*, since all the events exacerbating the famine were caused by the *government*.

This is an absurdly simple and stupid argument. The government is not some big bad entity that exists *outside* of capitalism, the government and the state are *inherent* to capitalism, ESPECIALLY in Great Britain! To ignore this is absolutely ridiculous and discredits much of what you've written. Look at the enclosure acts! Game laws! Holy shit read a book!!!

The British government forced the British peasants off their land and enforced labor discipline in the cities to benefit *solely* the owners of factories. Does that mean that the eventual benefits of capitalism that you undoubtedly praise (life expectancy, standard of living, etc.) were due to the big bad government and NOT capitalism?

When people are of an age where marriage is appropriate, and they make a choice to get married, they are making a choice to BE MARRIED. All kinds of ppl act all kinds of ways. I would not encourage (obviously, as I've been suggesting otherwise) that OP leave TODAY. They may find that they actually can't do this marriage, which is ok, but FFS, first, try to NOT divorce. Try counseling, try to identify and address the root causes of the infidelity and the terrible communication between them. Attempt to make the marriage work before going directly to divorce.

I hear you saying don't take a stand against the knee jerk divorce cheerleaders in this sub in this thread in particular, bc it's about a sensitive issue; but that's what's got me so up in arms. I don't think that marriage should be savable, expect in instances of infidelity. I think marriage should be savable in almost every instance expect for physical and sexual violence. Unless you're in danger from your partner, you loved them enough to marry them, then love them enough to attempt to salvage your marriage. 

If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But 9 out of 10 times, the first comment to be super upvoted, and all upvoted child comments will be those calling for divorce. Never do those comments explore what divorce means to a relationship, to children, to financial, emotional, and even physical well-being. IMO, the first step should be counseling or therapy, trial separation if needed, not divorce.","1427846941"

"medicine","t5_2qhff","Thanks!

One thing that I've noticed in my own studies is that we all have very limited exposure to the literature and ""best practice"" in other disciplines.  As medicine evolves into a multi-disciplinary field, this lack of knowledge of other fields may compromise my patient care.  You don't have to look too hard to find this phenomenon.

For example, many surgeons are unaware of the evidence that shows that epidural anesthetics may reduce cancer recurrence after solid tumor resection, because those studies are published in anesthesia journals and not surgery journals.  Or as another example (a controversial comment, not meant to offend!), many trauma surgeons report frustration at their perceived over-utilization of TXA by ER docs, because the late complications of thrombosis are never seen by the emergency department.

This heterogeneity of knowledge translation has the potential to negatively impact patient care.  I perceive trauma as an obligate-multi-disciplinary field; minimizing those communal knowledge gaps can only be a good thing.","1427846943"

If you're gonna hit the gym, doing a perfectly ordinary strength training routine will help keep you well-rounded and - ideally - injury free. I do weighted pullups on back day, other exercises that I think translate pretty well to climbing:

- Weighted dips. They're antagonistic and having that kind of pushing strength actually makes some palm-off moves a lot easier.

- Deadlifts have been mentioned, they're great. They engage your whole core to keep you stable through the lift, and it hits a series of muscles that climbing doesn't.

- Abdominal work. Planks, V-sits, progressions for front levers or L-sits, leg raises. All pretty obvious. I find it's best to never leave out the obliques either, because your core needs to be strong from all angles.","1427846944"

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; Ok, according to you, belief is binary.

No, it's not ""according to me.""

It's according to a basic understanding of the laws of logic.

&gt; However, according to many of the philosophers I linked to, belief can be non-binary too.

I didn't see any of this in your links - of course, the ones I checked out were all to *books* and not to statements or arguments about belief.

If you have a specific statement which supports this claim, feel free to use it.

&gt; When you say that belief is binary, what exactly are you arguing? Are you arguing that everyone does think belief is binary? Are you arguing that not everyone does think belief is binary, but everyone should think that belief is binary? I just want to be very clear whether your position is one about facts of the world or advocacy.

I mean exactly what I said; *belief is binary.*

I don't particularly care whether or not everybody agrees that it is - any more than I particularly care whether people believe that the earth is flat.

Again, your claims rest on equivocation of belief with confidence in belief.

&gt; In any case, I hope you are not arguing that belief is binary by definition

Belief is binary by application of the laws of logic.

Identity; things are what they are. A is A. Belief in something is belief in something.

Non-contradiction; things are not what they are not. A is not not-A. Belief in something is not disbelief, nor lack of belief.

Excluded middle; either a proposition or its negation is true. Either A or not-A. You either believe, or you not-believe.","1427846945"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I bought (the parts for) my PC back in April of 2011. I spent about $1,200 on it. I'm still kicking myself for the dumbass blu-ray drive I bought that cost $55. I probably overspent on my CPU as well, but oh well it's got a bit more longevity.

Then I bought an SSD in 2012; that was an amazing decision. I got a 256GB for about $190. You can get one today for about half the cost. Still, no regrets. SSDs just make life better.

Then I upgraded my video card a few months ago during Black Friday. I bought a 760 GTX and sold my 560 GTX. The net cost ended up being was about $120.

I'm honestly really looking forward to another build. In just the short time that I've owned my machine, prices have fallen quite a bit. I'm probably going to do another build in 2016 (if I have the patience to wait that long, heh). I'd really like to get a 144hz monitor and a machine that can push that for new games. One of my favorite things about PC gamins is having (near) total control over my frame rate. I don't do 30 FPS unless I'm playing a console exclusive.

Here's my recent game activity on Steam:

* Far Cry 4 - Game is great although very similar to FC3, which can be good or bad. If you didn't like FC3 definitely don't play 4. I personally loved FC3 and am enjoying getting back into a similiar world.
* Dragon Age: Origins - I've always like Bioware and wanted to try this one. I'm about 9 hours in and liking it a lot so far. Feels similiar to KOTOR, in a good way.
* Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed - Got it on sale a few days ago during the Sega sale on Steam. It's a fun cart racer. I'm liking it, although it's not mind blowing.
* Borderlands The Pre-sequel - I'm going through this co-op with my brother. I loved BL2 and am loving this game as well. The low gravity physics are really fun.

"gamecollecting","t5_2s8fe","I would say it depends on what you have. 

For me, I never grabbed games only because they would 'gain' value, I just collected the games that looked like they were something I wanted to play. So the stuff I have is stuff that I don't see myself getting rid of because it isn't a question of value, they're just things I enjoy. 

The guys who bought games for an investment? My advice to them would be to cash out unless they plan to hold onto them for an extremely long time (like decades) to ride out the bubble and let them gain inherent value instead of speculative bubble value. And that's assuming you have stuff that's legit, severely rare. Games that get called 'rare' on ebay but were printed in the quadrillions and hoarded by resellers are going to crash and never recover. Smart money on those says cash out.

Intermediate bots teach you how the game works. They teach you that diving towers at level 2 is a stupid idea (and yet people still do it in regular play). They teach you that farming is far more important than getting a boat load of kills. They teach you the absolute basics of the game.

Jungling is not a basic game, it takes a very advanced knowledge of the game to attempt it. Jungling is not a matter of just sitting on your ass and farming until you're at six items. Jungling is about being the early game playmaker and setting the tempo for the whole game. You influence every lane, and so you have to understand every lane, which is far too much to ask for someone who's just level 17.

Someone who's level 17 is still learning the game and figuring out what the hell is going on. And you don't learn a lot by playing in a gimped lane or being shoehorned into a single champion because of said gimped lane. You also don't learn much in low level normals because nobody has any idea what the hell is going on, or you are paired against people who well know what's going in, and are utterly defeated. There's no learning from that at all, all you learn is how to play against people going tank ashe top, or how to surrender at 20 when someone plays kat mid and gets 20 kills and a full mejais.

If you want to learn jungle, you need to dedicate around a thousand games into it, and preferrably playing a very small selection of champions. By that time, you will have well moved beyond level 30 and will have probably landed in whatever rank you belong in. Learning a lane, especially one that's a wildcard and constantly changing is very, very hard and takes more games and knowledge than you can try to squeeze into a single reddit post.","1427846952"

From the beginning of his career, with ""Dreams"" and ""Lights Please"", he's effortlessly able to tell a story. This is something he's consistently been superb at throughout his career. On *Sideline Story*, in the song ""Lost Ones"", he narrates the perspectives of a pregnant girl and her boyfriend. On his 2013 album *Born Sinner*, on the track ""Runaway"", he raps:

&gt;[..]  
&gt;Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them  
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice  
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just  
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at  
9 months later got a baby, that's  
Not quite what you expected, but you  
Refuse to neglect it, cause you  
Know your wifey loves you, thus you refuse to accept it  
That's that type shit that turn my granny light-skinned  
Rich white man rule the nation still  
Only difference is we all slaves now, the chains concealed  
In our thoughts, if I follow my heart to save myself  
Could I run away from 50 mill like Dave Chappelle?  
You know...

(Still my thoughts if they wont compensate dis Q revert he gonna be even weaker than after 5.2 change). Reason is you still was able to do some kind of dmg by building nashor tooth and maxing W second. Now its 3 sec dot wich gonna work even worse cause you wont burst hard enough with 200 dmg Q while you has 500 ap and cause of it W gonna do lower % of dmg. (yea i know about lich bane but even it deals like 350 dmg with that amount of AP, while other champs can use dis item for oneshots with 1-2 spells examples-&gt;viktor,nida,tf). While fizz doesnt have any range tools to harass he can only jump on target and kill it or die to it.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;The only clearly defined aspect of atheism is the lack of belief in deities. Therefore, an atheist would disagree about truths that Christianity claims came from God.
Examples:
God is Love. The Trinity. God created the universe.

But there are other eternal truths they may both believe in, like logical or philosophical truths. Marcus Aurelius was an at best agnostic Roman emperor who persecuted Christians, but many Christians love his writings for statements such as this:
&gt; The nature of the universe is the nature of things that are. Now, things that are have kinship with things that are from the beginning. Further, this nature is styled Truth; and it is the first cause of all that is true.

Which is something both parties could agree on.

If a different program created exactly the same effect, but using a method that *did* hook into the Source engine, would you consider that to be cheating?

Of course you can. Maybe not the big long sentence I wrote as an example, but something short. You just send three keyboard commands as well as your one mouse command - Y, E, Enter.

&gt; 2) The argument that we shouldn't treat pigs and cows differently from the way we treat cats and dogs is used quite frequently. But if chickens, pigs, cows, fish, etc should be treated humanely, shouldn't all animals with a nervous system? Why is killing a cockroach or mosquito different from killing a turkey? 

Because they are pests that threaten a person's well-being. 

&gt; 3) Do vegans support abortion?

That is a loaded question. Some are pro-choice.","1427846959"

You very well may have been saved by Mike throwing that challenge. Did you have any indication when it happened that he was throwing it, and do you think you would have gone home then had your tribe lost?

 You didn’t get to see it, but Sierra put in a spectacular performance as well. We had no idea that Escameca threw that challenge—other than Kelly, of course. Going into that immunity challenge, Hali, Jenn and I had a deal to vote out Kelly if we had lost in order to weaken the original blue collars.

Stuff to remember:

1. **Titles make the post.**  
 Good titles are critical to quality content.
 * Explicitly, the suggest title button is usually terrible.
    
2. **Do people want to see this?**  
Content isn't limited to what's in the suggested submissions list but it's good to go over it.

3. **Is this the original source?**  
Nobody wants to click a link and then click a video. Just link the video.

4. **Can I add value to this post?**  
Most posts benefit from a little elbow grease.
 1. 9 times out of 10 you should link the source, not the article.
 2. Videos are better when linked at the relevant time.
 3. Gifs are easier to enjoy than a video. [Gfycat](http://gfycat.com/) has a convenient tool for making them.

If you're good with the conditions above, go ahead and post it on /r/StreetFighter using the link below.

You may be right about assault rifles and SMGs though, but until I've gone over the different weapons and looked I don't know for sure.  It might be okay.

SMGs are in a similar boat, I'd have to see what impact a +15% damage bonus has on various SMGs but I know there are a good amount that just barely don't hit 40 or have to sacrifice too much to hit 40, what would be made signficantly better.

"homeworld","t5_2re2q","A new button is placed next to build/launch/research on the right hand panel: this untranslated purple button brings up your inventory, showing you what is in your cargo hold. You will start out with a small amount of ammunition, Maintenance supplies (which are consumed while repairing), Hydrogen fuel (Consumed by strike craft in flight), Antimatter fuel (Consumed by hyperspacing, despite how it may appear ingame a hyperspace jump will never cost RUs) and Basic Supplies (consumed by your fleet at a set, steady rate. Don't run out, or you will lose RUs over time, be unable to hyperspace, and your fleet will travel at half velocity!) A good early-game move is to visit the trading stations around you and stock up on these staple supplies: a few hundred Basic Supplies, fifty Antimatter Fuel, and a hundred Maintenance Supplies will last you a good long time. To access these trading stations, use the sensor manager to see Objective pings lighting up the structures and ships that you can trade with. Move close to them via conventional drives or hyperspace jump and left-click on the trading station to bring up the trade menu.","1427846963"

Dire indeed for money in my Uni days, who is not. See a ad that says minimum pay $17/hr + commission. Commission and dubious are a complimentary term, but I thought I'd inquire. Bam, an interview. Put a suit on, stretch my cheek muscles, get to the interview, open the door. 40 - 50 others who thought they'd inquire. 

I see people go in to the office and come out with a air of arrogance. My name gets called, I walk in, after some simple questions, I was deemed right for the job. I questioned the salary structure but I was assured that my second interview would make everything clear. I walk out feeling confident.

I suit up, stretch my cheek muscles and open the door. The room is full of half the people form the first interview. This seems odd. I take a seat. Lady walks in - Do you want to make money? Because if you don't then you should leave right now. The half that didn't show for the interview were the smart ones, or were so dumb that they were deemed unfit to get scammed. 

We sell knives. When you recruit someone you can make commission from there sales. You start by selling to your family and friends first and move up. I stand up. Thanks for wasting my time, if anyone is smart they should leave this room. I walk out. The lady follows. I don't think you are the right person for this job. I looked at her and shake my head.

You can buy gold for yourself, or for others (if someone makes a post you really, really, like, you can 'gild' it, which puts a star on the post/comment and you buy them a month's worth of Reddit Gold.)

The joke here is that redditors with gold are the fat cat elite class that need to be torn down by the 99% of us non-gilded proletariat, so the Automoderator bot is blocking anyone with Reddit Gold from posting. (And somebody decided to gild the bot, amusingly)

She didn't teach us shit, she just gave us a map of the world and told us to color it in using colored pencils, but be sure not to go out of the lines! What the fuck is this? Grade 1? So I'm doing this fucking coloring, when she walks down the aisle and bumps into my arm, causing me to draw a small brown line into the ocean. I tried to fix it with an eraser, but she saw me and she SNAPPED.

She started screaming at what a stupid child I was for not following her instructions. I tried to point out that she bumped into my arm. Oh, and this line? This line was less than an inch long. IT COULDN'T EVEN HAVE BEEN A HALF FUCKING INCH.

Oh damn. I should have shut up because she started screaming about how DARE I blame HER for HOW STUPID of a child I was. She ripped everything off my desk onto the floor, then she DRAGGED my desk into the hallway, and screamed at me to pick all my stuff off the floor, and take it outside.

I was forced to do all my schoolwork in the hall that day. I cried most of the day.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","How many solo-queue players are quite like Incarnati0n though? He's not a one-trick pony like many top solo-queue players who wouldn't make good pros, he doesn't play ""pub-stomping"" champs that don't work in competitive (I believe this was a criticism of Mimer, for example, when he entered the scene?), and virtually every pro who has talked about him has nothing but good things to say about his talent. I can't think of too many other players who ever met that description. Pobelter (I think, I wasn't following the scene particularly closely when he originally appeared), Apdo, MaRin, Bjergsen, and... I'm out of names. Maybe Rush? Probably not to the same degree as the aforementioned.

Of the four I mentioned, 1 is a star (Bjergsen), 2 are solid to above-average players who haven't matched the hype (MaRin and Pobelter), and 1 is widely considered the best solo-queue player ever (Apdo). Frankly, if Incarnati0n turns out to be ""just"" another Pobelter/MaRin level player he could still really help a team, and if he's closer to Bjergsen well, that speaks for itself.

That's not to say he's a guaranteed success, he obviously isn't, but given his somewhat unique solo-queue success (when considering how dominating he was, the number of champs he played, and the length of time he maintained his status) I don't think it's unreasonable to say that he will probably be AT LEAST a solid professional.","1427846969"

There are infinite numbers between 0 and 1.
 There's .1 and .12 and .112 and an infinite collection of others. Of course, there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between 0 and 2, or between 0 and a million.

 Some infinities are bigger than other infinities. A writer we used to like taught us that. There are days, many of them, when I resent the size of my unbounded set. I want more numbers than I'm likely to get, and God, I want more numbers for Augustus Waters than he got. But, Gus, my love, I cannot tell you how thankful I am for our little infinity.

In terms of ""ducking"" Kovalev, that's not a strong argument in the scheme of things as Kovalev hasn't been the big name on the block for that long. It isn't as if this matchup has been demanded for 6 years. Although I grant you he certainly needs to address that demand soon.

Your point about Beterbiev is very interesting and if that had come to light this weekend when we recorded I would have certainly drawn that in as a big factor. My main point about escaping to cruiser is that the wide audience is oblivious to the talent and prospects in cruiser. Stevenson could fight in cruiser against RJJ, Bellew, Cleverly, Malik Scott, Steve Cunningham and Edwin and it would look like he was clearing out a who's who of the division when really there are a lot of unknown talents that they could ignore without causing public upset.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I honestly have an answer for this, though it is kinda sad eventually. This will eventually be trumped by marriage and kids being born, but I do think it's something everyone can relate to. This is also a bit of catharsis, too, so bear with me.

The best day of my life was July 9th, 2007. 

A little back-story. I had just graduated from high school. In high school, I wasn't unpopular; in fact, I was very social, becoming more so as I went from Freshman to Senior year. But I was very insecure, and sometimes perceived some people had a negative opinion of me (whether justified or not). I was also super, super insecure around girls (I'm a dude). Who wasn't at that age?

Sophomore year, through a friend, I met easily the most beautiful girl I had ever seen, lets call her Lexi. This girl was way, way, wayyyyy out of my league. Captain on the nationally recognized poms team, super popular with everyone, blond-haired blue-eyed bombshell, rockin body, and super confident. I could barely muster a word around her most of the time. 

That is, until Senior year. I had ended up becoming president of one of the more prominent clubs on campus, and had made the varsity soccer team. I also shared a few classes with Lexi. Somehow,  I found the courage to talk to this girl between classes, and we would share a walk to English class everyday. If you were to ask me how I found that courage today, I would still have no answer for you. But I found a way to make conversation with her, and we ended up becoming good friends. 

She was dating a guy for the majority of that time, so I wrote off my chances with her from lets say spring of senior year onward. But I still was very drawn to her, just in a more amicable way, if that makes sense. 

At around that same time, my parents surprised me with a houseboating trip where I could invite a group of my friends as a senior send off trip, in July. So, I corralled a group of disparate friends and invited everyone... including Lexi, who had fairly recently broken up with this guy. 

All week, things were a blast, and fairly normal between Lexie and I. Again, I had written things off between us. She ended up not feeling well one night, and I stayed up with her to take care of her. This must have struck a cord with her, because her behavior around me markedly shifted after that. 

On the last night of the trip, she lay down next to me, and we stayed up and talked all night under the stars (everyone slept on mats on the top deck). And then, all of a sudden, I kissed her. 

That kiss was a big deal for me. It was a milestone on how much I had grown up and become more confident. It was a signpost that I could do anything if I wanted it bad enough and set goals to achieve it; to be persistent, and above all, to be caring to people that matter to you. 

I've since grown up and had all kinds of adventures (and misadventures) with women, but that still stands out in my mind as one of the bigger deals in my life today. 

Unfortunately, she left me high in dry in a very disastrous first semester in college... which led me to distrusting women generally for a very, very long time. Her subsequent behavior (i.e., breaking my young and fragile heart) led me to eventually becoming a less trusting individual, but hey, you live and learn. 

We don't talk anymore, though she does keep up with some of my closer friends. I learned a couple of weeks ago she got engaged... and it didn't bother me at all. 

So yea, the night of July 9th, 2007 is frozen in time as one of, if not the, best days of my life, no doubt. I just need to find a way to get back to that high-water mark for that particular part of my life. Its a work in progress!

P.S. This girl, physically, is still top 20 of hottest girls I've met all time. Personality wise (the more important part)... eh... not so much (in hindsight).

"serialpodcast","t5_33vph","Motive speculation

In his recent interview, Jay expresses a lot of anger towards the magnet program and he also emphasizes regularly that he was the ""black kid who sold weed to a bunch of white kids.""  He states that football (he was a jock) paid for everything but all the money went to the magnet program. 

It is stated multiple times that Jay was an ""oreo"", or that his family had been criminals and the like.  He was the first of his family planning on going to college at the time of the trial.  It seems implied that Jay was not of the same mold as the rest of his piers (one of the reasons Adnan mysteriously chooses him as an accomplice) but had an urge to fit in. 

I know this is a stretch, but imagine if Jay was actually a really jealous guy and he also had an underlying resentment for the magnet program (Adnan being the poster boy for the program) and an inferiority complex about being ""the black kid who sold weed to white kids.""  When his longtime girlfriend took in interest in Adnan he became jealous, if not outwardly expressed to anyone besides his gf.  I mean Jay could not have been a great boyfriend if he forgot to get his gf a present--maybe they were having issues.

I also realize that birthdays can be extremely stressful and if a relationship is a little off, sometime emotions can be magnified.  Important dates like birthdays lead us to ask big questions about our lives, and perhaps the events surrounding the birthday present/threat of Adnan/unknown relationship troubles may have led Jay to take extreme action.  Plus, it seems very strange he barely spends any time with Stephanie on her birthday!!!  Like no time all day, maybe things were a little rough.  (random thought: maybe Adnan didn't call Hae after she disappeared because he had fallen for Stephanie at this point...)

Ok so when Adnan offered to let Jay borrow his car to buy his gf a present (which Adnan had not forgotten to do), things start to fall into place.  Now Jay is infuriated that Adnan would humiliate him and reinforce his fears of being inferior to the magnet program kids and the fact that Adnan is simply a better person than he will ever be.  He feels threatened--about losing his first love and maybe the most important person in his life.  When Jay takes Adnan's car/phone for the day he has time to think and I believe this is when he realizes that he now has the perfect opportunity to frame Adnan which serves two purposes:

a) his girlfriend, who he is deeply in love with, will no longer be threatened by Adnan.  Now, Jay will also no longer have to live up to the standard of Adnan (no more getting presents because Adnan did, etc., [I know this would bother me a lot, especially as a teenager in a long relationship])

b) The glory of the magnet program, and it's golden child, will be tarnished forever, maybe balancing the scales back in favor of the regular students like Jay a bit

One of the little girls chased us down and made sure I got a popsicle too. It was the sweetest thing and really brightened my day for some reason, thinking about the fact that these little kids saw that we were hot and tired walking around all day in our suits, and were thoughtful enough to chase us down to offer one of their popsicles.

And lately I've been getting lots of ""______ has force closed."" pop-ups which I never had, even when I use to run custom ROMs on a GS3.

So this left me wanting a phone with this criteria:

* Great camera
* Fast Processor
* Awesome screen
*  Premium feel (Im tired of the plastic)

I'm already use to having no SD card, removable battery, or not being waterproof. This left me with 1 phone: the GS6 64GB on Verizon. After playing with it for half an hour in Best Buy, Im so ready. Plus I love tap and pay and can't wait to use the Samsung Pay thing. Touchwiz is reskinable, so its no longer a problem. And I know that it won't be launching with a year old processor with a poorly calibrated screen like my current phone. After owning 3 Moto phones, the X was their 3rd strike, I'm done.

PS. Screw Motorola again because I will have lollipop on my GS6 before they even push it to my Moto X 2013.","1427846975"

Hearthstone is free.

There is always something going on in hearthstone compared to say wow where a large portion of the game is grinding this and that or waiting in queue's. 

Its a game you don't need to pay too much attention too when watching so you can get on with some work or even some wow or hearthstone whilst watching it on your second monitor. 

The balance is a lot better with lots of unique decks and counters unlike say wow PvP which is just FOTM rush. 

It has far better personality's, I find all the people who stream wow very grinding on the old ears as they make their-selves the biggest clown to get the biggest numbers; I am sure they are of course enjoying themselves and as they should its just my ears cant handle that assault for very long at all.

The prime-time shows (Flintstones, Jetsons, Scooby-Doo) were a little more sophisticated, but really followed the same formula.

Go back and work harder.’ It’s so strange to me, and there’s so much of it.”

What a bunch of pretentious nonsense. The best music that is being made at any given moment is being made in a living room or a garage without a record company breathing down an artist's neck for more, more, more. I'm sorry that technology allows almost any 18 year old kid (who seriously learns the craft) to produce her own music and give it as professional of an edge as your multi million dollar studio and overpriced engineer, Mr Flowers. Thank God the Internet lets that kid distribute it for free to get his name out there, too. This isn't the way Mr Flowers did it, of course, so he has to turn Gene Simmons and complain about the next generation just because. 

I do agree with him that rock radio is stagnant. But again he should take a closer look at the kid working from his living room instead of waiting for radio to save the day. The most creative, original, and interesting music isn't found on the radio. It's found in the basement shows and the coffee shops and the old symphony halls.

I didn't know what to say.

Years and years ago, I used to work for...oh, what was it...Terrace, Field and Smith, I think?  A law firm.  We weren't the *best*, if I'm being honest, but we did fairly well, and I lived a comfortable life.  As comfortable as could be expected, anyway.  It's hard to explain the way it weighs on you - knowing the way someone's going to pass, and not being able to do anything about it.  Nobody else seemed to be aware of it, this hovering death knell.  A calm, unassuming hue of blue, yet overbearing all the same.  I learned from a very young age not to talk to anyone about it.  In the best cast, people would think I was joking.  Worst case...well, I spent a few years seeing a psychiatrist, for that one.  Which is why, for the life of me, I never imagined I would tell Mr. Terrace about it.

I had just won a case, and Mr. Terrace had invited me out to a congratulatory dinner.  As we finished our meals, he lit up a cigarette.  He leaned over and offered me one, and I politely declined.

""Yeah, I know, bad for you and all that.  Wish I could quit, but I just can't seem to shake it.  They'll probably kill me sooner or later.""

And I had to open my big, stupid mouth.  ""Nah, subarac...""  I trailed off.  His focus went hazy, just for a second, and then he fixed his gaze on me.  *Subarachnoid hemorrhage*.  It was almost painful.  Damnit, how could I be so careless?  I had to change the subject...something, anything.  ""Uh...how about those Bears?""

His expression remained the same - quizzical, calculating.  It couldn't have been more than a few seconds, but the silence was thick and heavy.  Finally, he sighed.  ""There are about...three things wrong with what you just did.  One, I hate the Bears, and you should know that by now.  Second, that was the most transparent attempt to deflect my attention I may have ever seen, which, third, I would hope you have more respect for me than to think I wouldn't see through that.  Now, finish what you were going to say.""

I was, forgive the cliche, a deer in headlights.  The only thing I could manage to say was the truth.  ""S...subarachnoid hemorrhage.""  He furrowed his brow, and flipped out his cell.  His fingers bounced around, punching something in.  He sat, occassionally flicking his finger across the screen, his eyes darting back and forth.

""Huh..."" he muttered, as he slipped his phone back into his shirt pocket.  ""Well, that's an odd thing to say out of the blue.  When does it happen, then?""  He studied me, his eyes poking and prodding, digging for a sign that I was just having a bit of sick fun.

""I...I can't tell.""  And for some reason, the floodgates opened, and I just couldn't stop the words from falling out of my mouth.  ""I've seen them for as long as I can remember.  Everyone has it, some word over their heads, and all it says is how they die.  These horrid, grotesque things, these long, medical words, some of them I can't even pronounce, and they're this light blue color like it's supposed to be less horrible that way or something, I can't-"", Mr. Terrace held his hand up, signalling me to stop.

""Okay, whoa, slow down for a second.""  His attention flickered for a second, his brain processing everything.  He turned his head, surveying the room, and subtly pointed at a young woman sitting a few tables down.  ""Alright, how about that blonde woman, there?""  He flicked his ashes into the ashtray.  ""How's she go?""

I turned, pretending to stretch.  *Alcohol poisoning*.  Leaning back in, I turned back to face Mr. Terrace.  ""Alcohol poisoning.""  I felt slightly ill, as though this whole ordeal was going to turn sour very quickly.

Mr. Terrace simply nodded, and pointed to someone else, this time a portly gentleman sitting at the bar.  ""Uh-huh.  And him?  The fat guy in the little coat?""

I glanced over, and squinted through the smoke.  ""Han..Hantavirus?  Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.  I have no idea what that is.""  I slumped back against the chair, my mind racing.  He's going to think I'm off my nut.  He'll fire me...hell, I'll be lucky he doesn't have me admitted.  I sighed, heavily, and as though it were an incantation, our waiter appeared.

As he nabbed up a couple of plates, he asked, ""Anything else I can get for you gentlemen?""

""You know, actually, I think I'll have a rum and coke.""  Then he wiggled his eyebrows at me.  ""And what's your...uh...*poison*?""

I turned to look at our waiter.  I hadn't paid any attention to it earlier, but now here it was, as clear as day.  *Suicide*.  ""Su-"" ** *cough* ** ""S...sure, I'll just uh...I'll have the same.""  I pinched the bridge of my nose.  Twice in one day, for the *love of*.  I watched as our waiter walked off, and sighed again.  ""He uh...he's going to commit suicide.""

Mr. Terrace shook his head.  ""What a shame.  We should help him, don't you think?""

""I don't think we can.  I've tried before, and they never change.  I guess it's fate?""  I shrugged.

""Well, let's give it a shot.""  He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a brown, withered wallet.  Rifling through it, he tugged out some bills, and counted a few out.  Nodding his head in approval, he slid them under the glass, and tucked his wallet away.  ""Let's see if that doesn't change is mood.""  He smiled.

The waiter came back with our drinks, and again, Mr. Terrace's brows danced about, filled with intent.  I checked, even though I knew what it would say.  *Suicide*.  I shrugged.  ""Nope, nothing.""

Mr. Terrace rubbed his chin, the stubble of his 5 o'clock shadow audibly brushing against his thumb and forefinger.  ""Well...I'll make a wager with you.""  His eyes lit up, bright with a sense of...I wasn't sure what.  ""Say I actually die from this...Subarachnoid hemorrhage?  If that's what gets me, I'll have a separate will, and I'll leave you half of my estate.  Sound good?""

I laughed.  ""Sure, sure, and if you don't?""  I played along.

""Pfft, I'll be dead, what will I care?""  He held his hand out, and I shook it.  He smiled, and finished his drink in one swig.  ""See you at the office tomorrow, kid.""

""Yes, sir.  Have a good night.""  I watched as he walked out.

That's because she is not allowing him a say. He wants her to keep the child, she wont. He has to eventually give up and give in to her wishes, this doesn't mean that resentment wont build up.

&gt; He will suffer from depression but as you can see, she is not in the right state of mind to carry a pregnancy and raise an infant.

Doesn't she already have a baby? Yes, she's not in the right state of mind. I'm simply responding to the, eventually you're husband will see bs. I don't really think that's how it works if someone aborts a child you want to keep.

*A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial (n = 100) studied the effectiveness of a low-dose COC (ethinylestradiol 0.035 mg plus norethisterone 1 mg) compared to placebo for endometriosis-associated pain over 4 cycles. It concluded that there was a significant reduction in pain scores for the COC group compared to placebo [Harada et al, 2008].*

It mentions the combination that I found to be the best for me as I was telling you. There's more on endometriosis management from the link below. It is from the UK but brand names aren't used as much as the preparations, so it should be easy to cross-reference if you're looking for a pill or other method in particular.

Things like this also get exponentially smaller returns on investment of 'improved' processes to reduce incidents.

Another story: the last PTS handling ever worked on was with kid that was born to parents in the Sea Organization who wanted to leave (overts or PTS). What he was being given told in an effort to get it to stay was RADICALLY different than what I was fed. 

He was being told horror stories about how hard the outside world would be for him, when we were on the RPF...I knew from working with him that he wasn't a slacker (I'd hire him today if I had a job to give him), but his friends and family were trying to make him too scared to leave.

I think Korean is much more difficult because of all this. 

But I NEVER EVER think about any of them when I study, practice, and listen in on stuff. I think only: 

Wow. This language is awesome. Korean is just awesome. I love it. 

And that's why I think Korean is way easier to me than Spanish, Filipino, Russian, or any other language I've ever tried to learn, mostly because those other languages I decided to learn were required by schools or popular opinion argued the usefulness of those languages; never was I interested learning them.

My back was hurting one day after practice, and in savasana, I was laying a bit frog legged to not put too much pressure on it. The instructor that morning grabbed my ankles and swung my hips (not sure what this is called) and it loosened it up a bit. Definitely made a difference.  

The studio I went to was extremely small so most yogis knew each other and instructors typically knew you by name. Actually after reading through everyone's comments, I started to melt remembering how good it felt to get the neck/shoulder/temple massage from the instructors with the mint lotion.

Aye, lol'd.

&gt;  the creative process more fundamental then it's transient forms. After all, no form lasts forever; evolution forever turns out and changes all current forms

Aye, everything is in motion and a state of constant change and we grow into using different forms but those old forms still exist and could be remade. Or just exist in our minds alone still.

I suppose the key part of this line of thinking would be that everything that exists, is attempting to reach a perfect form. I.E a fish is trying to be the perfect thing for its given environment and purpose. In order for it to do this, it takes on certain attributes and physical/mental/emotional form. And that its basis behind it is intellect. The relationship between the optimal species, the selective pressures, and the generative processes of the D.N.A production themselves are essentially a collective form of intellect or natural intelligence that are naturally arising certain things. And these things are expressions of just intellect and creativity. 

I would say that this is natural selection. But I would say that natural selection is discovering and testing the limits of what can exist and of reality itself. [And from my view, could be seen as using the creative force that's God.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism#The_One)

**Requirements for Isolation** - Closed

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - Over ear, comfortable for 2-5 hr listening and gaming (CS:GO) sessions. (I have slightly bigger than normal ears, so some bigger sized earcups might be nice)

**Preferred tonal balance** - Fun sounding headphones for electronic music. Maybe moderate emphasis on bass, but I don't want it to destroy the quality of the mids, especially for hearing everything when gaming.

**Past headphones** - HE 400, which was fantastic however open backed, which in my new setup is going to be difficult for me to use, so I sold them.

**Preferred Music** - I listen to basically every subgenre of electronic music under the sun, and occasionally some hip hop. If you have time, [this is my spotify account](http://open.spotify.com/user/vasnormandy), and it'll give you a good idea of what I listen to.

That aside, If you do not enjoy playing a character who is forced to be naked all the time you absolutely shouldn't be forced to. If it means a wizard has to appear out of nowhere and goes ""*Alakazam you can wear clothes now*"" then so be it. Forcing someone to be nude all the time seems like an extremely transparent attempt to insert exhibitionism into the game, random roll or not.

If the GM really wants to retain the same curse just have clothes be reduced to burnt shreds equivalent of beggars rags instead or something. Way less creepy and mechanically just as restricting.","1427846998"

The alternative is to simply crack down with law enforcement and send them...where exactly?  Without state help or funding we have no where to shuffle the mentally ill.  Furthermore where would be send the non-violent, non-druggy, and non-mentally ill poor to work and live?  It is hard to transition from a city with available public transportation, food banks and homeless centers to a life in the suburbs/country.  I have met and know of people have made a life for themselves after homelessness.  There is a possibility of throwing ""the baby out with the bath water"" as they say.   There are many homeless teen runaways in SF.  We're almost damn famous for it.  Some are here for a high and for life in the big city but some were kicked out of the house for being LGBTQ.

"Lollapalooza","t5_2r3dl","Samsung Galaxy Stage: South headlining stage, likely where the biggest headliner each night will play. Massive field, can get very muddy if it rains even a little. 

Bud Light Stage: North headlining stage, likely where the 2nd biggest headliner will play each night. Sound great, I love this stage because the city backdrop behind it is awesome. My 2nd favorite stage. To give you an idea of the size of the fest, the distance from the South headliner stage is about 1 mile, and all other stages fit between the two, more or less. Plan for a 15 min walk between headlining stage during the day, closer to 30 mins due to the crowd later in the evening. 

Lake Shore stage: South sub-headliner stage. I find the sound can be average if you're too far away. 

Palladia Stage: North sub-headliner stage. The only permanent stage, and the worst stage in my opinion. It's too small, you have to stand on concrete and the sound is probably the worst in the fest. 

Perry's: The primarily EDM stage (there might be some hip hop headliners play Perry's depending on the North stage closer). It's a very different vibe to the rest of the fest. Delivery a younger group (a lot of whom can't handle whatever alcohol or drugs or whatever is in their system). I don't want to be too harsh because a lot of people love Perry's, but personally not my thing. In the 3 years of the fest I've been to, I think I've been to Perry's twice. 

The Grove: My favorite stage. Usually mid-card alternative artists, set in among the trees which makes a really nice, intimate setting for such a huge festival. Sound is great (though for a quieter band, there can be some bleeding of sound from Perry's). Due to the smaller size, there is bound to be a mis-scheduled band there which causes a massive clusterfuck overcrowding. Fun., Of Monsters and Men and The 1975 are the ones that come to mind immediately. 

BMI Stage: The smallest stage (except the kids stage). A lot of smaller, up-and-coming independent artists there. Really nice small stage looking over the lake. Great for sitting on the hill and relaxing when you need a break. 

Kids Stage: Just as it sounds, a stage for the kids. Small stage, I've never been but you do walk past it a lot. You'll be surprised by some of the acts that play there though. Portugal. The Man was there last year for a short set, and Perry usually does something there. ","1427846999"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","There is a difference between taking it upon ourselves to kill a sinner in violation of our nation's laws, and supporting the right and duty of our government to exercise justice against transgressors of the law. The fact of the matter is that homosexual acts are worthy of death just as fornication, adultery, bestiality, and incest are worthy of death. It is good when a government recognizes these things and exercises justice against evil-doers. When they are instead tolerated, accepted, and embraced it destroys the moral fabric of a nation and inevitably God's judgement will fall upon the nation in any case.

I believe God's judgement will fall on America, Canada, and the European nations which have arrogantly defied God's laws and rejected His perfect moral teachings. In their hubris these nations, the ""world leaders"", think they will not be brought low and humbled but indeed they shall be one way or another. If the people repent and if moral laws are restored then they will be spared God's judgement upon them. However if the people of these nations do not repent then judgement will come in the form of wars, civil strife, economic calamity, famine, drought, pestilence, and disease. These arrogant and haughty nations which believe their technological prowess will save them will discover that only God's mercy has preserved their peace to the extent it has been preserved.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","After reading as couple of your comments and seeing that you get those often I can tell you that you have a condition called blepharitis. When one of your eyelashes falls out and just one tiny little piece of dirt gets inside of the open pore infection begins. 
Most likely you can feel it coming and there is ways to stop it before it gets to that level (what we saw in the pictures). See your eye doc and ask him for a prescription, it's an antibiotic eye cream, use it couple times a day at first sign of discomfort along with hot compress and it should go away on its own. 
Unfortunately blepharitis doesn't go away but styes become less frequent after a while. Hope that helped ","1427847002"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","This is very long and mostly personal, but maybe you can relate, so I thought I would share:

Very similar stats, as you, 5'3 and got up to 160 as this past winter (my first after graduating college) was very sad for me. Took me a minute to realize I had passed sad and gotten into pity party mode months before realizing it. If you want to be harsh on yourself, be harsh for the right reasons. I was doing that same kind of thing all the time, hating how I looked, completely frustrated with it all and eating and drinking as a coping mechanism. 

I saw a picture of myself at the beginning of this year where I did not look like me. At 160 I was at the beach with my best friend, fully clothed and I saw the picture and honestly could not recognize myself. The weight was a physical part of not seeing myself but also my posture, my sadness, the lack of light in my eyes. I was not enjoying living in the way that I know I can, and want to. Whether the weight was the cause or effect or whatever combination of the both, it doesn't really matter.

Since then fitness and health is no longer a primarily long term thing for me. What I mean by that is that while I have a goal weight, ultimately I am doing this because at the end of some days, when I find myself wanting to go back into pity party mode, I ask myself if I did everything I could that day to feel my best. If I did, I sleep it off or practice self care in another way: mud mask, sappy movie, angry music whatever. If I didn't then I make sure to change whatever it is for the next day. Pity party days are become less and less frequent as time goes on. 

I know that when I workout I feel happier. When I eat healthy I feel lighter and more confident regardless of the fact that I'm not even halfway to my goal. I know that my body isn't going to change overnight no matter how well I stay in calories and workout. But it is not going to change at all if I spend an hour a day crying in front if the mirror instead of moving around or planning meals. 

I wouldn't dream of making the negative comments I am capable of making to anyone else. That would be cruel. I also wouldn't take that shit from anyone else's mouth. So who the hell do I think I am to talk to myself like that? 

My body is truly amazing. I appreciate it more and more every day, as I work to make both the physical and mental aspects of myself better in little ways. 

I am at 147 after 2 1/2 months and I feel a lot better for a much larger portion of my time. My body looks thinner, but more importantly, I feel more capable, stronger. I'm taking selfies again and captioning them with how fly I look, after hating every picture of myself for the last couple of months. It seems dumb but it's a big marker for me in terms of how I perceive myself. I don't mean this to be harsh, but it sounds like you know what steps to take to start feeling better. A half hour workout is 2% of your day. Do you want to feel better about yourself or not? Start now. ","1427847003"

"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","It's no coincidence that people almost always discover The Red Pill during a dark period of their lives.  Almost every TRP story I've heard starts with ""I was going through a really bad time!"" or ""I was starting to hate myself!"" or, more typically, they were resentful towards women because of a bad relationship.  (Or, of course, the classic 'the women I wanted to fuck didn't want to fuck me, and this enraged me!')  There's nothing more compelling to the human mind than the promise of easy answers.

TRP loves using code words and absurdly simplistic world views to try and sound profound, but at the end of the day, it's just a bunch of wounded men sharing a big pity party.  Which is why I don't hate Terpers, despite their belief that we Bloopers loathe them.  Their misogyny and cruelty deserves to be reported and mocked, but it's largely a group of men who have no idea how to properly deal with negative emotions.  And that's an unfortunate side effect of the macho horse shit that pervades our culture - the same culture, ironically, that TRP wishes to promote and endorse.

Anyhow, great piece, and I'm glad you saw the light.","1427847004"

If it's less than $25k you can try small claims court. It takes time but it's cheap. You will likely be awarded half your legal costs if you win. Rules are different in Canada.

Alternatively, you can use social media with FACTS.  Any placement firm depends on their subcontractors. If you are known for not paying subcontractors, you are going to go out of business soon. Especially if it's a well known firm like Procom, Tek or Eagle.

Finally do you have any contacts at the company you did the work.  Let them know what kind of company they are dealing with. Any company worth its salt would not want to be associated with a staffing company that does this.

In the future, if a staffing firm pays you late, make the end client aware of your dissatisfaction.  They are paying for you to perform and obviously you cannot perform 100% under duress.  

Unfortunately odds of success are probably low. I've learned to only use big staffing firms. Counterparty risk is very real.

Thanks for your advice, I honestly feel like the outpatient is doing more harm than good to my life. Who knows what will happen with my GF, i guess there were already issues with her just not being too involved with me and my son for the last little while. We have been together 5 years and we do love each other. She just removed our relationship status on facebook when she was mad over something really petty, so she is acting weird and it is causing me a lot of grief as of late especially because every girlfriend in my adult life since my son was born has cheated on me instead of ending the relationship first. I'll have to gauge where she is at and really clear up what I'm expecting out of the relationship too. Looking forward to just talking to her about it so whichever ways it goes just to be out of this limbo. I believe in know the things that make me happy too, good food, excercise, my son, music and friends. Having a job is really the only thing i need and i'll be happy, rehab mkrs me very unhappy, its not helping with any aspect of my life. I tries to bring this up to my family and they ended up screaming and accusing me of smoking pot again. Our family dynamic i total shit. I'd talk to them about anything but mostly they just end up yelling and blaming me if its anything difficult. I used to fight back when i was smoking but know they just act like jerks and i'm just calm but the result is the same, they blame me for starting an argument, say i am raging and accuse me of smoking pot. I'd also add that their concern really amplified the situation into paranoia, they would accuse me of being high when i wasn't and any time there was conflict it was blamed on pot. I was already weaning myself off although slowly before the intervention. I went from smoking in the day and being pretty active applying for jobs and also making dj mixes, to just smoking after 5, to just smoking at night. I feel i would be better off doing this for myself.","1427847005"

"Cynicalbrit","t5_2tqbt","You're accusing me of fabricating drama. Please elaborate. I'm simply stating that I hate his guts and that he is afraid to give his opinion (whatever it is), which is in direct conflict with his persona (which is the pro-consumer never afraid to say what needs to be said, always right about everything). Why *isn't* he saying what needs to be said? Why not? TB is one of his good friends, right? Why is he not saying ""God damn these idiots trying to get rid of him?"" Why not? Shitloads of people have asked him to make a statement, and yet... nothing. That's why I hate his guts. Because he only ever targets the low hanging fruit that is already the mainstream opinion. Because, when it came right down to it, he's too afraid to say what needs to be said.

I'm not ""crediting them with antagonism."" I'm don't care that TB said Wil Wheaton kept private... whatever it was they kept private. I'm not making things up. 

And, as to your statement:

&gt;This is in no way different from Anti-GG persons saying: ""You do not support everything we say, you must be a gator."" 

No. That's incorrect. I'm saying he's a coward because he's afraid to publicly defend his friend who really did nothing wrong (and had cancer) from his other friends who were trying to somehow get rid of him.","1427847007"

""A number of early European automobile manufacturers experimented with the automotive use of aircraft engines, including Hispano-Suiza, Renault, and Rolls-Royce, although it was Fiat that made perhaps the first true aero-engined car when it created the Tipo S76 in 1910. Nicknamed ""The Beast of Turin"", the vehicle consisted of a 1907-08 Fiat production chassis mated to a six-cylinder Tipo S76DA airship engine that had a displacement of 28.4 liters (1,730 cu in) and developed 300 hp (220 kW) at 1,900 rpm. Daryl Murphy speculates that the car was built to capture the world land speed record, which at the time stood at 125.95 mph (202.70 km/h) after the Blitzen Benz had established the mark at the English track Brooklands in 1909. While the Tipo S76 did race at Brooklands, it never exceeded more than about 90 mph (140 km/h). It later returned to continental Europe and ultimately disappeared during World War I.""","1427847012"

http://human-stupidity.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/race_intelligence_adoption_rushtonsm1.jpg

&gt;“The best evidence for the genetic basis of race-IQ differences comes from trans-racial adoption studies of Oriental children, Black children, and Mixed-Race children. All these children have been adopted by White parents at an early age and have grown up in middle-class White homes.”

&gt;Chart 9 summarizes the results for Oriental children adopted into White middle-class homes.
Korean and Vietnamese babies from poor backgrounds, many of whom were malnourished, were adopted by White American and Belgian families. When they grew up, they excelled in school. The IQs of the adopted Oriental children were 10 or more points higher than the national average for the country they grew up in. Trans-racial adoption does not increase or decrease IQ. The three-way pattern of race differences in IQ remains.”

&gt;The best way to assess the effects of culture and socioeconomic status is to look at trans-racial adoptions, which combine one race's genes with another's environment. Among Asian-American kids, biological norms seem to prevail. In one study, kids adopted from Southeast Asia, half of whom had been hospitalized for malnutrition, outscored the U.S. IQ average by 20 points. In another study, kids adopted from Korea outscored the U.S. average by two to 12 points, depending on their degree of malnutrition. In a third study, Korean kids adopted in Belgium outscored the Belgian average by at least 10 points, regardless of their adoptive parents' socioeconomic status.

This study followed malnourished Korean orphans adopted into American families after the age of 2, and only the **severely** malnourished didn't score above the mean, and just barely. The others surpassed it! So at the very least, we have strong evidence that even in extreme circumstances this has less of an impact than many would like to believe.

http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/30/10/1734.full.pdf

Something many are often (willfully) ignorant of is that heritability of IQ increases with age, with it only being around 30% in the early years, then rising to around 80% by adulthood. So the show you the results of longitudinal studies, but only up to a certain age, since they saw the results they wanted and looked no further, as if they didn't continue after that point.

Yes.  Because what other regulatory body would deal with it?  


&gt; but that would be true if you were driving drunk, too (as your policy is usually void if you're drunk)

Your policy may be void to cover personal expenses, damage to your own car or health etc.  But I am almost sure that your insurance is still 100% applicable to pay out for damages to others and their property regardless of if your drunk or not.  You may void your own coverage, but the damage you can do to others is still covered.  And that is the nexus of the personal/commercial insurance issue.  If you damage another person while in a commercial role, you invalidate the personal insurance that pays out for damage to other people.  Thus why its so important to have commercial grade insurance; its for the damage you can do to others.  ","1427847013"

That's fine, we can just agree to disagree.  But to your other points...

&gt; it is a beer from people who love beer. And that, to me, is just as important.

See that's the thing.  Damn near all beers are made by people who love beers.  Sure maybe not the CEO of ABI (although maybe, I don't know) but I'd bet you the brewers and researchers at everyone of those big beer corporations love beer every bit as much as your average beeritor.  Actually at least one of them - /u/ABInBevAMA - is a beeritor and will argue as passionately about beer as any of us.  In fact, with the growing trendiness of beer and beer-made-billionaires, I don't think you can even assume every craft brewer and owner is passionate about beer.  I know I question the passion (and business sense) of a few local breweries.  Long story short, passion for beer isn't really a good metric for determining anything about a brewery, in part because it's not really one we can accurately measure.

&gt; f I start making a light lager as a homebrewer, start selling it local bars, start a micro-brewery, start distribution to other states and make my little slice of beer heaven, according to your standards, I wouldn't be a craft brewer. 

I mean, if all you are making is a cheap light lager of the same quality as your average macro lager (or a beer of similar quality sold at craft prices ala Shiner Bock), then no - you would not fit the /u/evarigan1 definition of craft. This is why I don't think size should really factor into it.  But mind you that is not to say that style dictates whether it is craft or not.  That is why I compared Yuengling to two delicious craft lagers in Eliot Ness and Hoponius Union - lagers can be done well... I mean, just look at Germany.  It's the individual beer, not the style.  Most macro beers just happen to be lagers.

&gt;  But if AB buys The Alchemist and puts Heady Topper cans in stores across the nation, would you celebrate the delicious craft beer?

Me personally - I can honestly say I would.  I still sing the praises of beers like BCBS and come next fall the pumpkin lineup of Elysian.  Great beer deserves credit no matter who makes it.  The better question is, would I still buy it... that's a question I'm becoming more and more unsure of the answer as time goes on. But... that's really a completely different topic.

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Though I am a novitiate, and agree with you, I think we do need to account for three major items:

1. In Hebrews 8, and therefore Jeremiah 31, which is one of the three places in the NT we get ""new"" vs. ""old"" language, the old is characterized 100% as Sinai, implying that only that covenant has been displaced:  ""not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.""

2. In 2 Corinthians 3, we have the ""new"" contrasted with the ""old"" in terms of ""letters written on stone"" vs. ""heart written on by Spirit"" and some pretty strong language about the stone written ministry.

3. Last, of course, Galatians 3, where the Sinai covenant does sound like a temporary over-lay on the Abrahamic.

I would suggest as solution that we need to always be careful to speak of *changing administrations of the Covenant* rather than simply change of covenants.  I also would suggest *there is no such thing as an un-administered covenant*.  I would suggest the words don't even make sense together.  From this perspective, I can see that the Sinaitic administration is simply the next administration, with fuller revelation and fuller redemptive realization to that of the Abrahamic.  Therefore, when the NT author(s) speak of the Old being displaced by the New, he is merely referring to it's fullest before-Christ administration being replaced by the New and much fuller administration.  And second, I can see Paul in Galatians really arguing that Christ has always been the substance of the Covenant of Grace, so the administration at Sinai does not erase that promise.

What do you think of that line of thinking?

Edit: Oh, I need to note also, that it is quite possible that some of the earthly manifestations of the covenant promises were indeed related to the peoples' vow of covenant performance.  Also, I would add that the increase in legal clarity was attached also to an increase in means of atonement, though both were typical and shadows of Christ. ","1427847017"

[Symbols have a `#to_proc` method](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Symbol.html#method-i-to_proc). The `&amp;:upcase` is just syntactic sugar for calling the `to_proc` method on `:upcase` symbol. This method returns a Proc, if you're not familiar with Procs, you can think of them as wrappers for blocks. The Proc takes an argument and sends itself as the message.

So the Symbol#to_proc implementation might look like this:

    def to_proc
       Proc.new do |obj|
         obj.send(self)
       end
    end","1427847020"

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","I haven't played HM, but I have played Rune Factory 4 (also developed and published by Marvelous! and Xseed.

I've played Story of Seasons (SoS) for about three hours today so far. The introduction is very long, almost 20 minutes. There are 6 bachelors and 6 bachelorettes. So far though I'm unable to improve relationships (in any noticeable or apparent ways). I'm sure this is something I'll have to advance into. Right now I'm stuck only able to do farming and trading related tasks.

As far as farming goes, it is less tedious than in RF4. Rather than plant individual seeds you plant and harvest 9 at a time by default. The trading/selling is interesting. You aren't able to sell/trade everyday, instead merchants come to town on certain days. So far there are merchants coming/leaving in 3 or 4 day intervals. Each merchant is from a different country and pay extra for certain crops. So there's definitly a more dynamic strategy of planting crops that will be ready for certain merchants who pay more for them. 

As far as the bachelor/bachelorettes go, they aren't nearly as dynamic as they are in RF4. Maybe once I can actually start improving relationships they'll show personality, but so far all interaction with them is boring. 

The game is still really fun to play though. The devs have certainly focused on easing you into the game and not throwing everything at you immediately. 

I was actually going to buy a HM game a couple months ago after I finished RF4, but then I saw SoS was coming out, so I decided to wait and buy SoS instead.

Overall, I don't have any complaints so far (again, I'm only 3 hours in). I can't comment on if SoS is worth it when compared to HM, but if you liked RF4 you'll probably enjoy SoS as well. There is no combat in the game (so far, and I don't think there will be), so it's probably much more like what I've heard about HM.

Feel free to ask me questions about it if there's anything else you want to know.","1427847024"

Poverty *has* always existed, to varying degrees.  Take an anthropology course, or study ancient civilizations.  Even the most advanced societies have not eliminated poverty.  The feasibility of this endeavor is tantamount to the libertarian/anarcho-capitalist utopia of a voluntary, stateless society. 

I don't accept that people should live in abject poverty.  The only solution to the problem is a global, classless society, which is not in any sense an achievable end.

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","I might try:

    #include &lt;math.h&gt;

    int main(){

        int number;
             //log in math.h is natural log (ln)
        printf(""%d"", log(number)/log(2));
    }

where [ ] denotes base, and ( ) denotes parameter:

log[y](x) / log[y](n) = log[n](x), and since any number in binary with only a single bit will be an exponent of 2, you can easily find the number place of it by simply doing log base 2.

It would be really awesome if RW and DW became detachments instead of augmented CAD.  ObSec is cool and all, but there are so many other fluffy rules you could give them for running those companies as dedicated fighting forces. 

My biggest problem with the 6th Ed codex (besides the retarded pricing of units vs C:SM) was that it was just C:SM.  There wasn't really a lot that made the codex stand out; C:SM even got to unlock bikes as troops, so it seemed to just hunker down beneath the shadow of White Scars.  I would like to see the codex diverge from C:SM and focus on this idea of the knights of the Inner Circle hunting the...err...heretics.

"estimation","t5_2uh0h","From some government site I found:

&gt; Financial provisions are made for managing all kinds of civilian radioactive waste. The cost of managing and disposing of nuclear power plant wastes represents about 5% of the total cost of the electricity generated.

so, not much when compared to income.

then I found this:

&gt; Disposal by shooting the wastes into deep space or the sun

&gt;Cost and the risk of an accident during launch has kept space disposal from being taken seriously. With the current cost of putting objects in orbit at around $10,000 per pound, and given that the U.S. inventory of spent fuel and high-level waste is of the order of 100,000 metric tons, not including the heavy shielding that would be required, the costs with present technology would be prohibitive, even if the risks of radioactive wastes crashing back to earth could be managed somehow.

&gt; But if one wanted to dispose of only the very long-lived waste, e.g., technetium-99, cesium-135, iodine-129, and the long-lived actinides, then the amounts are much more manageable, of the order of a few million kilograms for all current U.S. wastes. [...]

It was a prepared statement for some news site.

100,000 metric tons? Well, a google search for how much we have put into orbit so far turns up 

&gt; I did find one source that estimates that 255 tons were put into orbit in 2007. That year is probably not representative.

lets ignore that last part and totally assume it is. In 100 years we would launch around 25,500 metric tons. So, at the rate we are currently launching, we would take about 400 years to launch the **current stock** into space.

Roughly 20% of all launches appear to fail. In our scenario, that would amount to a strong possibility of nuklear fallout.

Uhm. I'm tired. Current numbers point to ""a lot"" and ""it would be an environmental catastrophe"". I would seam to require a space industry many orders of magnitude larger than the one we have.","1427847031"

**Interest payments:**

$8438.85 **=23.75 * 29.61 * 12**, or $29.61 over 285 months.

Take away the initial $1500 purchase for each and you get about $17,000 and $7,000

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Honestly, I think it's very hard for people to provide critique on your plan. There are so many nuances to pairing items together—for instance, high-waisted pants may go better with slightly cropped tops, some tops may be more formal and pair well with only a few shoes, some pants may be too long or short at the hem for certain shoes. 

You've provided a lot of information (in your list of items) but not a lot of context. For instance—what weather conditions will you have? What dress codes will you need to regularly adhere to? How often do you plan on doing laundry?

And then—what silhouettes and types of pairings (certain cuts of sweaters with certain cuts of pants?) are you most interested in? What outfits are you already comfortable with?

Is this capsule all stuff you already own, or partly stuff you're going to buy? I definitely recommend buying clothing slowly, so you can figure out how to incorporate a few pieces at a time into your existing wardrobe and your everyday life. It's actually quite tough to buy in bulk and get rid of in bulk.

*(edit)* Forgot to add, but it's also really helpful to take pictures of all your stuff/collect stock pictures from online, and possibly assemble them all into a single graphic. It's much easier to get an overview of a capsule wardrobe, and see possible pairings that way.","1427847034"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Tests aren't about enjoyment, they're for something (usually important), and they're often synonymous with a struggle. Life being a test implies that you're alive in order to fulfill something, not to play it like a frivolous game. It's basically another way of saying that life is hard, but that it has a purpose. All that is a way to make you serious about life and also to put you at peace, because it's all ""good in the end""... (As long as you do the right things, fulfill the purpose.)


Humans see that reality is confusing, endlessly oscillating between chaos and order, pain and pleasure, that nothing is certain, that people are born and die randomly and trivially... in other words, that this whole universe seems awfully like something not made with us in mind; not for us or what we want in any way. But at the same time reality is constantly in your face, every moment of your life, so it's obviously important; otherwise you wouldn't be here forced to experience it, right? And there are at least some things about this universe that seem to be made for us in mind, so that's good enough. That's the ""logic"" or intuition behind what motivates the formation of religions. It's the obsession with the teleological aspects of reality, instead of taking a bigger picture which would put them in context, in balance with things in the universe that obviously aren't ""for us"". That's why reasonable people see that intelligent design isn't science, because it presupposes purpose, a will, that exists beside cause and effect in describing the universe. But the religious can't help themselves: ""hands are obviously made for us to hold things"", ""bees exist to give humans honey"", ""love exists for humans to enjoy""... ""holes in the ground exist so puddles can form"" and not the other way around (which is actually the case).


Religions exploit the complexity of reality as we experience and (try to) comprehend it by making up stories, narratives, rules that make sense to most. And most humans are more emotional than reasonable, so that's what sells. Religion isn't a conspiracy, even if it's sometimes used like that. It emerged from human minds and society. It's a form of social self-control, and not necessarily for the betterment of society or other kinds of progress. Whether belief in heaven and hell help society progress or not is up for debate, but, like in biological evolution, what matters for its existence was and is only survival, not your or my ideas of societal progress. It's natural selection; if society collectively evolves to be more progressive, if reason and skepticism is such an important part of it, then dogmatic belief in an afterlife will just fade away, like the legs off of a whale. If we don't get that ""anti-meteor shield"" up in space and fully functional soon enough, because of superstitious afterlife beliefs, that'll just be the universe or evolution saying: ""don't make yourself too comfortable with fantasy, instead use your mind to build spaceships... or you'll go extinct"".


Beside all that, ""why spend time building anything if there's paradise at the end?"". It's the same question as the one asked to atheists, ""why not commit suicide if life is going to end anyway""... and the answers are similar: it's because that's not what life is about; paradise is a reward, not a goal; the end of life isn't the goal, but just an event that doesn't define your whole life. Think of religious beliefs and terminology as different kinds of language. To some, atheists may seem like aimless, evil people because they define God as love and order, morality. Belief in hell and heaven is about belief in justice and hope... this is just my hypothesis, but I think that's the fundamental nature of religion. What we see when talking to religious people — all the logical fallacies and stubborn apologetics — is a result of a cognitive dissonance between conflicting symbols and their definitions, often within the mind of the believer himself. People know that burning innocents is evil, and they know that nonbelievers aren't evil, but because they have to make a choice, between ""good"" emotions and ""bad"" emotions, they choose what makes them feel good even if it makes no sense — innocent people in hell for being nonbelievers. So talking to the religious about their beliefs is not so much about making them see the truth, it's about teaching them a new language that doesn't destroy their hopes and that doesn't give more power to their fears. Or teaching them that they can have their hopes and peace without also necessarily having ancient fables that force you to believe in ""hellfire for kuffar Eskimos"".","1427847034"

"Dodgers","t5_2ra0i","here's who you've gotta know.

KERSHAW. MVP. GOAT. Best pitcher in baseball, nasty curveball

PUIG. MVP (runner up). Amazing right fielder who acts like he's five and we love him.

A-Gon. Mr. Consistent. Really good 1st baseman

JOCCCCCC. The new guy. Probably gonna be a beast. He's our center fielder.

and of course PACO! he's not the greatest relief pitcher but he has a special place in my heart. he's only on our team like half the time cuz of dumb contracts forcing others on our roster.

hey did I miss anyone","1427847040"
"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","Possibly because of how the question was phrased, most answers here are focusing on comparisons of individuals (poachers, elephants). The question, however, seems to rest on the context, in which there are people willing to kill a poacher to save an elephant. The reason (some) people are willing to do this isn't about comparing the values of the organisms--it's about comparing impacts on ecosystems. Losing one elephant (currently) has a much more negative impact on its local (and possibly non-local) ecosystem than losing one poacher does. This is a major reason why we care about preserving species, and an even bigger reason why we care about preserving large species of which there are relatively few (versus, say, getting all up in arms about an endangered mosquito variant). 

The arguments here are interesting, but I think many of them miss a fundamental point (though certainly not the only possible one) about why anyone would care to ask this question.","1427847040"

"UVA","t5_2rcav","&gt; Cursing isn't illegal and it is not universal code for being drunk. 

Yes, in public it is. It's included in the same law as the drunk in public law.

&gt; He was charged for resisting arrest but that doesn't mean he actually resisted arrested.

You can see him resisting on the video. He might not have been drunk, but he was clearly resisting arrest.

&gt; It's a bullshit charge in a lot of cases and more than likely it is in this case since he was charged with resisting arrest without violence.

That's because he just resisted arrest and didn't attempt to use violence against them. It's still resisting arrest.

&gt; Also why is getting an injury ""not surprising"" when the officer's themselves admit he wasn't violent? 

Because he resisted... That's going to make the entire process difficult and everybody involved at higher risk, even if only slightly.

I wouldn't be surprised, or bothered, if the charges were dropped. It seems like they were mistaken in thinking they needed to approach him and then things got out of hand. Even though he shares some responsibility there it doesn't seem very useful to follow through with charges once it is determined that he wasn't actually doing anything wrong except for resisting.","1427847044"

So, if I have my CoD character, and I make a version of the game in 8bit, does that somehow change the character?  If I pull the view out to third person, does that?  If I turn it into a strategy game, does that?

"mac","t5_2qh4u","New Mac, I'm talking the one you want to transfer stuff to. Do you have stuff on that computer to? As a rule of thumb, you should never be without backups. So if you don't have a proper backup, make one now. (hard drives fail, laptops get stolen and data get corrupted.)

Right click (or cmd click) on Macintosh HD and go to properties. It should give you the amount used. That's the space your files take up. Add both of them up (both comptuters) and multiply by 2.
So if one uses 300GB and the other 100GB then you need 800GB.

So, personally, in hat case I would get at least a 1TB external drive, which means you do a complete time machine backup of *both* computers before messing with anything.

You've been lucky so far, don't push your luck, make backups now before doing anything else.","1427847045"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","He could take Elastigirl easily. Spidey can go toe-to-toe with Mr. Fantastic, who's superior to her in every way.

Dash really isn't that fast for a speedster. He was *shocked* that he could run on water, which only requires you to move around 30 m/s. He can't be too much faster than that. He can't really hurt Spider-Man, either. His speed-enhanced punches were barely hurting normal humans. It might be hard for Peter to tag him, but it's really only going to take one hit.

2 hits from the Omnidroid made Violet pass out when they hit her shield. Spidey could probably deliver the same amount of force as that in a few hits, as well, if Violet tried to trap him. Invisibility might be trouble, but again, Violet's powers are pretty much all defensive. She has no way of putting him down.

I'd say Mr. Incredible is strong enough to do some serious damage to Spidey if he hits him (based off the stopping the train feat), but he's way too slow to get a hit in if Spidey's being serious. Spidey should take it, but if he gets hit more than a few times he would be in trouble. He shouldn't get hit too much, though.

I would give this one to the Incredibles, slightly. Dash and Violet's hamster-ball would be effective, and  Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl between them have decades of fighting experience. A fastball special from Mr. Incredible could be pretty effective if Elastigirl were to smother Spidey and let the others try to take him down from there. It would be close, but a 4-on-1 is pretty good odds in favor of the Incredibles.

Spider-Man. And it's not close. Bloodlusted, he could probably take half of them out in a few seconds.

Violet creates a force field in Spidey's brain. Game over.

Nothing against the streamers that I watch, as they are all skilled PvPers, but all of the technical aspect of PvP seems to have been removed in this game. This past week I've watched hundreds of fights by a dozen streamers, and every single one comes down to R1 and parry spam with lots of healing and dashing mixed in. The mechanic of regaining health by inflicting damage only further encourages spam.

You'll have a hard time finding something with the exact black accents that coat has, so I suggest opting for a plain red coat and then add the black material yourself.  (If you don't want to sew, just use Aleene's No Sew Fabric Glue - stuff works.)

Also, if you want that same length, make sure you measure yourself and compare to the coat's measurements.  Coat lengths can be tricky, especially if you're a tall guy and shopping in the women's section.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Alright, I've heard versions that say everything that exists must have a cause as the first premise. This version that states there cannot be an infinite regress of causes is essentially just saying that the universe is eternal. Something can't exist for no reason or without cause, therefore there has to be something that is beyond needing to be caused, something that has always been. That thing could be a quantum fluctuation, since by definition ""nothing"" meaning ""absolute non-existence"" can never actually ""be"", therefore when we talk about ""being"" or existence, there must always ""be"" something.

So in this version, it seems that all the argument is doing is defining a thing called God into existence, since the next part is essentially: we call this uncaused thing, whatever it is, God. Why would this be even remotely helpful in justifying belief in God anyway? This seems like useless preamble for the dirty business of trying to actually prove a God that is in any way distinguishable from a universe where no God exists. What is the purpose of the argument?","1427847051"

"rage","t5_2qil2","Sure I acknowledge it's unhealthy. Never said it wasn't. While I think that some illnesses attributed to obesity are kind of silly. Like ""you'll have less migraines"". I know that my PCOS is directly related to the fact that excess fat in the female body produces more hormones which directly fucks up your cycle, and that fucks with you fertility. Its one of the reasons I've taken steps to change my life so that in a few years when I get married and have kids it'll be a possibility. 

My main argument is that if I decide to live my life in a way that hurts no one else, but ultimately kills me... what is it to you? And unlike cocaine, or drinking or even smoking. People get INCREDIBLY AGGRESSIVE with me for saying things like ""I love who I am and what I look like."" If I don't end that statement with the phrase ""but I'm working out and losing weight to be healthy"" people get really aggressive with me. I've gotten LOADS of emails over the past few days for simply asking in a post down thread for people to ""accept"" us as we are. I simply asked people to not be rude assholes to fat people and people are trying to argue with me in PM about fatness. I just say hey ""treat us with respect and don't you know post photos of us without our permission online in web forums in order to mock us"". 

What is it about weight and body size that makes people feel so superior and act aggressive. I mean should you be proud of your hot fit body sure! But unless you're rubbing your hot fit body on me... I sure enough don't care. Should I exalt those who have dedicated their lives to sculpting their bodies? Are people mad that's not my particular goal? 

And in regard to the aggressiveness: I mean, if I told you I had Cancer and I was working with my doctor to do the best for myself and my body but until my treatment is complete... I'm trying my best to remain happy despite things not being how I want them to be. It would be cruel to shriek and scream at me and tell me I'm going to die. If a cancer patient said ""I'm tired of fighting and after years of working to fix this illness nothing has worked. I give up."" Is the correct response to scream at her? Or do you support that persons right to die as they see fit? Die in a way that makes them happy? 

Fatness has a specific response that is puzzling to me.  People assume that people give up, but it's a frustrating thing to be fat. It's very hard no matter what road you go down. ","1427847052"

"funny","t5_2qh33","I was working for a family businesses that employed about 30 people. The attitude was somewhat

""Come in sick, I know you can at least sweep or something.""


Being young (17), I was foolish. I came in day 3 of 5 days off with Bronchitis. Just to do the right thing. When the boss arrived, he asked how I was doing. I thought he meant like, how's the illness progressing.
I said 
""Yeah.... All right I guess. I'm on my way."" At an enthusiastic level of 4/10. I was still very sick  but wanted to ""do the rightie.""

The boss got in my face, and got aggressive.
""You get the fuck out of my face, and you come back tomorrow 110% or you're fucking finished here! you got that?!""

I left work straight for the doctors. He gave me another week off, I called the boss to let him know.

The day I was due back he called me into his office and fired me.


Here's the thing. For the last 2 years I had been working 45 hours a week (5 hours on a Saturday.) but my pay slip either said that I worked 40 hours, or didn't state how many hours I worked at all.
I was getting wise to this. I discovered the reason they paid me at an inflated rate for less hours than actually worked was because hours 40-45 should have been paid at double time. They were cheating my salary.

So they owed me 5x hours a week at double my hourly wage ($11.00) for the last 100 weeks. $10,000. Fucking boooyah. That, added to my unlawful dismissal compensation was worth an approx $14k paycheque.


The complaint meant they were investigated by Wageline (Australian government agency). All my ex co-workers also found themselves with come pretty tidy back-pay themselves.

And you need to learn to stop typing LOL all of the time, but I digress.

You made the statement, ""There is no safe level...."" Yet that is never stated in either of the articles you posted. The only thing that is actually being said is that too much of this shit is bad for you (No duh), and that it should be treated differently than it is now by the various regulatory agencies. Specifically, they recommend that sugar be removed from the Generally Regarded as Safe list, which allows manufacturers to put *unlimited* amounts of sugar in food. This further goes to support the notion that excess levels of sugar are harmful.

Edit: The following paragraph was made well before the above post was edited. Unlike the OP, I will not remove or change my posts without noting why the changes were made. **Especially** if doing so makes the person I'm having a discussion with look stupid.

The fact is that article doesn't purport to say what a safe level is, simply that an excess level is harmful enough that regulatory action should be considered. For someone who is so keen to suggest that I can't read a scientific paper, you may want to do a little bit of self-reflecting on how well you truly understand what that article is saying.","1427847056"

Also, when you look at this from the cultural angle, a society that is becoming *more* stratified according to gender norms after progress was made is just trying to band-aid its own problems. I don't believe that children, whose brains are genderless and who have no exposure to the sex hormone their bodies naturally create, can have a ""hardwired"" gender identity that justifies synthetically dunking themselves in the opposite sex hormone for the rest of their life.","1427847057"

WRONG !

As he ages, he becomes more infertile, the possibility of defects rise, and at 38 it's pretty old to be having a kid. 

At 45 his child will be 6. His FIRST child. How is he supposed to be an active dad at 45 ? At 50 ? Given present mortality rates he is unlikely to even see his grandkids if he is children follow the same pattern and have kids later in life. 

You've killed the best years of his life knowing full well that you didn't want children. You just selfishly stole another year for your own happiness, and want to steal more from him ? 

This is exactly what other people would say if you were a man doing this to a woman, and really there is no difference with the situations being reversed. Now he is at LEAST 3-5 years away from being properly ready to find a new partner if he started looking TODAY, based on criteria of comparability, financial stability, likelihood of staying together as a family, and a whole heap of other factors. 

You aren't ready to be a mother, and you really shouldn't do it unless you want it. To do it now to keep the relationship is the most selfish thing you could do (beyond what you've already done even), you should go apologise to him now and tell him to find himself a new life partner and that this should have happened 8 years ago.

First off, welcome. And thanks for agreeing to help us test Gmail. By now you probably know the key ways in which Gmail differs from traditional webmail services. Searching instead of filing. A free gigabyte of storage. Messages displayed in context as conversations.

So what else is new?

Gmail has many other special features that will become apparent as you use your account. You’ll find answers to most of your questions in our searchable help section, which includes a Getting Started guide. You'll find information there on such topics as:

*How to use address auto-complete
*Setting up filters for incoming mail
*Using advanced search options

You may also have noticed some text ads or related links to the right of this message. They're placed there in the same way that ads are placed alongside Google search results and, through our AdSense program, on content pages across the web. The matching of ads to content in your Gmail messages is performed entirely by computers; never by people. Because the ads and links are matched to information that is of interest to you, we hope you'll find them relevant and useful.

You're one of the very first people to use Gmail. Your input will help determine how it evolves, so we encourage you to send your feedback, suggestions and questions to us. But mostly, we hope you'll enjoy experimenting with Google's approach to email.


Speedy Delivery,

The Gmail Team

So then you're left with the customer who wants fully-functional Smart TV features — like email, browsing &amp; streaming — but doesn't have a (Funcional enough) Smart TV; or the know-how to plug-in and use an Android box, Pi, etc.

That seems like a really small audience, and getting smaller every year as people phase out older TVs. Am I missing some really obvious consumer function?","1427847059"

If, in every instance you have to either invent additional details, or dramatically change the nature of the scenario in order to support your point of view, then you must be acknowledging, at least on some level, that the assessment of the original scenario as being equivalent to rape is incorrect.","1427847061"

Three weeks later she gets married to this guy 15 years older than her and sent me through an emotional rollercoaster. I had to deal with acceptance and how I might be shunned because of the dispute. I still dwell in that from time to time.2. A good friend of mine has a kid and is married. But she constantly complains about not having money (she has no job). She also struggles with taking care of her child because of lack of money. She always talks about she doesn't know what to do but knows that she has to get a job.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I've been thinking about this a bit further and I've thought about some notable filmmakers and how they achieved their status:

- Kevin Smith sold his comic book collection and maxed out ~10 credit cards to self finance 'Clerks.'

- Darren Aranofsky took donations from friends and families to make 'Pi' for ~$60,000, he also filmed illegally and had someone watch out for police who could come and shut the shoot down.

- Oren Peli spent $15,000 and used his own house as the films location to direct 'Paranormal Activity'

- Stanley Kubrick, after being rejected from college, used his own savings to fund a short documentary that was sold for a small profit. He made a few more shorts and then used more savings to self-finance his first featue.

- Shane Carruth shot 'Primer' on a $7,000 budget and in addition to writing and directing he also played the lead role, and was the cinematographer, editor and composer.

- James Wan directed a short film called 'Saw' which he co-wrote with Leigh Whannel on a $3,000 budget in 8 days which led to Lionsgate funding a feature version.

- Quentin Tarantino originally planned to shoot 'Resevoir Dogs' on a budget of $30,000 but Harvey Keitel liked the script so much he agreed to be in the film leading to investors putting $1.5 million into the movies production.

There are plenty, plenty more examples like this. My point is that their gender here is irrelevant, the only thing that was important with their projects was the quality and the marketability. I can't think of a single story like this from a female director. These guys risked a lot to get where they are and made a ton of sacrifices. Their drive and talent got them into the industry, not the fact they have dicks. ","1427847062"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The 1930s heat is also a break from correlation with CO2.

Not necessarily, it's possible you're looking at different data than I am, but it would seem to spike in temperature while CO2 steadily climbs.  Either way if the argument is ""look at this one instance of something deviating slightly, that disproves the entire thing!"" that's not a particularly compelling one.

&gt;Global warming has diverted attention away from traditional pollution which is actually KNOWN to be harmful.

You know what, that's a completely reasonable and fair point.  Global warming has definitely been heavily publicized in recent years.  But it has also been insanely publicized and denied constantly, so the sort of PR push has really been important in bringing what could arguably be one of the greatest issues of our time to the forefront of people's consciousness.  I do agree with you that we shouldn't cease attempts at conservation and cleaning our environment in other ways, however.

&gt;I beg to differ. Solar has huge problems of power storage and loss of efficiency of the cells if covered by clouds (even partially over an array). It burns out batteries and the like. Wind is dependent on local conditions. There's a story of a British town that put up a wind generator. The town hated it because it was an eye sore and it was also calculated that the town wouldn't recoup it's money from the thing for about 50,000 years.

Fair points, and I'd argue that the efficacy of these methods is largely dependent on local conditions, these aren't a universal solution, but could supplement power on a large scale if implemented properly, in appropriate areas.

And I agree with you on nuclear power.  I just wanted to point out that it has a bit of a PR problem and runs risks other than just being a money pit, like solar and wind might end up as.  It requires an entire supporting suite of regulations and bureaucrats to make it run properly.  Not to say we shouldn't be working on it.

&gt;There's a couple of European flops. Germany paid for solar coverage...despite it being cloudy all the time and Spain has huge budget problems from their wind farms not turning out good.

True enough, point is it's conceivably possible to get a lot out of these technologies.

&gt;The cheaper the energy, the easier it is to do a lot of new things. Now, if you restrict energy usage...you hurt that advancement in technology.

Okay, I get your logic, I just disagree on a couple points.  1) we don't need to restrict energy usage, we just need to shift to other sources of energy.  It doesn't need to be significantly more expensive, and I'd argue that if we made cheap, renewable energy more abundant, we would have a much smaller reliance on fossil fuels, and ultimately make energy cheaper for the poor and developing, since scarcity will be less of an issue.  2) I disagree that we should take a risk on putting off efforts to curb human induced global warming in the hope that we will advance quickly enough to a point where we have widespread alternative energy in the form of a yet undeveloped method of energy production.  3) I would argue that embracing the idea that humans are inducing global warming and that we need to incentivize alternative energies, I could see us developing yet undiscovered/implemented forms of alternative energy.

I think enacting various cap and trade policies and a host of other regs would actually be conducive to your ultimate goal.  Again this is my opinion.

&gt;I don't believe the science around Climate Change is very scientific. I think the advocacy around it is very very un-scientific. Insistence on agreeing with the majority, the idea of ""settled science"", the injection of interpretive opinion...its all not scientific. 

Very little of what I'm saying is just 'my opinion.'  the only times I've given my opinion is to respond to instances of you giving your own opinion.  Furthermore, I agree that a lot of the advocacy around global warming is unscientific, shit, a lot of it is just marketing schemes and PR.  But the science behind it is solid, about as solid as we can get without having a second earth to start experimenting on.","1427847064"

What does it mean to ask for ""more"" ? He also compared it favorably to ""special treatment"" for war veterans:

&gt;“Within common law we have ample precedents for **special compensatory programs**…. And you will remember that America adopted a policy of special treatment for her millions of veterans after the war.”

Not that you cared, but that's what he actually thought.

**edit**, before you get even stupider:

&gt;The ancient common law has always provided a remedy for the appropriation of the labor of one human being by another. This law should be made to apply for American Negroes.

Removing Assad could potentially be catastrophic on a level we havent dealt with before.  Not only do we have no further stabilizing force (like the US military, which I am not willing to sacrifice on this mission) but you want to begin removing the only actual governmental and recognized power in the region.

How on earth could anyone expect that to turn out well when you already have IS running amuck in northern Syria (largely thanks to funding from different sources, not necessarily Assad's fault either) and the country already in the middle of a massive Civil War with dozens upon dozens of factions vying for power?

I hate to say it dude, but yeah, Assad is the most stable thing in that country right now.  It blows, for sure... but your strategy, as much as you hate to admit it, is akin to the US strategy in Iraq... but in far, far, far worse circumstances.

You are wanting us to depose a dictator in the middle of a warzone with actors we would like to see in power less than him.. jesus christ, atleast Iraq was peaceful when we went in.. and the US military was there to lock it down and it still became a clusterfuck.

Now you want to willy nilly pick up dictators out of the middleast and see what happens?

I've done a number of key salary negotiations over my career and friends have came to me for advice as well.

In terms of disclosing your salary it may have been better to say ""if you decide that I am right for the position we can chat about salary. I am sure we can iron out the details because I am really excited about X Y and Z (about the position)."" By disclosing salary it gives away one of your bargaining chips (the real problem is that some companies base your salary on previous salaries, instead it should be based upon the value you bring to the organization).

I'm happy to go over some of these things for you (for free). Just shoot me a message and I'll send over my contact information.

Our backyard was so small we had ""6 and out"", so if you hit it over the fence you got 6 and then had to sneak into the other persons yard, get the ball and you were out. I know you were just trolling Arin in the video, but part of me would have loved to have seen a ""Ross Rules"" game of cricket. :D

Doesn't work for me.  Now I have no contacts on my phone and when I try to use the contacts app it crashes
 
I don't want to have to do a factory reset if at all possible.  too many things that I would need to re-install and set back up again.

EDIT:  fixed it.  somehow.  i went in and starting removing some apps that i didn't need anymore to figure what I exactly needed to re-install for a system restore.
in doing so I did two things that I think may have helped fix  the issue:
I deselected all of the apps that I had setup as device administrators and I went in and uninstalled all of the updates to the builtin amazon apps (I tried delete forgetting they were baked into the rom) and disabled them.  
Then i noticed I wasn't getting the error anymore.  went and tried contacts and it started fine and forced google to restore my backup contacts.
Only other issue so far was google wasn't bring back search results,  but simply uninstalled app updates and restored them through the play store","1427847068"

You aren't the first to mention the unnecessary speed of the CPU, but I am the kind of person to buy something once and stick with it for years and years UNLESS it will somehow make sense to get a cheaper build now because games aren't as advanced as a 4790/gtx 980 could handle UNTIL ~5 years from now when the 4790/gtx 980 setup would be cheaper and more appropriate for that time period's games. But I don't think the difference in price from now to then would justify buying something else now and replacing it in a few years. I hope this makes sense, I'm def trying to minimize the cost but bottom line is that I don't want to replace something 1/3/5 years from now because the benefit of having the component NOW that I would otherwise get in 1/3/5 years is more than the cost difference.

Why would he execute over 30,000 Red Army personnel, including 50 out of the 57 corps commanders, 154 out of the 186 divisional commanders and 401 out of 456 colonels in the late 1930s, then ignore their replacements when they told him the Germans were positioning to attack in 1941?

Why would he lie to &amp; piss off his only allies if he knew he would need their help to avoid catastrophe?

We have had a few not so glorifying moments, some leaders have done some screwed up things, and people see that. And there are plenty of really screwed up things going on right now in our government that powerful people refuse to address. Some people forget all the good things america brought and continues to bring.

Its like, if I give you a thousand bucks you'll love me, if 6 months later I punch you in the face when I'm drunk you won't want to hang out with me any more. People remember the bad and most recent a lot easier. A man born 20 years ago in a country with a constitution, in a house with electric lighting, air conditioning, a car in the garage, who can hop on a plane and go pretty much anywhere, is watching the news on TV about how many people died in Iraq. Its hard for him to keep all the good in context and not get a little angry.

Not to mention, the advances of propaganda as a science, peoples viewpoints can be affected very easily and cheaply, and there are people that want you to view america as bad. An american does something g bad, a leader is a corrupt scumbag, and people don't blame them, they blame america. They frame it so that Americans do bad things because of america and good people do good things in spite of america.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Gonna start off soft here.  Contraceptives are a positive things for the well being of many families for more reasons than just the one narrow view that has been placed here.  I don't see how anyone can justify taking away all of the positives of a contraceptive medication for the notion of a conjugal act without intent of pregnancy being evil.
Here's a short rundown on some of the alternative benefits of contraceptives for women. http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/other-reasons-to-take-the-pill

Next up I would like to address the idea that the banning of contraceptives would reduce the cases of premarital sex by forcing abstinence as the only form of birth control. 
It doesn't work.  We tried it.  It failed.  just as much sex more pregnancy more abortion. You can check these figures out too if you would like.http://www.webmd.com/sex/birth-control/features/other-reasons-to-take-the-pill
Lastly, and this is where the waters might get rough, it is irresponsible to suggest that by using contraceptives while married you are doing something evil or withholding yourself from your partner.  If you are not, for whatever reason, ready to conceive a child with your partner, wed or not, use contraceptives. It will be much better for your family for you to not struggle with or regret the event. ","1427847069"

Years ago, I'd frequent a 24-hour AutoZone late at night for small parts I needed right away, and I usually saw a customer returning a Duralast lifetime warranted alternator after just a few months, and I once heard two customers say they had a total of 5 fail between them in a year.   

  
My NAPA rebuilt with 2-year warranty quit charging after 18 months.  Its replacement did the same, just past the 2-year warranty, but Visa's warranty extension paid for its replacement.

So maybe Bosch or Denso for rebuilts?


My factory original Ford starter failed by shorting, and because I was afraid of rebuilts I bought a brand new one made by Rotating Electric, which claimed to manufacture its products in the US, but that could have simply meant they assembled Chinese parts.  It cost less than a Ford Motorcraft rebuilt, but its Bendix gear still makes a slight grinding in the cold.  Realigning the starter hasn't helped.

I'm loving it so far. The Sound Blaster X7 was surprisingly good for an audiophile device as I mainly bought it for the gaming features that I subsequently found I never used, but the Oppo is noticeably more transparent and detailed. I find that it's a hair more neutral compared to the slight warmth of the X7, and notes have more body as well. The X7 always felt a little thin at times, but it was a stellar all-in-one device for the price.

One final note: I find the HA-1 has a blacker background with my active monitors. It seems to have a lower noise floor than the X7 although the specs of both don't seem to bear that out for some reason.

"IronThronePowers","t5_361bq","&gt;Lord Rickard Stark of Winterfell, Warden of the North,

&gt;I write to inform you of the events concerning the Three Sisters and Lord Tristan Sunderland. I received a letter attached from Lord Hornwood that had Sunderland declaring himself king. I must offer my thanks again to Lord Hornwood for aiding the Vale and all the realms in this incident. I received it while Sunderland was already enroute to the Eyrie.

&gt;When he arrived I questioned him on this and on where his fleet currently was. Sunderland informed me they were all in port. I later wrote to his son, who also informed me the fleet was all in port. My patrols however spotted twenty-seven longships in the coastal waters outside the Paps enroute back to Three Sisters. Lord Tristan denies any knowledge of this and the purpose of this fleet is still being ascertained. I have not received any merchants or messages from the Paps in some time though.

&gt;Please share this information with your vassal, Lord Manderly. I have asked Lord Tristan's son, Ser Aegon Sunderland, to split his thirty longships in three. The three groups of ten longships will be sent to three different holdfasts. With only 15 Galleys and 5 Cogs remaining in the Three Sisters. 

&gt;I would ask if you and your bannermen were willing to be prepared to begin a blockade around the Three Sisters. Once my patrols have spotted the longships leaving then I will send a raven to White Harbor, alerting your ships to move in at this point. If matters become resolved I will send word to White Harbor that your aid is no longer necessary. If they worsen, then I will send word the same way.

&gt;*Jon Arryn, Lord of the Eyrie, Defender of the Vale*

****

*attached letter*

&gt;Lord Hornwood

&gt;I have no interest in smashing the Manderly ""fleet"", so long as he stays away from my lands and ships.

&gt;As for Gulltown, I doubt we will be friends any time soon, especially after what I have planned.

It's also *possible* that my ass is really my head and I can't tell the difference. Shouldn't we teach that too? It's *possible*. 

Seriously, what a stupid fucking comment. Science doesn't teach the things that are possible, it teaches the things that there are evidence of. 

Yes, some things we currently don't know for a fact and we teach them, but there is direct and measurable evidence of these things. For example, we can't explain exactly what causes gravity (at a quantum level). But we can directly measure and explain its effects. There is ample evidence that gravity is real, thus we teach it as science.

The existence of God or intelligent design is a non-falsifiable position. It can't be disproved. And there is currently zero evidence of God's existence. And I say this as someone who believes in God.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","**Abstract:** 

&gt; Community traumatic events such as mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and natural or man-made disasters have the potential to disrupt student learning in numerous ways. 

&gt; For example, these events can reduce instructional time by causing teacher and student absences, school closures, and disturbances to usual classroom routines. 

&gt; Similarly, they might also disrupt home environments. 

&gt; This paper uses a quasi-experimental research design to identify the effects of the 2002 ""Beltway Sniper"" attacks on student achievement in Virginia's public schools. 

&gt; In order to identify the causal impact of these events, the empirical analysis uses a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits geographic variation in schools' proximity to the attacks. 

&gt; The main results indicate that the attacks significantly reduced school-level proficiency rates in schools within five miles of an attack. 

&gt; Evidence of a causal effect is most robust for third grade reading and third and fifth grade math proficiency, suggesting that the shootings caused a decline in school proficiency rates of about five to nine percentage points. 

&gt; Particularly concerning from an equity standpoint, these effects appear to be entirely driven by achievement declines in schools that serve higher proportions of racial minority and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. 

&gt; Finally, results from supplementary analyses suggest that these deleterious effects faded out in subsequent years.","1427847074"

rwaeh, my friend, every time I see that orange letter and I see it's from you I have an orgasm.

&gt;Did I say that you said it? It fits with ""most likely kill civilians for the small chance you might hit the rebels.""

Yet you didn't deny that was the logic behind it! You simply said: ""Inform me when the rebels don't hide among the buildings with the civilians. "" Tell me dear friend, what is your logic behind it's use?

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","Fixing for better readibility:

For everyone who can't see it:

Added Relics. New unique, soulbound items with really powerful effects. There's currently 6 of them along with 2 extras.

Added the ability to enter the Alfheim dimension through the portal if you have a specific item...

Added fluid mana that you can store in railcraft, buildcraft, and so on, tanks. The conversion rate isn't 1:1 if you do it both ways.

Added multiblock mana pools, 3x3, 5x5 and even 7x7. They store way more than normal ones, as expected.

Added radius viewer functionality to the Manaseer Monocle. While looking at a flower with it equipped one will be able to see the flower's effective range visually.

Added the Black Hole Talisman. It's the unlimited cobblestone works. Wait, that's from thaumic tinkerer. STOP STEALING CODE FROM YOURSELF VAZKII YOU SCUMLORD

Added the Resolute Ivy, an Ivy item similar to the Timeless Ivy that lets you keep the item it's attached to through death.

Added the Reverse Mana Fluxfield that transforms RF to mana. Again, the conversion rate isn't too generous so get your big reactors dusted.

Added the Spriggan Mana Tablet, an upgrade to the normal Mana Tablet using Dragonstones that holds 10x as much.

Botania tile entities no longer register non-prefixed names (eg, ""pump"" rather than ""botania:pump""). This fixes incompatibilities with mods that have similar names. Since both names were registered previously, transition will work with no problems.

Changed the Gaia Guardian to be able to be killed by fake players after I got spammed with requests for it.

Edited the Thaumcraft Integration page to tell the user that the Botanurgist's Inkwell needs to be charged when created.

Entries that come from botania addons will not have the ""View Online"" button.

Fixed Ancient Wills rendering on a Terrasteel Helmet that has Phantom Ink.

Fixed double flowers being able to be duplicated through bone meal.

Fixed glimmering flowers being able to be bonemealed to create double flowers.

Fixed the Hyacidus, Pollidisiac, Tigerseye, Narslimmus and Medumone having their range be lower in one side.

Fixed the Phantom Ink recipe working if more than one piece of armor is put in the grid.

Floral Powder can now dye sheep.

Moved the Life Aggregator to the Ender Artifacts section and made it require two Bottles of Ender Air.

Redid all the flowers, spreaders and pool HUDs. They now show exactly (in numbers) how much mana the blocks have, are producing and are receiving.

Removed the cooldown on Thermalilies and returned their production rate to the original speed they were at before.

The Mana Pump will not stop outputting a comparator signal once it stops pumping as long as it has a cart on the rail.

[API] Added IManaFluidContainer and IRFManaAcceptor for compatibility.

[API] Added IRelic, IWireframeCoordinateListProvider, ISequentialBreaker.

[API] Added RELIC EnumRarity.

[API] Added breakOnAllCursors() to the internal method handler.

[API] Increased version number to 37.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Hmm. OK, given the time constraints, I will second someone else's suggestion for the immediate future. It needs to be on the record that you object to this, and the reasons why. I recommend that when you are privately with the doctor and your mom is not in the room, you tell the doctor (and/or other medical staff in the private area who are taking data from you) how you feel and why. Request that they put it on the chart/enter it in. (assuming the UK medical charting is far more electronic than in the US)

I don't know what will happen after that, and I'm not familiar with UK medical ethics or anything, but it's very likely that will put a temporary  moratorium on the procedure. I cannot predict your mom's reaction, or subsequent manipulation and control. 

What will happen if you don't tell the doctor, though, is one of 2 things.
1) You will get the surgery and regret it
2) You will get the surgery and it will improve your quality of life after recovery, but you will carry resentment against your mother forever and that's a huge can of worms","1427847077"

"Metal","t5_2qhud","It's definitely not arbitrary. Since we're so passionate about metal, we're very interested in what makes it what it is. I draw lines a little more fluidly than most of the others around here, and the lines I draw are pretty blurry, but I agree with /u/TOUCHER_OF_SHEEP that lines need to be drawn. BtBaM definitely seems to come from more of a hardcore/metalcore background. I think Tesseract is definitely a progressive metal band; their most overt influences are Meshuggah, whose current music is an extrapolation of their origins in tech thrash; Dream Theater, which I'm sure everyone here agrees are a progressive metal band; and Periphery, which has a much more metalcore background but also draws from Meshuggah. One way or another, it doesn't affect my view of the music. Metal or not, I find BtBaM to be a little incoherent, and metal or not, I think Tesseract is fucking fantastic. 

But there are also very good pragmatic reasons for not wanting those sorts of bands on this particular forum. Since those bands, and their respective styles, are so much more popular than the music that most shredditors are primarily interested in, there's a danger that they would overwhelm the forum if we were more permissible with what gets posted here. There are other subreddits available for those genres, so there's no need to have them crowding things up around here.","1427847079"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I got one of those cheap peanut vibes at first to see if I like vibes in general.  Then I did my homework on them by reading reviews and deciding what was best for me/what I wanted out of a toy.

Amazon is definitely a good place to look and has a big selection.  I ended up going for the Lelo Ina as my first actual toy and super glad I did.  It was quiet, a safe material, easy to clean, rechargeable (batteries are a hassle - it's totally worth it!), fun, high quality, and lasted a long time.  The price was also worth it to me (Lelo runs more expensive but they're far cheaper on Amazon).  When the motors finally died after four years of frequent use, I immediately replaced it with the Ina 2.  I recently added the Lelo Lyla 2 to my (small) collection: it's marketed as a couple's and club vibe since it can be controlled by a wireless remote, but it works really well solo, too.  It also happens to be waterproof.

Also, get toy cleaner specific to the kind of toy you get or something you can easily clean/maintain.  And toy-specific lube if you need that.  You don't want to use anything silicone based on a silicone toy material, for example, because it'll break down.  Water-based lube and cleaner are safe bets for something like silicone.","1427847080"

Naturally, the good king followed with another wager, not one to be outdone, and with a pleasure barge no less! 

""I thought we were having a simple drinking contest--not pulling our cocks out and measuring them against one another,"" she said as she refilled her drinking vessel once more, emptying it again in a succession of only a few long swallows. A few drops dribbled onto her chin, but she was quick to wipe them clean on a sleeve. 

Meanwhile, Jast had returned, unable to be left out of the fun it seemed. ""And here I thought you'd had quite of enough of...losing things,"" she said to Jaime. His indication that either she or Kara were the lesser of the group gathered simply based on their sex quickly raised her ire, and Runa had started to stand, tossing off her cloak and pushing up sleeves as if she were about to punch Jast in the face *yet again*. 

""I'll show *you* poor thing,"" she said, but Volmark's arm around her shoulders as he reclaimed his seat kept her within her own. And his words that followed? Far too close to the truth than he realized, which caused her angry expression to fall away to a smirk. Placated for now, Runa simply took up a pitcher a poured yet another drink for herself, as well as Arryk, curling in against him quite comfortably for the time being. ","1427847082"

For bio, I've always relied on the textbook, but there are LOTS of online resources for bio, especially since it's remained consistent for many years.

Last but not least, there's [openstaxcollege](https://openstaxcollege.org/), which has free (and HIGHLY recommended!) textbooks for multiple subjects, including [chem](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/chemistry), [bio](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/biology), and [physics](https://openstaxcollege.org/textbooks/college-physics).

"kansascity","t5_2qngc","Uber has been a god-send here in Los Angeles, where taxi service is notoriously unreliable and untrustworthy. It's not about saving money here, it's about reliability. It's about knowing that your ride will actually show up. It's about riding in a nice clean car instead of a thrashed old cab with sticky seats, windows that won't open and a worn out suspension. It's about not getting ripped off by a cabbie who ""forgets"" to trip the meter, then insists ""It's okay my friend, I make this trip all the time and know how much to charge."" (That happened roughly 50% of the time whenever I got a cab at the airport.) It's about not having to carry the exact combination of bills to pay the driver, or having to carry cash at all. 

I have no doubt that the cab businesses are suffering. Fuck them, if they weren't so shitty and outdated there wouldn't be a need for an alternative. OTOH, restaurants and bars are greatly benefiting, since people now have reliable transportation and needn't worry about going out and having dinner and a few drinks. 

Taxi services have *always* been a notoriously shady and unreliable business, nothing makes me happier than to see the free market make them squirm.

You cannot know for sure how you'll react, but the chances are strong that you will at the very least be resentful of your husband. 

I heard someone say today that any marriage that survives to the first birthday of a baby is a ""good"" one. Having babies is very very very hard on your relationship. Even if you love that kid with every fiber of your being, that doesn't mean you won't end up hating your husband for ""making"" you have that baby. Don't do this. Tell your husband the truth and let the chips fall where they may.

I say this as someone who decided with my husband that we wanted and so had and love our kid, but the marriage almost didn't survive. It took us two years to get back to somewhat normal. We are far from the only ones. 

Bluntly: The odds are good that you will lose your relationship either way. Do you want to do that with a baby that you never really wanted or with the freedom to walk away and have a happy life with someone else who feels the same way you do?","1427847084"

It is very difficult for either a Pro-Life Democrat or a Pro-Choice Republican to get themselves elected anymore. The reason the more extreme conservatives are the loudest voice in the pro-life movement is because there are very few alternatives. We rarely have the option to vote for the candidate who is both pro-life and pro marriage equality for example. I personally believe that the abortion issue is a human rights issue. I believe that a fetus should be given both human and constitutional rights. I believe that innocent lives are being destroyed.

People also do have a porn folder. Sometimes it's easier to just click open your folder and look at something trusted and true. Plus, it's sometimes hard to find a video you liked again, unless you bookmark it (which often people don't do, especially if he's expecting you to use his internet). 

I think you're taking this way too personal, and need to relax. 

Being upset about a porn he has only seems logical if it was something seriously disturbing, like child pornography, bestiality, rape, etc. Something that would be seriously wrong. He watching a woman give head just seems normal.","1427847089"

"heat","t5_2s8tk","Phoenix was at their best a couple of seasons ago with Dragic kicking out to Channing Fry for threes. Now imagine that same dynamic but instead Bosh can actually defend and has a decent mid range game. Now add old man game Wade, Deng who can still defend the oppositions best offensive player, plus a legit athletic 7 foot rim protector and you have the makings of a solid contending starting 5 (think Dallas in 10-11 for example). The only thing missing is consistent 3 point shooting and depth at center (I love Birdman but he is getting up there in age.) 

Basically imo, we need some 3 and D guys and we will be a legit title contender. The only thing is I would love for our younger guys to grow into those pieces, like Ennis/Beasley/Walker becoming legit 3 and D players, but I'm not sure we can wait for them to develop since we are trying to contend as soon as next season. Either way, its going to be an interesting off season because if Riley is aggressive at acquiring veterans this off season will show me if he believes this team as constructed can compete for a title... and that probably means some of younger pieces will be moved for veterans (ex: Ennis,Walker,Beasley replaced by Wilson Chandler)","1427847091"

*I guess it's because... [Insert the five or so things that you said afterward]

I don't want to discourage you more than you seem to be but pep talks and motivational posters aren't going to get you over porn. Only a sound mind and body will enable you to enable yourself to quit. By that I mean, you can try all you want to *say* ""I'll quit this time"" over and over, but you end up failing (Trust me, I've done it multiple times). You have to be willing to put yourself through troublesome times and hardships in order to change your habits, because in the end your habits are reflections of your *lifestyle*. A lifestyle is a hard thing to change, but once you've managed to change the things that impose bad habits on you (You've *enabled* yourself, as I said earlier), you can start to make the choices that you know you have to make to change your life (You've enabled yourself *to then enable yourself* to change).

See what I mean? Now, don't take my word as fact. I'm only on day 5. What do I know? But I will say, don't tell yourself ""I can't quit"". That just means that you're setting yourself up to fail. To beat porn you've got to work, one harsh footstep at a time.

Let's not be infatuated with labels.

Furthermore, I don't think we've gotten to the point where computing technology has radically changed the workforce, rather than complement it. I think we will see that with the rise of artificial intelligence, the change in society will be more comparable to that of the industrial revolution. It took close to 2 centuries for the IR to radically change employment. As far as computing and other technologies go,  we've only just begun. :)","1427847095"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Way to employ the straw man fallacy against anyone who asks deeper questions. Was there a war between the Fire Nation and Air Nomads, yes. Did the Fire Nation attack the Air Nomads at some point in that war, yes. Was there a massive genocide the likes of which had never been seen, almost certainly not. 

The Fire Nation from its birth has always been a small but innovative country. The Air Nomads have three great temples and occupy three different sets of Islands many of which are almost as great in size as the entire Fire Nation. The Air Nomads were also not pacifistic at all as many people on here claim. Not only were they skilled warriors but they were planning an attack on the Fire Nation using their Northern and Southern Temples as strategic points. Even before the war monks had broken the tradition of letting the Avatar grow up before confronting him with who he was. This may seem insignificant but it is relatively easy to brain wash a 12 year old boy but much harder to brainwash a fully aware adult. If the Air Nomads had peaceful intentions why did they break tradition to train him rigorously before the war even started. Firelord Sozin knew his nation could not handle an assault by the far superior Air Nomads and when the commit arrived he seized his chance and launched a preemptive strike on the military heart of the Air Nomads in order to keep his country safe. Had the Air Nomads been peaceful they would have merely fled and escaped (they could easily fly away using air gliders and sky bison) but instead a battle occurred which killed hundreds of brave Fire Nation soldiers. We have military records of those soldiers who died that day at the hands of the ""peaceful"" air benders which you are free to look up. Contrary to popular belief the Fire Nation soldiers did not kill all the Air Nomads. They merely drove them out of their bases in the Air Temples and in doing so insured they would never be a military threat again. There are likely descendants of many air nomads today but they have long sense renounced their nomadic ways and any ties to the militaristic regimes of the Air Benders after generations of marrying into Earth Kingdom families.

Meredith was very clean. We added a new equip in act 2 where I change all my armor and weapon. I wonder if it really made that much of a difference.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Wrong. That's $51.3 million gross and does not include the overall P&amp;A costs, interest, overhead, rental fee deductions, and any profit participation.

The Wrap puts the overall budget at:


$45,000,000 (Production Budget)

$35,000,000 (US/Canada Marketing)

$10-12,000,000 (International Marketing)

-$5,000,000 (Re-called Marketing Spend)

$85,000,000 (TOTAL Budget)


So: 


$51,300,000 (VOD &amp; Theatrical Gross)

-$85,000,000 (COGS)

-$33,700,000 (Gross Profit)

It was a wash. VOD has a long, long way to come before it can be reliably used for launching big-budget productions.

Sorry to be a snark, but to those of you who want to find and try climbing this stuff, please reconsider. It is eroded sandstone, really fragile and breaks easily.  The weathering is quite active, a pass of your palm across the overhanging bit will rub off quite a lot of loose sand. It's a lot cooler to look at than to climb.

Having said that, I've tried it, of course.  Every climber who sees that rock wants to have a go.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","That's a lot of typing to rebut an argument I never made, nor would make. Natural is meaningless. Normal is meaningless. 

In psychological terms, which is what we're talking about here, disorders aren't defined by how weird they are, but by how much harm they do to the people who have them. Being bullied because you're gay is harmful, but if that's enough to make something a disorder then I guess so is being black or being the new kid in school. There's absolutely no evidence that being gay and having gay sex are inherently harmful. Now, if I know you types, you're going to start talking about how terrible anal sex is for you. Even if that were true (and it isn't, but I don't feel like getting into that argument) gay men can have sex with each other that involves no butts, and if the problem is anal sex we should be talking about all the straight people doing it too.

There's substantial evidence that people are significantly damaged by attempts to change their sexual orientation, and everyone involved is happier if folks who are gay just be gay rather than trying to change it. 

You're the one making a claim that there's something wrong with this behavior. It's nearly impossible to prove something is harmless, but if it's harmful there should be abundant evidence.  The burden of proof is on you. ","1427847100"

&gt;You can only have so much meaningful discussion about a silly internet video.

True, but I honestly don't see much discussion about his videos even after he posts.

I mean, he played the barbie games one month ago, but searching 'Barbie' on the sidebar brings up the video, the video again, and 13 other posts. Of those, 1 is just a reaction image about how '/r/jontron came when there is a new jontron video', one is just a screenshot of the video with the title being the exact words jon said when that image appeared. There is one fanfic-like post that pretty much just takes a joke jon uses on the episode and expands on it, and the rest are your tipical lolsorandom /r/jontron fare.

The only post that attempts to discuss or add anything related to the content of the video at all seems to be one guy who posted a link to that peripherial Jon didn't know how to use, explaining it. The OP himself posted how about he knew 'nobody gave a shit', and truly nobody did; the post has five upvotes and two comments.

I know we can 'only have so much' meaningful discussions, but we don't really have even one. Are the barbie games bad? Are they good? Did Jon miss something? Any extra trivia having to do with the game, explaining a few odd choices like the clowns? Comments on game design? Anything?

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","Mostly no...

In hip-hop you'll find that lots of labels and management companies also extend their rosters to producers as well.  They match MCs with their producers but also flex their connections to get tracks placed on other records.  So, in a way, they're *kind of* in-house.  It's more of a way for the execs at play to monetize the end product further (which isn't a bad thing btw)

The in-house deals you hear most about are when mega producers sign agreements with majors as a&amp;r dudes.  It can mean a lot of things from exclusivity, to 

A few large/well-funded indies build studios and allow fairly known producers to use them for free in exchange for doing production.  Again, think of the share of publishing etc that the parent company and producer can monetize over time.

In large room EDM you just have straight up ghost producers for cash.

Anyway, The idea of having a business card that would read ""Record Producer - Columbia Records"" isn't a reality but if you build your name, you can find ways of teaming up with labels/studios/publishers in a symbiotic relationship.

If you want to learn the business, I'd suggest interning at a local label you think puts out rad (and noticed) shit.

Hope this helps.

Polarized lenses, especially from things like snow goggles are more or less just a ploy to get you to pay extra. To go a little beyond ELI5, snow is a pretty lambertian reflector meaning it scatters light in every orientation almost equally, so there's no point in filtering out by light polarization, unlike water, which is very specular. The only surface that would make sense is ice, but in that case, it might be more beneficial to not have polarized because the glare will help you distinguish the ice - important if you're skiing or whatever.","1427847101"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Well I'd say we could multiply by 20 then, but that would assume the cows feed is supplied 100% by California farming, and it's definitely not.  Also doesn't take into account how much water the cows drink as it will vary by how much moisture is in the Silage they're fed, which will also vary greatly.  In addition the milk cows eat twice as much as the beef cows, so we can't just use the 95% figure for that either, more like 47%.  It's going to be near impossible to figure out an accurate statistic on that with my limited logical skills, so I decided not to.  
  
However, since I was curious I took the numbers I sourced and cited on my askscience post yesterday about this, then just did a basic *20 on the figure, and even at that INCREDIBLY beyond generous math(because the 3.5mil would have been 47%, and some feed comes from out of state) and found the absolute way beyond max water usage for all cows in California of any type assuming 100% feed comes from CA and steak cows somehow eat twice as much as they actually do, and it's still only 7.8% of state yearly water use.  
  
In other words these vegetarian groups claiming how ""cows are using up all our water so stop eating meat"" are completely and utterly full of shit, and it may in fact end up possible that they consume MORE water from the food they eat than us meat eaters, because things like almond milk require tons of water to produce and definitely DO come entirely from California sources, since we grow all the damn almonds.","1427847103"

But is all of this...

&gt; You've got quite a dilemma on your hands. It's almost like someone needs to invent ""words"" that ""mean things"", so that you can speak a series of words that will communicate your thoughts, and then her brain will be able to interpret the words so that she knows what you're feeling, and can reply with some answers.
Oh shit, wait... there is such a thing. It's called language! English seems to work well for you, so I'd recommend English, assuming she speaks it too.


... really necessary?

People (especially in advice subreddits) often seem to talk down to teenagers and simplify their problems like they couldn't possibly be real people with real emotions, and like everything they experience is trivial. It's not like OP didn't *think* of just asking her, but there are obvious reasons for his hesitancy. It's not easy to put yourself out there, especially when you're relatively young and thus inexperienced.

Like I said before, I do agree with your advice and think he should just be straight with her. But he needs encouragement, not a whole patronising thing on how the answer is **obviously** to **just use his words**, as if that never occurred to him before.","1427847104"

The Joker is a hugely popular villain, so of course people would love to see him in the show, but they probably cannot get the rights for him either, or they think he would not fit in the show.

Punishing parents for doing a bad job of being a parent isn't going to work either though. Parents can't be coerced to be loving, attentive and caring. 

What needs to be done is to teach people that the goal of life is not get old enough to get married, fall in love with someone, marry them and then produce children.

I think the existing warnings around unauthenticated pages are important to keep. While I agree that they're not perfect, and more information should be given, some level of ambiguity is inherent in keeping the language simple enough to be understood by non-technical persons.

I much prefer the description of impacts, rather than failure cases:

* ""Anyone can read the data you give to this site, so don't give out any sensitive information"".
* ""You might not be talking to the person that you think you are. Be careful what information you give out"".
* ""This page is encrypted and authenticated. Your communications should be safe against eavesdroppers.""

Providing the exact reason for the impact, and the technical details, should be something that's in the page or warning body, beyond the headline. People *will* skim-read or just read the headline, so engineering correct user behaviour using the headline alone is critical.","1427847106"

I dunno I guess Incubus is a *little* more proto-death oriented and Coroner is a little bit more prog oriented but the fact that you can't see that they're playing essentially the same formula of metal is beyond me.

I don't think they're *exactly the same band* no, but they are both a HELL of a lot more similar in sound than the difference between, say, Nile and Necrophagist.

&gt;Also, including melodic death under the banner of death metal isn't really fair since melodic death has nothing in common with death metal other than the use of harsh vocals.

Right. Except for the fact that melodic death IS under the banner of death metal (YOU don't get to just redefine genre consensus because it suits your argument).

Which was MY ENTIRE POINT. There's such disparity between different bands playing in the death metal umbrella that if you take two bands on different poles of the genre they're almost playing entirely different genres.","1427847106"

Politics isn't easy, it's not as simple as showing up and people vote for you. There is a reason that Lawyers, Professors, and hugely successful Business people end up as politicians. They aren't fools, they are generally quite well educated.

Brand isn't a visionary, he does nothing different than what you think politicians do, he parrots what other people have already said, or he's read somewhere, whether he understands it entirely or not. He's fairly well spoken and this makes it appear as though it is genuine inspiration but none of his concepts that actually make any sense are his own.","1427847111"

(On my tablet the eyes were definitely green, not blue.  But on my computer they are still a greyish blue and not the same blue associated with Elsa from Frozen.)  The thing that 'identifies' her as Elsa from Frozen and not Elsa from Indiana Jones isn't her facial structure, the artwork is too generic for that.  It isn't the details like freckles or eye color, because the artwork is too generic for that.  So that leaves her hair.  Thick blonde braid tossed casually over the left shoulder is a certain signifier that the Elsa is definitely Elsa from Frozen. OK.  So that doesn't check out.  Her hair is braided.  That is it.  That is the connection to Frozen?

- Convenient. It's tied directly to my CC, so I don't have to worry about having cash to pay the driver.

Trying to accomplish simply getting the HIGHEST damage output I possibly can. DPS is what I'm looking for.

Additionally, I wanted an opinion on either using Kridershot with Ele Arrow, Nat's Slayer w/ the Nat's Boots w/ Ring of Royal Grandeur for the N3, or also between simply using a Calamity instead. I have all of these items and am having difficulty finding out which ones to use. Here are screenshots below:

"movies","t5_2qh3s","But you see, thats my problem with Knightley. She knows they are there, but if you are going to continue to be disappointed when you weigh statistics against an super narrow field in the big studio circuit. The idea that something is unequal does not inherently make it negative or something that is being manipulated by male studio heads. 

It's not a matter of executive just ""hiring"" women to direct. To make such  statement displays a gross misunderstanding of how studio heads work and evaluate potential directors to handle franchises and such. 
Studios are going to pick someone like David Ayer, fresh off of Fury, to direct the new Suicide Squad. It's just the way it is. Amy Pascal was fucking begging David Fincher to direct the Job biopic. Why? Social Network. They aren't going to look for Kathryn Bigelow for that one, or some indie director with no street creed. Nobody is going to look back father than a few years for some director, unless you are a famous director, for a new project, so newer directors with indie successes have to strike while the iron is hot. 

Michelle MacClaren, some people might say, was chosen simply because she was a woman, but I don't think thats fair since Wonder Woman is arguably one of the most recognizable pop culture icons, let alone being a female at that. They wouldn't just hand that to anyone. MacClaren got the job because of her resume and how TIMELY her resume is. She is hot off of two insanely successful T.V shows. 

As far as 2% of all film being women, can you cite the statistic on that one? I'm hard pressed to believe thats the case out of ALL the films released. I know out of DGA representatives, it tends to be lower, but thats not surprising and becomes less dramatic when big studio films tend to be around 200 or so, excluding those that don't tend to see major release.

To Granik and Cholodenko, are they necessarily wanting to break out of their indie scene? Granik and Cholodenko are known for having a hand in ALL aspects of their work, and tend to develop projects that interest them and NOT seek employment from major studios, but rather seek their distribution at most. Is Winter's Bone indicative of a director who wants to direct an action movie? Not really. Fury on the other hand…

Executives pick directors for major studios based on very VERY small shortlists. As a director trying to make themselves not only timely but efficient, you HAVE to choose projects that you are not only passionate about, but you are willing to see make money. 

I've seen numerous directors at Sundance with highly successful films over the last few years, and thats thanks to the expansion and recognition of indie film as a award worthy/mainstream outlet for artists. But will Linklater go and direct Mad Max now? Probably not. Will anyone even consider him for that? Probably not. All I'm saying is there has to be something taken into account the amount of women who have put themselves in a more ""marketable"" position, yet don't pursue big studio productions. Also, it speaks to what kind of films they and many other indie filmmaker regardless of gender, tend to make. So why is that? You're right. It isn't simple. 

I think its hard to put a demand on women, or men, like that, without knowing what influences the kinds of films people make. Again, the amount of directors is small, and thats for movies that the studio itself is developing and NOT picking up for distribution. Susanne Bier can catch Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence for her new movie, but she seems content on doing foreign low budget films. I think people are demanding more of something that there might just not be enough of, at least at the moment.

Studio executives are not going to hire more women for big budget films, solely because of some weird society pressured ""affirmative action."" They are going to invest in directors who have proven the are willingly to play ball with producer overlords, something I think many men and women in the indie field just don't want to have to do. 

EDIT: Since you also questioned my ability to name female directors…Sofia Coppola (one of my favorite all time directors), Kathryn Bigelow, Agnes Varda, (you already mentioned Cholodenko and Garnik so I won't repeat that), Kim Pierce, Katherine Hardwicke, Sam Taylor, Lucreita Martel, Susanne Bier (who won an academy award for her film) Angelina Jolie, and so forth. Ask anyone to name more than five famous male directors. Odds are you'll get Spielberg, Scorsese, Tarantino, and Burton, or MAYBE Eastwood and Lucas. Thats my point though that you missed. It's not about popularity. It's about knowing that they are out there working. It's dismissive to weigh representation based on knowing the names of people. I can't name a lot of capital cities, but that doesn't mean I don't know they are there.

"DebateFascism","t5_2v642","&gt;Indeed, but the condition is rare and not to be self-diagnosed. 

as with all other conditions to include aspergers. I agree, but this isn't the issue. We are talking about people who are legitimately diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Its relatively rare, but its common enough that it warrants attention and merrit. Many of these people have social problems because of the stigma behind the disease so you hear about them far more often than you really should.

&gt;Particularly in a world where masculinity is mocked and masculine behavior discouraged we're going to see a lot more people who equate their low self-image stemmed from their inability to meet high, socially set beauty standards to their gender. 

Oh stop, treating gender dysphoria, and asking for respect for people who legtimately aflicted by GD has nothing to do with this.

&gt;I'm no doctor, but I feel that a safe and sensible first-line of treatment for people who think they may suffer from GD is to try to improve their sense of self-worth in general. 

I think the first step is to be a good doctor and make them see a specialist who will do a science based evalutation to determine if they do or do not have gender dysphoria. No diffrent then any other medical condition, especially a rare one. ","1427847123"

"networking","t5_2qkaf","This is likely the answer.  Especially if these are 2.4 GHz only UAP.

Wireless is basically a half duplex medium.  Only one transmitter can be active on a channel at a time so if you have 30 APs all cranked up in power and on the same channels then co-channel interference will kill your performance.

You should make sure that you distribute your channels to avoid co-channel interference.  With only the 3 non-overlapping channels of 2.4 GHz it can sometimes be a losing battle.  You should set the power level on your access points to Low to mitigate things but without a proper wireless survey you're essentially stabbing at the dark.

You want to make sure that APs are on channels as far away from each other as possible both vertically and horizontally. 

This isn't perfect but to illustrate quickly depending on where you pulled cable to you could do something like:

              +-------------|
    3rd       | 11   6   11 |         
              +-------------+
    2nd       | 6    1   6  |
              +-------------+
    1st Floor | 11   6   11 |
              +-------------+
    
     - or -
    
              +-------------|
    3rd       | 1    6   11 |         
              +-------------+
    2nd       |   11    1   |
              +-------------+
    1st Floor | 1    6   11 |
              +-------------+


Try tuning on 1 AP at low power and checking your signal strength.  When you're near and RSSI value of -68 or -70 that's the distance you should consider the edge of your ""cell"".  Measure the distance from that AP and double it to determine the distance between APs.  You don't want them too close to each other.  If they're too close to each other at a Low power level consider removing some APs because you probably have too many in a small space.","1427847124"

But the villains? Have you seen Bojack Horseman by any chance? There's a delightful character that is made up of two children, one on top of the other, and wearing a large coat. The two pretend to be an adult so that they can hang out with them, and everything they say is an absurd caricature of a grown businessman. They say things like, ""I went to the stock market today and did a business."" I bring this up because the villains are essentially the same, doing absurdly stupid and evil things with idiotic and inane responses, and they were utterly unbelievable *even within the fiction itself*.

"Permaculture","t5_2qkib","Don't rush. It's tempting to want to charge ahead but you'll likely end up with dead plants or things where you don't want them. There is time. I promise. 

First. Observe. Where does the sun hit throughout the day. Where is it the windiest. Where does the frost linger in the grass the longest in the morning. Does any place get waterlogged after rain or dry out very quickly.  You get the idea. 

Second. How much space do you have vs. how much can you use practically with little waste. It might be worth getting grafted trees to get the variety you want rather than clogging the whole yard with full sized fruit trees of individual varieties. You might be sacrificing all your sun for 10x as many apples than you need on trees that are too tall to harvest and not having space and sun left over to have a veggie garden. 

Third. Research and contemplate. Do you want showy flowers? Vines? Veggies? Herbs. Edibles can be really beautiful. Think about what you use or crave that is expensive or hard to find and see if you can grow it. Is something you want very disease prone or delicate? Be sure it is worth the hassle and heartache. Research other varieties or alternatives. Spend time in local nurseries and botanic gardens. Join a gardening or pemaculture group. People readily share seeds, plants, help with graftings and give ideas and help for free. 

Fourth, lay it out and execute. Again, don't expect it to be amazing overnight. Take your time, appreciate it, and listen to what it is telling you. Good luck!

Edit: Research beneficial plant relationships and pemaculture principals. Lure bees. Resist disease. Rejuvenate the soil. Give to get.","1427847126"

As we mourn the loss of a community member, I write to tell you about ­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­Hyoun Ju Sohn, the graduate student from South Korea who died today.


He was a first-year doctoral student in the Physics program known for his passion for Condensed Matter Physics. As a teaching assistant, he relished his interactions with our undergraduate students and garnered glowing evaluations. At Columbia University, he was a Rabi Scholar. The Rabi program enables ""outstanding students of science"" to engage in research with Columbia faculty during the summer. Hyoun Ju received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia in May 2013.


We extend our deepest sympathies to Hyoun Ju’s family, friends, and all students, faculty, and staff in the Department of Physics.


If you or someone you know needs support during this difficult time, help is available through the University's offices of Chaplains and Religious Life (863-2344) and Counseling and Psychological Services (863-3476).

"vita","t5_2sjmv","You have already said it: it being the GOTY edition on top of having more story content and all of the issues fans have brought up being looked at and changed as needed, thus giving players a lot more value than a whole new game that's going to lack those things until they emulate Capcom's ""U"" business model with monster hunter, which I find unlikely. Plus, some people have already been turned off by the games issues. Them are going to be a lot less inclined to pay for a  sequel while the original remains broken. Those who know nothing of FW (some of them, rather) will also be apprehensive about a sequel to a game they know nothing about if they research the issues still  plaguing the original. They won't have very high hopes and therefore, interest, in the second one.

If someone (man or woman) gets to the level of slapping a person around that's the last step before putting them in the hospital.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm going to post them now, and they're both books by college professors. But I know the Zionist way. I can acknowledge Palestinian crimes. On the other hand, you will argue the quotes are out of context or wrong.

* first off, Theodor Herzl, the father of Zionism stated ""Might takes precedence over right.""
* The myth of Israel as David versus an Arab Goliath is great, ""...but they [the Palestinians prior to Israel] had one fault. They were weak and defenceless in the face of real military might..."". The British put down the many revolts of the Arabs, which Ben-Gurion understood. He stated he himself would do the same thing if he was a Palestinian, and with greater audacity. The mandate had no strong central government, Palestine was a mess, and the British kept it under control while the Western-backed Zionists ceased control. And to claim the squabbling mess of postcolonial Arab militaries was a threat to a Western backed nation is a joke.
* when asked at the Versailles conference on his goals Chaim Weizmann, a ""moderate Zionist"", stated the goal was ""to make Palestine as Jewish as England is English."" In 2001, White British made up 92.1% of the population, down a considerable bit since 1919. So the intent of the Zionists is clear here (Palestine/Israel was ~90% Arab in 1919)
* The early Zionists would make Hitler proud. David Ben-Gurion (who you choose to name airports after) stated it would be better if children died and Eretz-Israel became a nation than if they escaped to other places. Before the Second World War, Britain offered to take in thousands of Jews, especially Jewish-German children. But Ben-Gurion stated that if ""it would be possible to save all the children in Germany by bringing them over to England, and only half of them to Eretz Israel, then [he] would opt for the second alternative."" Several of your former and ""great"" prime ministers were involved in massacres or atrocities. Shit, the Irgun killed my grandfather (mayor of a mountain town in the Galilee), and you people elected Begin! Fun fact, many prominent American Jews objected to Begin visiting the US in the 70s, including Albert Einstein. And the Zionist gangs/terrorists committed many atrocities against women and children and whole villages.But if any power does a similar thing Israel decries it. A wrong is a wrong, no matter if it's scary brown Arabs or Jews committing it.
* the Stern Gang got their own postage stamps
* the Zionists opposed any plan of a bi-national state until the end when the Palestinians were marginalised (you take their land and expect them to be happy because they got the *good half*
* there was no Jewish discontent in Palestine prior to the Zionists: ""...the indigenous Jews of Palestine did not revolt and demand special political rights; on the contrary, many in fact opposed Zionism and its basic philosophy, arguing that the Zionist project to establish Israel by force was morally unteable because **Israel would be established only with thee return of the Messiah, not by the sword of mortals like the Zionist colonizers.""
* Ben-Gurion attempted to blame Arab terrorists for the Deir Yassin massacre (shit, I'm no fan of Hamas, but they don't even blame Israel for attacks)
* They also deceived the West into thinking an historical connection to land meant you have political rights.

That was 20 pages worth of notes from ""Might Over Right"" by Adel Safty, an Israel professor in Tel Aviv (I believe.) I also have the ""Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine"" by Ilan Pappe, also an Israeli professor. I've read books by both sides but the Zionist books have been so one-sided and false. Safty's book damns the Zionists with their own quotes, in many parts he does not editorialize, he just shows the evidence shows the Zionists knew what they were doing and deceived all of the World into thinking it was noble. Forgive me if it's a mess, I hate trying to format on reddit. I don't mean to attack you but I have read books by both sides and all I see is a displaced people and a powerful nation that stole land, protected by  the Western powers, and the world's strongest superpower.","1427847135"

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","I think what you are asking is how is ULTIMATE authority to govern derived? Now that depends on who and when you ask the question. In past times it would be have said to be derived by God and the Divine Right of Kings, however that isn't how we view it generally today. Authority to govern is granted to the head of state through the implied consent of the governed.  That is where ultimate authority is derived.   

&gt;  don't see how winning a battle makes one a legitimate ruler.  

I can see how you would feel that way. Really this is about one thing: the peaceful transition of power. Each step in the logic chain is there to prevent mass death and bloodshed. The reason it is legitimate is that the previous situation was even more intolerable.  We have had anarchy in human history and it simply meant the strongest ruled and peace could only last a single generation until the ruler died and the new mightiest had to be determined. That could be a heir, that could be someone completely different. Monarchs represented stability and protection from that cycle with at least some assurance of a clear line of succession and the chance at a peaceful transition of power. So that is where the guy standing on the field got his legitimacy in the first place and why we have heads of government.  The alternatives to it are just THAT much worse. This is really part of what is called the ""social contract"" that exists between authority and the people being governed. What that battle (Hastings is what I am assuming you are referring to) did was change the social contract from something that was implicit, to something explicitly spelled out in duties and responsibilities. BTW, he lost the battle.    

&gt; Modern understanding of anarchy is not 2000 years old, so I would prefer some specific arguments of the modern thinkers.  

Sure.  I have more money, power and guns than you do.  I set myself up in your system. You either do what I say or die. By giving me the power to do so, you have no longer setup an anarchy and the only way to stop me is to exercise despotic and tyrannic power. Which is why we choose to have governments instead. Without government it is simply who is strongest who rules until someone stronger comes along to replace them.     

The reason we look to the Greeks is they already tried ALL this. The word ""tyrant"" isn't a description, it is a title. Tyrants were sometimes appointed, but often they were elected. They tried anarchy in all its forms and the reason you think of tyrants as being a bad thing is because of the Greek experience.  It is also why you are ""ostracized"". The bad connotations of that come also come from the Greek experience with direct democracy. When it comes to government, your first stop should always be the Greeks.  They religiously obsessed about it in all its forms (it was actually a part of their religion).  ","1427847135"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Well, they're for different reasons. Chryslers (Chrysler group consists of Dodge, Chrysler, Plymouth (defunct), and possibly more I'm misissing) are just troublesome garbage.

Thepaxguy was right about Land Rovers, and the same problems apply to Minis, Fiats and to a lesser extent Volkswagens.

While they might feel nice to drive and have a lot of positive features, they are all expensive to maintain. They are all complicated and difficult to work on, and so a given job will take a longer time to complete. Labour is usually the biggest cost in a car service, the average shop rate where I live is $130 per hour, and so if a job takes 2 hours to perform instead of 1 it will cost twice as much in labour alone. The time a given job takes on a given car is generally standardized, and can vary wildly depending on how difficult it is to perform. Luxury car dealerships will generally have a higher shop rate too.

And Minis, Land Rovers, and Fiats all have a bad reputation for reliability. Volkswagens are more reliable than the others but they'll still have a lot of small, expensive problems.

The best recommendation I can make is to research a vehicle before you buy it. This is easier with used cars, a new vehicle might be an all new design that has no relation to the vehicle previously sold under its name. A general rule of thumb I might propose is that if you're only looking for something that is very affordable and reliable and nothing else, just buy a Toyota economy car, especially one that's made in Japan (you can tell this by the first character of the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) being a J).","1427847137"

For example, could you give a country like castile AE in Europe if they have not really expanded into Europe, but are focused on a  colonizing game? That doesnt make sense to me. But I really like your other ideas, especially the assassination one. You could go very deep with that mechanic. I think trade is kind of covered though, given that you can assign privateers to steal trade power from your opponents in a node. Perhaps you can get assassination opportunities through unique events, such as the King attends a ball tonight, ideal chance for assassination. Also you can choose a method, such as outright killing him, making it look accidental, poison, etc. each choice would have a higher risk of implicating you, the player, as a conspirator in the assassination. This would give you AE and negative relations with said country. But the ones that have a lower risk may cost more, require more time, etc. fantastic ideas though. Also, maybe the option to see who the ai country is targeting, stealing techs(basically kind of like civ 5). Espionage is probably my favorite aspect of strategy games.","1427847137"

"projecteternity","t5_2v1qz","Some unique items will come with enchants that you cannot, as a player, add to your own items. (As far as I can tell)
Examples would be: Draining (leach life as you attack enemies), Convert Grazes to Hit, or giving you access to spells. (The character with the item equipped has access to a specific spell he/she normally wouldn't have)

On top of this, there are more ""common"" enchants that can you add to your own items. If you right click on an item to open the description window, you'll have an ""enchant"" button at the bottom of that window.

Other than that, gear ""somewhat"" has level, but they come through enchants: Fine, Exceptional, Superb.
They are enchants under the Quality section. They make your weapons more accurate/deadlier and make your armor reduce more damage.

It's easier to find gear of higher ""quality"" than it is to enchant them yourself, from what I can see. To enchant a shield with the ""Exceptional"" quality I would have needed to be level 8, but I found one while I was around level 5-6.

So, keep adventuring and you'll find some cool items. If you don't find them, you can still easily enchant them. You have the Quality enchants, but you can also add Attribute enchants (+1 stat), add Fire/Ice/ect damage to weapons, stuff like that.","1427847138"

"projecteternity","t5_2v1qz","Basically when a unit is 'engaged' with an enemy, if you hover the cursor over an area to move them it will be highlighted red.  This means that to move you'll have to break engagement, which automatically provokes some pretty nasty undefended blows, called a Disengagement Attack.  This goes for enemies too.  [Have a read about engagement here](http://pillarsofeternity.gamepedia.com/Melee_Engagement), it's crucial and it'll make combat much more enjoyable if you get how it works (less of a clusterf***).

Positioning is key in these types of games.   Work out your characters strengths and then work out where they need to be to maximise those strengths.  So for instance I have my two wizards up the back, in light armour or robes (so they have a fast 'recovery rate, ie can perform actions more quickly).  Tanks engage the frontline, this leaves my  chanter and a priest in the middle, keeping them and the casters at a distance from enemies so they can pop off their spells unmolested.  Chanter has a gun and the priest has a bow in the middle, they provide ranged support to the tanks while the priest buffs/debuffs/heals, but if there are too many enemies in a wide open space for the tanks to hold the line both my chanter and priest have a second melee weapon set, the priest with his far reaching quarterstaff (he can literally whack enemies over the shoulders of the tanks without exposing himself to damage) and the chanter in heavy armour with a greatsword to provide extra tankiness up the front, if need be.  Weapon switching is another thing you'll want to get used to using in terms of battlefield management.

Against large numbers of enemies I often try to provoke a fight in a narrow corridor so two or three people can 'hold the frontline' without letting them flank me, and this stops them 'swamping me' and bogging everything down, but if I'm in the open, once the frontline is locked in, I try and angle the casters in from the sides to give them line of sight for the spells that need it.  

But there are all sorts of ways of approaching things tactically based on your party make up and preferred style.  Take some time to think about positioning and engagement, once you start getting your head around it it'll make things so much more fun and interesting.  Did for me anyway.","1427847140"
"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;The idea of the universe comes from living things.

But the universe does not.

&gt;This concept is not a reality. It's a concept

Correct..ish. The universe (the objects that make up the universe, that is) can exist without the human concept. Our descriptions describe objects that are independent of those descriptions.

A stone is still a stone.. minus our descriptive word for it if life doesn't exist.

&gt;Might it not be more accurate to say that life as we know it, leads to the conceptualization of ""the universe"", ""god"" and other abstractions?

Sort of, but those objects still exist independent of us. You're conflating concepts and objects, I think.

"conservatives","t5_2qj2e","Here is my written challenge to my colleagues who started using the term Islamophobia:

Islamophobia

	Phobia is defined as “A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangerous”.  Given the definition of phobia and its application upon the Muslim faith the use of term Islamophobia has generated controversy in the United States.  The argument has tended to focus on whether Islam can be considered dangerous.  Therefore, to understand the term we must examine whether Islam poses a danger to American society, this paper will argue that it does, to one area in particular; the right to free expression.
	The original prohibition against any display of Mohammed was perhaps superficially praiseworthy because it was intended to combat idolatry or worship in images.  From this prohibition however we saw that a cartoon published in a largely insignificant country could spark significant violence in which dozens of human beings would be killed and extend to one of the more severe violations of international law.  For example, a mullah in Pakistan offered one million dollars and a car for anyone who murdered the cartoonist.  Such violence should not come as a surprise after similar threats were made against the author Salman Rushdie decades before. The violence against Denmark however was not just directed at individuals but against Danish embassies.  The violence that resulted from the Danish cartoons is a unique and disturbing example of the danger the ideology poses to the concept of free expression.
	Now it may be said that this is just an example of the extreme. However, the point must be made that it was the extremists who effected so much change. In the case of the cartoonist for example the extremists got exactly what they wanted. Every major newspaper and media outlet within the United States refused to display the images and allowed themselves to be blackmailed against the principles that founded this country.  Our country should be humiliated by this complete capitulation, but it should also scare the American public whose founding principles are based on the right to free expression. 
For a decade the Organization of the Islamic Conference attempted to persuade the U.N. to pass a resolution making the defamation against Islam a form of racism that should be abolished worldwide.  The idea that criticism of an ideology can produce a connotation that was once reserved for criticism against a race of human beings is a very subtle and nasty insinuation that needs to be met head on. Such an idea can only be meant to place Islam in a category of special significance that is more deserving of protection than other ideologies. Such a notion is indeed dangerous given the ideologies conflict with the founding secular principles of our American government.

You can see some actors just kiss first if they like the girl and it become melodrama more than romance. Its some actors inability in expressing romance. Park min young is plastic face and she emote only deer in light expression.

I am so picky now on what i like.

I am more into betrayal , sacrifice , chaebol romance plus actress ability to emote multiple expression.

The girl in maids can express so many emotion in her face. She is great actress. Kang sora too. There are few act and steal scenes. Also IU can own scene. I avoid any actor and actress who born as tiger in chinese astrology. They really can't act at all. Also 19987 (rabbits) male actors - lee min ho - i hated all of his dramas.

currently watching house of blue bird...- i really like this type of drama...light no fuzz so far...hope they keep going. I am impressed with first 10 episodes.

Also, you have 3 additional mechs on test drive all the time.  

I think adding some items and internals to the starter mech was a good idea, but replacing Fred was just unecessary.  It's not a HUGE deal to me, the novelty is the only thing that matters for me.  But the Assault is supposed to be earned as an upgrade from the Recruit.  Giving new players the assault from the get go is not going to make them noticeably better, and IMO was a change that wasn't needed or will make that much of a difference.","1427847144"

I did some half life calculations using 15 days as the half life for dec. Takes about 180 days for a single shot of 150mg to drop to levels where you should PCT. I made this mistake before starting and now I have to wait it out for a long time.

To your question, it is great for a lean bulk provided you control estrogen. It seems to bloat badly on carbs, as I experienced taking in 500+ g of carbs. Makes it really uncomfortable at night but in the morning it's all gone and you can see the changes almost daily. Ace is a lot more dramatic for me. If I cycle trest again, I'll use ace. 

If you feel you're too fat for a bulk, diet down before trest. It can be a mind fuck to be bloated as well as the increased aromatization with the 7a-methyl estrogen (similar to dbol)","1427847149"

Honestly most of them probably wouldn't known what to do so they just wouldn't act any different. Maybe if you cornered them and asked their opinion they would've said something not PC and probably offensive, but I didn't see any hate from these guys about pretty much anything. ","1427847152"

If you are doing business articles for a magazine and you're going on holiday, by all means pitch in a travel article. At best they will pay you, at worst you do it for free but can then get a load of discounts and freebies on your holiday thanks to the commission. All of which you must of course disclose, but that's standard for travel writing today.

"Construction","t5_2qiuc","We use the Blubeam Revu app with all our docs on Box.net. You can sync them pretty easily. We also use BIM 360 for all of our issue tracking and checklist. 

I recently found an app I presented to my company that is super easy and is sort of an all-in-one in regards to plan viewer, issue tracker ect...  It's called fieldwire, http://fieldwire.net/. 

First of all, it's cheap! compared to BIM360 that is. A way more intuitive approach to issue tracking, iOS feel to it. Lastly, it autoOCR's your plans when you upload them, as long as they are in standard format. It's free for up to 3 users. 

If anyone tries it out on your project, let me know how it works out.
