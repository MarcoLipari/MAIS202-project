Here Domino has been changed from a bone white woman, into a black woman, and the only reason I see is to pander to people for money. You could argue that it is their job to sell the movie, I say that doing it like this cheapens the character. Makes them a token to sell tickets. 

Besides, most established characters like Domino either don't change very much, or when thy do, it's because the entire comic line is changing. Like the transition form the golden to silver age. It wasn't out of place for heros to change because everything was changing. Here we have an established character being redesigned for no really good reason as far as I can tell. 

As it is, I bet that people would be really upset if they made Storm into a white girl. But for some reason because Domino was made black, it suddenly no longer a marketing ploy. ",1501545601

It's definitely possible to get one as an undergraduate if you have a strong referral (e.g., your postdoc tells his buddy at some research lab ""you really should hire this guy""). I'd encourage you to ask him if he has any connections. Academia is very much about who you know. 

If you want to get into a good PhD program, all that really matters is research experience (ideally with publications) and faculty recommendations. Standard software engineering internships don't really count for much at all. So, you might want to take that into consideration if you're genuinely interested in the academic path. 

I would also encourage you to ask your postdoc about your chances of getting into a decent PhD program straight out of undergrad. I understand the desire to do the MS first to strengthen your application, but remember that many terminal MS programs cost money whereas PhD programs will pay you (not very much) to attend.

Nothing that you have now was not bought by the blood and sweat of those who came before you, you have been privileged by this and it would seem you are not aware of this. You are not an wholly an individual you are a part of humanity and you cannot separate yourself from humanity's machinations entirely, it is necessary to respect that.

I understand the Tragedy of the Commons, that is why you would need governing bodies to prevent such things. You would in essence still need a state of some variety. I'm not convinced that stateless communism will ever fully emerge, because we as humans have a great capacity to act on narrow perspectives, and we will need collective reason and authority to rein in our natural shortsightedness.

You do realize we are both arguing for cooperation right? I'm just going the extra step and saying you don't need possessions to be cooperative, you don't need that delineation between mine and yours, that delineation is what causes divide. Apathy and ill-use are bred by purposelessness, one should not find purposelessness when operating cohesively and cooperatively. 



* ""So what if my labor doesn't go towards everyone's benefit? Not everyone is entitled to my labor for their benefit. Would it be nice if I was charitable? Sure. But no one gets to claim the fruits of my work as their own or decide for me what the ""fullest potential"" of my labor is."" 

--Fullest potential of the hammer, not you as a laborer, is what I was stating. Your response seems to be confusing items of utility and your personal labor, I was stating if you are putting the needs of others on the same plane as your own needs as an individual it will become clear what ""ITEMS"" you may claim as your own personal property and what would best serve all by being utilized by all.

"battlefield_one","t5_3eer4","the model 8 .25 is viable is cqc, thats the only place it really is viable. sure you could use it outside 20m, youll be outclassed. and the model 8 .35 shares the .25's cqc dps aswell, given that they both start at 3btk. the luger 1906 and model 8 .35 are skill cannons, and yes, while not easy to use, are the best gun as their respecive ranges. most of the time the mp18'll beat the hellreigel factory and defensive(the factory variant is actually a storm variant), and it still has a lot of horizontal recoil. every other stat on the model 10 isnt that good, it really isnt op, the reason it seems op(along with the automatico) is the bad map design on objectives, where they really arent bigger than 20m across, which gives the illusion of being op, when it's really just an issue of poor mapdesign, but thats a whole other issue. 

the mg15 can be used, most other lmgs have a better ttk. i honestly forgot about the bernet mercie, as i dont generally play support. but yeah its prettygood at range.

They have to toe the company line as much as possible, but they're not all complete idiots.  They know what type of person Trump is and there was a reason none of them had any interest in supporting him in the first place.  Whether Jeff Flake is truly concerned or not, its important to realize that Republicans in the Senate and House are taking a firm anti-Trump stance.

"RyzeMains","t5_39cxp","Mathematically speaking, if you see that you can spread E to 2 or more people in a fight, always do it. You could have EQEQ in that window of time, but if you can EEQ you'll deal almost the same damage in total (180% Q damage vs 200% Q damage) AND you'll have the shield, movespeed and the time between your E cooldowns to reposition. If its 3 people and above, always go for it. If it's late game, and you're double tear, and you happen to see the enemy ADC got flux on him but he just stepped back, flash forward to E(spread flux onto everyone nearby) Q(duh) W auto(2 Muramana's proc) and he should probably be dead. As Double Tear Ryze late game you have a 2k HP shield on your seraphs and your overload passive when combined, so if the enemy ADC (or APC) is the only real damage threat (like Juggermaw teamcomp, tanks only exist to peel), you don't have to worry about being killed (in fact most of my flashes are used for flanks, this ""supryze backline flux spread"" thing and sometimes in lane).

The iced coffee that was chalky tasting was quite bad.  The chalky flavor overwhelmed any other potential flavors. I'm not sure if it was just a different taste due to the filter because this was simply awful. From what you are saying, it seems that using a mesh filter shouldn't make the coffee *bad,* just different tasting. Perhaps the issue I ran into was a brewing/roasting issue.

I've experimented a lot with different iced coffee brewing methods (including cold brew and Japanese pour over).  I suppose my general concern when seeing coffee being served from a refrigerated container (but not cold brew as these places offer both) is that they are just brewing some hot coffee and then putting it in the refrigerator.  I've been to several places where the hot cup of coffee is delicious with many different flavor notes, but then when I've had a black iced coffee, it's like there is nothing there. Conversely, I've gone to places like La Colombe and every time my iced coffee is quite flavorful.

That's not to say it wouldn't see still stable gains on less voltage (like many see with Pascal), I didn't take the time to try yet.  

I'm quite happy with a 2Ghz card that doesn't throttle too bad with fan speeds under 75% - this one fits the bill.  Most other Windforces I've seen seem to float in the 2025-2088Mhz windows as well under sustained loads.  So not a great or super-quiet cooler, but an adequate one.

As someone else mentioned for men who were less endowed prostheses could be used, just as women's nude bodies are often altered either with make up, merkins, or digitally(this is done more and more frequently) to make their bodies more desirable. It has much more to do with the male gaze. The vast majority of TV and Movies are filmed, directed and produced by men (usually straight). Because of this most sexual content is made specifically to cater to male taste, thus women are shown fully nude much more often, and men's penis' are very rarely shown. In fact, this is even more of a problem when a show is specifically known for nudity. You mentioned Game of Thrones. The first season of Game of Thrones did actually contain some male nudity, but as the show became a phenomenon that was known primarily for two things (violence and naked women) it became more an more focused on nude women, to the point of gratuity(not that I'm complaining. I too am a straight male).

1. I think even ""dozens"" is an exaggeration, let alone hundreds.  
 
2. This is statistically negligible, and doesn't even compare to the way minorities are treated in other countries.  OP mentioned a few, but there are so many more examples of ethnic cleansing, racially-motivated massacres, etc. in much of the world.

In the 109, you can usually climb about as well and your plane is *really* good at repeated vertical loops, and at low and mid tiers should outrun the Spitfire. Keep your distance if you're on equal footing, and seize the first opportunity to get over them by even a little so you start forcing them to bleed energy evading your repeated loop attacks.  
  
With the 190, be mindful of your speed (you don't accelerate as well, but you should go faster in the end) and like the 109, avoid engaging until they're distracted or at a disadvantage. Instead of looping like a 109, you want to extend away further before coming right back. You shouldn't need much time on target to get the kill, and if things go south and you haven't bled your speed off too much you can disengage to reset.",1501545609

This begs the question: Why do you want to keep immigrants out if we obviously have a need for them here in this country? Why not simply make it easier for them to become citizens? If you're a fiscal conservative (are you?), you're missing very basic math.

Tons of squandered crops = bad

Spending tons of taxpayer $$ on a wall = bad (if you believe in less spending, of course)

Let immigrants in, make them citizens, and we need no wall, so we save $$, plus crops get picked, plus tax dollars from labor = good. 

The only arguments for not allowing immigrants in are generally couched in racism or ignorance. If the economic arguments don't make sense, how can fiscal conservatives still support a border wall?

There are many workarounds, I'm just saying that Bluehole is handling it poorly and should either alter the in-game rules, or drop the topic altogether, but banning people on a first offense for doing something the game allows and doesn't even warn against is very bad community management.

I like the removal of the ability to harm a downed opponent, but I think a better solution is the traitor mark as well as a solution that someone else described to me recently:

&gt; when a teammate kills you then you have the option to deny them your lootcrate. That way they have nothing to gain from it other than the fun of killing teammates. When a person has a number of reports and were denied lootcrates with each kill, then a ban is obvious.

At the very least though: in my opinion there should be an in-game warning about team killing and no one should be banned for the first offense or even handful of offenses. 

In League of Legends when you go to rage quit, there's a warning against it. In PUBG the end game screen when you team kill should have a warning in a bold red text 

&gt;We noticed you friendly fired a teammate this game. Just so you know team killing is unsportsmanlike and repeated offenses *may* result in a ban

Obvious bans would only happen after a number of reports, and reports would only happen to intentional trolls (more often than not). But this first offense ban nonsense is bullshit. ",1501545613

"evenewbies","t5_2tkgx","&gt;You never ever use the ""MWD+cloak"" trick on a ship that uses a covert-ops cloak and has a align time of under 10s, because its does not help you in any possible way imaginable.


You should really work on your reading comprehension, because I gave you a scenario where this maneuver absolutely gives you an edge.


But let's break it down a bit more for you with two scenarios:


You jump a gate, everything seems clear, and you initiate warp and cloak. During your align a sabre decloaks and bubbles you, and your warp is canceled and you now move at ~30m/s and dropping (basically w/e speed you were traveling at when the warp was canceled). You can't activate any prop mod because you are cloaked, your max speed is ~300m/s. This gives the sabre a fairly small sphere of space in which to decloak you.


I, however, never initiate warp and use the trick. When the bubble goes up it has zero effect on me, and I will continue to build speed. This high speed makes that ""where could I be?"" sphere in space much larger, making decloaking much harder. 


It's not about how fast the sabre is, it's about maximising the area of space I can actually be in. If you had a spoon of lucky charms with one hidden marshmallow, and I had a large bowl with one hidden marshmallow, who do you think would find the marshmallow first?",1501545613

"FinalFantasy","t5_2qhdi","Seems like you actually understand them all pretty well from your summaries. One thing I will say about Penelo though is that you may have overlooked her relationship with Larsa. She is the one who initially sparks his realization that the Empire's course may need readjusting and basically catalyzes the future of peace he begins to pursue between Archades and Dalmasca. He'd never had the chance to speak to a normal person from Dalmasca before he met her and it made him realize how out of touch his initial perspective was.

Furthermore Penelo just wants to go wherever Vaan's going, and so if he wants to keep flying with Ashe, Balthier and co. then of course she's going to stick with him.

And then the ending scene with the letter she writes to Larsa is actually a callback to Cara's letter to Mid in FFV, which is pretty cool in and of itself despite the sappy J-pop song.

The game has a lot of subtlety to its character interaction, arguably to a fault because it's difficult if not impossible to get a full picture on the characters after just one playthrough. The more times you play the game (or even just read the script) though, the more nuances you pick up on. For instance, Vaan and Penelo probably bond the most with Basch over the course of the story as he sort of adopts the role of guardian/chaperone to them. It's never explicitly stated or given its own scene, it just sort of becomes evident throughout the seemingly innocuous side interactions that dovetail various big scenes.

FFXII is a game that has to be studied like a play to be fully understood, and its characters have to be viewed like a web with consideration to how they all interact with each other rather than isolating each one into a vacuum for individual analysis.

Also the next time you play, something you might enjoy is to keep a running tally of how many times Ashe tells Vaan not to interrupt her. Like, the stuff you were talking about in his paragraph is deliberately acknowledged by the game's writers and it's hilarious. Vaan tries to pipe up with something relatively pointless and Ashe will be like ""stfu kid the grownups are talking."" It's fucking savage and the most underrated comedy in FFXII.",1501545614

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","Here are my three go-to questions:

1.  What do you like to see in your successful teachers? Or what does it take to be a successful teacher in your school?

2.  If I were to contact some of the teachers at your school, what would they say about working there? (If you ask this question actually email some of the teachers in the grade level or subject area that you interviewed for and see what they have to say). 

3. What kind of science extra curricular activities does your school offer that I could become involved in? (My specialization is science so tailor this question around what your specialization is). 

The first question shows that you're interested in improving yourself and working towards being a better fit for the school. The second question shows that you care that you find a school that is right for you and not just jumping at the first opportunity that comes up. It also lets you know what the principal thinks her teachers think about her and then you can find out what they actually think by asking them yourself. The third question shows that you're willing and excited to get involved in things outside of teaching at that school. Principals want people who will be willing to work the extra curricular activities in addition to teaching. ",1501545615

Being condescended to as an adult woman is incredibly insulting, and people tend to revert to that when they find out you want to be sterilized, physicians included. My doctor took the time to talk me through the options, but accepted it when I gave her logical counter-arguments. I was honestly glad she was taking it seriously enough to offer options.

"HatsuVault","t5_3ahjg","Plausibility - 7, definitely feels realistic but probably going to be a hatsu of an one-off character.

Strength - 5, due to memory overload and hatsu proficiency, I don't see the user being able to win in most straight up fights with it. 

Adaptability - 9, since versatility is the main point of this hatsu, its only natural that it scores the most in this aspect. It has something to assist in movement, defense, and resource collection on top of its primary purpose of being a weapon. What a lot of people aren't realizing is that not only does it work well in close combat as a buzz saw and long range as a laser, you can also potentially use it as mid-range bladed projectile by creating larger than normal fan blades and amping up rotation before flinging at your opponents. 

Cooperability: 3, Definitely feels more like a hatsu used in one on ones since the fans and laser could possess danger to allies in crowded situations. Not to mention there really isn't any aspect of the ability that can work well off other hatsus. 

Room for Development - 4, this sort of hatsu is going to have low room for development for the same reason why it has low strength. Too many hatsu categories are being used in it.

Emission Focus - 4, Similar reasoning as for Strength and Room for Development, too many hatsu categories. While emission is definitely the lynchpin of this hatsu, the severe need of transmutation and manipulation to work dilute the focus of it.

My comment: This hatsu would work much better as a pure Emission or pure Conjuration since you can reasonably do all the things with manipulation and transmutation within either categories and simply add the lasers through limitations. Also if you are going through the emission route, not having a handle and instead making them float with be much more dangerous and simple as that way you can make more elaborate defenses and have higher proficiency in mid-range combat.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt; I know I beat the original main storyline and was moving through the quests that come before Heavensward. My last goal was getting the Ironworks set....but I don't know what I should be doing if I jumped back in.

You'd still be working towards the same goals, actually! Continuing the MSQ is always a good goal to have, and getting Ironworks (and then augmenting it) is something every fresh 50 should be working towards. I talked more about how to do that [here]() just now, if you need a refresher.

You may want to run through the Hall of the Novice to remind yourself of your class's basics and of how dungeons work; it also rewards a nice XP boosting ring if you wind up wanting to level any other combat classes.

&gt; Additionally, I think I read a couple weeks back about some Realm transfer incentives. Are those still active and something worth looking into?

It's probably not worthwhile for you - there's a bonus for transferring from any world to a new world, but the only new worlds are on the European data center, so that's not a good idea if you're in NA. There's also a bonus for transferring from a congested world to a preferred world, but Hyperion isn't a congested world. You can read more [here](http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/5e1a319accdb6ec98b54ef82e35d22338cf55ce7).

&gt;PS: Is there anyway to review the story (spoiler-free) up to a given point besides through the quest log in game?

I don't care if they got Tarly, you don't win a castle siege without some incredible trickery, diplomacy or an overwhelming numbers advantage and extremely heavy losses. They made it clear with dialogue that it just came down to straight fighting and the Lannisters won easily.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","With an email list of 10K .... **why** would you need a publisher?

Say only half of the list converts (buys) every time you release a new book and announce it to them.  (($2.99 * 5K)*.7) = $10,465.

Unless you are a celebrity or otherwise in a position to have a powerhouse Hollywood agent who can land a six or seven figure book deal for you ... there is no publisher anywhere that will pay you even a third of that ten thousand you just made.

""But royalties!"" will be the response.  ""The advance is just that; but the publisher will pay royalties too, so you need to add that in.""  Okay.  8-10% is typical.  And returns (the unsold books the stores order and then send back to the publisher) are often charged against your royalties; making you pay for the system that encourages stores and publishers to not think or plan strategically for how they sell books.

There is a reason only a very, very, very, **very** small percentage of traditionally published writers earn enough from their traditional publishing to live off of.  As in, a single digit percentage number of the trad writers.

And finally, if your email list can consistently push 5K sales, that's going to do amazing things for your rankings.  Making your books extremely visible, which puts it in front of a lot of non-list customers.  Some of those will buy too.  Their buys will help your titles maintain or improve their rankings, which creates a self-sustaining feedback loop.

One thing though - the youtuber promotion is sadly a good thing. Yes, it causes a lot of stupidity and toxicity, but a lot of players wouldn't be here if not for that introduction. (Myself included - here from TrumpSC.) At the end of the day, BMG wants to make money from this and appealing to a wide audience of both hardcore and casual players is the best way to do this.

Yep. I think you're right about that. They've had all this time (over a year) to hone on the jokes, writing and plot lines and we get a generic episode with no real point. 

I rewatched the episode and a few of the jokes were a little too on the nose, which I think shows should avoid if they want to be timeless. I liken it SOMEWHAT to the GoT episode with Ed Sheeran.

I mean China, if its intelligence community is at least a bit competent (we don't know it, but let's bet that it is), would most probably already have a lot more plans on how to make reunification happen than the US does. They would have a lot more intelligence on North Korea, would be in contact with the other higher-ups in the country's political and military elite who could possibly stage a coup. The biggest reason for North Korea's existence supported by China is to be a buffer state against U.S. forces, and the biggest reason for U.S. forces existence in South Korea is due to the threat of North Korean invasion. If America can trust China enough to do a tit-for-tat, the North Korean problem could be solved without any nukes dropping anywhere. But it's really up to China, and South Korea getting on board with such a proposal.

I was 24 years old, working all alone in a male department with men in their mid 30's. The way that they looked at me and spoke to me was absolutely vile. I felt scared and violated every single day that I went to work. But I couldn't say anything because it was ""just jokes"". I don't give a fuck if its a joke, it's not appropriate. Women are more likely to be sexually harassed, sexually assaulted, and raped. Women often feel that they cannot stand up to someone less they endanger their jobs or their position at their job. There is still a power imbalance when it comes to men and women in jobs, especially if a woman is far outnumbered by a man. And the things that men say in these situations are often disgusting and threatening. 

Stop hiding behind ""it's just a joke"". You know who says shit like that? Bullies. People who harass. Assholes. Stop doing it because I guarantee you there are many people who hate it but feel like they can't stay anything about it. It's inappropriate and unprofessional. ",1501545629

- You can scale a white weapon with ele damage sourced elsewhere = cheaper

- You can scale a decent ele weapon just as much as a decent phys weapon, ele wins out in low-mid tier, phys wins out in top tier, but you have the option to go full phys and ignore enemy resistances with less potential damage, or stack both phys and ele, and tons of options every which way.

For my crit build (not build for BF), there are efficient ele nodes on my way from shadow to scion, so if i used hrimburn gloves and phys-&gt;cold from the same tree i'd get more damage than a pure phys build, less damage than an ele build, but have to deal with enemy resistances, but i built for ele.

Theres just so many variables, mostly budget, to give you a straight answer, it depends on those and i thought i made it clear.

FINALLY this makes sense to me! I've been trying to figure out why the Novronian succession seemed to operate so differently than the one presented in Age of Myth. It's such a simple answer that they weren't following the rules of the law properly.

This must be why the Novronian emperor kept going back to Avempartha - to present the horn for challenge as part of the ""treaty""? And since both the Emperor and his heir would be there when the...thingy thing (I have no idea how to spell 'gilarabryn' properly) attacked, clearly someone was trying to get a new line of succession started (one of the Myraleith?

Not to mention the effects of a 75mm solid-steel shot hitting a wall at almost twice the speed of sound. Also, the fragmentation rounds and shells that are meant to split apart after hitting.

""For real though something's wrong with that kid."" Charlie said with a slight grin to Colin.

""Haha yeah, he looks like the next guy to 'go rogue' like the dude on the news did.""

""Wait, who went rogue?""

""Oswald Wessel, dude fucking blew apart his wife and 2 kids apart with a *scream*. One of his kids were completely obliterated, didn't find anything left of him."" 

""Fuck man I've heard about that, didn't he kill seven Elites trying to get away?""

""That's the guy.""

""That's unreal, what tier is he?""

""I don't know, the SPT is thinking he's gonna be the third class five in history.""

""He has to be, killing seven *Elites* those guys are class atleast tier three's."" He said holding up three fingers.

""Damn. Imagine if he became a Fighter, or an Elite himself.""

""Hell yeah I'd pay to watch that guy if he came a Fighter, seeing him blow people away using his voice. You watching the..""

The sound of the bell cut off the conversation.

""Alright class,"" Mrs Boyd said as she walked into the room ""First of all, I'd like to wish you all a 'welcome back' and that this year is going to be a thrill with all the upcoming events that this school has to offer!"" 

The class all began to whisper and move in their chairs excitedly for the announcements, after all this is the one hundredth year of the National Fight and Sparring League and the way Fallback High preformed last year they were favorites to win the league this time around. 

""Yes class I know this is all very exciting! Fallback is in its prime and this week we will have tryouts for the school's NFSL team. But first, attendance!

""Charlie Dane?"" Mrs Boyd called out.

""Always here Mrs Boyd!"" She chuckled at him. But then gave a frown to the attendance list.

""Damon Ángel?"" The teacher called out. He put his hand up reluctantly.

""Well well"" said Mrs Boyd ""this is quite the treat! Class, it looks like we have a new student! Why don't you tell us about yourself Damon?""

Damon opened half of his mouth, trying to not tell the class about himself, before Mrs Boyd interrupted him,

""Come on, come on stand up!"" she was squealing with excitement.

""Fuck sakes"" Damon said under his breath. He stood up, the sounds of his boots pounded into the tile floor as he stood Charlie tried his best not to laugh. 

""Colin!"" he leaned towards him silently screaming ""dude what *is that*!"" He was barely containing his laughter.

Colin leaned in ""Man I don't  know but I can't with that outfit, *holy shit*! Looks like he's a Midnight supporter, judging by that hoodie!""

""What a joke, who even supports the Midnights anymore? Theres not a worse Fight team.""

Damon wore the Midnights hoodie, their logo of the cat looking at the full moon was across his chest, his ears were pierced with gauges. The black, skinny jeans he wore were ripped and tattered, from his pocket came a golden chain which connected to his pants l, his hair was like charcoal, and despite his name, is caucasian in color.

""Ahem."" Mrs Boyd's green eyes pierced the two boys like a spear and they instantly stopped the banter.

""Go ahead my dear."" Mrs Boyd said in an apologetic way.

""Uh well, My names Damon and I..""

""Am a total faaaaaaag!"" yelled Charlie from the back of the room. 

""Charlie!"" Mrs Boyd shouted at him but when she looked at him he disappeared with a ringing noise.

Damon instantly sat down in embarrassment, his face was as red and to hide it, pulled up his hood. Mrs Boyd continued with class. Then the bell rang and everyone walked out of class grinning at what had happened ealier.

""Hold up"" Mrs Boyd said to Damon when he reached the door, he turned and looked at her ""don't listen to what Charlie said, he thinks he's a hot shot now when he won best Fighter of Fallback last year.""

""Yeah whatever, I don't care what anyone thinks."" Damon said as he walked towards the door. 

""Just one more thing Damon."" said Mrs Boyd. He turns around just wanting to leave, *come on, let me go* he thought. 

""Take this, I expect you to be there.""

Damon turned back and reached for the piece of paper in Mrs Boyd's hand. It was a flier for the Fight and Sparring team for Fallback. Damon just stared at it.

""My favorite team is the Midnights.""

He looked up surprisingly at Mrs Boyd, she had a smile on her face, the kind that tells you not to worry.

""I-I don't know, I'm not exactly experienced with fighting.""

""Don't worry"" Mrs Boyd said with a smile ""I know you'll do well.""


It was Friday now, day of the tryouts. They were held in the stadium outside the school. The stadium was a bowl in the ground, with the arena at the bottom and the bleachers running up the sides. People were there. All mostly proud parents, faculty and students. At the bottom of the bowl, Mrs Boyd was there with a fewer other adults. Damon walked down the steps towards an empty section when he heard Mrs Boyd yell,

""I knew you'd come Damon! Get on over here!"" 

He walked over to her looking down trying to avoid all the stares and the whispers. He looks at Mrs Boyd with pleading eyes.

""I still don't believe I'm doing this, I don't even think I have powers.""

""You do Damon, I *feel* them waiting to be released!"" 

*I feel like I have powers too but they never show* he thought. *I don't know what I can do, my mom can control plants and my dad can..* his thoughts were interrupted by Mrs Boyd.

""Alright look at the board and find your name, the name paired with you will be the person you are fighting against.""

*Alright* I thought *whos gonna be the one to knock my head into the ground this time? Watch it be Charlie, knowing my luck. God I hate that kid.*

""Hey, Gay-man!"" Charlie said with sarcasm, he walked towards Damon with Colin and his other goons.

""You're fighting me, so tell me what can you do? Everyone says you're a freak that can't do jack.""

Sweat was dripping from his forehead now, *shit what am I gonna say* he opened my mouth to speak but Mrs Boyd cut in, ""He can do many things"" she said ""You'll Just have to wait to find out."" 

""Good things it's not long, we're fighting first, come on guys."" Charlie walked away with his goons and I let out a sigh of relief. 

Mrs Boyd put a hand on his shoulder, ""You do have powers you know."" 

""Yeah yeah."" Damon said and walked away to get ready to get curb stomped by Charlie. *Of course it's him, Im so screwed* 

The loud speaker turned on and screeched *** Charlie Dane to the left side of the arena, Damon Ángel proceed to the right*** 

*Well, this won't be the first time I got beat up by a super* He thought. Charlie was already waiting at his side of the arena, where a box was on both sides of the arena.

""Pick up the pace Gay-man!"" He yelled smiling at him.

*God I wish I can kick your ass* 

The referee walked towards the center of the arena, and spoke ""Inside the boxes in front of you, if you hadn't already,"" he said looking at Damon ""put on the suit inside."" Damon looked across at Charlie, *he isn't wearing a suit* Damon unlocked the chest to find the suit. It was clear and felt like plastic. He slipped it on and it disappeared. *Woah* the referee continued ""The rules are simple, there will be three rounds. If someone is knocked out in match it's an automatic win to the opponent. The suits you've put on will protect you from major injury. Here everything goes in Sparring other than killing your opponent. Ready? FIGHT!""

He blew his whistle, the crowd roared and Charlie disappeared followed by the ringing sounds heard in class earlier in the week. *Man for real?* Damon thought, followed by a freight train hitting his back.
***OH THATS GOTTA HURT*** shouted the announcer. Damon flew a hundred feet forward landing on his chest and tumbling over. Damon studdered to his feet and looked around he couldn't see Charlie. ***This is Damon now looking for Charlie, good luck you won't find him!*** *Great invisibility, I wish I could do that.* Damon's thoughts were interrupted by a sucker punch to the gut, ***WELL IT LOOKS LIKE CHARLIE FOUND YOU FIRST!*** Damon  crumpled over, now Charlie was un-invisible just stomping on him.

""Come on kid! This is way to ea..""

His thoughts ended when Damon grabbed his foot and crushed it.

***Well looks like Charlie hurt his own foot from up here!*** 

""AGH YOU SON OF A.."" 

Damon was on his feet now, and had grabbed Charlie's tongue. 

***Or maybe not! This has gotten interesting now!***

*No, it's happening again*

Two large dark wings sprouted from Damon's back. They were easily six feet across each, it was like a nights sky, like  a universe lived inside those wings.

""Way!"" Charlie tried to say wait but  Damon was still holding his tongue. He let go of it and just yelled at him. He screamed and it became energy. Charlie flew back and at the same time flew foward, he was being ripped apart and also compressed. The energy kicked up so much dust that the stadium was covered. ***WOAH WOAH WHAT HAPPENED HERE*** the announcer was still going. The smoke cleared, Damon was on his back, his wings retracted back into him. Charlie was on the opposite side on his feet already, limping towards Damon holding his side

""That was a neat trick you freak, but now, you're dead!""

""I don't care"" Damon gasped "" I have powers, just like my dads."" He was smiling now.

""What?!"" Charlie said to him gasping and also surprised.

""My names Damon *Wessel* Ángel, and he let me live."" Damons vision faded to black and with the smile of relief on his face.

My younger brother, who learned to talk while we were there, had only memories when we moved back to the states to PA.  He had never seen birds before, and chased one because he was so intrigued.  He also didn't know what snow was and freaked out the first time ever put his hand in it.

"maryland","t5_2qnnv","Been camping there pretty much every summer for the past 25 years, my wife for the past 40.

1. Bring insect repellant.  There will be bugs.  You have the mosquitos (the island mascot), black flies (they are annoying biters), green heads (horse flies that live unless decapitated), and in the past few years I've come across these little biting gnats/no- see-ums that get through your screen and bite the cap out of you when you try and sleep.  All the bugs can be non-existant during your stay or come in swarms depending on heat, humidity, and which way the wind is blowing so be prepared.

2.  Book ahead of time.  The state and national park fill up during the summer, especially during the weekends.  I only stay at the national side and book at the earliest time for my stay, which is 6 months out.  Not saying you won't find anything, but it pays to look before you go.

3.  DO NOT LEAVE FOOD/COOLERS/WATER/TRASH IN YOUR TENT!!!  THIS IS IMPORTANT!!
The horses will go through your tent.  They will rip it to shreds.  They do not care if you have onions or oranges, they know food is in a pretty box and they will get to it.  You can keep it out if you are at your site, but strap it down with a good bungee cord or keep it in your car or camper.  Do not give them scraps because they will go after you.  I have personally seen a horse go through a screen tent to eat a bag of oranges.  The next day after the family fixed their tent with safety pins and whatnot, they left trash behind.  The horses were back and made a different hole.  People don't learn.  A good noisemaker can scare them off, maybe.  I carried around 2 aluminum bats with me, NOT TO HIT THEM (before morons yell at me for that), but to bang them together.  Just don't get too close because they will kick and bite.

4.  Tents:  Buy sand stakes.  They make them in metal or plastic but are longer than traditional stakes.  The metal are worth it though.  If you have poles that are supported in the dirt, bring small tuna cans or similar to put the base of your poles into it and less likely to sink into the sand.  If you can, spray  your poles with wd40 before connecting them together.  Sand will get into the connection and rust any metal as well as make them difficult to separate.  IMPORTANT:  Tie your tents down.  The storms can be crazy.  I have seen tents flip and flood.  I have had flooded tents and was lucky my clothes were in plastic bins.  I have seen tents go flat in the winds and some fly off like a kite.  Use extra sand stakes and good lines.

My wife and I love it there.  We have taken our kids camping there and they live it.  I have not gone camping the past 2 years because of life, but make at least 1 day trip per year.  We were just there 3 weeks ago with our kids and dogs.  There are fun things to do there if you like hiking, kayaking, or just relaxing.  Just be prepared.  There are cold showers on the national side, I think there are heated pay showers on state side.  

If you like BBQ, be sure to hit Smokers BBQ on 611(Stephen Decatur Hwy) just after The Greene Turtle.  Great pork bbq, love their banana pudding.

If you need wood or veggies, my favorite place is the guy at Assateague Farm &amp; Firewood on 376 by 611 and next to Bucks Place.  He's a good guy and retired out there after doing landscaping for years in the Baltimore area if I remember correctly.  He's a talker, but nice guy fair amount of wood for your buck, and good veggies.

Assateague Market is a rip off for ice and alcohol, but you pay for convenience.

Assateague Crab House though...great AYCE crab prices since they're off the main area and great people.

Hit the visitor center and check out the touch and feel tank there.  Good history on the island.  

Also, don't stop in the middle of the road or pull over to take a pic of the ponies.  You block traffic, can cause an accident, and they are everywhere.  You will see more.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;but I doubt SE will ever be what we hoped...

Not to defend KSH, but what exactly did you hope SE was going to turn into? Because the whole issue of Space Engineers is that the game keeps increasing in scope, there were never meant to be planets when the game launched in early access. The original idea was a simple space sandbox minecraft esque game. Then survival was added, then unlimited worlds, then procedural asteroids, slipspace blocks (Jump blocks), **PLANETS**, the scenario system  (A system that is supposed to allow the community to create its own story missions), co-op etc...

The game, in its current state has so much more than what was originally promised. There didn't use to be pistons and rotors that broke the game, but now there are, and now the game is broken (And has been, for years). Marek (Used to be lead dev) never even thought that SE could handle planets, but people complained that other games were having planets and as such they caved and spent many, many months forcing them in.

The community is as much the cancer of this game as most Early Access Survival developers are of their failed games. It's a shitty situation nobody likes to be in and in this case neither side wants to admit they have fucked up.",1501545636

Now, I think TDD is a fine practice, but it's hard to get right, especially to those without experience. 

It's also hard to start testing in a code base that didn't start with it. Michael Feather's ""Working Effectively With Legacy Code"" is my bible in these cases. Steve Vance's ""Quality Code: Software Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns"" is fantastic but isn't a beginner's book.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","&gt; the end of that relationship had a lot to do with her being bisexual

It probably didn't. It had a lot to do with her being a jerk. What I mean is, if she were straight, she would have belittled you for something else. If you're short, she would have kept talking about how she loves tall men, how they're sexy and you're not. Or maybe she would have had a type who is another race than yours. Or perhaps she would have complained that your penis is too small, even if it's big.

My point is, the bisexuality may have been the weapon she used to hurt you, but it wasn't the reason she hurt you.

Now, being hurt by that experience makes sense. Being worried makes sense, too. If someone attacked you with a knife maybe you would be afraid of knives and not want them at your table. But the reason you are getting these answers is that it sounds like you are blaming bisexuality for your girlfriend's behavior, rather than blaming her for her actions.

I mean, obviously you are blaming her, but... the fact that you focus on something she couldn't change (her sexuality) rather than something she could have (the way she decided to treat you) makes it look like you're finding excuses for her behavior. (And the side effect is to accuse people who are taking a lot of discrimination from both sides, so people here can be on edge about it).

I don't think you have to date bisexual women. I mean, it still leaves you with a bigger dating pool than if you were a gay man (by a lot). And you can of course have your own preferences. But if you cope with your trauma by eliminating something that is harmless (bisexuality) rather than something that is harmful (being a jerk, treating people poorly, making them feel unworthy), you'll still be vulnerable to people who are just like your ex but happen to be straight, while excluding people who could have helped you heal from her.

In the end, I do hope you find people who make you happy and don't make you relive bad stuff that has happened to you, and if that means they'll all be straight, that's no skin off my nose. I'm just trying to explain why this part of your message is what a lot of us are focusing on, why it's a worry. I hope I didn't come off as aggressive about it. I realise I don't know anything about you. I just know that there is nothing about bisexuality that forces you to hurt your partners, and I worry that you're actually repeating some excuse she fed you when she was treating you like shit and not even noticing.

Anyway, I think you got the answer to the question you actually did ask. Finding a straight poly woman shouldn't be much harder than finding a poly woman is in the first place :)",1501545638

It's really hard for me to know what lanes to go to. Often times neither side have bot tower and I don't know what to do with the wave... I can't solo push myself all the way to tower most of the time, because there are no wards and someone on the enemy team will likely kill me. But I also can't freeze the whole game if my team is losing really badly. What do I do? Slow push? Let it push with a slight minion advantage? I really need help on this. I just don't know what to do with bot wave most of the time, and I almost never go top, because it's even more confusing to know what to do.

I mean: to improve our food, hotel and restaurant standards of quality is great for tourism I get it but that is secundary. To improve the transportation system, to improve our street safeness should be motivated by our needs, not because Asian tourists got mobed by a group of youngs wannabe-thugs.

If we, the inhabitants, could enjoy good condition of life, fair prices, safeness, good transportation infrastructures, then, because the common people have access to such level of wellbeing the tourists will enjoy them as well.

I understand that the OG are an ""opportunity"" and that some foreign investments would be made but as most of the money invested would come from the French tax payers in the end, why wait for this ""opportunity""?

"reactiongifs","t5_2t5y3","Funnily enough the only reason I even replied on this because while I have opened a lot of doors for people today has been the first time I remember that I didn't get any acknowledgement at all. Maybe I just live in a place with a lot of extroverts or I forgot, but even people that I learned later on is incredible shy still got out the nod or something equal. I can also tell you that I didn't say anything and didn't even roll my eyes at him even if he wouldn't have seen nothing it, I had a small mental reaction to the oddity of not for ones getting a reaction and then promptly forgot it until this thread pop up on /all.

And well I personally can't control social pressure or make other people feel or don't feel that pressure. So accusing me of using social pressure to receive a lesser energy response then what was supplied seems quite odd. I can't not make them feel what they feel and I can't predict their response to me opening the door before I do it. 

Completely honestly if someone actually stated calmly that they in fact did not appreciate me opening the door for them I would not freak out at all. I would probably be a stunned and go ""Okey? ... may I ask why?"" Because that is just how I personally work. Now you could accuse me of being overly questioning but if they stated that clearly their opinion then they would probably be open for a short response. Because if it is me that is the issue, well then I might need to work on that.

On the logical part do no kindness well I was mostly sarcastic even if I still believe that is the logical conclusion to draw with all the people here telling that they hate having other people open doors for them. But kindness is only logical if you see it as communal contribution.

Still you are wrong on at least one thing. If I see the guy (honestly already forgot his appearance) I will not open the door for him, even if the case is similar as it was today with his hands full and unable to kick the door open as he held fragile expensive equipment.

Christ, do you even listen to yourself. You're like a walking parody. 

&gt;Most of what is taught in school will not be used by most people in most cases. That doesn't mean it isn't part of bloody general knowledge.

Not nearly to the degree of uselessness in Roman numerals. Math concepts are the main culprit, but even those you can use as general logic and problem solving knowledge. Roman numerals? You said it yourself, they're fairly easy and simple to learn, but because of that, there really don't bolster any sort of ""general knowledge"". You could memorize the Chinese characters for numbers as well and that's equally easy and more useful. Knowing Roman numerals isn't going to break or make someone's intellect. 

&gt;As in, a hundred times worse. It actually impacts the world in very very tangible ways every single day.

Now please spin this in the context of Roman numerals. How does someone not knowing Roman numerals effect almost anything? Willful ignorance on concepts that someone needs to know is bad, but on frivolous stuff like this, it's certainly not as bad as the people who arrogantly tout their knowledge and speak down to anyone who doesn't know it. An ignorant person can learn, but an arrogant person is just an asshole. 

&gt;you're doubling down on the 'proud ignorance' part.

So to sum up your answer, you have no real particularly beneficial reason to learn Roman numerals. Good to know.

It's just speculation about the future, while existing bitcoin has a use case NOW and it is ACTUALLY used in ""informal economy"" (not necessarily illegal) and in other situations where (pseudo)anonymity is desirable.

BTW, when paying for coffee, those are exactly same seconds with LTC and BTC since confirmations are not required. The difference is really in transaction costs.

 P.S. likely BCH will have equally cheap transaction costs (as LTC). But it all does not matter, neither Roger's bigblocks, nor Charlie's improvements, nor Jared's 3 seconds will not magically turn those cryptos into money like BTC is, just because they have certain perceived advantages.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Around 8 or 9 years old, I went to the dentist to remove my 2 baby canines to make room for the 2 that would grow in crooked should I not get the procedure. The oral surgeon numbs me up adequately, or so I thought. He then extracts one tooth after a bit of wiggling and jostling and it came out fairly easily, with only slight pain. I though, ""man, this is going to be a breeze."" Boy, was I wrong.

The second tooth was not as loose as the first. In fact, it was still attached to my jaw. To my youthful horror, I watched as the oral surgeon climbed on top of the table, straddling me, pulling and tugging on this tooth. I felt searing pain shoot through my bone, and I heard harsh cracks as I physically felt the tooth break away. Tears were rolling down my cheeks at this point, and the oral surgeon soon saw, panicked, and applied more numbing solution. Finally the tooth broke free, and I breathed a stinging, throbbing sigh of relief. 

After all of this, the man has the audacity to give me chocolate ice cream as a farewell gift. I sat, limp lipped, looking as if I was one of those damn cleaning fish on the side of the aquarium walls while I tried to slurp on this chocolate mush, which ended up all over my clothes.

I played through WD1 in anticipation for WD2 and pretty much the entire experience felt like a derivative slog, apart from some missions that included Jordi and T-Bone. Espcially excruciating was the whole thing with Clara and forcing her to die in service of Aidan's feels after his niece already did. I hated that.

WD2, in comparison, was an absolute joy to play and I was able to look back on it fondly when I finally, reluctantly, put it down. It's not without it's issues but I'd gladly jump back into WD2. I wouldn't replay WD1 if you paid me.",1501545645

What LE expects from a bank or an exchange is traceability and awareness. Both are impossible with Monero. 
Look to what happened to BTC-E. What if all ransomware hackers start converting their BTC to XMR? The exchanges will receive tons of XMR and LE are going to say : you need to stop accepting XMR or we'll shut you down, because we have enough reasons to think this money comes from criminal activities. XMR is way too perfect for money laundering, right? And when the dark markets come back after the last shutdowns, I'm sure they will adopt Monero over Bitcoin. This will bring a HUGE market. 
Am I missing something? Just trying to understand how the total anonymity won't kill Monero when it becomes too big. It could be catalogued as a ""criminal cryptocurrency"" faster than we think. Then, it might be over...

It's like if there's a school shooting in the US by a bullied kid; do you need to know everything about the kid, what exactly was said to him, and how many bullets he fired to understand the situation? No, kids are emotionally unstable, have access to guns, and are held powerless to fight back by the school system, so he lashed out the only way he felt able. 

Similarly, Islam explicitly commands violence against many different people (apostates, homosexuals, other religions, other races, women who disobey, women who are raped/""sluts"", anyone who alters or insults Islam/Allah/Mohammed, et. Al.) and they have access to guns via the actions of the corrupt US government. Pretty obvious what that leads to, and when it does, I expect it. 

ALSO why I don't need to read why someone in Paris or Europe who slaughtered multiple people while yelling ""ALLAHU AKBAR"": it's obvious.

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

"skateboarding","t5_2qig3","Maybe the deck is okay and the rest of the parts are cheap as hell, or maybe the deck sucks too. Possible considering it sounds like even the grip tape is cheap. A skateboard is the sum of its parts and buying a skateboard complete is like buying a prebuilt computer where they cheap out wherever they can even slightly get away with it.

Find out what kind of trucks, wheels, bushings and bearings it came with and see if any of those can be switched out for something better. Also in the short term learn to adjust the bushings, tighten and loosen the trucks and tighten and loosen the screws keeping the wheels on until all that's properly tuned. But chances are you woulda done better getting a blank deck, bearings, wheels, screws, etc all separately and putting it together yourself.

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","&gt; All my observations in my comment above are true

Well, no, you *think* they are true, because you made them. But equally true is my observation:

&gt; I've yet to see you post one thing of substance in your time here; all you do is post pro-Core soundbites and heckle anyone who dares differ in opinion.

Yes, OP appears to be new to /r/BitcoinMarkets (at least as far as posting goes), though I've seen his name in the other Bitcoin subs, and he did put some effort into his post here. That much I can agree is true. As for ""propagandist rbtc undertone"" and ""full of all kinds of bullshit,"" well, that's clearly subjective. And you've done nothing to actually convince anyone reading that this is so; you haven't refuted a single point, idea, or premise of his. Hence you wouldn't really be able to blame the casual reader for remaining unconvinced of your ""true"" observations. I mean, ""rbtc undertone""...really? He analyzes scenarios that /r/btc shills would downright hate to see happen as being realistic, and even gives credit to Core and the UASF movement. If he's propagandizing, he's doing an awfully bad job of it, don't you think?

Anyway: heckle less, and try providing actual insight and reasonable arguments to back up your pro-Core stance. You might be right about some of it! You might convince some readers! But you might also be forced to think things through and refute non-trivial counterarguments, which I suspect you're hesitant to do.

Bixby- ah yes! Another r/Android user who has watched one video about Bixby and decided it's inferior to Satan himself! Good to know you're educated on the subject! /s


The S8 camera is just as viable in the ""pick up and snap"" category as the iPhone 7 is. The S8 is FAR superior if you venture into Pro mode. Cause you know, not all consumers are little kids. Some people want to try to take to good pictures...

TouchID - Obviously.

3D Touch - A gimmick tbh. It doesn't change the user experience in any meaningful way. It's a toy to show off to others. Plus Android can replicate it through software and it's just as useful. It's not really innovation. But ir can have an impact on UX so if you want to call it that, I guess.

Camera improvements - So basically what everyone does every year, is innovation? Samsung improved the software on the S8 while keeping the S7 sensor. The S8 shoots better pics than the S7. That's not innovation. That's an expected upgrade.


""Dual Camera System that Actually works"" I am pretty sure Huawei would laugh at that claim.


Apple Pay - Really? Being a popular company means you can claim innovation on something you did second? Okay. Cool. /s

I take it you haven't used an S8... It's like you don't understand how much better this device is to use. Like, it's a religion. Once you go infinity display, you never go back.

Android OS - Biggest flaw? Bitch please! This is the most useless statement of ever. It's the biggest advantage. It might be the biggest flaw to you. But again, your bias has no impact on the reality of the product. The reality is that Android devices are successful because Android has done some amazing things.

This is an interesting conversation in general because the number of teams dictates that anyone in the ""top 30"" designation for MLB has to be capable of being a team's ace. Gray, when healthy (and he's had two 200 inning seasons, so it's there), is perfectly capable of being a staff ace. We're just in a golden age of pitching. But you'd immediately take the peak Gray season over anyone on the Yankees' staff with maybe the exception of what Severino is doing right now and maybe one Tanaka season. He's better than just about anyone in the AL East with the exceptions of Sale (duh), Archer, and Stroman. If he pitches the rest of the season relatively close to where he's been the last month-plus, the Yankees are immediately the favorite for the division considering their bullpen improvements. Even if you call Gray a ""top 60"" pitcher, you're implying he'd be the #2 on a team's staff at bare minimum. Given what the Yankees gave up and his age/salary, that is a tremendous haul and I think it's sort of selling Somny Gray short to call him a ""top 60"" starter. ",1501545649

Oh and another fun problem but let's say the system itself isn't flawed but that the code going on the DVD was compromised on the build server so that all copies are equally compromised and all checksums inherently match?

My point is that as easy as it is to come up with a better system it's just as easy to come up with more attack vectors. Sure your system may be better than what we have now, but it won't be in the next election cycle.

Also, and here's the kicker that's biting every single voting machine system: How do you upgrade it when a critical vulnerability in the system is found and how do you ensure that the updates are correctly produced, transmitted and installed when you have near clueless elected secretary of states in charge of it all?",1501545652

I go hard on my commutes, at least 23mph on that section, and was surprised someone was keeping up on flats, but his drafting pushed me to go unsustainably faster so eventually I slowed down so that he'd pass me.

My original math was:

&gt; ""Today, advertising makes up 31% of the company's total revenue. Less than half of that comes from YouTube ads; the rest comes from sponsorship relationships.""

31% from advertising as a whole. My understanding by ""the rest..."" meant the rest of their overall revenue, not the rest of the advertising-specific revenue. (Part of the reason why I said it was vague, it can be taken in both ways).

&gt; One-fifth of revenue comes from the sales of merchandise.

51% of total revenue accounted for, putting first memberships at 49% of the company's overall income. As you can see from my original comment, I'm still correct:

&gt; ""This one I have a hard time figuring out. Do they mean First Members (formerly called sponsors?) or do they mean the sponsored ad reads in every video? I would think that the sponsored ad reads would fall under advertising revenue but it's vague and unclear.""

So technically, I'm not wrong, you're just splitting hairs at this point and not reading the entire content I wrote above.

Kintsugi (金継ぎ, きんつぎ, ""golden joinery""), also known as Kintsukuroi (金繕い, きんつくろい, ""golden repair""), is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum, a method similar to the maki-e technique. As a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.

That all said- I see it as higher risk than ETH, and I don't think it's ready for ICO's yet. There's certainly no current competition. Not at all, but long-term, there may be. I understand that there are a lot of ETH fans on here, I've been buying some ETH in the dips lately as well. What excites me about ANS (NEO) is that if it does catch on (and it's starting to - COZ has begun some rapid, high quality work to create wallets for IOS and other platforms, and NEO has added a few developers and is being more responsive to Westerners), it could be the equivalent of investing in ETH in the first few years.

What I'm getting at is that I do expect the Falcon 9 to be in service for 30 years or more, much like the Centaur upper stage, but I expect Falcon 9 to go through many further improvements before the production line is finally shut down for good. There will have to be a very stable version, to satisfy NASA's requirements for manned spaceflight, but manned spaceflight will become the domain of mini-BFR/ITS in 5 years or so.

*****
&gt; The president isn&amp;#039;t just the most visible public figure in the world; he&amp;#039;s also the head of the vast federal bureaucracy, and his actions have made it clear to every federal employee - from cabinet secretaries on down - exactly how to get on the boss&amp;#039;s good side: spend money at Trump properties.

&gt; The unfortunate fact is that current loopholes for the president make it difficult to stop Trump from accepting taxpayer money at his private establishments - a clear example of how legal is not always synonymous with ethical.

First of all, my condolences. The injury sucks, and the recovery is long. You will discover new levels of frustration and also patience. You might feel helpless at times and doubtful of being able to be at the same athletic level you want. Don't get too frustrated. It will only make the road back that much rockier. Listen to your body and your doctor. But heed these words:

DO

YOUR

PHYSICAL THERAPY!!!

I cannot stress that enough. It will be tedious and painful at first, but it pays so many dividends in the long run. Skipping it or taking it lightly will only set you back and keep you from playing at the level you are used to. You will need to be very diligent if you want to regain your strength and help prevent re-injury. 

I am nearly two years removed from surgery and I have moderate pain in my knee to this day, but I am able to do almost everything I used to. I am just more cautious. I have a soft brace for when I play disc golf because I've had minor issues with knee pain after rounds. However, I am happy to say that I used my recovery to work on my form and on the finer mechanics. I couldn't seriously play until 9 months after my surgery, but everyone is different. 

Find small things to work on. Putting might not be strenuous. Same with forehand. But always, always listen to your body and don't put yourself in a worse spot by trying to do to much. Have faith, my dude. You will be back on the links before you know it! ",1501545662

"iamverybadass","t5_386om","The problem is that we see two sides of the same coin. Hillary didn't need a competent campaign manager. She needed to be a better candidate. She was just as corrupt as people say Trump is. She has *yet* to even address the emails that showed all the scandals she's done, instead she'll point at Trump and Russia and blame them. If someone checked their SO's phone and finds them cheating, do you blame the cheater or the person who found it out? Common sense would say the cheater.

As for the election: yes, I know how the popular vote and electoral college work. You don't have to patronize me and act like that's the first time I've ever seen those statistics. If you also look at the results, you'll realize that the entire lead comes from California, a state with offensively horrible voting laws, and has consistently voted blue for a long time. I'm not claiming there's election rigging (unlike some people in this thread), But I will point out that if you take out California, Trump won the popular vote. It's part of why Trump won the electoral college too; *Hillary appealed well to her supporters -the democrats- but Trump actually campaigned and earned support **across** the country, rather than specific areas*

And for your final points: I don't think there's a recession, I think the economy's improving and the stocks reflect that. The ""deals"" the ""world"" has been making without us are terrible. Actually look at the deals. In the Paris Treaty, for example, we're pretty much just throwing money at other countries for nothing in return. Trump promised better deals, and he's actually delivering by not signing every shitty deal that lands on his desk. I don't know what you're talking about with NK, but they've been an issue since the Cold War, are you going to blame the holocaust on Trump next? I've never heard about him stealing tax dollars for his hotels so I'd actually like to see a source on that. And as for the whole ""Russia"" thing, I'd *also* like to see a source on that.  

I'd also like to point out that their idea of ""election interference"" was forced transparency of the DNC's wrongdoings. Yeah, they got hacked, and got caught with their pants down. *But if you consider the truth about your parties actions a threat to an election, you aren't a good candidate*",1501545663

Now, lets try again.

Your campaign villain is actually the shadowy director of a large augmentations sub of an AAA corp. He's funnelling money into creation of super-soldiers under the guise of legitimate research.

The runners do a job or two, and come across these super soliders. They're tough, but not 'boss fights'. Clues start to get put together, and as the cold war / shadow anamosity grows between this guy, who is pissed his pet weapons are getting shot up, and runners who are pissed their jobs are getting sent off the rails....

Eventually the runners are going to decide: No. We're not doing a job this week. We're going out and we're going to find this guy and deal to him.

And that's how you set up a villain. No real villain is the meathead who fights in the open. Make someone smart. Calculating. Ruthless. And put them in a position of power. Have them use tools against the runners, make the difficulty even getting to them, not killing them personally.

What I hope happens is that we see that process happen to a lot of people over a very very short amount of time because, imo, that's the easiest and shortest path to the kind of radical social and economic change that's going to be required for us to transition from where we are today towards something better. 

Politics and social discussion will likely play a key role in this, especially when you consider how stigmatizing it is for someone to be out of work or enrolled in some sort of government assistance. For many people, there won't be many options, regardless of what their personal opinion is of those programs. I think if more people felt comfortable taking assistance and it was socially encouraged, especially as opposed to being hungry, cold, or sick, then we can make it over the hump without a lot things to go in the history books. 

Thanks for keeping that important aspect in the discussion.

&gt; The unfortunate fact is that current loopholes for the president make it difficult to stop Trump from accepting taxpayer money at his private establishments - a clear example of how legal is not always synonymous with ethical.

"funny","t5_2qh33","The hot lid stops steam from condensing. But once you pull the lid away it becomes relatively cool compared to the air directly around the grease. Putting the lid back over the grease will now cause some warm air to condense back into water. This is similar to how a cold glass will cause water to condense on the outside. In this instance the effect is rather negligible, however.

Also, the higher the pressure the more likely that water will condense. This is why water on Earth is liquid while water in the near vacuum of the rings of Saturn is gaseous. By putting the lid on the container that suddenly you are increasing the pressure and it causes small amounts of water to condense. This is more significant than the previous point but still nearly negligible. But it leads into the big point.

Frozen food has ice on it. Putting ice into hot grease is ill advised. Especially if you then put a lid back on it and don't let the water escape anywhere, make pressure build, and force all the water to condense back",1501545668

"UKPersonalFinance","t5_2wkka","&gt;Yeah, yeah, students eating beans on toast and all that, but you don't do that every day for a year. I was a student for 4 years and I did not know a single person that ate on that kind of budget.

It's definitely do-able, I just finished my 3 year degree and managed it very comfortably. It's not like I was scraping the barrel either, I had a varied diet and didn't skimp on meat etc at all.

&gt;you can't buy a panini from the student union when you slept in too late to pack lunch

Prepping a lunch the night before would prevent this.

&gt;can't buy a bag of sweets to study with

A few sweets won't exactly break the budget. I'd always have a drawer filled with chocolate/biscuits in case I fancy something, or need something to keep me ticking over at the library between meals.

&gt;If you want to eat meat or drink anything other than water you are not going to get through a week's food on £20.

Asda, 4 litre bottles of orange juice for £2.30, 1kg of chicken for £4.50, 750g for 5% fresh beef mince for shy of £5. Carbs are cheap as chips, as are vegetables. That mean will definitely last more than a week.

&gt; Who's buying your enormous cooking pots? 

You say this as though purchasing cooking equipment is only something that the OP would have to do if they were to take my advice. Funnily enough, I think they'll have to buy some anyway. You don't need industrial sized gear as a student, even cooking for a couple of days at a time.

&gt;Who's buying your spice rack and your herbs?

Again, not overly expensive and not exclusive to cooking on a budget.

&gt; Are you getting a taxi back from the place on the other side of the city that does the 20 kilo bags of rice for £6.99?

No, but I have heard of a fantastic new concept known as ""online shopping"". Some retailers offer £1 delivery, who would have thought it!

A few of my friends used to walk to the Lidl and split a £4 uber back with their stuff, which is an option if there is one near enough, but I always just used online shopping.

It's not too hard to do it if you can plan things to a half decent degree (it's not like I was using spreadsheets to count how many grams of meat i could eat per day), but I can see where your scepticism comes from.

Eating at restaurants would have been the biggest thing to go against the budget, but I'd have just taken that out of my monthly ballpark figure for ""entertainments"" (i.e. drink, going out, what have you). Obviously though, if OP's on a strict budget, going to restaurants isn't going to be a priority.

&gt;£30 for everything else is absolutely not enough

My main constraint on that was the drink, which is hard to budget I suppose. I was thinking £10 drink, £5 phone, £5 gym, £5 laundry/toiletries/etc and £5 for whatever else there was.
If i've missed anything major let me know, but I don't think that's too outlandish.",1501545668
"Hungergames","t5_2sfjs","-------------Spoilers-—---------------




Anny was suffering severely everyday.  Before the rescue, Finnick was in turmoil being separated from her.  When Anny is saved, Finnick can not even stop holding her hand (in the book).  His last words in his interview with Caesar were about how his last dying thoughts would be about Anny.

Why would Finnick risk everything to join the mission?  There wasn't even a point in the squad being in the Capitol.  Their propos were done.

Saying something is out of character is different from saying someone would not be brave enough.  The author makes it clear that he is very brave - his name is Odair, as in dare.  But Just because Finn is capable and politically and personally motivated to do something doesn't mean that he will choose to do it and that it's consistent with their character.  Katniss went into a rage against Snow about Peetas torture.  Finn didn't have the same blinding rage.  In fact, Finn was overjoyed and had a wedding.

Anny was not the normal wife of a soldier.  A lot of men leave their wives for war but many many times the wives are self reliant.  Anny is different.  Finnick knew how much Anny needed him.  She had a difficult time telling what reality was.  She needed someone she could trust.  When you need reality checks you can't just ask anyone.  She needed Finnick.

Finn took his responsibilities to his only ""family"" seriously.  In the hunger games arena, He prioritized caring for Mags before joining/hunting the careers.  He would have done the same for Anny.  Hunting Snow was not his priority, caring for the last member of his family was.

While some parts of the book were, The deaths were not realistic portraits to describe the real life valor of brave men and women volunteering for duty.  The deaths were meant to teach children lessons about revenge and fighting.  The author finds fault with Katniss' seething, blinding rage and naive trust in district 13 and Coin.  The author is showing us how her past kills and survival against the odds (and propos) led to her to an unrealistic, egotistical and, possibly delusional, belief that she, specifically she, was powerful enough and special enough to kill the man who murdered so many.  Katniss suffered, but so did so many.  Katniss survived the hunger games, but there are other more dangerous kinds of threats.  She even calls the war the hunger games again.  Katniss did not have the maturity to see the big picture.  She was also suffering from nightmares - all effects from her traumas.  Her doctor was right about her illness.  Her doctor jokes for Katniss' benefit.

Katniss' ego, rage and learned disrespect for rules and orders was specific to Katniss herself, not to Finnick.  So why did a mature, adult Finnick go against orders?  He seemed to follow rebel orders in the hunger games when he was supposed to protect Katniss and Peeta.  In the arena, When Finnick tells Katniss to remember who the real enemy is, it is Katniss who answers that it is Snow, Finnick does not answer, and indeed the enemy turns out not to be a single person but a type of person.  

And the type of person Finnick is is someone who would use his strength to care for the weaker people he loves - Anny, who has no one else like/but Finnick.",1501545668

"Dariusmains","t5_390gk","Jax can be hard to fight if he knows what he's doing. The thing is that most high elo Jax players go top while most low elo Jaxes go jungle, so as Darius players we don't get much practice laning against the guy until we're losing Platinum promos over it.

Jax is like Darius in that he specializes in prolonged fights due to his passive. Both in a fight will be wanting to AA as much as possible to get passives online - Except he can stack it on minions then go all in. You have the better early than him so you should be able to create presence, keep him off minions (Aside form a few last hits, which won't stack his passive) and force a fight when you feel it's best. Fully stacked Jax passive &lt; Fully stacked Darius passive, but not if Jax gets to start the fight with his at full and kill you just after you get Noxian Might active.

A good Jax will be smart with his Q. He'll use it to jump directly on top of you to dodge your Q, so don't even bother Qing unless his jump's down. Ideally, he'd use his jump onto you with his helicopter active as his engage, so it gives you something to do while he's avoiding AAs. Alternatively, if he tries to escape with Q, you can cancel it with E if timed right, or predicted. Cucks them pretty hard.

Since the Kat rework, Jax is the only champ other than Lee Sin who can ward ump. (Correct me if I'm wrong.) This is one of the things that pulls people to play Jax, and they like to do it. Jax players will often be saving a ward so they can ward jump as an escape and whatnot. This means they're not warding as much as they should be, so it's easier for to co-ordinate early ganks with your jungler. Which you have to, since Jax is one of the best late-game fighters.

If he uses his W to empower his Q, he's retarded. Absolutely boosted. He's even more of a disappointment to his parents than you are. Fuck him up. This is your court. His only sports skin has a hockey stick, fucker picked the wrong game. If there isn't any dunking, then it isn't a sport.

The AA dodging is awkward, especially if you're one of the absolute madmen who builds Trinity Force most games. Pretty much don't do it against Jax, his dodging while render your higher AA mostly worthless; the mobility and tankiness are better against Jax, as is the cheaper cost and the armor shred to deal with his ult active.

Speaking of, his ult passive is the less scary part of it. Its passive is what gives him dueling power. Even if he builds tanky, since Jaxes lately have been watching Dong Huap and build Titanic Hydra as a second AA reset to instantly get that 3-hit passive goodness.

Wanna be a cheeseball? If you know he's the type to wait out his E's full length for maximum efficiency, E him just as he's about to get the stun off. You'll chest bump-him away, possibly far enough to not actually stun you. If not, you still knocked him up with the thing, giving him less time to take advantage of his successful stun.

You lose late. Get dunks early, carry despite him.",1501545668

Updated to Zodiac Age. If you need the treasure maps just google them.

Note: This app inflates each value in the Percent section by 1. So a 95 in the value is listed as 96%, and 99 is 100%, 0 is 1%, etc. Just the way the app creator prefers the numbers shown as actual percentage values.

96% to 100% are the 5% chance items (most rare items. And while I say 5%, thats only after all the other values match up, so obviously really rarer. But 5% here)",1501545669

Or he saw someone who looked like her,  she told him her name (not Amy Bradley),  and then after a few months either thought she said her name was Amy or he told people she said her name was Amy because she looked like her or he wanted to insert himself.   Or maybe her name *WAS* Amy or Amy Bradley,  it seems like it could be a common name?    I firkmly believe though that Amy, an older white girl on a cruise with her family wasn't taken for sex slavery and paraded around the world with her captors in front of witnesses after being in the media and searched for as a big case.   No way, and even if they did take her she would have been killed very quickly after she was taken as it would have been too much of a risk to keep her.   She fell or was pushed off the ship.

From a strategic perspective it makes sense to make distance between you and your future enemy.  The Soviets previously tried to make agreements with the allies. For stuff like Czechoslovakia, that the British and French gave up to the Germans, and later for Poland in exchange of Soviet troop's having free movement in Poland which the Pole's and allies saw as occupation. But to say they just let Germany take it, that'd be factually wrong, the Soviets weren't Britain. The Winter war also assured them they weren't ready to face Germany so waiting is also strategically correct . Not to mention the Western half of Poland was...not Polish to say. They conquered it just 20 years earlier. Declared war on Ukraine. Yes your precious Poland took someone else's land it happenes in history, they even took Czech land when the Germans occupied it. They held Lithuanias current capital for 20 years. You might argue that the katyn massacare was bad, which it is, but it's preferable to the German occupation of eastern Poland. ",1501545674

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","YMMV, but here's what works for me:

1) Get excited about exactly one change at a time until it's a habit and consistent lifestyle. Then I can move on to other changes as desired.

2) Tons and tons and tons of mini-goals, because what is going to happen is you'll lose the initial weight/gain the initial workout capacity quickly, but it'll take months (for weight) and years (for muscle) to see the rest of the change happen. I'm not a patient person, so I like to keep the successes constantly flowing.

3) Accept that ""willpower"" ain't shit. Want to deny yourself of foods? Figure out what is the least effort that is necessary to make that denial, when it comes to shopping plans, meal plans, and social plans. Want to get to the gym? Figure out how to make missing a gym appointment as personally mortifying as possible. And so on and so forth.",1501545676

"WikiLeaks","t5_2qy11","If we want to talk about propaganda, lets just take a step back.

Say for example we had to compare Russia and the US on the metric of how free the society is. With free being defined as the ability to think organic political ideas that aren't put there by state controlled propaganda. 

So how can we prove that the People in the United States have more freedom to think and choose than the Russian government would allow for their people? I think the answer may be relatively   easy, one man has controlled the entirety of the Russian government since 2000, taking a break in 08 to be puppet master for 4 years and still enjoys an 80% approval rating despite the quality of life in Russia being relatively worse than that in the US. While us Americans can't find something we don't complain about and put on the president, while the Russians can't seem to find anything to get mad at their leader about. 

That's pretty absurd. The thing about propaganda is this: there is no arbitrator for what is and isn't propaganda. It is only the thing that you disagree with that seems to earn that tag. I would encourage being critical of those who we think have earned our trust, because that is when the propaganda hits us the hardest. When we let our guard down to people we trust out of fear of a third party, that's how we turn into puppets. ",1501545676

"littlebigplanet","t5_2rqr8","I can seriously relate to this. You're not alone. LBP gets me very nostalgic. I had so many good memories with the game, in fact it is one of my most played games ever, AFAIK. I had a lot of friends I played with regularly. LBP2 was especially great. Even if you were just dicking around on the moon, it was so much fun to talk to your friends while testing your creative limits.

When LBP3 came out, I decided to pick it up and try to relive those memories I had as a younger kid, but LBP3 just sucked so hard as far as multiplayer goes, and I had the PS4 version! Haven't really played much other than it's story mode because of the multiplayer issues, and the fact that all the levels are fnaf and all the other things little kids like nowadays. Seems we just have to move on :/

On a happier note I recently picked up a ps3 and will be installing lbp1 as soon as i finish fixing it to play the story mode again (last time i played it I was probably 9 or so, and now I'm 17!) and maybe check out the online scene.

To diagnose SAI, you have to see a low AM cortisol and low ACTH. A cosyntropin stimulation will not be helpful.

The episode you experienced does not sound like an adrenal crisis. They don't get better with time, most people have weakness, fatigue, low BP and just feel like they are fading out.

I've turned Auto Rotation off and left Slowdown on because my initial aim is good enough without Auto Rotation's lock-on assistance, but playing without Slowdown is a chore. 

Don't get me wrong, there are games where I **can** excel with zero Aim Assist, but those are overshadowed by the many that I get dominated without it. You have to be at a considerable level of aiming excellency to consistently do well without any form of Aim Assist, because the competition who has it on doesn't have to try as hard to acquire targets or track targets. It just makes the whole process 50x easier and an easier process leads to near unwavering consistency. Positive consistency is the key to winning gunfights, so the players using a bot to aim for them or help them will almost always have the advantage over the player that doesn't use a bot.

There's a big difference between doing some venting on shifts that partner isn't working and talking mad shit over the headsets when they're right there. The latter is just straight-up high school behavior, and if this partner continues to underperform to the point where you feel you need to do that, that's when you set up a meeting with your SM about your concerns with that partner.

"shittyrobots","t5_324c1","For the simple application of concept, the tape could be acting as a crinkle-stitch... (I'm sure that's not even a correct term) the type of stitch that bunches material on one side like the stitch around elastic bands in gym shorts.  If you crinkle one side, it is shorter than the opposing side, so through inflation of the bladder, a natural curve is created out of a straight tube.  You could lay out and inflate the tube prior to use, shape it, and tape it before deflation. When reinflated, the tube takes that shape again....like the tube under the box with the globe. I would assume they can apply a steering mechanism similar to those in bore-scopes(at the controlling side, there are servos that push and pull cables that run the length of the scope to the camera. The only part that is pulled on is the camera so it can move like a snake head).   I have also seen new research on materials that expand/contract under electrical load. Strips of this stuff could be used at intervals and connected with small wiring to create endless controlled curves along the length of an inflated tube.  To make it through the hole in the wall, control doesn't have to be pinpoint so long as the mouth end seals around the hole.   Air will push the rest of the tube on through (size limited).

"NHLHUT","t5_2yp50","Its not the team its the player. I had 3 accounts in the top 10 one season. (Until round 3 when I let the accounts fall out after a lot of people were upset about it) I don't think I ever finished less than 3rd in a season where I played all four rounds.

I made a team with 600k on PS4. Didn't really play that many games and got top 15 in the one round I ever played there. 

Focus on being the best player you can be. You don't need to replicate what everyone else does. I play with my dman on their proper sides for example which is nonexistent at high level play. I.e. My lefthanded dman plays LD and right handed dman plays RD. You just have to figure out what works for you.

The big difference is notice between the very best players and the good players is their ability to maintain the puck and enter the zone. A lot of guys even in the top 100 or top 250 have poor zone entry skills against a trap. They also give up the puck far too easy. 

It is incredibly difficult to win games when your opponent has 2-5x your TOA.  

Once you master doing those things you really need to just add minor tactics that work for you. I.e. plays that work for you on 2 on 1's which should occur for you every game just about. 

You can literally play just about any settings its all about what works for you.

The other thing that is of utmost importance is to play everyone. Too many guys avoid games against people who they will probably lose too. But it's to their advantage to take a loss and perhaps learn some new techniques or tricks which they can then add to their own skill set. The button skill is not any different from someone in the top 250 to top 10. In fact of the better HUT players I can only think of a couple who have noticeably exceptional button skill. (Logicz and Gren come to mind) The other guys you consistently see at the top like Delta Slays are far from button skill gods.

Everyone should call in and have premium services barred from their phones as soon as they get them.  
I disagree that they should be barred by default though - people should not have to call in because they want to pay for porn/sex chats on their phones. See the UK for reasons why.

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","Friedman was a mathematician that worked in the FDR administration.   He is credited with  the formula for payroll deductions.  During WWII he developed the formula for setting up accurate bombing hits based on bomb weight, speed of the plane and other factors.  There was a group of women who worked during the war that did all the calculations for the bombing raids under his direction.  

He did not personally like working for Keynes. He also had a break down after the war.  Today we would say he suffered from PTSD. He got a job working at Chicago U teaching math. From there he wrote his theories to dispute Keynesian economics. 

Before Kenneth Galbraith died, I watched him on PBS talk about this. Galbraith was also on the same team in FDR administration and his book that he wrote about what went wrong that cause the depression is still in print and used in college courses as required reading.  Today Milton Friedman gets very little attention like he once did in economic courses during his heyday in the 1970's. He fell off his pedestal as economics proved him wrong.  ",1501545690

Depending which protein you choose, you have 10-7% carbs; she's used to probably a lot more from the kibble. 

The frozen raw nuggets are super easy, just get a steel or glass dish that you use only for cat food and put a bunch of frozen nuggets into the fridge. They thaw in 6-7ish hrs, I mix my cat's with a bit of warm water because he hates cold food

The dehydrated nuggets are mixed with warm water and create kind of a paste-like consistency, similar to wet foods. We fed both raw and dehydrated, he seemed to favor beef &amp; turkey

I would start transitioning your cat's food to partial raw nugget/dehydrated nuggets to see how she likes it. It should definitely help with her digestion/bowel movements, but may experience diarrhea (I believe is a symptom of transitioning to raw) when getting used to it

I know that the newer Battlefield 1 can easily take up more than 8GB of RAM on the higher graphical settings. So it's always better to have more but you'll notice it when you need it.

There's literally no discernable difference between DDR3 vs DDR4 in general gaming and daily operation. The ONLY caveat if you are using Ryzen CPU.

AMD's Ryzen CPU's Infinity Fabric clocks itself to the speed of the RAM speed. I think because the memory controller is in the CPU itself. So using faster RAM can boost the performance of the CPU (a different/minor way to boost the performance of the CPU). ",1501545691

&gt; President Donald Trump has been formally urged to declare a federal state of emergency to deal with the opioid epidemic, with Gov. Chris Christie and other members of a White House task force issuing the recommendation in a report released Monday afternoon.

&gt; The report - viewable in full below - also calls for a dramatic shift in the way the federal government responds to the opioid crisis, and advocates for expanded access to rehab and medically-assisted treatments such as Suboxone.

&gt; The report calls for Trump to use either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act to declare a state of emergency and &amp;quot;Use every tool at our disposal to prevent any further American deaths.""

LaVine has $10M cap space. If they can trade RoLo at/before trade deadline, they will have enough cap space to cater two max contracts.


Forget Lebron, I'm eyeing DeMarcus Cousins. That dude fits Hoiball and is just fucking 26 Y.O...


Imagine landing Porter or Bagley(if he is succesful in his reclassification). I don't like Luka Doncic, but he also fit Hoiball.


So any of those rooks, plus LaVine and Cousins is already a good team. If Bulls can't land another FA, there's is plenty of left overs there that could sign a one year rental.


The thing is, this is not going to be a rebuild. This is more of a one to two year stop gap, because of the timing GarPax push the reset button.

Most of what he's saying is baseless; you're right, I do have interest in the occult. I have read much and experimented more, and know what is and is not relatively possible through magick. Nobody has burned their house down with a fire spell. That's utterly ridiculous. One may have increased the chance of an accidental fire by affecting their own subconscious mind, but that's about it. 

It may be true that I have an attached entity. I cannot remove it myself, but am working with another shaman who I recently met. I got that entity because of vulnerability during abuse, not because of Harry Potter or occult involvement. 

Personally, I'm not a fan of Crowley, though I've read quite a bit of his writing and writing about him. Rowling's books have absolutely nothin to do with his philosophies. 

I meant to engage you in discussion about these archetypal stories and why, regardless of the video you linked, the use of these archetypal ideas are bad.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Probably the wage I've already done it for, or a little higher, since I'm highly experienced. Ever wrangled chickens, planted trees, bailed hay, picked (not just berries, it's actually a job, and it's just called ""picking""), milked goats, fenced, or done any other agriculture-related job? I've spent most of my life doing that kind of work, and I would still be doing it if the farms in my area (the entirety of the prairies, to be specific) hadn't been forced to shut down, sell-out, or hire TFW to stay competitive/comply with regulation/meet the green line. It's one of my main skill-sets, after all.

It's hard work, if done well, and usually nets a similar wage to hard construction labor. It can be as low as $12/hr (if you are fencing for a couple of weeks) to as high as $40/hr (if you devote a summer to raising chickens for meat). Unfortunately, those wages are unsustainable when industrial corporate farms can rely on government subsidy and $10/hr (or less, as even wages can be subsidized) TFW, and get bailed out whenever they financially fail (which they do, *all the time*), *plus* receive favouritism from transport contractors, produce retailers, and wholesalers (thanks in no small part to [excessive government regulation](http://www.dairyinfo.gc.ca/index_e.php?s1=dr-rl&amp;s2=canada)). Privately owned, locally marketed, produce-focused business has been under siege from our government for decades, and the TFW program is just one of the ways that happens. Plus, TFW [could until recently](http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/no-more-temporary-foreign-workers-for-businesses-linked-to-sex-trade-immigration-minister/wcm/679c176c-c19f-4a9f-a2a6-7de3d8e111d3) apply to work as strippers (who often end up working as prostitutes), and the TFW program is consistently [abused to facilitate human trafficking](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/labour-exploitation-temporary-foreign-worker-program-1.3879689).",1501545696

Assumptions:
- Bahamut equipped, her own TMR 1x (resulting in 70% EVO MAG boost, aka 1.7 flat multiplier to her ability damage), rest of the equips as described, Tidus' 100% Water Imperil applied

- Rydia would have 983 MAG/837 SPR in base form

- with a 100% buff, she would have 1169 MAG/1023 SPR; her water attack would deal about 8.1 million damage on the training doll before chaining or 32.4 million after hitting the chain cap

- with a 200% buff (1355 MAG/1209 SPR; only practical on 10-man  trials, if anything), her damage would be ~11.2 million before chaining/~44.5 million after chaining cap against a 25 SPR target

Distributed ones are way simpler in terms of complexity, but they are huge in terms of their size on the map and numbers of outposts. My personal distributed 2k spm spreads over 15k tiles and has some 80 outposts.

&gt; President Donald Trump has been formally urged to declare a federal state of emergency to deal with the opioid epidemic, with Gov. Chris Christie and other members of a White House task force issuing the recommendation in a report released Monday afternoon.

&gt; The report - viewable in full below - also calls for a dramatic shift in the way the federal government responds to the opioid crisis, and advocates for expanded access to rehab and medically-assisted treatments such as Suboxone.

&gt; The report calls for Trump to use either the Public Health Service Act or the Stafford Act to declare a state of emergency and &amp;quot;Use every tool at our disposal to prevent any further American deaths.""

"metacanada","t5_2sh5g","It's all around sad because it needs to start early (not that older people can't change, I helped my mom lose some weight when she got lazy simply by giving her recipe ideas) and people need to give a damn, but it doesn't seem like anyone in a position to help gives a shit beyond their own lifespan there. Lot of provinces have this problem honestly, but it's especially bad there. Touting the breakfast program as helpful is fucking hilarious, as garlic did. They serve the poor kids toast and call themselves heroes essentially. It's not any different than a lazy parent, but someone gets paid to pretend they fixed a problem. 

I've spent most of my adult life in the states, and I've done my best to help from a distance and I can tell you for sure that they generally just need guidance and encouragement. Being around healthy people goes a long way for culture, they are surrounded by unhealthy bad habits and people who chalk them all up as discard-able, and then the next generation gets the same stuck up scoffing treatment from outsiders looking in or people in better positions for whatever reason. I refuse to say an entire province should be ignored/disregarded. I think that pervasive idea is why liberals win every fucking time there. Everyone's too good to do anything to help anyone unless it benefits them these days or wins them social points.  

I think it would be cheaper to help them than pay for it. ",1501545700

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","HellYeah. Lets imagine for a moment that the rate of bad things happening has stayed the same for the past 200,000 years or so. 

Lets now imagine that we evolved to live in tribes of 100 (Ive pulled this number out my ass for the sake of a thought experiment) 

Lets imagine these tribes (for the sake of simplicity) only died of natural causes. So they all lived 365 days a year. 

So there is 100 of them and 365 days that they live a year in which something good or bad could happen. 

Thats 36500 opportunities in which something good or bad could've happened.  Lets say that the ratio of good/bad things was 3560/35600 or 1/10

Every year in our tribe roughly 3560 bad things happened and this was the norm that we became accustomed to over about 190,000 years of our 200,000 years of existence. Suddenly humanity starts to develop huge clustered civilisations and one day creates the internet granting us worldwide communication. 

Now instead of being in the communicatory vicinity of roughly 100 we are now in the communicatory vicinity of seven billion. And this has happened so fast. Our calibrations are way off now and not fit to deal with this scale. 

The ratio of bad things happened has actually gotten lower since then but because of the quick and huge boom in population and in communication technology our 'braindars' are no longer useful or accurate to intuitively determine the state of affairs. 

Bad things have become less likely but the opportunities for them to happen has risen exponentially as well as our likelihood to hear about them. 

Something that is very unlikely. Given enough opportunity. Will happen all the time. Which is particularly nonintuitive ",1501545701

I've lost my first 2 weeks since the trade by desperately small margins. For example this past week... I was leading 7-2 going into Sundays games, feeling pretty confident. By 8 PM it was tied 5-5 while I had a 1 SB lead. I thought the matchup was done because every other category had been decided, and he only had Buster Posey left. 

WELL WHAT DO YA KNOW?!? Posey decides to attempt and achieve his FIRST stolen base of the year. In the 9th inning. Of the last game of the week. Giving my opponent the edge in SB and taking the week 5-4. Ive felt numb all of today. 

The Curse of Trout has extended to the rest of my team, and even to the rest of the league. The package I received was KB Votto Sano Wood and Osuna. KB and Votto have been in incredible slumps since I traded for them, Wood looks like a different pitcher, and Osuna has blown two saves since I acquired him.

"MDMA","t5_2qwvg","Responding to: !\dosage

Hi, MDMA-bot here :)

&gt; ### Most important things to know about MDMA dosage
&gt; 
&gt; 1. Guideline: your weight in kg, plus 50 = total dosage in milligrams for the session. (1.5 mg/kg with a 120 mg max may be more optimal, but the weight + 50 is a good rule of thumb)
&gt; 
&gt; 2. If finger dipping powder: ideally switch to weighed doses, but if not that, use ""crush, dab, wait.""
&gt; 
&gt; 3. If using tablets and you haven't taken a tablet from this exact batch before, start with half, or less. 
&gt; 
&gt; 4. Low doses may be particularly important for your first few uses, as you might unknowingly have a health condition like malignant hyperthermia that makes MDMA more dangerous.
&gt; 
&gt; 5. A study found that MDMA desirable effects are maximized, and undesirable effects minimized, at doses between 81-100 mg.^[1]
&gt; 
&gt; 6. If you're unwilling to use these dosage guidelines, please make extra sure your friends are aware of the signs of heat stroke and heat exhaustion, and pay extra attention to keeping cool.
&gt; 
&gt; 7. ""I think there's no ""safe"" dose if you have a preexisting health condition contraindicated with MDMA."" For example, malignant hyperthermia, which you may have but be unaware of.
&gt; 
&gt; 8. A small female died soon after consuming 500 mg of 91% pure MDMA. It is highly probable that they had a health condition that interacted dangerously with MDMA, but this shows why it's important to pay attention to dosage.

1. It is important to remember that not everyone who lives through a dangerous event develops PTSD. PTSD also does not always equal aggression. Many people with it have avoidance symptoms, flashbacks, trouble sleeping, reactivity emotions and/or somatic reactions.  

2. You know one great way to treat PTSD? Talk therapy. Being able to talk through his anxieties, fears and rationale with Jessica have seemed to really benefit Cody. We see him reflecting a lot, showing emotions and learning to be vulnerable the longer he stays in that house. 

3. We don't even know if he has PTSD, but he if he does, going on the show mightily greatly impact his life. He said he was miserable with his life before coming on the show. Perhaps this show will lead to a breakthrough for him, open doors and really allow for him to reflect on his life. People with PTSD deserve grace and hope. 

Finally - Josh doesn't have PTSD that we know of, but he's displayed moments where he has major emotional triggers. So why should someone like Cody not be given an equal chance like Josh? Or even Mark? I'm genuinely curious. ",1501545703

Itemization is something you should learn on yourself by watching others, there are some standard builds which you can find in the game by Torte de lini, other than that watching pro players and how they itemize is interesting. Just because something is different doesn't necesarly mean it won't work ( no matter what reddit or random in your game say ), for example w33ha (pro player) like to go odd builds with invoker, like maelstrom quas wex builds which is really different from the usual but it was pretty effective the way he played. Or you have EternalEnvy going slark with hood for reduced magic damage from his Q.

You'll learn eventually all items and what they do by playing so don't get discouraged if you don't know how to itemize or what some items do.

And play what you want, don't let others tell you what you should pick unless they're being reasonable.

I didn't mean anything overall negative, as public transit is a major problem. But the styling of ""waiting in rain"" and ""so hot I'm sweating"" just reek of someone who doesn't *have* to do such things. 

I'm in a different city and rely on bike more than anything else. When I do use public transportation wifi is not my concern. GPS is interesting, as where I live there really isn't a time to wait for the bus (I once waited 2 hours for one bus), and I actually don't have a smart phone... I'd prefer more buses than gps and wifi. 

As a result, there is a bit of a contradiction going on: I do think ""poor people"" don't need those elements, but to get middle class people to use public transit will inherently give the necessary changes. 

So, I can't say I disagree with his complaints, or even his strategy for bettering a metro, but it did seem heavily condescending and exclusive.  But, this is surely a class exclusive paper, as far as I can guess.

"mastcelldisease","t5_3547e","I would recommend it. You'll have to be stricter initially and maybe for years but then you should be able to have more stuff. Allergy specialist might not be much help with the MCAS either. But hopefully they will. 

I recommend this author and this book is quite useful, if somewhat old. I accidentally stumbled on the histamine intolerance diet in this book - because I was basically already on the diet, just needed to eliminate tomatoes and vinegar. (Which is a nightmare initially but you'll feel better.)
[Dealing with Food Allergies: A Practical Guide to Detecting Culprit Foods and Eating a Healthy, Enjoyable Diet](https://smile.amazon.com/Dealing-Food-Allergies-Practical-Detecting-ebook/dp/B004EHZQUE/ref=sr_1_2?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501545021&amp;sr=1-2) There's a newer version ""packaged"" as a text book for nutritionists. I just bought it used but it's more expensive. 

You're going to need to figure out what your body agrees with. Histamine is a bucket to fill. You don't want to overflow the bucket. I'd start by dropping alcohol, tomato, food with preservatives, 90% soda, and vinegar. 

You also want to learn about the age of food and how histamine develops as food gets older. You probably don't want to eat cooked food that's older than 2-3 days, assuming it was stored properly. You might not want to go over 48 hours. (Some people will eat leftovers a month later and then don't understand when they get sick. Hopefully this doesn't describe you.)

Be careful of all the websites and recipes and, well, shit, out there. There's so much more now than a few years ago. When you Google histamine intolerance now there's even more to wade through. Joneja has a website and other books. She's a fantastic source. 

A [more in depth book about MCAS by Afrin](https://smile.amazon.com/Never-Bet-Against-Occam-Activation-ebook/dp/B01CZUBNL2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1501545413&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=afrin+mcas) came out last year.

[THIS](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490952) is a fantastic academic journal article about histamine. I've seen it cited multiple times. It has a few tables/graphs that are super interesting.

Remember, your first and best sources are doctors and people with licenses. People who are sharing their experiences are great too but they might be very wrong and who knows how your body is different from theirs. You have to learn to understand what your body says is good or bad and some days that varies. 

oh! almost forget. You might want to avoid NSAIDs if you don't already. Depends, on you, of course.

"teslamotors","t5_2s3j5","If used Tesla's keep people from buying new EVs from Audi, Volvo, etc., it will be because you can buy a used Model 3 for less than the cost of leasing a new Audi/Volvo/whatever.

If the average Tesla costs $45k, and it has a 60% residual after 2 years, it's going to be worth $27k in 2 years. That's a $500 a month car payment, assuming a five year term and good credit (and no money down).

You can lease a brand new BMW, Audi, or Mercedes for $500 all day long, and tax credits can offset whatever cost premium there is for whatever EVs they offer in 2020 or 2021 (when 2 year old Model 3s are being sold).

Now, you can massage all of these numbers - you can lower the buy payment for the used Model 3 by extending the term, and you can crank up the lease variables on the new BMW/Audi/Mercedes-Benz - but the math is the math.

If a consumer can choose between leasing a new car ***or*** buying a used car for the same $500/month, a good chunk will lease.

If used Tesla Model 3s hamper sales of new EVs from Audi, BMW, etc., it will be because their residuals are terribly, terribly low. That will only happen if Tesla makes 500k cars really quickly (which seems unlikely) or they have some horrible scandal that ruins the value of the brand.

Either way, I don't think anyone buying a Tesla should hope that used Model 3s compete for buyers with new EVs.",1501545710

"EliteLavigny","t5_38hqh","If the Forsaken Hunters are the Bhutas Hunters, there's something you should be aware of should your region of space ever become controlled or exploited by ALD. The Emperor's control ethos uses 'combat' to maintain control of exploited systems, and that makes dictatorships extremely difficult to maintain control over, due to increased fortification triggers.

If you'll notice in Heilelang, The Imperial Inquisition's prevalence in the region means that system requires three times as many tonnes of garrison supplies as Ovini, despite them being the same distance from Kamadhenu.

If your intention as you grow is to establish a presence for Emperor Arissa Lavigny-Duval, using a Dictatorship government will severely damage any chance of the Power ever expanding or maintaining a presence in the region.

Thank you for your efforts in support of the Power and I wish you success as you complete your goals.

They've already shown time and again that they're willing to go *very* far to enforce female security, regardless of the cost this would bestow on men. In fact, chipping men to make rape and sexual assault impossible would actually be one of the more harmless things they've done. Because I definitely am not sure what's worse - not being able to commit rape in the first place because I'll be caught in no time (which doesn't affect me since I don't intend to rape anyone), or any woman who has put her mind on it being able to disable due process by claiming rape (which potentially *would* affect me, regardless of my own decisions).

You'll also be able to learn some hard counters against any particular hero.

A friend of mine recommended that the best way to start learning the game is to be a hard support. Don't be against first-picking and solo supporting in pubs. Your job will involve warding, harassing the enemy and not contesting for last hit with your carry. It'll be a tough experience, but you'll learn a lot about map awareness and plenty of little tricks to stay alive longer.

Even with your situation with your mom about stopping supporting your relatives, it's easier said than done. When you finally in that position, you'll understand where your mom is coming from. The least your cousins and others do is don't complain if she can only give a small padala or the content of the balikbayan box is not that worthwhile. Because trust me, it is out of good will from her. And the money she sends, hopefully it's really going to the intended purposes. You'll get it once you get here, i'm hoping it happens soon for you. 

My suggestion for you is that just keep working hard. Just don't do anything that will jeopardize your filing status as that will crush your mom if anything happens to it. Because i'm sure your mom thinks about it regularly. If you can find a job, any job really, to support yourself, take it. Even if it pays just for your meal that day do it. Your mom will keep sending you money even if you insist not to. You don't have to spend it, just put it on your savings. So once you get it, you have enough saving to hopefully last you couple months of food while you adjust and get your career started. Because once you get here, im 100% positive your mom's attitude towards you having time to lay on the couch will change almost instantly after she takes you on vacations here. 

As far as retirement, yes it is nice to see your mom saving for in the future. But here, 52 years old? Thats nothing. She has at least good 15 years on her career before retiring. Unless she really cant anymore, she'd wait till 67 before she files for retirement to get the full benefits on her social security. Even then, she may work past that unless of course you can support her with her well deserved annual Philippines vacation :) 

As for now, since I don't know your field of work, if there's affordable certifications whatever it may be that can help you a job here, whatever field, take it. Job market here can be very competitive here too. Anyway to get experience or make your resume attractive is certainly a plus. 

As for the OP's situation, there are a lot of variables into it. Her mom have been going back and forth for 20 decades, I don't know what it is case to be exact, but you'd think that she woild have brought her here if everything is fine and dandy.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Im not who you asked, but I'll give somewhat of an answer:

It's totally dependent on signal levels. If the signal is too low, 150 ft can be a real issue. My guess is that there isn't an RF amplifier near enough to provide the signal strength necessary. It may be that the nearest tap is 150 ft down the easement. That may not even include footage to the house from the pole, then to the equipment in the house. After splitting to multiple devices (modem, TVs, cable boxes, etc.) The signal level is going to be even lower. And totally unreliable.

A few years ago, *at cost*, it was roughly $35,000 per mile for infrastructure. This did include some fiber and hard line to cover the distance, but most of it was for amps/line extenders/power supplies/etc that would be needed directly before OP's house. Even if the cable company only had to pay half of half of that, it would very much be a loss. Return on investment would tank. If OP paid $200 a month in bills, only maybe half of that would go to the service provider (the rest going to broadcaster fees.) So if OP were to pay $8000 up front for their half, the cable company would have to pay $8000. It would take roughly 7 years of $100 a month for them to break even and begin profitting. The ROI is not viable.

Since signal levels are probably currently too low for OP to get a decent connection, it would be trouble call after trouble call; technicians on site constantly trying to repair the connection and create something reliable that could never happen. On average, to have a cable technician dispatched to a location, it costs a cable company roughly $115 an hour. 10 trips? $1150. If the cable company agrees to provide service, they would then ideally have to fulfill their responsibility of making it work. Its not worth the hassle or fiscal loss.

Don't get me wrong, I don't mean to justify the shitty reality of cable and internet providers in today's world. I'm all for net neutrality and believe that internet is a required utility more than it is a recreational privilege. But there is a much bigger financial picture than most people realize.

Everything highlighted in light blue is extrapolated/educated guess at what would perform in those scenario (due to lack of data available). But the scaling seems pretty straightforward, 4k:1440p is almost 100% across the board identical scaling (and that was the bulk of the data I had available).

Now this IS only for doom atm, but see how the rx vega has a simulated 73fps whereas the vega fe has 64.2? That 73 number was definitely the average we saw from all of the marketing way earlier on and is definitely higher than the fe. Maybe just more mature drivers when amd released their 1440 ultrawide, maybe I just skewed the data, idk I'm tired, but this is about as good as I could figure with simple if stupid math.",1501545713

That could happen. If states of both types compete equally and openly than Republicans slashing taxes would hurt their own people but attract more business who could just locate there but sell to rich liberal states, as is the case with companies producing goods in 3rd world countries today. It would probably lead to democrat states having to establish barriers between them and red states which would likely lead to the end of the USA.

On a side note I do blame Murray for guys like Cornel and Lemuiex and Karabacek being bad picks. ",1501545716

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","The Niskoran Order is a faction of humans that is against the use of magic. See, humans first came to be and developed on Mundivik, a continent to the northeast of Aurora (the main content of my world). However, they had no knowledge that magic even existed (the gods specifically designed them to be this way). They were amazed by magic when they made landfall on Aurora and met the elves.

However, probably about 50-60 years after they made landfall, human children and teenagers began experiencing bouts of magic (random flames, icicles, etc). They met with the elves who at first were reluctant to teach a race who had no knowledge of magic less than a century ago, magic itself. But they agreed with the exception that humans not learn divine magic.

Anyways, the Niskoran order was formed around that same time. Their belief is that humans were better off not wielding magic, and that these events are a result of the elves playing a ""long game"" and tricking the humans. Because of this, they are extremely anti-magic as well as xenophobic. They seem to almost be religious and zealous, referring to their original founder as almost a sort of saint.",1501545717

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","I've considered testing, but the only confirmed haunted place I have been to and sort of tried it was Gettysburg while I was hiking there with my Boy Scout troop.  Midway through the hike, I remembered my flashes and tried doing it, but at the time I was really dehydrated and the sun was bloody bright that day (~80 and high humidity) so I could barely see anything that was right in front of me, in regards to my physical eyes.  I didn't really trust anything that I saw in my flashes mostly due to the severe headache I had at the time due to dehydration and the bright sun possibly mixing with my flashes and distorting what I actually saw, potentially creating false positives.  However, I could see the purple particles (I've heard that they might be called ""The Fog"" but I'm not a hundred percent sure it is the same thing I'm seeing) a lot better, albeit they just increased my headache more, probably.

I haven't been able to determine a meaning for why they move in channels around certain objects, so far, but I have noticed that they like to move amongst consecutive colors and they seem to mostly stick to the one specific object they are on, or maybe it is just the contrast between the object and the objects around it that make it noticeable that the particles are vibrating and moving on the object.  I'm just not entirely sure.  From some research and talking to some other people, it seems like I might be seeing the frequencies of objects and people when I look at the particles, however I haven't seen anything consistent with them so far.  Will try some experimentation with that and will try keeping you posted.

Depending on the type of barrier, I can see the person's particles.  I will say, however, that it can be hard at times to determine depth with them because I sometimes can see through some objects to look at particles and other times not be able to see the particles on the outside (like glass, for example, can be hard at times to determine if I'm looking through it or at it).  When it comes to screen doors, the particles usually like to travel along or vibrate on the actual wire of the screen, making it pretty much impossible for me to see particles on the outside without getting confused where each of the particles are coming from.  I've also found that the particles aren't just limited to barriers like screen doors and glass, but also the lens parts of my eyes.  I discovered this when I would be going to sleep and would see if I could see objects or walls via the particles, but instead I would usually be met with just a wall of the particles that I couldn't see past.  At times I can kind of see the depth difference between particles, so when I would be doing this in the dark, I could kind of see that some particles were farther away than others, but I wasn't able to make out any shapes.  I figured that the closer particles (as in the REALLY close ones) were the ones that made up parts of my lenses, while the farther away ones were just particles making up the air and parts of my ceiling.

Oh yeah, just to let you know what I did end up seeing at Gettysburg, even though I don't trust them entirely because the sun really did screw with them a bit, but I'm not entirely to what the extent is.  I saw some transparent, colorful, mini-fogs in parts of the places where the battles took place, but only a couple and the bright sun left the equivalent of a giant lens flare on each of the flashes.  The mini-fogs were the color of the rainbow-esque circle you can see in the sky in the morning, which I believe is Venus.  I can't remember exactly, it has been a while since I've seen it.

I'll let you know if I discover anything new!",1501545717

The way my teammate tells the story, it was more of a ""so would you want to row here?"" ""Oh yeah I'd love to!"" type of conversation, rather than an ""I hereby solemnly swear to row here"" one.

The first school was heckin mad, so maybe the situation was more serious than she let on, but my teammate was just like ""eh, I'm just a kid, how was I supposed to know it was that serious of a thing?"" and the first coach went sulking away.

It was hard for me to tell if she actually knew what she was doing or was genuinely oblivious and just got caught in the middle of a high-pressure situation. 

Either way, I don't think it's cool for the coach to pressure your athlete like that, and I wouldn't feel guilty at all about advising her to say what it takes to stay in the coach's good graces while she figures out what she wants to do. Nothing is official until you sign a paper...

I know this comment might make me seem like a tool, but there are a lot of coaches out there who take advantage of young athletes' naive/optimistic outlook.

Well, I once worked in a building where, unbeknownst to me, my bouncing was causing the entire second floor to vibrate.  It too weeks for people to figure out it was from me.  Neither I nor they had any idea. I couldn't feel the vibration naturally as it perfectly matched my rhythm so when people asked me if I felt the vibration, I said no.

Was the strangest thing.  Eventually the solution was to move me to right next to a support column where my bouncing got damped out.",1501545719

These aren't the shit-talkers, steroid freaks, gun nuts or loudmouth political protester windbags. I'm talking real-deal, all walks of life working in varied professions; officers, detectives, agents, EMTs, firefighters, operators, analysts, you name it! Didn't matter if they were men or women, big or small, race, age, whatever. I could always pick the real ones out from the wannabes. Resoundingly common traits and identifiers! Always calm, composed, passively vigilant-- situationally aware, acute and tuned.

The most authentically skilled, knowledgeable, scariest, and intimidating people I've met have said as little as ""hello"" to in passing, wore stuff likes business suits or just simply windbreakers and blue jeans. Let their actions, not their outfit, do the rest of the talking for them. The very last thing they'd ever want is to draw undue notice to themselves. Anonymity is valued at a premium for a real warrior.

Real badasses don't have to do that whole Hollywood grizzled action hero costumed routine.
 
That person in the picture, he doesn't want fear, or admiration; he wants attention. Not at all unlike a very dramatic little teenage girl. ""Please look at me, please notice me.""

"Smite","t5_2stl8","passive: good for laning phase, makes very little difference late game from what i have seen. i imagine it would be better at higher levels.
abduct: beads burner, vast majority of guardians have this. differnce is khepris is on his escape so if he uses it and doesnt get a kill he is dead and its only single target  khepri can only get one at a big risk to himself, which is pitiful.
rising dawn: yes, it clears lane. khepri will almost always win lane. if solo laner is diving, which is where they need the dmg reduction, he will either be out of range or far enough away to have taken a large amount of damage before your 2 gets there, especially because khepri is a backliner not a frontliner or diver.
solar flare: i think its better than his one. can cc more people and doesnt put you in nearly as much danger.
scarabs blessing: regardless, it can be used twice in a fight for the most part. if your assasin wants to dive they can, but then a smart enemy team will just follow you when u get ulted, as most assasins wont run until the ult has almost ended. it can be used as a bait but then you dont have it availabe to save any of your other teammates, yes it gives movement speed for chasing but then once again its not ready for saving a life which is far more valuable, and if you build him full cd oyu have no tankyness so will have to waste your ult on yourself.
im gonna compare him to geb as they are by far the most defensive supports in the game afaik, i havent played much of terra or ganache tho.
GEB
his escape has better setup potential, a slow and more mobility, with the advantage that if u miss you dont die
his 2 will setup more then khepris 1 and three combined, and cant be beads, so offers more peel despite the fact that the duration is less.
his three can do a better job than a khepri 2 as its instant and gives more effective helath, and can do a slightly worse job then khepris ult just 3 times more often.
his ult is extremely good setup, and does 35% of their health and will either burn their beads or kill them.
and his passive will give extra tankiness late game if the meta is crit giving geb more time to apply shields.
so to me it looks like khepri wins lane because of his 2 and passive. geb wins poke wars because he shields all the poke. safeness(?) because his only engage isnt anywhere near as risky as khepris. more mobility cause his one goes further. better defensive capabilites as he can shield knockup more than one and slow and has the ult to deal a large chunk of the warriors hp. better offensive capabilities as he has more cc. and he helps the team better when some1 dives as he doesnt have to pay constant attention to them, he can just stick his shield on them. khepris have to time the ult which means half of their concentration wont be on their carry, and neither will the free revive if the diver isnt ahead. lmk if i missed anything

"Alienware","t5_2r5rg","The problem for the R1 above all else is a part called the ""power board"" which is a small mobo-like board sitting next to the mobo... It seems to be responsible for managing the power when going from the PSU to the mobo.

Unfortunately for you, the R1 powerboard isn't capable to running much and in turn needs to be replaced before running anything like a 1070 or 1080 (same thing applied a year ago when people with the R1 wanted to upgrade to the 970). 

I'd suggest looking into a X51 r2 powerboard. If you can find one of those a 1070 should work without too much trouble since it's TDP is typically around 150 which happens to be within the limits of the x51 r2/r3.

A 1080 is going to be very difficult to install without doing custom clocking to lower the power draw.

It could be possible as there are people out there who (allegedly) managed a stable 980 and others, a 1080 by undervolting the gpu. 

It's a tough situation you are in especially since the rest of the pc probably runs just fine but isn't powerful enough to warrant a transfer/rebuild with another case and psu. 

I'd say take a good long look at youtube as you aren't the first to be interested in this sort of upgrade.

Hunger is all about what you're used to and how much your stomach has stretched out.  I was eating 2500+ calories a day, for example, so even just a weight-maintenance goal of 1800 calories felt like I was starving myself.  There just wasn't enough physical food in my stomach to make me feel full, because my stomach had expanded to accommodate my giant eating habits.

Reducing hunger while losing weight, unfortunately,  is just a time-thing that you need to suffer through as your stomach shrinks.   Now I'm at a point where I can eat 1450 calories a day and be satisfied, just because I've been not eating crazy amounts on a daily basis.",1501545726

You can recover deleted files from a HDD/SDD ***IF*** you don't write any data to the drive, essentially ""deleting"" the files means that the files are still there *until* you write new files onto the drive and then that 'deleted' data is overwritten.

So to recover those (files if they're not overwritten), disconnect that drive from whatever it's plugged into so nothing gets written to it.

 Google or find the subreddit which will tell you what data recovery software is available and how to use it, then follow whatever steps necessary to connect the drive to the computer **without allowing data to be written to it.**

 Remember each byte of written data on that drive is over-writing your ""deleted"" data (i.e ""free space"").

 Anything other than ""free space"" is unrecoverable data unless you take it to someone who specialises and has some other special technique for getting it back which I haven't heard of.",1501545729

"MDMA","t5_2qwvg","Responding to: !\frequency

Hi, MDMA-bot here :)

&gt; ### Am I doing damage by rolling too often? What damage? Is the 3 month rule real? How often should I wait?
&gt; 
&gt; &gt; Ann Shulgin: ""I quit with no problem, but ten years later I tried it again, and instead of that wonderful feeling of connection with everything, it made me depressed. The exact opposite of what it should be. I tried it once more and the same thing happened, so I stopped. Now I advise people-especially college students who discover MDMA and think it's the greatest thing ever-to not use it more than four times a year.""^1
&gt; 
&gt; **Using MDMA too often may result in a permanent inability to feel the positive MDMA effects**
&gt; 
&gt; Anecdotal reports suggest that rolling more often can lead to a loss of the ""magic"" - where much of the positive effects are lost. There are also good reasons to wait between rolls: see [this post] by MDMA researcher Matthew Baggott.
&gt; 
&gt; Two people I talked with who lost the ""magic"" found that after losing the magic, even waiting ~10 years was only enough to get them one more decent roll before MDMA returned to ""magic-less"" again.
&gt; 
&gt; **Using MDMA too often may prevent you from benefiting in the future when MDMA is legally available and used in therapy**
&gt; 
&gt; As MDMA researcher Matthew Baggot wrote, ""In ten years from now, MDMA may be legally available and used in therapy. **You don't want to be unable to save your marriage or fail to come to terms with trauma because you rolled too much in your youth and now can't feel MDMA.""**
&gt; 
&gt; **How long do I need to wait between MDMA sessions?**
&gt; 
&gt; Perhaps 3 - 5 weeks if you're using less than or equal to 120 mg and no more than 3 total sessions. Three months is an anecdotally based rule of thumb that is likely wise to follow if you're planning on using MDMA more than 3 times in your life.
&gt; 
&gt; There isn't really any high-quality research to tell us what we should do. [This paper] and [this paper] show brain changes that lasted ~3 weeks after use, but we don't know if those changes are relevant to calculating appropriate MDMA usage frequency.
&gt; 
&gt; The medical research group MAPS uses two or three MDMA doses, spaced [3 - 5 weeks apart.] A minimum break is then perhaps 3-5 weeks if you're taking less than or equal to 120 mg and with no more than 3 sessions - it may be wise to increase the delay if you plan on more than 3 sessions in your life, but we don't really know.
&gt; 
&gt; **Origin of the 3 month rule**
&gt; 
&gt; MDMA users may have heard people mentioning a ""3 month rule"". This is a good anecdotal report based rule of thumb.
&gt; 
&gt; The origin of the three month rule is a quote from Ann Shulgin, widow of chemist Alexander Shulgin: ""Now I would advise anyone who wants to use MDMA not to take it more than 4 times a year if you want to continue to get the best effects from it, otherwise you risk losing its effects entirely and permanently.""
&gt; 
&gt; **Avoid increasing dosage to make up for weaker effects if you're determined to use MDMA without waiting**
&gt; 
&gt; Anecdotally, people who take MDMA frequently seem to take high dosages. Don't do this, as evidence suggests this increases the risk of neurotoxicity and the risk of serious negative effects, and anecdotal reports suggest that this increases the risk of negative after-effects.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Shadowverse","t5_3c35m","Evaluating cards in a vacuum is not the right way to evaluate if a card is too strong in the current meta. First off, 70% of the time evolved followers traded into something and are left with a small amount of hp. Using up 4 valuable shadows to kill a half dead card does not seem to be too strong to consider a rework.

Now one might argue that killing a pre-evolved follower is extremely strong, which it is. But pre-evolving a follower is less useful against shadow than it is against other factions. Shadow tends to run many weak followers with strong effects and not big followers that likely evolve over it if it wasn't pre-evolved.
Also since you know they likely run 3x soulsquasher, if you haven't seen any squashers being played you won't pre-evolve due to the risk of squasher being too high of a tempo play.
What is the cost of having a strong tempo play in the form of squasher? Well, you might want to hold on to squasher if your hand is of low value. This puts less pressure on your enemy and his evolve points, thus making it less likely for you to be able to use soulsquashers effect.

Now even if soulsquasher were a very overpowered card, one has to naturally ask if it is healthy or unhealthy for the game. For my point of view, healthy is any card that makes you and your enemy think strategically, as it increases player interactions and rewards thinking.

Another important point is to ask if soulsquasher singlehandedly opresses all non top-tier decks. Lastly, doesn't every craft have some sort of strong point as in class defining cards or effects? When we're at it, why not nerf Albert? Because sword is not doing so well one might say.

Your whole post disregards any class mechanics because you ask why *shadow*craft can make use of shadows. Why do dragon cards gain bonus effects upon reaching 7 crystals? Why does haven have so many follower-summoning amulets? It is inherent to what they *are* as a class.

On a last note, If people started to play 3x soulsquasher in every deck and started winning many games, don't you think you will have to adapt your deck and your play style in order to counter what they are doing? Let's say a highly board centric midrange deck makes it's way to the top. Don't you think including board clears might help in combatting it? The whole process of playing leads to slowly progressing to better and better defined iteration of decks. Soulsquasher as a strong force might punish some types of decks and rewards others, slowly balancing out the other deck types.
It is analog to a chemical system that tries to find an equilibrium. Heck it is similar to deck types praying on each other and trying not to get eaten too often by their counters. OTK decks prey on control and slower midrange, control preys on aggro decks, aggro decks prey on bricking and on OTK decks etc... 

You can't evaluate a card in a vacuum because it will never be played in a vacuum. Greetings.",1501545732

Howard in the past fondled Gay Ramone during the gay dance party with the Goo Goo Dolls.  He kissed Howie on AGT (he has kissed other guys on the air throughout his career).  He dry humped Nick Cannon on a couch on AGT.  He did a lot of acts that could be considered gay.

Two, not contradicting myself at all.  A check list is saying, to be gay you have do this, this, and this.  And then me giving examples of each of those points.  I am just giving you examples where he shows homosexual tendencies, but I am not matching them to specific traits of homosexual tendencies.  You need to learn what a check list is.

Third, of course it is debatable.   He does get paid to entertain people , but not everything he does actually entertains people.  I am sure if his audience is remotely close to what it was 10 or 20 years ago, they do not like the cock talk.

"Spanishhelp","t5_2sjzy","Hola, el idioma que estoy hablando es español latinoamericano. Es muy similar al español hablado en España, pero hay algunas diferencias en la pronunciación y en el vocabulario.
La razón por la que son diferentes es debido a la evolución de la lengua hablada por los colonos españoles durante la época colonial. Como los conquistadores tomaron más tierras para el imperio español, se encontraron con cosas que no había palabras para describirlas con el español de España por lo que las inventaron por con su cuenta o tomaron las palabras de los nativos, tales como las palabras Llama y Coco. 
Las diferencias entre el español europeo y americano aumentaron debido al tiempo en que las dos comunidades se alejaron la una de la otra y a causa de la evolución natural del lenguaje.

He aquí un breve relato de un evento famoso que ocurrió durante los movimientos de independencia en América del Sur, el cruce de los Andes por José de San Martín. San Martín y su ejército de argentinos y chilenos planeaban derrotar a los monárquicos españoles en Chile con un ataque sorpresa. Su ""Ejército de los Andes"" consistía en unos 4000 hombres, 10 000 mulas y 1000 caballos. San Martín sabía que no podía enfrentarse a los españoles directamente, ni podía arriesgarse a tenerlos informados de su plan. Así que para reducir el riesgo de que fueran vistos por los observadores y para ocultar el número real de soldados, dividió sus tropas en dos grupos grandes y 6 pequeños. Por desgracia, después de 21 días de marcha, un tercio de sus hombres había muerto y había perdido más de la mitad de sus mulas y caballos. Sin embargo, San Martín y sus hombres eran todavía capaces de lograr una gran victoria contra los monárquicos en la batalla de Chacabuco con la ayuda del líder del grupo guerrillero Manuel Rodríguez. Fue sólo un año más tarde cuando el 18 de febrero de 1818 se firmó la declaración de independencia de Chile.

When I saw the therapist, he asked super general questions about when I started HRT and even asked if I currently went to Callen Lorde.

Nowadays when a new update arrives, i just try to play as much as possible of it. (buy stuff, try out all the missions,ect.).

In the past with I/E, i did every source mission, saw every car that the update offered, tried the new vip missions, ect. after like 100 sells i knew everything how to approach every mission, avoid npc's,  ect. and it was very repetitive and boring at that point. With the money earned i could afford just a few nice benny cars and an office garage. 

After that i simply kept jumping sessions for 30 minutes or so sometimes. There is always that modder that teleports everyone to the mountain or airport and spawns money and stuff. After some time i got ~12 million or so.

Finally i could buy the real fun stuff, enjoy the game and screw around with my friends instead of spending hundreds of hours of boring mindless grind which makes you insane.

With the current update im gonna do the same sooner or later. Of course i will try to enjoy everything the update has to offer (without cheating) before hunting for money modders.

Are you trying to say that nvidia has record high margins yet they ONLY increased costs in-line or proportional to 40nm to 16nm per mm costs? 

Because at that time nvidia had something like 38% gross corporate margins now they are near 50%. How? The answer to that is they charge more compared to their costs than they used to. 

I'm not saying GP104 (1080) should have been $249. But I AM saying $699 at release and even $599 for the regular versions was severely gouging the customer.

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","Whenever you create a tournament and nobody else joins, you get your gems back. This is for preventing people having 'lonely birthday' cases where they create a tournament but none of their friends join

To make the tournament locked just give it a password and don't tell it to anyone. This will make sure that you are the only one in the tournament so you get your gems back allright?

Now we take advantage of this by using the tournament purely as a 'billboard' that people are going to see when they search for other tournaments by giving it a name that many people search for (like ""Clash Royale Tournament"" as I suggested). Thousands of people are going to see your tournament this way. Now you just gotta put your clan name in the description of the tournament with some arguments to join and this will lead to people joining your clan.

The great thing is that you can make this thing run for practically 24/7 with only 10 minutes a day of work, even better (though I personally don't do this) is make your WHOLE CLAN create these billboard tournaments but all for different keywords (you gotta estimate what keywords other than 'clash royale tournament' are searched for very often in the tournament search bar tho, I think your best bet is by simply adding country names like USA in the name because those country-only tournaments are very common, or you could name them after famous CR YouTubers)

2) Rather than strictly ""better"", I'd say that Disney's canon is, thus far, more *controlled* and is likely to remain so. TBH I think the best of the new canon is miles ahead of the best of Legends, and even the ""worst"" of the new canon (IMO) is on par with the middle range of Legends stuff. Nothing so far written in canon plumbs the depths of *Darksaber* or *The Crystal Star*, and that probably won't happen.

3) They could be different. So far the only major Legends character to really appear is Thrawn, and he's basically the same character (with different events surrounding him).

"seduction","t5_2qhrv","Analysing my childhood and my teenage years, I would say I had/have 2 major problems:

 • Overprotective mother/kinda absent father, that built me into a weak, unconfident ""nice guy"" that doesn't know how to deal with women or socializing in general

 • Somewhat of a delayed physical development, that made me feel even less masculine, confident and brave (basically, it's like my body was (is) always 2-3 years younger than I actually was, so I was always the tiny, weak, small dude that couldn't fight or be competitive at sports)

This + my naturally introverted behavior + smaller problems (like bad teeth and acne) = 0 socialization, -3 interaction with girls and -193718 sexual opportunities

The label kinda bothers me, but it isn't the main problem (even cause I'm not pretending to tell a lot of people that I'm going to an escort). It's just the lack of confidence, experience, the unfamiliarity I have with intimacy and physical contact with a girl, and the pure retained sexual drive.

I'm working hard in the last weeks to improve myself. Studying game, dieting and working out hard, NoFap, trying to build more confidence and all that stuff, but this lack of sex and feminine companionship is driving me fucking crazy and I can't see me changing that naturally so soon",1501545741

On the same note, why ""stainless"" and not ""steel""? Steel is a lot closer in length to the other words, thereby making it a more cohesive set. It would also be a closer match because it's the material noun, rather than an adjective.",1501545742

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","&gt;  The fiber needs a little fat to bind it together so it isn't digested too quickly.

The whole point of fibre is that it is not digested by us at all - it just passes through the stomach and small intestine and acts as food for the gut bacteria. Fibre does not need to be bound by anything. If you feel hungry soon after your meals, I would recommend including grains and starchy veg as they are more filling and also help firm up the stool. For reference, I'm on the whole-food plant-based diet. On average, I get 80g fibre and 30g of fat (no added oil - just from wholefoods). Also, make sure you chew your food properly and take your time eating. ",1501545744

Trump was not too disorganized to [ask Russia to hack Hillary's e-mails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnY7D4M4k68).

Trump's campaign was not too disorganized [discuss sanctions with Russia as Obama was adding additional sanctions for election hacking](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/national-security-adviser-flynn-discussed-sanctions-with-russian-ambassador-despite-denials-officials-say/2017/02/09/f85b29d6-ee11-11e6-b4ff-ac2cf509efe5_story.html?utm_term=.256d0f368ae7).

Trump administration was not too disorganized to [distance the US from their NATO allies](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/29/allies-distance-themselves-after-trumps-first-foreign-trip/102292048/), which benefits Russia more than the US, [and meet twice \(once without any other US officials present\) with Putin at the G20.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40651502)

Trump was not too disorganized to u[se the same messages as Russia during his campaign.](http://www.npr.org/2017/07/17/537323120/timeline-of-trump-and-russia-in-mid-2016-a-series-of-coincidences-or-something-m)  These messages are straight out of Russia's hybrid-warfare playbook.

Trump was not too disorganized to reject any notion of discouraging Russian hacking.  In fact, he did the opposite.
&gt;""Why should I tell Putin what to do?"" Trump said, before turning to a talking point used by both Trump's campaign and Russian media outlets. ""Let me tell you, it's not even about Russia or China or whoever it is that's doing the hacking. It's about what was said in those emails. Those were terrible things.""

&gt;Rather than condemn the hacking, at his press conference Trump seemingly encouraged Russia to keep going.

&gt;""Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,"" Trump said, referring to Clinton's deleted personal emails. ""I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's see if that happens. That will be next.""

These are not a series of coincidences.  For a man who seems to act randomly in most matters, he is extremely consistent in his stance toward Putin and Russia, and coincidentally ran a campaign that, even if unsuccessful, would do as much damage to US institutions as possible.",1501545744

Short of there actually being a god of the universe who comes out and says, ""fuck y'all"", you can't really outdo it. The other part of that is how ultimately there are tons of things where the trilogy fell short. ME1 had incredibly unrefined combat and exploration, but had amazing roleplaying elements such as your character stats and abilities. It also had the superbly written plot. ME2 when compared to the rest of the plot was completely unnecessary, but had written and introduced tons of fully fleshed out and captivating characters. On top of that, the game had an stellar final mission that made your heart pound and demanded you think your decisions through. ME3 had easily the best combat in the game, with arguably the best stat system. However, it took way too much dialogue out of the hands of the player, made paragon/renegade choices way too extreme without offering any neutral dialogue decisions, and good fucking god the ENDING. Mass Effect is a diamond with rough edges. I would absolutely love to see Bioware buff those edges out and give us truly refined trilogy. I think there is more than enough to justify giving Bioware a mulligan and doing the whole thing over. I normally hate revamps, reboots, spin-offs, etc, but if there is truly any franchise that deserves it its Mass Effect.",1501545745

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.

Interview and people skill tactics: do you have a pet? They not only help emotionally, but you can practice speaking aloud to better adapt to public speaking. No joke. Seems moronic, but practice helps when no one is around. 

I was super shy and had to fly to Indiana to deliver my first osha training. I developed the PowerPoint content, then practiced reading the slide notes aloud to the cats for timing and that awkward: getting used to hearing my own voice and being stared at:) Force yourself to do it 10-20 times to familiarize the art of the rehearsal, knowing it's going to suck, but it's just something you do once and could have big rewards.

As for interviewing: You don't have to overly make eye contact when discussing your knowledge, it can be distracting and scary. Walk in and easily smile and make eye contact. Shake hands and be cordial. Then answer and ask questions. Focus on content over nerve wracking concerns. Chances are your interviewer is or was also once nervous.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Funny because that was literally the first issue I had with 'taxation is theft' too! Theft as an idea doesn't exist without a state to both define what theft is and to also enforce property rights. States are sovereign, logically. So you're actually being allowed to keep stuff rather than having stuff being stolen from you. The counter to that is usually 'theft is theft even if i can't prevent you from stealing my stuff.' 

My current dismissal of 'taxation is theft' requires you to first [dichotomize what each form of taxation is](https://youtu.be/Aaq2UXW0krA?t=8m45s). Once you do this you realize that '*not* paying for using natural resources is also theft.' So if I pump in all the air from the atmosphere and store it in my tanks I am stealing this natural resource from everyone else. All without ever stepping foot onto 'your' Land! But taxing anything other than the use of natural resources can be considered slavery since you'd be taking away someone's labor without their consent.",1501545747

"DelphiMarkets","t5_3mn4a","&gt;It's too late for anyone to back out now

...and so the reason you're here is to... well, I guess to collect a paycheck. 

Points 1 and 2 are more armchair lawyering from our resident Gnosis shill. Also, it's a little weird that you think your best 2 points are about the *legal terms and conditions* ***of a dApp***. It's like trying to discuss cars in terms of legs, because you remember that horses had legs. You're not operating on the right wavelength.

&gt;The Delphi github repository is stolen from the Gnosis github repository.

&gt;The contributions made by Delphi in that repository consists, in their entirety...

&gt;The tiny code changes in PythianOracle.sol 

Let's see how [Delphi themselves describe this](https://medium.com/@Delphi_Markets/the-master-plan-eb42cf648a75), shall we?

&gt;It might initially seem overambitious to commit to maintaining multiple separate (and in some ways incompatible) platform implementations. However, **the more complex implementation (the Gnosis-compatible codebase) is ultimately going to represent little more than a local clone of Gnosis’ official repository (with a few custom interfaces added and some of the more disingenuous and misleading naming decisions revisited), so almost all of the development effort will be provided by Gnosis rather than Delphi for this.** 

Oh dear. If only your attempted smear had been published 5 days ago, maybe it would have looked more like you had a point. As it is, you're just saying what they're saying, except trying to make it sound like it's a bad thing.

&gt;Out of 33 pages, 3 pages describe the Delphi system. 

&gt;Most of the whitepaper consists of describing things that were there before Delphi.

Seems to me more like 20 or so describe Delphi. Pages 10-12 describe properties that both Gnosis *and* Delphi share (that's the point), pages 12-21 describe properties that Gnosis exhibits which are *not* relevant to Delphi (again, that's the point, from what I can see). For instance, Delphi doesn't have Poisonous Token Incentive problems or risks of non-WIZ fees... oh, and [look at that token distribution](https://plot.ly/~zweice/18/) versus [the Gnosis debacle](https://medium.com/@Delphi_Markets/wealth-distribution-and-why-it-matters-4155c481d300). 

The day that you Delphi haters acknowledge the Wealth Distribution stuff ... and more importantly the fact that it spells doom for Gnosis in the long term... is the day that I start taking you seriously.


I suggest that we, as a community, tag users like /u/itsnotlupus and remember that they are not here to be productive, they are here to smear. They don't want us to succeed (either because Gnosis is paying them not to) and they are here to lie and divide us. 

On the last couple days of the crowdsale, they really ramped it up in terms of attacks. They brigaded *every* crypto subreddit. I even [called them out massively](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/6qbv7r/urgent_delphimarkets_is_a_scam_their_token_sale/dkwq21f/) and of course was victimized by a wave of ad hominems as a result.

They ended up [deleting that thread after I called them out](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all), but guess what: [I was one step ahead of you guys](https://web.archive.org/web/20170730044029/https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all).

Well, that was the write up I was hoping for.  It's always nice when people are able and willing to take the time to express themselves.  Thanks.

What I find interesting in the answers is the highly selective perspective used to evaluate the question.  I don't intend this to be mean or angry sounding -- if the questions were asked in a particular fashion or if certain conditions were omitted, I would expect your responses and accept them as completely valid.

Drones.  I was vague in the context of usage.  I thought it was obvious, but perhaps not.  I was clearly not referring to sanctioned deployments.  (I could write for days about our Laurel and Hardy routines scouring the countryside looking for our lost RQ-11's ... those laughable things have a mind of their own when it comes to landing out.)  What I was refering to are the illegal assassination drone strikes which not only (sometimes) kill a target sentenced to death without any Jury or Judge but also kill numerous civilians - and don't even tell me you think they are ""guilty by association"", yes some are, but not the majority.  These are not only immensely counterproductive to gaining allies they are also extremely troubling in a Democracy for a president to be able to decide ""who dies.""  Yes, I know all about FISA and FICA - having submitted numerous reports/documents for targeting approval I am very familiar with exactly how rubber stamping the process is (okay, was.  My last submission was 2011.  I've heard it's marginally better.)   Trump was very clear about his verbose criticism of Obama for conducting these exact same strikes and then ... expands and extends their missions and targeting.  This is not campaign marketing - it's duplicitous.  He lured people to thinking he was going to reduce military attacks abroad and then increased them.

Transgender.  So, first, your personal assessment of how LGBT personality might affect ship life is personally valid -- and during the many, many years of DoD review related to the topic investigators interviewed hundreds of people just like yourself.  Their conclusion was that LGBT peoples present no different distraction/unrest.  Now, granted, individuals may have a personal inability to co-exist but we usually call them bigots:  claiming a black person isn't allowed into the shower because Race is not a valid objection.  It might be their personal opinion, but they are the one needing to change, not the system.  LGBT issue is the same.   With the mental issues ... I wonder what the objection is about.  I suspect that some percentage of people do enlist for the explicit goal of having their change operation funded.  Research show's it is not the majority, but statistics do show the dollar cost of those procedures - it's very small.  As an example of why complaining about this is disingenuous look at people who a) get married simply for BAH, off-post housing/etc, or b) GI-Bill.  None of them -- and their number is legion -- get different treatment during service, and only get their benefits after their service.  How is that any different?  If a person has an objection to LGBT people ... that would be objectionable to them.  And this is exactly back to the bigotry is the *individuals* problem, not the system's.

China.  Agreed, for the most part.  I think Trump is out of his element when it comes to dealing with Nation State issues, but he is learning one hopes.  The issue of China  isn't that they have an rights abuse problem ... Trump made all sorts of grandiose claims about leveling the trade barriers etc.  Nothing will happen - nor can anything happen because for every tit he takes from them they will tat back.  They're no weaker a Nation than the US - we might have a very slight technological advance in our deployed military, but it's short term.  They have the numbers.  And that will not change.  In then end nothing Trump or anyone else does will keep the US economically/militaristic above China in another few years.  Geopolitically China is getting ahead of the US precisely because of our bad politics Trump embraces.  When China becomes the leader of Environmental Change/Improvement you know things aren't being done very well.

Twitter.  I totally agree with your assessment of how/why Trump (or who ever does it for him) uses Twitter.  I don't agree on your comment that the media has a liberal bias.  This is not only proven wrong in many instances, you can easily look for yourself.  Corporate ownership implies Conservative.  If for no other reason than big money doesn't want to rock any boats.  Never have, never will.  Since the late 80s ""news dissemination"" has become entertainment and as a result corporate ownership bought out for the profit.  Some of the outlets are left leaning, others right leaning.  The issue of Objective, Factual and Unbiased.  These are qualities which are more present in some outlets and less in others.  The reason the Right created the ""left media bias"" propaganda was precisely with the goal to turn people away from reading the reporting (news) and to turn to the editorializing (newstainment).

So, anyway, thanks for the response.  Hope my counter replies are understandable -- my wife is hounding me to pack up so we can go out ...

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Splitting this into two posts, because my answer is long.

&gt; Earlier in our discussion I commented on how I believe that the Trans policy tweet was meant to distract from the controversy swirling around the administration. 

There are a lot of people who have interacted with Donald Trump over the years, and the interactions have shown a number of very consistent traits:

* He has an ego.
* He knows how to work the media
* He uses controversy to achieve his ends
* He cares about people under him (whether that's because he wants to be liked, or because it builds loyalty, or because that's the type of person he wants to be)
* He really supports military and police (as evidenced by him taking time numerous times to thank them over the years, even when nobody is watching)
* He has a Japanese style mentality when it comes to business - nice to people, but ruthless towards other business owners.  
* He responds very negatively to attacks, potentially to the part of narcissistic rage

He's the type of guy who pays off someone's mortgage who did something nice for him, or sends his plane to get a sick kid to a hospital, but he will stiff suppliers and bribe politicans to get a permit, or to see his competition doesn't.  

I bring up his personality because understanding this makes it easier to predict what he does, and why he does it.  It explains why he (for example) leaks his own recordings of him pretending to be his publicist - creating controversy for himself when it's a slow news cycle.

When Trump says he's pro-gay people, he's genuine.  His mentality is very people-oriented.  He's in the hospitality industry, and exposure has humanized them a lot to him.  That's also why he shifted his position on children brought into the country illegally.  After his comments about deporting illegals, he got a lot more exposure to people that would be impacted, and so even though it lost him points with the hard-liners, he refused to overturn the policy on deporting those kids.

He also spends a lot of time with the unions and union workers - people who are hurt by illegal immigration.  He's spent a lot of time meeting with his base, and he desperately wants to be liked.  They tell him of factory closings, of jobs moving to Mexico.  Victims of illegal immigrants who have committed other crimes tell him that they have been harmed, and he listens and believes them.

Take this framework, and look at the trans decision, and it starts to make some sense.  The military is a conservative institution - they know what works, and they really don't want to change.  Change might be good, but it might be bad, and what we have works.  

So, the military tells trump that they don't want to deal with trans people enlisting.  There's risk, and they don't want it.  Trump doesn't deal with a whole lot of trans people - most of us are liberal (meaning we hate him, rather than support him).  

Most of the people in my life have no idea I'm trans, so I don't serve to make impressions of trans people upon others.  Who are the visible trans people?  Generally the poor and more crazy ones.  

Donald Trump runs in expensive, customer-facing circles.  If you're visibly trans, you're not going to work in most places Trump will meet you.  If you're not visibly trans, you won't affect his opinions.  It's not that he hates you, it's that he doesn't think of you.

On top of that, we're in the middle of a budget, and there are conservative republicans that really hate paying for liberal things.  They can't stop abortion due to Roe v. Wade, but they can try to cut all funding for them they can.  They can also try to cut all funding for trans surgery, because we are degenerate and evil.

So, you have a military that doesn't want trans people, trans people are not in his sphere to be personalized, a man who likes to work the media, and congressmen telling him that if he wants their support that he better not fight the military.  

The ObamaCare repeal was lost by one vote (thanks, McCain!), so he needs every congresscritter he can get.  Congress tried to vote to defund trans surgeries for soldiers who got out (which won't affect readiness at all), and the people who did that vote haven't given up.  They certainly don't want trans people joining specifically to get surgery (which would inevitably happen).

All of this brings us to:

&gt; Do you think it's possible that there could be some merit to the claims made by the author that both the tweets about the new trans policy, and the communication director's profanity laced interview could have been meant as distractions?

Absolutely.  I doubt that it was done specifically to distract from the testimony, and that if it was a distraction, it was done more with regards to the ObamaCare repeal failure (which does make him look really bad), but it's possible there were aspects of both.

He's good at working the media, and he was going to do it anyway.  Why not wait until a time that's good for his purposes?",1501545754

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","Thank you for phrasing that the way you did. I've been seeing a therapist for years. It's not a magic cure. It takes work, dedication, and time. Therapy *helps* find ways of dealing with issues. Also the relationship between the counselor and the client is important. If you don't have a connection to them, it's not going to help. It would be like if you had a physical injury. Your doctor told you to take a medication every day for some time, and go to physical therapy. But you decided to just take the pill a few times, or maybe you take the pills as prescribed but skip out on the PT, or did the PT and skipped the pills. Counseling in one tool in a tool box and if you don't use it correctly it's only going to be slightly helpful at best. 

I've been in a somewhat similar situation as OP and I'll give this as my advice. It's unlikely that no one is going to know you're romantically interested in them. If you are, just ask them out (provided they're single) and understand that if they say no, they aren't saying you suck they're just not interested in you that way but probably see other traits they like in you.  If they say yes, sweet! But it doesn't really matter if friends you aren't romantically interested in like you that way. I'm typically attracted to many people at the same time but I'm monogamous at heart and can enjoy the view, so to say, without the desire to do anything about it. So try not to worry about if people are attracted to you. At the end of the day if you're not interested and they aren't making a serious move on you or doing anything that makes you uncomfortable, it doesn't matter. Though it does seem to matter to you so it's important because of how it's effecting you. 

If you're wondering this about everyone you are around, then it starts to look like an obsession.  Now that might be one of those situations where it isn't a problem until its a problem (like say you have a glass of wine every night. It progresses to more and more and starts to effect your daily life. That one glass wasn't a problem but now the wine is). The fact that you posted this looking for help suggest it is a problem for you. 

Therapy may help you if you find a good counselor, listen to them, and are willing to put in the hard work to change that behavior that's bothering you. It won't be easy and it won't happen overnight. It can work though and has helped a great many people, myself included. 

It can't hurt to call around and see if you can find a counselor you like. I picked mine because her write up said I could just text if I felt most comfortable that way and she told me that the way someone was treating me was ""bullshit"". We clicked after that. I called between 5 and 10 counselors before I found her but it was worth it so much. ",1501545755
"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","Adding a bit to other answers - take into consideration that reddit made a meme out of PT. People generally completely dismiss his points and bring up a way in which he presented his arguments (which was absolutely awful by the way - but does it invalidates opinions and arguments?), joke more or less seriously that he should put a public apology etc... Generally: a hate boner. PT said in videos and comments a lot of things and it might be not perfect to completely rely on people's opinions in that matter.",1501545755

&gt; One result of the dearth of scientists has been a Congress that is often ignorant of the scientific perspective, not just on obvious issues like climate change-Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the chair of the House Science Committee has called it a myth propagated by &amp;quot;So-called, self-professed climate scientists&amp;quot; and subpoenaed emails from government-funded climatologists-but on virtually every subject that comes up.

The casters point to Jensen being set up around by his team, but I personally don't think that's fair. Bjerg gets the luxury of having extremely consistent laners in all his lanes and rarely needs to carry, but hasn't been really discredited by the casters for that... I think having your team work around you and you being able to constantly hard carry demonstrates skill just as being able to share your lead with other lanes and getting them ahead does.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The very first NES was astonishing. Over the course of about two months, I'd probably dumped about $20 worth of quarters in the Vs. Super Mario Bros. (that's what it was called) arcade game at Imperial Bowling Lanes. I'd made it to level 8-1, and that's only because another, older boy had showed me about the Warp Zone in 4-1. Shortly after that, I got the NES and a copy of Super Mario Brothers for my birthday. Whoa, you mean *it looks exactly like the arcade game*!? That was unbelievable.

I've always been a gamer, pretty much since I was a tiny boy. Back then, gaming meant mowing lawns, digging through couches, skipping milk at lunchtime at school, all to collect as many quarters as you could. Getting quarters was like a game in itself. Then you had to find the game machines, which was its own sort of adventure. ""Hey, did you hear they've got Joust at the Do-Duds laundromat?"" You would go into places that don't typically cater to kids on the off chance that they had a video game set up. Supermarkets, bars, restaurants, you name it. The nearby 7-11 had a ""gaming room,"" which was little more than a broom closet that could fit three game cabinets, which would rotate out every few weeks or so. Going to Pizza Hut was always a special treat because they had the best game rooms.

Home game consoles were usually shit. I had the Atari 2600, where Pac-Man was basically a 4x4 yellow square. I also had a Commodore 64, and the games for it were of the sort that would take several hours typing BASIC out of Byte Magazine to get a workable version of Hangman. God help you if you forgot to save to disc.

The Nintendo changed everything, because now I had the arcade in my home. It looked the same, it played the same, it had the same levels. The Warp Zone was in the same place. The first time I passed Bowser and it wasn't that stupid fucking Toad retainer or whatever telling me the princess was in another castle, not gonna lie here, I fucking cried. I cried at the end of Super Mario Brothers because it felt like my entire life had led up to that moment, and now it was finally over.

In the age of Skyrim and GTA, most gamers don't remember the time when *all* games were linear, but to my mind, the first ""open world"" game was The Legend of Zelda. No levels, no hi score, and the ability to go backwards. You could actually go back and visit places you'd already been, like the cave where you get the wooden sword. Amazing!

In my entire life so far, that was probably the biggest technological shock to me, because it changed absolutely everything that happened afterwards. I so dearly miss those days and the excitement of it all.

Sometimes I'll be playing a modded Skyrim playthrough for the 4,000th time and I'll get this fantasy in my head of showing this amazing game to my past self. One day it occurred to me: that's exactly what I'm doing right now. That ten year old boy is still inside me, and he's having a great fucking time.",1501545760

Os portugueses é que foram os que lucraram com a escravatura certo? Mas os exemplosque dás são todos no Brasil.

Brasil que era colônia de Portugal...portanto, todos os senhores de terras aqui eram portugueses e parte de tudo o que era produzido no Brasil ia diretamente para a Coroa portuguesa. Não interessa se são seus antepassados ou não, eles não deixam de ser portugueses, não deixam de estar explorando a terra e a vida de pessoas em nome, e para o lucro de Portugal.

&gt;Não concordo. A História de Portugal, mesmo se considerarmos só os últimos 900 anos, é uma coisa muito mais antiga que escravidão transatlântica,mais abrangente, que envolve muitos outros temas de interesse aos alunos portugueses. Claro que se fala de escravatura e do triângulo do Atlântico e do Padre António Vieira em Português.

A História da colonização do Brasil e da escravidão cobre quase 400 anos de toda a História de Portugal. E se Portugal tem uma História tão abrangente assim não cabe nela a escravidão do Atlântico? Ou cabe apenas glorificar a Escola de Sagres?

&gt;e conheces tu o ensino na sala, se é mencionado ou não, ou vais apenas pela opinião dela? Porque as anedotas pessoais dela, no seu contexto são idiotas.

Ela é uma pesquisadora acadêmica, não são anedotas pessoais, são resultados de uma pesquisa sobre o tema. 


&gt;E se há mais afastamento do ensino em Portugal que por exemplo no Brasil em relação ao tema da escravatura transatlântica talvez faça sentido, porque a sua influência está-nos muito mais distante.  E temos mais história além daquela que toca o Brasil. 

Novamente, o período no qual Portugal mais floresceu economicamente foi aquele em que Brasil era sua principal colônia, aquele em que o açúcar era feito por negros escravizados, o ouro era minado por negros escravizados e que o café era colhido pelos mesmos negros. 

A colonização portuguesa não é glorificada sem motivo por aqueles desprezíveis o suficiente para fazê-la, ela é tida em alta estima por ser o único período em que Portugal foi hegemônico economicamente há nível global.",1501545762

&gt; One result of the dearth of scientists has been a Congress that is often ignorant of the scientific perspective, not just on obvious issues like climate change-Texas Rep. Lamar Smith, the chair of the House Science Committee has called it a myth propagated by &amp;quot;So-called, self-professed climate scientists&amp;quot; and subpoenaed emails from government-funded climatologists-but on virtually every subject that comes up.

I think Jose has already created a side where people know we will not lose much. The team shows a good mentality and fighting spirit, but still lacks the quality in attack that you need to go on big winning streaks and finish high up in the league.",1501545764

It sounds like the coordination between the left and right hand start to break down a bit when you go faster; it looks like you might be changing fingers on your left hand just a fraction late compared to your bow stroke, which is causing the transitions between notes to be a little choppy. I don't know if you are practicing the 2nd and 3rd pieces at that speed all the time, but I would try and practice them slower so that you get the timing between your left hand and right hand down. Also, in regards to the bowings that u/Djinneral talked about in the first piece, the reason why your bowings are getting mixed up, like in measures 5 and 9, is because you are supposed to retake the bow; you lift the bow off the string and replace it back near the frog. It is another part of bow control that can be learned in this piece.

If possible, when you shoot your next video, would you be able to shoot it at a straight-on perspective so we can see the angle of the bow relative to the bridge and fingerboard, as well as the angle of your left wrist?

&gt; “I think there's a misconception that games like Rogue and Dark Souls are appealing just because they're hard, when really the challenge is a small piece of the puzzle,” he explained. “What players really want is for their actions to feel meaningful, and that requires a lot of different elements working together: difficult-but-fair challenges, player agency, high stakes, true secrets, an interesting world to explore, etc. For a long while, it felt like games were designed around this idea that players shouldn't get frustrated or else they'll quit, and that made them feel more artificial despite the technological leaps. These days, it's better understood that some amount of frustration is inevitable if you want to make players really own their accomplishments.”

Most people thought Porcello over performed last year. Eduardo Rodriguez isn't exactly an amazing pitcher although I think he has a lot of potential. And Price was coming off a very disappointing year relative to his career.

Flood fill, also called seed fill, is an algorithm that determines the area connected to a given node in a multi-dimensional array. It is used in the ""bucket"" fill tool of paint programs to fill connected, similarly-colored areas with a different color, and in games such as Go and Minesweeper for determining which pieces are cleared. When applied on an image to fill a particular bounded area with color, it is also known as boundary fill.

No need to spend much on a media pc either. I'd just use a Raspberry pi with [LibreElec](https://libreelec.tv/) as it's os.  [Libreelec](https://libreelec.tv/) is essentially the bare minimum operating system required, along with kodi pre-installed.

I'd say your standard team will be:

Orlandeau - straightforward chainer, common and powerful, also has decent offensive breaks when needed

Tilith - healer with a ton of utility

Rikku - Suberb support, complements Tilith nicely

WoL - good tank, great utility, adds breaks to your team

Luneth - top tier finisher, innate dw, needs enhancements

This team covers most of the main roles, using the standard support trinity and a classic chainer-finisher combo.  You'll most likely take a friend Orlandeau for this setup.  For situations where you just want to clear easy content faster, you can drop Rikku (or Tilith or WoL) and add another damage dealer, likely Aileen, possibly K.Delita or Reberta.

Do note that Wilhelm is much tankier than WoL.  We use WoL in this team because he brings defensive breaks that the rest of that setup lacks and better offensive breaks than Orlandeau.  If you'd like to use Wilhelm instead because you need better single target tanking, or if you'd like Delita's stronger breaks for fights you want to clear fast consider something similar to:

Orlandeau, Tilith, Delita, Wilhelm, Luneth

This team loses out on Rikku's resistances and superb LB, but has much stronger defensive breaks for faster clears and a tougher tank.  Additionally, Wilhelm's buffs are some of the better non-bard buffs (only really losing to Zarg atm) and are easy to cycle with his Impregnable and his LB.  If you want both the buffs and the break, you can drop Luneth and just use the Orlandeau chaining for damage, though I'm not sure if the breaks would outweigh the benefits of a proper finisher.

For content with strong elemental damage where you need heavier than usual resistances, you'll probably want to sub Marie in there, or Minfilia for the niche case where you can't use magic.

In the case where an enemy resists light, you'll bring Aileen and a friend Aileen rather than Orlandeau.  Or Reberta/K. Delita if they work better for the fight.

I think this is a decent startup.  Let me know if you want clarifications/have questions/ are looking for a specific team for a certain fight.",1501545768

Right now, range anxiety is keeping people from even considering an EV. Once they have one, they'll realize that range anxiety with a &gt;200 mile car is pretty unfounded.

Not everyone wants their dad (and everyone else) to see their tits (or dick) on the big screen. Men can be super successful actors without being stripped down to their underwear (or farther) in the majority of their movies (even if it's globally acknowledged that they're hot). Women are nude 3 times as much. That is not a statistical fluctuation. That is a societal characteristic. https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/05/female-nudity-three-times-likely-male-hollywood-films

I pointed out in another comment thread that in the Atlanta Games, the best attended soccer games were within 300 miles of Atlanta, the worst were in Miami, the farthest Distance from Atlanta.

As part of the '84 games I learned that if you have the game in another location other than the home city, you need to pay all the travel costs, so you need a large stadium and fill it to make it worthwhile. You will not see a CAF and AFC team play in a big stadium, or even a small one in another city. It will not make money (although it may pay for itself.) In the '84 games all the host Cities for the Olympic soccer events had to pay all transportation costs for Olympic staff, competitors, official etc. It was pricey if your match only drew 30-40K in a 60k stadium, but it was a price some cities paid to be a part of the '84 games.",1501545770

Problem is, I just can't bring myself to have sex with him anymore. It's not even him, the thought of sex or any variant of foreplay, even kissing much makes me feel physically ill and anxious to the point where I get incredibly upset and defensive when the subject is broached. We used to have a brilliant sex life... then one day it just changed. Funnily enough we had sex for the first time in AGES about 22 weeks ago (I was super into it for like 2 days I have no idea what happened) and boom, pregnant. If it was hormones then I must be seriously imbalanced because I can go for a year or so without any change in the aversion.
Anyway he knows somethings not right to an extent and I do my best to force myself to ""sort him out"" at least a couple of times a week even if its just a HJ as I usually can't even force myself to do more but I feel like the worst woman alive. I'm carrying his child, absolutely head over heels in love with him and our relationship is incredibly strong. Yet I find the thought of having sex disgusting. How could I ever explain that to him? How am I ever going to fix it? Will I ever get my drive back? I genuinley miss the incredible sex we used to have, but feel sickened at the thought of it happening again. Theres no way I could ever tell him that, he would take it as a personal thing as though its his fault. I desperately want to know what is wrong with me but I've never even dared to bring it up in my counselling sessions or my mental health check ups with my GP, I'm scared of what it might be because it seems to be a mental thing. I have a sneaking suspicion it has a lot to do with some ... events that occurred in my past but the timing of the aversion starting is years after. 
I miss the intimacy most of all. Not even the orgasms or how it felt, just the closeness. It feels like a huge chunk of my life has been ripped away from me and it's somehow my own fault because its ME feeling that way.

There's a sort of freedom to it—submitting your movement to the whims of multistrike.

Sometimes you'll watch your character fly into a divine shrine, disconnect at 0 fps, and find yourself dead when you log back in. Sometimes you discover Esh, who has piled a ton of lightning balls up against a wall, and get instantly evaporated, ending your 2WHC turmoil race.

But sometimes you get to watch screens and screens of mobs get obliterated, feeling the rush of immediate context-recognition/reaction (Leap Slam to avoid a bad situation/grab a shrine/keep up Fortify), and an extreme sense of speed/ease.

Also, the damage is pretty nice on a small budget. An Oro/Terminus and a 1c 5L chest and you're good to go.",1501545771

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","I didn't wait for Vega because I was loyal to AMD. In fact after many years with Radon GPUs my plan has been to get a Team Green GPU next (and I haven't touched an AMD CPU in almost ten years). But I don't like what NVidia is doing with Gsync, and since my PC is not just my gaming machine, but also my workstation for content creation, I wanted a GPU that has adaptive sync without the restrictions (and also the price tag) that NVidia applies to their proprietary implementation of adaptive sync. Well, that wasn't the only reason, but I will spare you my full thoughts on my plans over the last two years.

I was hoping that Vega would be the next Radeon Fury. Same league as the high-end range from NVidia, mildly higher power consumption (depending on the voltages that you apply), cheaper, with FreeSync and with the in my opinion nicer driver suite. And maybe it does still happen with Vega. Let's wait for conclusive reviews before we burn AMD on the boiling plate that was Bulldozer. But if it doesn't happen, I might join Team Green as I intended in the beginnig and just ditch the idea of having adaptive sync.",1501545771

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","As far as the Russia collusion thing goes, here's my operating hypothesis on what happened.

&gt; The connections are tenuous, and there is a lot that we don't know, but I wonder if you think it's possible. 

* Russia meddles in US politics, just like the US does all over the world.
* Russia tries to influence and bribe both parties, as well as infiltrate and take data.  Israel does the same thing, as does the US.
* Russia prefers Donald Trump over Hillary because he's inexperienced and focused on the US.
* Russia didn't know who would win, so they tried to have ins with both sides, because it's safer
* The emails were probably leaked by a staffer that was a Bernie supporter.
* Russia did hack the DNC.  John Podesta fell for a phishing scam, and they got in.
* When the DNC emails were leaked, John Podesta's password was in there.
* Some people in 4chan figured this out and dumped Podesta's iCloud account, device backup, and Outlook.  I was there in the thread when this happened (though there was nothing I could do to stop it).
* When the investigation started, they found the actual Russian hack (as would be expected).  The DNC decided to run with this (for obvious reasons).
* Donald Trump Jr. really wanted to get some dirt on Hillary.  Given their history, it's certainly possible it exists.  When he was presented with the possibility, he did indeed meet with the person, before finding out there was nothing there.
* Russia deliberately used their influence over the media (which they have cultivated to various degrees worldwide, not just through the State propaganda) to try to influence people in favour of Trump.
* Now that the election is over, they are likely trying to go the other way.  It's in Russia's interest for Donald Trump to be ineffective, as long as he's not mad at them for it.

This hypothesis is consistent with observed data, doesn't require WikiLeaks (which has a good history) to lie, and is compatible with parties acting in their own interests.  It doesn't require the Trump team to be traitors, and explains the connections.

&gt; then does the tweet about a policy that will impact the lives pf serving military members being released before the communications team has answers to provide the press or the military institutions are briefed so they can field questions about it, does that not all feel like a release that was at best half-baked? At worst, incompetence? 

Trump likes attention - it's what made his entire brand possible.  He's fostered a reputation for not doing things the politically correct way, and it resonates with his base.  Let's be honest here, Trump's attitude tends to appeal more to people on the lower side of the bell curve for intelligence - sounding particularly eloquent undermines that image.  It's a different approach to a tactic George W Bush used in order to appear more relatable.

Being unscripted and unfiltered, particularly for someone like him, is going to mean that things are half-baked to a degree.  He's going to put his foot in his mouth and have to backpedal from time to time.  It's going to hurt some people in the process.

As a voter, my choices were between him and Hillary Clinton, and I've worked with people who have worked with Hillary Clinton.  She's very good at keeping secrets, and she's rather vitriolic (andd sometimes violent) to the people around her.  Given the choice between a narcissist who wants to be liked by the people he represents, and a power-mad person who is cold, calculating, and willing to do anything for power, I'd much rather choose the guy without the filter.

&gt; After reading this and learning more about what the Maginstky Act is, even meeting to discuss it before the election seems like it was a bad idea. When they talk about ""adoption"" they are talking about relieving sanctions. 

Donald Trump has no particular reason to hate Russia.  Trump likely sees Putin as a man who's trying to protect his country, and the interests of Russia.  There's been an attitude trying to get away from the Cold War style approach for years now, from Obama's ""The cold war called - they want their foreign policy back"" to telling Russia that Obama would be ""more flexible"" after the election.

Putin kills his enemies.  He does it with impunity, and he makes sure it's known that he does it.  The real question, and I mean this honestly, is why should we punish the entire country of Russia for his actions?  It's reasonable for the US to punish people and countries for harming US interests, but if they hurt their own people, why is it the US job to intervene?  What if it wasn't Putin that killed the lawyer, but rather someone acting to benefit Putin because they themselves stood to gain from his Power?  If they aren't in the executive, and they weren't orders from the executive, then we're punishing an entire country for the actions of someone not even in power.

Also, there's an argument to be made that the Clintons have a rather suspicious number of people near them who have died under mysterious circumstances.  Hillary Clinton has explicitly said that the US should have undermined democratic elections in foreign countries.  If she had won, should other countries have collectively punished the US for her?",1501545774

"television","t5_2qh6e","&gt; Of course you're not offended, that's the point. I wonder why....

Well then don't make an objective statement about a subjective matter.



&gt;Cultural appropriation is only ""cultural appropriation"" when it's the dominant culture doing the appropriating. You can't really ""appropriate"" a dominat culture forced on you... but hey.. according to your logic..



The hypothetical group of people who you suggest as possibly using a quasi-european system would not have had it forced on them. Wasn't that your point?




&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


Actually, my people were subjucated for about 800 years, it's arguably still ongoing. Bit rude to make such assumptions. But, I'll leave it at that because I'm not the type to get upset about the past. 

Anyway, your statement

&gt;Of course it wouldn't make you uncomfortable because you regard it as fantasy and not something rooted in any minute sense of possibility. 


seems to contradict your earlier statement




&gt;If it were meant to ""teach a lesson"", why not role reverse? What would happen if it were white slaves instead of black? What if indigenous had repelled invasions or adopted a quasi-european system (for scenic relatability within the program i.e. High Castle style)? I bet that would feel a bit uncomfortable, no?


Funny, that. 




&gt;Your privilege is safe and sound. 



What privilege is that? 




&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 



That's a generalisation, isn't it? It's a bit at odds with your next statement....





&gt;Africa is an entire continent.. arguably the largest. Therefore, it's illogical to band an entire continent under one specific social / culture structure.



Of course it's okay to group all white people together, but not Africans. You're a hypocrite. 



&gt;Nations sold prisoners to other (non African) for capital or political influence, etc. Obviously not knowing this would lead to industrialized slavery based on little but the genetic makeup of slaves and their family in perpetuity. You're an idiot for this attempted retort. Seriously.



You're saying that they sold their fellow Africans without realising that those Africans would be treated as slaves? That's weird. Are you saying that Africans lack foresight? It's a strange argument you're presenting. How do you believe that they didn't think that creating a slave industry would lead to indutrialised slavery? 




&gt;Look up ""house slaves"" in reference to ""field slaves"" or refer to Django. That answers your ""but there's black people involved"" statement. 



I didn't make a ""but there's black people involved"" statement, I asked you a question. A question and a statement aren't the same thing. Did you ever go to school? 

And what is your point here? That any black person that writes a story about an alternate history where black people are still enslaved in the US is a race traitor, or brainwashed....? What is it?




&gt;Also, generalizing a race's reaction based on a few individuals is inherently racist.




I don't remeber generalising a race's reaction. I do remember you saying


&gt;Hell, your demographic gets up in arms over comic book characters swapping races/genders. Stop it lol. 


You're a hypocrite and a liar. 






&gt;You need to socialize more often. Maybe you'll change your myopic mindstate by default. Now, suck you mum.


I'm fairly social. Maybe you should get outside your echo chamber and learn to deal with people who have different opinions to yours in a mature way, rather than throwing out childish insults, making things up, making racist generalisations, and playing the perpetual victim. 


It'd be really nice if you could go on with your life without such a chip on your shoulder. It's not good for your heart. This whole ""us versus them"" attitude won't get you anywhere. Good luck with your life.

Obviously the most powerful approaches are first hand narratives - either with someone who attempted suicide and either failed or changed their mind, or telling the story of someone who succeeded with interviews with their family/friends -  and illustrating a bigger picture from that basis if needed (although 10 mins is very short to do the latter).  

Do you know what your approach is?  Obviously this is a sensitive topic so you want to be focused before you ask people to contribute.  Is it about why men don't tend to ask for help before they attempt suicide?  Is it about the lack of resources open to suicidal men?  You need to work that out before people will talk to you.  

What documentaries have you watched on the topic and what did you like/dislike about them?  What moved you?  I'm assuming you've seen [The Bridge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u10VsLsWPc4)?

I'm going to be blunt - you're making a student film about a topic that is a hugely important real life/professional thing for people you may want to interview.  Unless you approach it with the gravitas the subject deserves (in terms of doing your research, crafting your approach, doing everything you can to be taken seriously) then nobody is going to look further than 'student looking to get grades on the back of real human suffering and misery' and they'll of course say no.  

Take a step back.  Documentaries are about planning, and crafting, and nuance, connecting on a human level, and being acutely aware of what you're asking people to do and say, and how to ask them in the right way.

Smart and aspie types are generally attracted to engineering, math, CS, and physics.  Some equally smart guys that can or could do that shit are drawn to other fields.

I went to grad school at a top 50 school (not MIT, but a range of smarts and some brilliant people there on fellowships/working with the best prof, etc).  The smartest men (probably 3 SD above the mean, perfect or near perfect scores on the GRE, etc) were not goofy at all.

Why do you want to have a REIT in your portfolio in the first place?

Diversification isn't a matter of picking every asset you can ""just in case"" - it is a specific tool to reduce concentration risk in a portfolio.

When done correctly, it reduces the volatility of a portfolio *as a whole* without reducing expected returns.

However, if you add lots of different asset *classes* to a portfolio, you are generally changing the risk/return characteristic in a fundamental way, so not actually diversifying in that sense.",1501545783

The seed i planted grew *identical* to the breeder's description to a T, all the way down to the bud structure and smell. This is a good sign to see because if you sprout the same pheno the breeder wanted you to, the strain has extremely strong and well made genetics.

It was beyond easy to grow. Super super strong plant with THICK stems and leaves that was immune to 400w of powerful leds blasting it from 4"" away. 

My favorite trait of the strain is the side branching was OFF THE CHARTS. You DO NOT need to top this plant, in fact the breeder suggests you don't, which I agree with after seeing how this thing grows and how THICK the stems are. This would make it a poor candidate for a SCROG or manifolding technique, but it will NATURALLY form quite a few large, even colas in the canopy and the buds are dense/frosty all the way to the bottom of the plant. 

Super nice yielder too, I got 6.6oz off this one txomango and it was only in a 2x2 area until the last 2 weeks of flower. Buds were like I said the BEST quality I have yet to encounter. Hard as fuckin rocks, FROSTED UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN, stunk to high fucking heaven and beyond, and the buds looked beautiful. 

Here's my Txomango, which I had vegged for just over 2 weeks before flipping. This was on day 70 of flowering, the day I pulled it down.

Basically you become a wraith on the battlefield by utilizing billow resets alongside the smolder legendary. With zhin it all comes down to knowing your enemy and taking advantage of your abilities that make duels borderline unwinnable for the enemy. Firstly always use your billow liberally in a 1v1 as you will be using the card that resets the cd on a kill, along with the legendary you will have essentially 3200 hp at base since you can regen 60%. Secondly always use your counter offensively, it deals 700dmg and blocks one attack, alongside the card that h3als you on countering this is a super effective dueling tool. Lastly a zhin best defense is being elusive, make sure to use whirl through your target. Your attacks are easy to hit, theirs usually are not, by grabbing nimble and using whirl effectively you become an incredibly hard target which basically destroys their optimal time to kill whilst yours remains unchanged.",1501545784

All zombies can res other zombies, all zombies can hear a zombie commander, but also are in 12 subgroups of 8 who can talk to each other in game.

The Royals needed someone cheap to platoon with Alex Gordon in LF who is slashing .191/.342/.236 against lefties. To sum it all up, for what the Royals need, yes Melky is a better option.

As for the Nats, they were/are looking for 7th, 8th, 9th inning bullpen arms, Gearrin and Kontos do not fit that bill as we well know. They obviously aren't going to trade for Strickland and the Giants probably would prefer to not trade Dyson right now. Melancon may be a waiver option but he basically has no value atm since he is injured.

It all boils down to fit. The Giants don't have the players that are desirable to the handful of contenders atm.

Nothing more enjoyable then watching Orcus (or another boss) etc. swing 180 on some nub dps running around with an earth archon, lion, or yeti standing next to some other squishy dps and clerics and ""poof"" down they go. Or better yet when I'm pulling the entire dungeon and their defender pet takes aggro of some of the mobs off of me and gets others killed and blame me....

News flash. Towards late to end game the ONLY one who should EVER have a defender pet in a dungeon summoned is if the tank wishes to use one as an off tank and or the bonus gained from the lion. You are just making the runs that much harder for your tank and healer. I've been in pugs before at Orcus for example with 3 defender companions and him spinning everywhere and them bitching at me....",1501545787
"DIY","t5_2qh7d","As others have noted, pro classic is an excellent choice. I will add some advice, which is that pro classic has paint levelers in it, which can cause it to run and drop on vertical surfaces. Come back and look at what you've painted after 10m and lightly brush away the drops, you'll never see them.

Another new product is the interior emerald line specifically for doors and trim, it dries with a very hard finish. However it will show brush marks, so use a soft brush.

For the banisters where they get touched, I'd lightly sand with a sanding sponge, and use an oil based primer like zinsser cover stain, or kilz, then topcoat twice. Lots of hand traffic though will weaken anything due to dirt and oils.",1501545787

In realistic use of the most  affordable forms of bc, you know where a woman forgets a pill once in a while or the condom breaks, it's optimistically 5% per year, leading to a 40% likelihood of an unintentional pregnancy over 10 years.

If a woman is sexually active from age 20-30, using birth control perfectly, there is an 18% likelihood that she will get pregnant at some point in that 10 years. That is almost 1 in 5 women. That is not an insignificant proportion.",1501545789

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","Rule of thumb: if it was mounted on wheels and not man-portable, it was considered artillery. So yeah, gatlings were artillery all right. 

And volume of fire was definitely part of the picture. There's a reason infantry lines didn't last very long once rapid-firing infantry weapons came onto the scene. Musket drill was pushing it as it was, the proverbial 3 shots a second is a lot of bullets in the air going in the general direction of the Other Guy who in theory is also sending a similar volume of fire in your general direction... 

When you figure in true automatic weapons like the Maxim and bolt-action firearms, it gets even less sustainable to have infantry lined up in formation on open fields. Worse when you get into semi- and full-automatic rifles like the Garand and the StG-44... 

That's why I suspect the image, if translated into 40K, would be more suitable with a lasgun and a larger shield. Crouch or kneel, support shield on the ground or the knee-pad, prop lasgun up on the firing slot, there wouldn't be much exposed body to hit. ",1501545789

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My dad was in an accident and was in the hospital, presumably on his death bed. I was with a high school boyfriend when I found out, and he drove me to the hospital. We'd been dating about a month at that point, so he hadn't met my dad and didn't know my family that well. I thanked him for the ride and support, but told him I'd rather be alone with my family at the moment. 

Which was apparently the wrong answer. The douche wouldn't let me get out of the car, he kept me in the car arguing for about 15 minutes about how I was being selfish and wasn't considering his feelings, because it would tear him up inside to not go into the hospital with me. Then he accused me of wanting to go in alone so that I could call my ex. Why was I being so heartless?

My dad pulled through and it's been at least a decade. That should have been a huge red flag that he was a manipulative douchebag, but at the time I was so upset about my dad that it didn't really even register how horrible my boyfriend was being. ",1501545789

"college","t5_2qh3z","Are you the type of person who just wears the jeans and t-shirts to class every day? Are you going to need to dress up? Do you live close to home? All of these questions are important to consider when you're packing your clothes for college.

If you just plan on wearing jeans and tees just bring enough clothes for about 2 weeks and plan to do laundry every week to week and half. 

If you need dressy clothes, then you may have to bring more to avoid doing laundry. 

Living close to home means that you can leave the heavier winter clothes at home except for one or two for those freak cold days. If you live extremely close to home you can even swap out clothes regularly to make your wardrobe full of variety. 

I brought my whole wardrobe when I moved because I was going across the country and moving out to an apartment after my time in the dorms, and I ended up wearing the same 10 or so shirts and two pairs of jeans most of the time because of the casual nature of my college. Now all my other stuff is at my dads house instead and I'm back in the dorms with a suitcase full of clothes for the semester and anything I need I either ask him to bring to get when I go up to his house. 

As for shoes, you probably only need a few pairs: everyday sneakers or shoes, dressy shoes, boots, and exercise shoes. I like to go with neutral colors so they match with nearly everything.  

2 towels is a good idea so you can wash one and then have a clean one in case you start laundry and then shower or go swimming and need a spare towel.

The Iron islands have always had the best fleet, by a mile, few other houses have the need to dedicate many resources to it. The Iron islands also didn't start from zero, as Yara didn't take all of their ships to begin with so they'd have had at least a couple hundred to begin with. On top of that we're talking about a nation of fucking sea pirates, people who literally make their living stealing ships, but apparently it's a real jump in logic to guess that they, being pirates, pirated ships. So the actual amount of ships they'd have needed to build from scratch would have been a couple of hundred at most which isn't that out of line for a country literally built on the back of it's ship building industry, especially when they can steal wood from the mainland without much concern on reprisal since the other houses are more busy with other things.

I am too tired (it's night here, Europe) and can't give a good reply tonight. However, I want to pinpoint that there are different types of private property.

1. personal belongings, an extension of you. Your tools etc.    
2. land property and with buildings, estate property.    
3. ""intellectual property"", i.e. artificial scarcity.    

Regarding \#1 I know no left libertarian who denies this kind of property.

Regarding \#2 I think there are many left libertarians who do not believe in owning land, but there may be many that actually do.

Regarding \#3 I have not met anyone who denote themselves left libertarian and believe in ""intellectual property"". I have also met right libertarians who do not believe in ""intellectual property"". Remember the Pirate Party, they do not believe in ""intellectual property"" and is a mix of many left libertarians and some right libertarians.

For my own I do believe in \#1, I have hard to accept \#2 and I totally reject \#3.

I'm even working on a business model which has as goal to totally abolish the concept of ""intellectual property"" or ""artificial scarcity"". A purely left libertarian Pareto superior business model which has as goal to free technology, to no longer be limited by artificial scarcity.",1501545792

"linux","t5_2qh1a","There are a lot of answers but I'll try to give a very eli5 perspective on this:

Linux is both the name of the kernel and the colloquial name people use to refer to the whole OS.

It's called GNU/Linux because it's the Linux kernel surrounded by a plethora of programs called GNU.

GNU is a set of tools made by the Free Software Foundation. They wanted to do an OS no their own but lacked the kernel and thus chose to use Linux.

In reality, every linux program is a swarm of separated projects that function more or less on their own. So, technically, you can create your own SO by using, for example, your own Linux kernel (or even another kernel like BSD or Solaris, but that wouldn't be ""Linux"" anymore), Clang, Uclibc and NextStep tools.

However, that demands an enourmous amount of work in practice. So some people and organizations take care of the work and create their own ""Distributions"". That means, they choose to use a specific set of tools and leave the finished ""package"" to you, so you don't bother on thinking what init system or C library you should use. They arrange a set of tools and do specialized support for those. You get a simplified set of tools (like package managers with dependency management), a community, a bugtracker and even commercial assistance if you're willing to pay for it.

So, even if you're a power user and manage to install KDE, Gnome or even Wayland on your own, there's a whole other degree of ""freedom"" below. A very, very expensive (in terms of manpower) degree of freedom.

You CAN go beyond distros and install GNU/Linux by going to the Linux From Scratch website. But, unless you aspire to get into distribution management, you'll quickly see how much work it demands to create a working installation. That's why most of us simply choose a distro that works best on our own personal interest and style.",1501545793

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","it was science class so instead of desks we had these long tables with a metal sheet across the front that covered everything except the bottom of your calves and your shoes. also we sat in the back so he felt as though he could freely touch himself as though I wasn't sitting within a foot of him. these tables were usually where you'd finger your girlfriend in study hall, but he abused their power.

I tried to change seats because this seating arrangement lead to constantly being partnered up with him, but unfortunately I was way too uncomfortable to tell the teacher ""hey this dude won't stop choking the chicken please tell him to stop"" so I would literally just face away from him and pretend to have no clue what was going on. I had a mentality like *okay, he's not finishing, there is no bust crust at the bottom of this table, he's not molesting me or anything maybe he just has problems and it'll pass* I just felt like if I ignored it he'd get that I fucking hate him and that it was weird, so he'd stop. 

then eventually he sent me an unsolicited dick pic because of the fact that I never said anything or told on him (apparently every other girl he sat next to in other classes had), even though I never showed interest in him whatsoever. I ended up telling my two guy friends and they basically beat the shit out of him and berated him into keeping that shit an at home thing only.

EDIT: we also had a girl who did it, but for her it wasn't directed at anyone. like she masturbated through the Odyssey for example. it was still super awkward but less creepy, and someone just ended up telling her everyone was talking about it and she stopped. ",1501545793

Title: **How much should I tell my employer about a marijuana misdemeanor?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I'll go chronologically.
&gt; I've been arrested 3 times previously and right now have 2 misdemeanors, a Class B and a Class C.
&gt; 
&gt; My last, other, arrest, was in December 2016. Also Class B, possession of marijuana under 2 oz. I just went to court July 2017 and got deferred adjudication.
&gt; 
&gt; I got hired three weeks ago with a start date of August. 7th. They said just a background check and paperwork were left. Today I got an email that said, essentially, they saw it was an open case, can they get any paperwork from the court visit, and a letter of explanation on what happened.
&gt; 
&gt; What do I say? I want to just say, here's the information from the court visit (scan and email the big legal paper), I got deferred adjudication, sorry, I didn't think it was a big deal?
&gt; 
&gt; Or am I supposed to actually explain what happened? Because ""getting caught with weed after work"" doesn't sound so hot either, but I don't want to lie and say it was someone else's, especially considering my history.

"Documentaries","t5_2qhlh","&gt; First off, not everyone becomes addicted, and not everyone doesn't. The issue with your comment is the usual druggie bullshit that you're careful and you respect the drug so you'll be ok. Every addict starts off that way. Every single one says they don't and won't have a problem.

Would you say that to someone drinking alcohol for the first time, or betting on the races, or any other addictive behaviour? Because it applies to those as well.

&gt; Second, and perhaps more importantly your addiction or lack thereof is actually irrelevant. People smoke pot to get high, there's no such things as just having a single drag with dinner or socially. You smoke to experience the psychological effects of the drug.

Alcohol makes you more relaxed and talkative, a _psychological effect_ of the drug. Besides, cannabis at lower doses can also be used in a social context.

&gt; If you do this every day or even most days, you will fuck up your life. The same way you would if you got drunk every day, or did anything else which intoxicated you for a large percentage of your life, regardless of whether you're actually addicted or not. It literally doesn't matter whether you can stop if you never choose to do so.

Guess what, most people **don't** smoke every day, or even most days. Most people I knew who did it had a few joints on the weekend (and not always every weekend), that was it, and they were fine! 

&gt; OP missed out on his life. He did this because he was too busy getting high to actually live it. Given how quickly you dove to the defence of marijuana I'd almost guarantee you've done this too.

Actually, I haven't smoked pot for 5 years. I haven't drunk significant amounts of alcohol in a decade. I've never smoked tobacco. I'm as clean as they come, but I respect what others want to do to enjoy themselves.

"BPDlovedones","t5_33dd6","You said this in one of your comments: 
&gt; 
&gt; On the topic of controlling her violence, she certainly can't control it towards me, or family loved ones from the past. She wouldn't dare touch anyone else though.


So what that means is she knows that she HAS to control it in other places and situations.  Or get arrested for assault.  She is doing this ""can't control it"" stuff where she can get away with it.  She IS CONTROLLING her outbursts by only having them in selected locations. 

 She is using the threats of self-harm to control you.  That is so manipulative.  This is causing damage to you.  

What you can do:  Ask at your local police station what to do.  
Or, Get a friend or several to help you, so you are not alone.  Change your locks and keep the keys on your person, where they can't be taken, like a chain around your neck. If you don't have deadbolts and cameras, get them.  Gather up what is hers and either bring it to her place and leave it with someone or in a safe place she can get it, and do it while she is at work, then tape a note [keep a copy] to her door explaining that you are done and that she is not welcome to come to your place again, ever.   Do all of this on the same day, and keep friends with you for witnesses. 
If she comes over, do not open the door, just call the police and report the possibility of abuse if you open the door. 
 

Don't hide that you are afraid of her behavior or that these things happened in the past.  If you have bruises, photo them.  Silence only helps the abusers, and she is being abusive.

If you could, stay with someone else for a week or two.  And park close to anywhere you go or have people walk with you to your car.  Do all the security stuff, even if it feels dumb.  She is already violent, her escalation could be very dangerous. 

If she threatens suicide, always always call 911 and tell them and that this is not the first time. If she is bluffing, she won't want to be inconvenienced by a trip to the hospital and if she isn't, she will be getting help she really needs.   
You can't give her what she needs.  She needs professional help, lots of it.

As a kid, my parents would send me to science camps, which are a huge thing in California. It's often a school trip but there are fully recreational ones as well. They're set in woods where kids learn about science, environmental awareness, and cultivate an appreciation for nature. They often provide fun activities to keep kids busy, and nowadays a lot of them take phones away until the END of camp.

Road trips and adventures were a big thing for me too. I still continue these habits though I either go alone or with friends. My dad would drive to a random city with me and my sibling and we would walk around to find neat things unique to that particular area. Ended up distracted for hours by all the interesting sights. 

Just last week I took some close friends with me to go on a 10+ mile hike with elevation gain of ~2,000 ft but there was no signal. We ended up chatting about personal topics, ate lots of healthy snacks, and even played in the waterfalls. By the time we got to the car we completely forgot about our phones and just hit up a retro diner for jukebox tunes, burgers, and malts. 

I do have problems with going on my phone too much, but I dislike it so I try to keep myself tethered to the physical world by just going off the grid every now and then and surround myself with people who keep me busy and laughing. ",1501545795

Had he not, Ulfric would have had cause to call a new moot and a new vote for High King. ""

Go ask Torygg mage, the vampire woman about it, she knows a lot of shit. Torygg may have given him the throne, he have always respected uflric and ulfrics knows that. He have always listened to ulfric, every time ulfric visits he listened to him. She said and I still recall after all this time ""if he wanted to declare independence. Torygg may have backed him."" 

You can even talk to him ""When Ulfric Stormcloak, with savage Shout, sent me here, my sole regret was fair Elisif, left forlorn and weeping. I faced him fearlessly - my fate inescapable, yet my honor is unstained - can Ulfric say the same?"" 

Ulfric fought a man he knows he can easily kill, a man who have trusted him and respected and held him highly, knowing he can't say no and he is sleeps soundly every fucking night not giving a flying fuck.

Go ahead and give me any fucking hint in the game that he is a good man, I have played this game for 5 years and not removed it from my pc, I have talked with every npc a 100 times, read every book and there is nothing redeeming abut ulfric whatsoever except that his voice is cool and he kind of gives a shit about his nords. And you have yet had any good counter argument that anything I said. Except Aldin eating ghosts or some kind of shit, and shit that doesn't matter like levels.

Edgeworth being tied up and having to defend himself right off the bat was definitely entertaining. Franziska's appearance was welcome as well.

REITs have been excluded from the income trust tax legislation passed in the 2007 budget by the Conservative government. Many Canadian REITs have limited liability.[55] On December 16, 2010, the Department of Finance proposed amendments to the rules defining “Qualifying REITs” for Canadian tax purposes. As a result, “Qualifying REITs” are exempt from the new entity-level, “specified investment flow-through” (SIFT) tax that all publicly traded income trusts and partnerships are paying as of January 1, 2011.

So, I've been the customer in a situation like this. Kind of. At least, this story reminded me of this story.

I had gotten a bunch of clothes from a department store. The next morning, I went to put on one of the new shirts, and a button just popped off while buttoning it. I couldn't find the dark button anywhere on the dark carpet to just fix it myself, so I resigned myself to going back to the store to exchange it. Once there, with replacement and missing-button-shirt in hand, I got up to the register manned by the very same gentleman who rung me out the day before.

As he went down the receipt, he looked confused, then started at the top and went down again. And, then again. I started getting concerned that I grabbed the wrong receipt despite it being the only receipt I could grab.

Sales Associate: ""I'm afraid I didn't actually ring this shirt up, so I can't actually do an exchange.""

Now, having worked retail, I understand these are human beings behind the counter. 

Me: ""YOU LET ME STEAL?! Well, I'd like to buy the shirt without the missing button, please.""

That was what I was getting at. ""Marxism"" is not a political system or ideology. Das Kapital is not a guide for a future government, it's a complex and groundbreaking analysis of the capitalist mode of production. It's still taught and read by economists who disagree with a completely socialist conception of the economy, because there are some incredibly valuable observations and ideas that Marx made and created.

Socialist literature is complex and prolific. One of the main problems is that, through propaganda and years of having their heads beaten with it, many Americans make the following equivalencies:

Marx = Marxism = Socialism = USSR/China/North Korea  = Autocratism = Pol Pot/Stalin/Kim Il Sun/Even Hitler.

Youre too eager in wishing for war... There's no war coming mate. 

Both SDF and SAA realise that if they fight each other, Syria will completely depend on the sponsor of the side that won. Neither want that, you'd think. Besides, SDF is communalist, remember? Good luck getting Hakasah militias to fight the government for no reason other than the US wants it.",1501545801

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","yeah, you got it. AHA's are great for preventing wrinkles and fine lines, whereas BHA's gear more toward deep cleaning and minimizing your pores.

i'm an oily skin type and i use both now. i started with AHA's and i actually JUST finished applying my BHA product for the first time 30 minutes ago. AHA's are definitely hydrating and i can already see a couple fine lines i have where i tend to furrow my brows start to disappear a bit. it also made my skin suuuper smooth. i had never chemically exfoliated before so it was definitely a nice surprise after starting my AHA regime. however, what the BHA just did to my skin is incomparable. my skin is like a baby's ass right now, i've never felt it this soft in my life. there are pores that have disappeared in one use that i've had since i was 12 years old (21 now). the sebaceous filaments that i've dealt with all my life and had basically given up on, gone. completely gone. blackheads are totally minimized as well. i'm in awe right now.

overall, BHA's are definitely for me since i have oily skin, but i'm going to continue use of AHA's for the anti-aging properties.",1501545801

Your parents look like saints to their acquaintances and friends because they are working SO HARD to help their sons.  I wouldn't be surprised if they spin it as that the brothers are just victims of some situation, and never actually did anything wrong.  That kind of validation is like catnip to some people.  You complaining to them about needing some space doesn't buy them attention and sympathy from anyone, so they do not want to hear it.

I moved away from a narcissistic relative, and the freedom and lack of stress was amazing.  After her terrible parenting, it felt really good to just be too far away for her to see my children very often.

Opportunities for money making abound in financial investing and various online services. RNA and DNA printing instructions can be sent to labs to be completed in a matter of days. Remote fabrication and manufacturing jobs are easy to execute. 

Plus there is no reason to assume that the actor is bad, like North Korea bad.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","- The AM has sunscreen in it and the PM doesn't. (I think it's better to use a separate moisturizer and sunscreen, so in the morning I use CeraVe PM and a Biore sunscreen or Skin Aqua sunscreen.  
- I read that Cerave ""in the tub"" is the only one that works for people with fungal acne--it doesn't have any ingredients that feed the fungus, basically.  
- Cerave PM has niacinamide, which can help fade PIH spots. I have some years-old ones that I don't think it is affecting, though. Sounds like it can take half a year or so, though, so I could be wrong!  
- The moisturizing lotion and CeraVe in a tub sound like they thicker than CeraVe PM.  
Anything in a tub/jar is less sanitary than anything in a pump bottle if you dip your fingers in (a mini spatula helps, though!).  It sounds like you can get a pump cap for that CeraVe tub, though.  
- It sounds like some people break out from one of the CeraVe products but not others, but it sounds like it totally varies which one.  
- Here are some links that include some comparisons:

The lyrics, like in a lot of songs on this album, don't seem like they're meant to be taken too seriously. More than anything else, it's a musically atypical take on a typical pop-song about love and escape. 

Chemistry is genuinely a mess and a failure, I think, but I like the Infinite Content songs way more than it seems most people in his sub do. I think the idea behind them could've been a little more fleshed out but it seems to me like the point is to say 'look we can do punk; we can do something alt-countryish; we can put them both in the middle of a dance record even. Genre doesn't matter because it's all just content produced with the goal of keeping the listener infinitely content.'

Maybe I'm over analyzing, but that's the impression I've gotten so far.

If you want a plethora of 3rd party lenses, then get a Canikon or Sony Mirrorless. 

Let's take Canon for example. Say you invested in their APS-C system with the 70d &amp; you have a lot of EF-S lenses. Now you decide to move up to the 5D mk IV. You can't use the EF-S lenses on the FF Canons. You are stuck having to buy all new lenses. With the K-1 however, you can use any pentax lens made in the last 45+ years. FF, APS-C, film lenses even screw mount lenses. And Sigma, Tamron, Tokina etc... Made plenty of pentax mount lenses over time. Many of these are equal to some of the best lenses available today, at a fraction of the price. 

The current crop of Pentax FF lenses are priced close to the counterparts (L glass from Canon, Sony etc...).

"medicalschool","t5_2re2p","Here's what I did:   
  
- During orientation week, introduce yourself to everyone. You have to meet every single person during orientation, because afterwards smaller friend groups form and people go in hiding to study. Any time you see someone you haven't met yet, approach them, shake their hand, and introduce yourself. Everyone is waiting to be approached, so don't be nervous. I'm an introvert but I made myself do this.  
  
- Say hello in passing to everyone you see, all the time. Sometimes people are too busy or don't know each other well enough for a simple hello in the hallway. Make eye contact, smile, say ""hey"", and move on.  
  
- Friend everyone on FB if that's your thing  
  
- Go to every class social function. Don't skip something to study if everyone is going. The work is constant. You have to take breaks sometimes.   
  
- Get people's phone numbers if you feel like you're getting to know them better. Text them asking for study help, group study sessions, just to hang out, etc.  
   
- Throw a party and invite the entire class if you have the space. Even if it's not inviting everyone, organize social things and invite people to stuff. When you invite people to things, you get invites in return.  
   
- Join clubs and extracurriculars  
  
- Understand that cliques are going to happen, and it's not even a negative thing. You can't hang out with everyone every day, and you can't be good friends with everyone. What you can do is learn everyone's name at the very beginning, stay at least surface-level friendly when you see people around, and see who you become closer friends with as time goes on. I'm really glad I had this attitude. I know everyone in my class, could probably have a short conversation with anyone I see. In contrast, people who didn't try as hard as I did get to M3/M4 and have classmates on their rotations that they've never even met before. Good luck and have fun!",1501545808

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","It's tough.  I work in New York around a lot of Hasidim Jews walking around in the fucking yinkles and [George's hat from Seinfeld](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_feKCUOgjz_M/TPgFAxEUSZI/AAAAAAAACV8/47Ymot8qpsM/s1600/George_Costanza_Hat.jpg) and Bela Lugosi capes and shopping carts full of cans and whatnot.  They often give me that old fashioned crossing-one-arm-over-one-fist and clicking their teeth at me when I swerve to avoid them when they're just walking in the street.  

I try very, very hard not to be an outright antisemite when I'm literally surrounded by the worst of the Jewish stereotype all the time.  And yes, as an independent contractor they fuck me on money.  *A lot.*  It's like pulling teeth, I often have to threaten suit to get money legit owed.  It puts the whole ""Jews controlling da money"" thing right in my face all the time just collecting my pay.

It takes a great deal of patience and tolerance in my heart to accept that not all of these people view me and the rest of ""goyim"" as scum.  That they don't view my existence as somehow less than their own.  The deeply religious Jews I interact with are extremely antagonistic and unpleasant right out the gate.  I literally had this Hasidim in the full getup stop me outside Walmart late at night and go ""yo, are you Jewish?""  When I said no he shoved me aside with one hand and kept walking.  I would put my hand on whatever document you wish and swear whatever you like this is true.  Like, sorry for not being one of the Chosen, Heimish.  But I'm sure I'm an antisemite just for reporting that story.

I don't think people should hate Jews despite all this.  I just don't think hate solves anything or makes the world a better place.  I deal with a lot of deeply religious ones that happily embody the stereotype in a concentrated area so my experience is different than the average person with probably a few very nice, barely-practicing Jewish friends they barely know are Jewish.  I saw a guy jogging with a yarmulke that had a goddamn Nike swish on it the other day.  God-*DAMN* it...

You could if you weren't a blatant homer and actually watched basketball with a hint of objectivity

Why are we giving Wall this free pass over him being lazy? CP3 is a better defender because 1) he is one and 2) he actually tries

&gt;He the better finisher, more athletic, faster on the break, stronger, and has about 5"" on CP3.

So 2 of those is about athleticism despite the fact that I said ""besides athleticism""

And one is a physical trait which means nothing if you can't translate that into better defense

At first I went ""Wow, how did I miss the other people in the previous picture?"" Then I realised they simply were edited out :P

In both case, these are very great pictures the both of them! I stumbled upon it like that, but it's hauntingly beautiful. I like the almost geometry of it all. The effect of a lighter water composition in the bottom, and a harder heavier set of boulders at the top. Then and the almost straight borders between it, the shadow of the rock, and the rest of the water, in diagonals. And the fact the waterfall, the girlfriend, and the submerged/vs emerged rocks at the bottom form some sort of second diagonal as well.

I'd totally see that picture used for tourism ads, as it does a good job selling a dream of a relaxed time in a exotic and sunny setting (coming from someone living where the water is freezing and always looks brown)",1501545811

We can only go forward and hope that it doesn't happen again. That's my mentality.

Its an utterly stupid move, and anyone with a hint of twitch knowledge would be retarded to implement it. Secondly daybreak has stated stream sniping is against their TOS. [Here is the link](https://www.h1z1.com/king-of-the-kill/news/h1z1-producers-letter-august5) confirming that. Do you have a problem with streamers wanting players to follow the TOS?

Diamond Dogs is the weird terrorist group in V like Foxhound and Dead Cell this is why the Skulls are just empty shells to act as boss fights lacking the personality of the previous games enemies. You're not really playing as the good guys here at all but from  the perspective of the player (and the DD team) what you're doing is justified mainly because we (most of us) understand the consequences of what's to come in the rest of the MGS series.

simple solution: 
- if over the age of 18 have an ID with you, should you be asked
- if under the age of 18 have a guardian / parent with you that's over the age of 21.

No where in this policy is it say ""no blacks allowed 4p - 9p"" and the ones at are outraged at this policy are typically the ones that ironically forced it into creation, so if it applies; congratulations you played yourself.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","I was pretty against PETA before I was vegan and I'm still not the biggest fan.

A lot of the stuff they do sounds horrible when framed a certain way to normal people, such as the mass euthanasia of animals. As with all orgnaizations, there are some more radical parts of it than others, but generally speaking, euthanizing an animal is a sure-fire way to prevent it's suffering due to overcrowding, starvation, medical problems etc. As vegans the idea that life isn't inherently meaningful, but that it should not be a life of suffering if possible, makes this concept a little easier to understand beyond the knee-jerk DOG KILLER reaction.

It still makes me uneasy but it's not the holocaust I thought it was as an omni a few years ago.

They have also funded legal defenses for animal rights ""terrorists""? You'd really have to look into this yourself to see how you feel about it.

On top of that, they do use a lot of shock tactics, and we're still not sure how well that works. It could be a lot easier to dismiss a bunch of screeching people covered in blood telling you meat is murder than a rational conversation, but then that shock value may open you up to a discussion. 

Basically PETA is trying to do something good but they aren't perfect and use a lot of tactics many people, vegans and non-vegans alike, may not agree with. 

There's no one way to view them really. You'll have to look into these things yourself and see how you feel about it. ",1501545823

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Well of course you can control 'suffering' if you specifically define it as a controllable thing, but that's not at all what everyone else means when they talk about suffering.

Suffering is often discussed as a response to pain - not pain itself.

&gt;When someone experiences physical pain from bone cancer, they are suffering.

That isn't necessarily true.  Again, suffering can be a [response to](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/some-assembly-required/201401/pain-is-inevitable-suffering-is-optional) pain.  You can have pain without suffering.

&gt;Do you have an answer to what the poster actually said? Does your religion offer actual practical solutions to the suffering (physical pain and emotional anguish caused by cancers, tsunamis. etc) that humans must endure?

All religions address suffering and many people come to religion in times of disaster for that reason.

#Are you shadowbanned?

If you are a bot, give up and go home now.

If you think you are shadowbanned sitewide, then you got problems .  You can check if you are shadowbanned by logging out and visiting your user page to see if you get a no page found error !!! If you do then holy smoke.
 
If you are not shadowbanned but are seeing your posts and comments removed then it could be one of the following:

*  Maybe you are posting a banned domain such as those used by pedophiles.

*  Maybe you annoyed a reddit moderator by  not sharing their political and gender critical views.   A good place to visit is /r/unban to show that you are humble and appogise.  This doesn't solve the problem with the moderator but it is a good place to start

*  Sometimes for new accounts, low karma is a problem but that is only because of moderators making it a problem. There are subreddits like /r/free_karma and /r/aww that are not designed to help you pass restrictions on other subreddits but can help you get higher karma.

*  Another option is  https://www.reddit.com/prefs/deactivate/ .  You can always make another account or not.

"forwardsfromgrandma","t5_2t776","&gt;The cities are higher income, but also higher population. As I said before, there are lots of low income people in urban areas. It isn't right to disenfranchise them in favor of low income rural voters. Both should have a say in what goes on. There are more low income voters in urban areas by virtue of their being more people total.  

And we shouldn't disenfranchise rural voters in favor of low income urban voters either. Again you mention ""low income rural voters"" while also claiming to want low income people to have more power. You need to decide which narrative you're pushing now. Does low income matter or not. Because the system you are advocating here (where regardless of income or location everyone has equal voting power) is only possible with what I'm saying. You can't have it both ways. 

&gt;The rich are only beholden to the people with money. Like you said, you can only control them if you can stop giving them money. If you didn't have any money to give them in the first place, you're powerless. But everyone has a vote. Not everyone's vote is equal, unfortunately, but taking what power that vote does have away is not the answer.  

You're clearly confused about what I'm saying. At no point have I suggested taking away power from any voters. In fact, I've only suggested increasing the voting power of each voter. Somehow you've arrived at the conclusion that right now each voter only has about 50% voting power, and that in order to increase it, we need to give the rich and powerful *more* power so that they will give it to the poor people. I'm suggesting just giving it straight to the people with no middleman, and you're acting like your system is somehow better. 


&gt;You're looking at the whole thing as ""centralized government"" vs. ""decentralized government"" as though you have to choose one for every issue or the other for every issue. That's not how it should work. The federal government should make sure that everyone's human rights are upheld, and that we all have the basics for survival. The states should decide on things aside from that which affect the constituents of their state, and no one else. There needs to be a mix.  

Human rights: life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness. This is the purpose of the federal government as is written in the constitution. You made up the basics for survival part, as that doesn't appear in our constitution. Everything else should be states rights, as is written in the bill of rights. 

There really doesn't need to be a mix. It makes no sense to mix things. Why you want to put power over your life in someone else's hands is beyond me, especially when it comes to something that this person would have no knowledge of and will never be affected by. 

&gt;And as I said before, we need to take the political power away from the wealthy. That's step one into getting any sort of reasonable system.  

And yet here you are, advocating giving them more power. Strange times we live in. 

&gt;They do, but a smaller government election can't do anything about the environment.   

Besides the fact that you're just wrong (if there are 10 people working for a company and they all decide to recycle but the CEO says the company doesn't recycle but the 10 people do it anyway, then paper is getting recycled), isn't it strange that you feel that the federal government has that much power, and local governments have so little? Shouldn't 300 million people have more political power than 500~? I'm not sure why you're okay with that system being how it works. 

&gt;Any issue that involves tragedy of the commons works that way.  

The tragedy of the commons is just something the communists made up to justify communism. Capitalism solved the tragedy of the commons by eliminating the ""commons"" and splitting it into private property. Problem solved. 

Edit: &gt;as for the ""government should pay for you to escape things you don't like"", you would literally pay people to move so they could have sex with children in places the age of consent is lower? You would pay for people to move to places they could get assault rifles with extended magazines? Or are you more likely saying you want the government to pay for liberals to leave republican cities?

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","A few relatively smaller cities that are still fun that come to mind are Omaha, NE and Madison, WI.  If you're a bit of a calmer guy you might like Green Bay, WI, Des Moines, IA, or Toledo, OH.  Although they all still have nightlife too, just not as much.

Omaha is a bit bigger than the rest.

Madison is much more of a party city.  Lots of college students and people in their 20s.

I can't speak for Boise, ID, but it sounds like it would fit the bill and be closer to your family if that's important.  I've also heard good things of bolder, CO, and it's in your size range.

Any of these cities will get all 4 seasons, just think would you rather have a little more summer in Omaha or Des Moines, or a little more winter in Madison or Green Bay.  Toledo is probably somewhere in between.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F or W, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or #anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/chicagor4r/submit?sidebar&amp;amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting #again.

Just as I had apprehension about, he would let Cenk off the hook on many occasion because he is arguing from a basic bitch conservative stance rather than a principled libertarian or at least principled capitalist stance.

Cenk says ""Capitalism is great for shoes but healthcare is too important.""

Ben goes on to defend healthcare. What a better capitalist advocate would have done is stop him right there and ask ""Why Cenk? Why is capitalism great for shoes? Why would capitalism be the best system for universally providing high quality and low cost shoes but not other things?""

That would be checkmate.

Its a question Cenk cant answer. The only answer is that the only difference between the two is that shoes practically 100% unregulated and healthcare is all but controlled by the state. Thats why capitalism works for shoes but not healthcare. Because we have capitalism with shoes but socialism with healthcare.

Debating is like poker, the goal is to make your opponent go all in on a hand in which you have the nut (the best hand possible for any player at the time).

Cenk gave Ben this option many times in the debate and Ben fumbled. Problem is Ben is a neo-con. As much as I like Ben, he doesn't understand lassie-farrie capitalism the same way an AnCap or an Austrian Economist does.

Cenk needs to debate Molyneux or Peter Schiff. THAT would be a bloodbath.",1501545826

"MassEffectAndromeda","t5_38p25","Yeah man, couldn't agree more. There was no darkness to the story, no sense of the stakes which couldn't be any higher. There was no despair, no bleakness. A story like this lends itself to deep and universal drama, precisely because of the extremely dark situation. They're fighting for survival, just like in the reaper invasion, but in the dialogue and the voice acting that drama, that is so unbelievably easily exploitable because it should be self evident and there by default, just isn't there. It's all just bland variations of lines like 'Don't fail' and 'We're all counting on you'. And in between are characters who seem so impervious to the dark and bleak situation as to be without any humanity at all. Melodrama relative to darkness, I mean *real* darkness like should be present in a story like this, is almost always remarkably compelling. There should've been more squalor, more adversity, more *desperation*, to the game world. And the Angara should've been seen by the initiative as something of a godsend, and that would've made their ambivalence toward the initiative make much more sense and, again, would've made for some more killer drama. 

This game fails miserably in the writing and the ambient world shirking its own true darkness. It seems like they tried to make a game that also kids and casual gamers would enjoy, but that's not why we play mass effect. Building up to the reaper war; discovering the reapers, the council abdicating responsibility in that threat, and then the threat manifested and resulted in a giant galactic interspecies unification campaign to defend all life...I mean fuck dude, that's some appropriately heavy shit. The epic nature alone cornered them into dark melodrama, remember the piano in 3? The dream sequence of the murdered child that couldn't be saved? *Darkness*. Dope, bitchin, *dramatic darkness*. 

It was the writing and the acting. Not the filler elements, not the fucked graphics. It was lazy writing. 

Sorry if this seems long, but I feel really, REALLY, strongly about this kind of story.

Many people may not realize it, but the Medicare program is one of the largest single payers of health care in the U.S. and in the world.

Anna is the 5th and youngest daughter of a wealth rum baron. Since she was far off from inheriting any of the company she was often left with little supervision and consequently spent a long time with her sailor uncle. During their times together he often told her wildly exaggerated tales of pirates and adventure, to which coupled with her noble upbringing led her to have a very strange view on  what pirates actually were. When she turned 26 she convinced her father (he's giving up on marring her off at this point due to her brash and boisterous nature) to let her join aboard one of his ships and set off for her grand adventure.

The ArmaLite AR-15 is a selective-fire, 5.56×45mm, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed rifle, with a rotating bolt and straight-line recoil design. It was designed by Eugene Stoner and it is based on the Armalite AR-10 rifle. The AR-15 was designed above all else to be a lightweight assault rifle, and to fire a new lightweight, high-velocity small caliber cartridge to allow the infantrymen to carry more ammunition.

In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt due to financial difficulties.

I have put quite a bit of effort into finding more information on this lighter and have come up empty handed. I have been able to find maybe 15 other Edinex lighters but none that have the ""curved"" top cap (not sure what to call it - it's the piece that flips up when you want to produce a flame) or the strange faux-turtle shell exterior. I put in a fresh flint and butane and it works like a charm. Does anyone have any information at all about this thing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Closing the door, restricts people from coming in but also means bad people cannot come in.

If the playstore itself has somewhat frequent malware attacks, sideloading is only gotta be worse.

It's not like all we have to go on is their word; they've almost doubled the Java Edition dev team's size in the past year and the team is working on tons of engine improvements to make the game more extensible for future updates. They're not going to hire people onto a team to work on an edition they want to get rid of, let alone having them spend months of paid time working on improving that edition (thus making it **more** appealing than it already is, which they wouldn't do if they want to try to silently smother it). Even Jeb has said outright that **if** it were to be officially discontinued he couldn't see it happening until a number of years from now.

I've found that this not only skips most of the negatives, but it also helps expedite the process and get into ketosis a lot sooner.

It didn't ""confirm"" it.  It provided evidence to support it.

&gt;A green apple does not prove that all non-black things are not ravens.

Of course not.  ""Proving"" a thing is something else, and has never even been under consideration here.  The Raven Paradox argument doesn't even pretend to address ""proving"" anything - it's about evidence that supports propositions.

&gt;If it did not confirm it, then how is it evidence?

It's not necessary for a thing to confirm a proposition in order to be counted as evidence for it - it's only necessary that it support it.

For example - you trip and fall and twist your knee, and it hurts a lot and won't bear your weight.  So you go see a doctor who does a CT scan and discovers that you tore a ligament.  

The pain and weakness of your knee was *evidence* that you tore a ligament, but the CT scan *confirmed* it.

The ArmaLite AR-15 is a selective-fire, 5.56×45mm, air-cooled, gas-operated, magazine-fed rifle, with a rotating bolt and straight-line recoil design. It was designed by Eugene Stoner and it is based on the Armalite AR-10 rifle. The AR-15 was designed above all else to be a lightweight assault rifle, and to fire a new lightweight, high-velocity small caliber cartridge to allow the infantrymen to carry more ammunition.

In 1959, ArmaLite sold its rights to the AR-10 and AR-15 to Colt due to financial difficulties.

They also uproot native plants and eat native fish eggs.

Carp themselves are not ""bad"" fish or anything. It's just a fish doing what is in it's nature to do. It just so happens that by doing that, it changes it's environment and has a negative impact on native species.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Impeachment *is* a political act - it is the political remedy for a President's criminal activity. You cannot impeach the President merely for being a bad President, or disagreeing with him politically - and the framers were deliberate about how they phrased the clause on impeachable offenses.

https://www.lawfareblog.com/impeachable-offense

Initially, it was proposed that impeachment only be carried out for treason and bribery. It was moved at the constitutional convention that this clause be amended to include ""maladministration."" That wording was struck as being too broad and essentially making the President serve at the pleasure of congress. ""High crimes and misdemeanors"" was adopted instead. This implies that there must be some motivation for the impeachment other than a political disagreement, however unpopular politically the president may be.

While it is conceivable that a legal act may be impeachable (in the linked article, the author uses the example of the President moving to Saudi Arabia, taking 4 different wives and trying to govern from abroad) - the extremity that any legal-but-impeachable act would need to reach makes it basically impossible to arise in the real world. And given the already politically charged nature of an impeachment proceeding, congress is on a much stronger and more comfortable and more supportable footing if the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" they litigate are also ordinary crimes.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Blanket response for all 3 sub comments: I'm arguing from a philosophical stand point, i'm not trying to say that what happened isn't horrible. I am saying as we go through this process where we allow people who make dumb decisions (this wasn't her decision so obviously she shouldn't be held responsible) to be free of consequences when does it end.

So one comment mentioned the government stripping your organs to help someone. That is the government telling you to give up something you have no control over, probably 999,999 out of 1,000,000 times you have control over your ability to put on a condom. People saying sentencing people? How am I sentencing them, they fucking made the decision to have sex (again 999,999 out of 1,000,000) shouldn't they be responsible enough to live with the consequence of their decision.

e.g. Lets say I punch someone in the face, and i dont realize they have a condition and the punch causes them to die. I now have a legal consequence to that action where I will be charged with Involuntary manslaughter and face 12-16 months in prison (state depending possibly longer). I'm driving after a few drinks my car slams into a another car and I kill everyone inside. I am now facing 10-20 years for murder.

you see i'm not saying one way if something is right or wrong. I am advocating that every other action in our society has a consequence. This is the only one everyone seems to want to streamline (again not talking about this situation, talking about in general). ",1501545850

When I look at it from that standpoint, he seems like he's doing a great job. It's been interesting to see how the left is absolutely falling all over themselves to attack him at every turn, to truly lose their minds and credibility while totally ignoring the ills of their own party. I'd rather have a true statesman with a rockstar cabinet that hit the ground running on day one, but the people seem to have decided that they wanted someone to shake things up. ",1501545850

It's kinda strange that if your company hired some bald guy, nobody would think twice, but if you showed up bald one day, it would be different.

TBH, vanity sucks.  I can remember hating windy days, hated rain, etc...

Back then, I was thinking about moving away and ""starting a new life"" thinking that I'd move where nobody knew me.  It's actually sad, because I wasn't all that happy over issues of vanity, probably had to do with growing up a pretty boy and being 'popular with the ladies' and not wanting to let the go, but in the end... we all have to let go.",1501545850

Why are you not informed?

No generation will be worse off.  This is a lie you tell yourself so that you can justify your policies.  Things must be broken so that you can fix them.

&gt;It must be these conspiracies that develop policies like the cashless card and then hand the contract off to a corporate mate...

Umm yes?  Anybody that implements the cashless card will be a corporation, because corporations are simply methods of organising capital and labour.

You're assigning motives and agency to corporations that assumes evil intent at all times.  That's incredibly conspiratorial.

&gt;Must be a conspiracy that the mining industry choose their own taxes and structures so they could avoid putting the dollars down while times were great...

Mining investment hit nearly 10% of GDP at its peak.  The absolutely did not avoid putting the dollars down.

&gt;Must be why superannuation has been perpetually stalled

...Because the government wanted more money in people's pockets now, to increase their ability to purchase goods.  Super is literally forcing people to save now, at the cost of having decreased ability to spend now.

&gt;None of this has anything to do with the wealthy using their wealth to manipulate the system right...

I went to uni with a large poster, two fun new duvet sets (that were a colour that would go with whatever off white would be thrown at me over the next few years) and a few nick-nacs to remind me of home. In my case, that was a subsection of my keyring collection.

Also cushions are super useful, they turn your bed into a sofa, if you have friends round, or can be put against the wall or on the floor, if friends are on the floor and you can pick fun covers. If you are a little bit crafty, some it may be cheaper to get plain and decorate them with fabric paint and stencils.

Don't get plants or candles before you move in. They're hard to move (plants), and a bunch of places won't let you have them anyway. I also respectfully disagree about framing. Poster frames mostly don't come apart, so they are a bulky thing to move.

My room in halls had a massive pinboard (like 2ft or so - no putting anything up on the walls otherwise), so the poster was soon surrounded by my timetable and various bits and bobs.

This is similar to creation of hodor:

First timeline: Wallis for unknown reason is tramatised and becomes hodor.

They're the same processes used in, e.g., photo book printing. Jostens doesn't have a monopoly on photo books, so they clearly don't have a monopoly on the skills required to print yearbooks. What I'm asking is, how is it that they can have a monopoly on yearbooks when other companies are able to print them? Wouldn't basic capitalism say that if somebody has the means to provide the same service for less money, they will, and then customers (i.e. schools) will buy from them instead? ",1501545856

Super useful to know for anyone like me who was trying to get a solid, wired, connection to the PC for Vridge. I found an old router and set it up on my desk unconnected to the internet just to use with the gearvr and riftcat. I have the nolo vr so I just taped a long R45 cable to the nolo's tether cable. The router isn't connected to the internet so I'm still using the newer router that's in another room for wifi access. Had to do some troubleshooting to get windows to use the wifi connection for internet instead of the internetless ethernet connection. Initially when testing I completely disabled wifi on the S8 to confirm it works and now I just select the ethernet connection in riftcat instead of automatic. Speed seems to be about the same as if it was connected via usb tethering. I don't know if this will work on other devices like the S7 but from what I was reading a few days ago it sounds like it might only work with the S8/S8+ as the phone supports an ethernet connection probably because of the Dex dock.

Enter Steve Bartman, a normal guy sitting near where that foul ball would fall. He had his headphones on, listening to the game on WGN. He sees the ball coming for him and instinctively reaches up for it, interfering with the ball and potentially preventing Moises from catching it. There would be no out and and the Cubs would go on to lose the game and indeed the Series. Extending their World Series losing drought to 96 years. 

Poor Steve was unfairly blamed for the loss, he was threatened with death, his personal information was published in the Chicago Suntimes, the Mayor said something to the effect that he would not protect Steve. It was bad.  The Cubs would have to wait another 13 years to win it all.",1501545862

- Sansa Stark was married to Tyrion already, Arya was missing since Robert's death, although that wasn't widely known. 

- Tywin sends ""Arya Stark"" north and she marries Ramsay, but Theon recognizes her as Jeyne Poole, friend and companion to Sansa who accompanied her to King's Landing

- Jeyne ends up getting the full Ramsay treatment: screams heard at night, Theon watching, forced to use his mouth to get her ready (this is actually the first time it is hinted in the books that Theon may have been castrated as part of his torture), and making her lay with his dogs, until they are both rescued by Mance Rayder and brought to Stannis' camp (they're both still alive, yes)",1501545863

I had no idea our Chaplain was fired, instead I was told he was sick for an extended period of time. And a lot of these claims against the USMC president makes sense. He does not hold back when he sees perceived problems with the college.

The mistakes of USMC have been highlighted very greatly this past year, and being apart of the college during this time has been difficult. Culturally, the college feels exclusive and unwelcoming to most of the students that enroll here. The corruption of SMCSU was a mess, although not entirely the fault of its current (or former) members. So much so that my role as a Don and Chaplaincy sorta became the only remaining student support at USMC, where many questions were directed at us. Although there has been a distinct call to the Catholic Faith, they have seemed to fail in building (or re-building) the bridges associated with the faiths of other students who do not proclaim themselves Catholic, and this is needed now more than ever.

It's honestly very disappointing. And I hope to see a culture change within the college soon. That being said, I'm gonna see if I can switch colleges...",1501545864

More information on the process: The way it's decided on whether or not you are medically viable for the military is you fill out a small forum at the recruiters office talking about your medical condition. You give a small description of your condition and it's sent off to the head doctor. From there everything is put into the head doctor's hands and once they make a decision, it's final. They will not see you for a more detailed medical examination unless you are approved during this part of the recruiting process.

I agree they have an incredible network and the disruption they've brought to the table is noteworthy, but I just don't see them as a great value long term.

His built in CDR and Soul Reaper killer make him pretty useful in PvE, and his voicelines are much better than Deathberry's inane screaming, at least imo.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Not true at all. It was developed by Team Ninja, Published by Tecmo. Tecmo can absolutely say ""Sony paid for licensing now, you can't license it anymore"" 

2 examples:

Any game you buy on Steam, you only buy a license to use the title. Should the publisher ever decide they don't want people playing it anymore, and can remove your license, giving you a non-working exe on your system.

""But that can't happen on Consoles!"" you say?

Activision published, and had their studios develop Marvel Ultimate Alliance 1 and 2. Both games had DLC you could get to buy more characters and the like... But then Disney bought Marvel, and Activisions license for the properties ran out, forcing Activision to pull the titles from online stores, DLC included. Hell, if you have the games and bought the DLC, but then deleted it for more space on your hard disk, you can not re-download that DLC. Or play online coop for achievements/trophies. You literally CANNOT access content you've paid money for, cuz ""licenses"" (especially since MUA2 was the exact Civil War story line that ""Captain America- Civil War"" borrowed from for the MCU)

basically, if you have the hardware and a physical copy, for anything, you're good. If it requires some internet patch, feature, or upgrade, you will lose it one day.

First, my favorite ice cream ever is the caramel cookie Super Cup, though that's a seasonal/limited time item, and it's not time for that yet. Right now, the seasonal flavor is vanilla cookie, which is good, but isn't as strong of vanilla as the vanilla Super Cup.

If you are going to 7-11, the Black Thunder ice cream bar is a good choice (a chocolate ice cream bar with Black Thunder pieces).

Other conbinis have different options. The Giant brand ice cream cones are usually good (kind of like a Drumstick).

I see the status quo, I want the neighborhood I live to continue to exist as I bought into it. What are the options for going against the status quo? I haven't seen one.

after the first paragraph lavey systematically tears down god after god after god.

i think the point lavey makes in *""wanted!:god - dead or alive""* is that god is man made and [if god isn't dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_is_dead)(influence of concept of god), there's no good reason to keep it alive. i don't think it'd be wrong to say that full piece in context is actually antitheistic.

Why did you select 1x16 RAM and not 2x8? Are you planning on maxing out the RAM eventually (64GB)? If not use 2x8.

In that case as well, if you want high frequency RAM (ryzen plays nice with fast RAM) I suggest paying that little extra and getting b-die ram like this:

I should've said ""It *came* true. Now what?""

And I still want an answer to that. Your ""False prophecy from Satan"" came true, and built up the body. Now what? Do we add to the Bible? No. Because Scripture DOES in fact carry greater weight than some specific Word for a specific time and place. Scripture (aka your precious ""canon"") is for all times and all places. Not all of God's Revelation is. Otherwise we'd have a record of what those poor, ""falsely prophesying"" 70 elders said.

""God is dead"" (German:  „Gott ist tot“ ; also known as the death of God) is a widely quoted statement by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It first appears in Nietzsche's 1882 collection The Gay Science (Die fröhliche Wissenschaft, also translated as ""The Joyful Pursuit of Knowledge and Understanding"") However, it is most famously associated with Nietzsche's classic work Thus Spoke Zarathustra (Also sprach Zarathustra), which is most responsible for making the phrase popular.

Although the statement and its meaning is attributed to Nietzsche, this was not a unique position as Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel pondered the death of God, first in his Phenomenology of Spirit where he considers the death of God to 'not [be] seen as anything but an easily recognized part of the usual Christian cycle of redemption'. Later on Hegel writes about the great pain of knowing that God is dead 'The pure concept, however, or infinity, as the abyss of nothingness in which all being sinks, must characterize the infinite pain, which previously was only in culture historically and as the feeling on which rests modern religion, the feeling that God Himself is dead, (the feeling which was uttered by Pascal, though only empirically, in his saying: Nature is such that it marks everywhere, both in and outside of man, a lost God), purely as a phase, but also as no more than just a phase, of the highest idea.' Of course the spirit in which it is intended is a verily Nietzsche manifestation, however it is important to consider the material that gave rise to this idea.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let me further explain my position. I should have explained in my original post but I didn't have the time before. With my post left how it is, the No True Scotsman argument might apply.

My answer is in two parts. 1. As I had posted in my first post, I believe there are people who call themselves Christians who aren't. (Whither this be by deceiving themselves or by choice.) Some of these people will undoubtedly act this way. 2. I do not believe Christians to be perfect. They will fail to follow everything perfectly. This is due to our sinful natures. Romans 3 exemplifies this. Verse 10 says, ""None is righteous, no, not one"". (Which the author is quoting from the Psalms.) Later in verse 23 it says, ""for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"". Christians are to become more Christ like throughout their lives, but that won't be completed until they are in heaven. I would not doubt that believing Christians have acted in the way that /u/TurtleBucketList has mentioned. In a similar strain in how it is easy in America to call oneself a Christian while not being one, it is also easy for true Christians to lack maturity in their belief for extended periods of time. It is easy not to dig deeper than surface level. Does this excuse their behavior? No, not in the slightest. Do they represent Christians as a whole?

"medicalschool","t5_2re2p","I always ask, ""what do you think is causing your symptoms"", sometimes the pt knows exactly why they're having chest pain because it's exactly what their previous heart attack felt like and you don't need to go digging for answers. Also, it's a good way to gauge their knowledge of what's going on and their willingness to undertake lifestyle modifications/treatment (if they are a smoker with COPD and don't attribute their difficulty breathing to their smoking then they're not going to want to hear they need to stop smoking). 

Saying ""if my mother/father was having this problem, this is what I would tell them"" is an amazing way to convince and comfort. Even normal and reasonable people have been bombarded with enough of the ""doctors don't want you to know this secret"" and ""big pharma is giving you poison to take your money"" that at some level they have come to believe some of it. Saying you would treat your family this way is essentially giving them the employees secret family discount and they'll actually believe you have their best interest in mind. 

Sometimes you've just go to get informal and say thing like ""wow, that sucks"". Doctors are people too, and the natural reaction to hearing your patient was just diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic cancer at age 45 is NOT ""wow, that must be very difficult for you, do you have enough social support to deal with the diagnosis"".

So, with almost no previous experience I built a four poster myself.  

I bought some nice poplar 1x4's and glued them up to make solid posts. I used 1x10s for the sides, head, and foot boards.  
The part where the mattress sits is framed out of 2x4's 16"" on center with a 3/4"" plywood and plenty of screws.  The top is tied together with more 1x4""s.   As long as you are careful to join all your seams nicely and take your time it's not that hard.   

Even after 8 years it's as solid as a rock.  If I ever move I'll have to disassemble it into sections.   
All in all I probably have $350 and about 1 day's work into it.

A woman is likely to be more concerned about appearing unfavourably than a man is, since men are rewarded for aggressive ambition, while women are shamed for it.

O máximo que tive foi um professor que disse que os portugueses souberam explorar os escravos melhor que uns países e pior que outros, e fez questão de dizer que isso não é algo de se orgulhar.

Ótimo, gostaria que todos pensassem da sua maneira.

&gt; Já agora, não percebo a primeira parte. Não vou debater isso porque sei que não vale a pena, qualquer pessoa que ache que a maior causa dos problemas do Brasil são a escravidão de há 500 anos atrás, está em negação.

Tentei ser complacente com você, pois sei muito bem que você não estudou a história do Brasil de maneira aprofundada. 

Disse que atrevo-me a dizer a maior que a maior parte dos problemas do Brasil é por conta da escravidão, obviamente posso estar enganado, mas é fato que **uma das** maiores causas do Brasil estar com tantos problemas foi por conta da escravidão. Isso é fato, apenas uma pessoa que não tenha conhecimento sobre isso ou um tolo não vê isso.

For one thing, it means that McGann, who only got a TV movie and a special in video form, got over *ten seasons* to tell us his story via audio. Those companions he salutes before he regenerates into Hurt? They're all from his Big Finish adventures.

Were his parents pissed?  But no, JK didn't bother to devote half an ounce of her attention to looking into it.  We know this because had she looked into it, she would've found the full clip in about 3 minutes and realized her folly.  Even after she was corrected and everyone around her deleted their tweets and acknowledged their mistake, JK's ego wouldn't let her post a simple corrective tweet, like ""my mistake.  The clip was misleading.  What a relief!  So glad the boy got some attention!""  Nope.  She didn't want to look stupid so she tried to ignore it for as long as she could, until she could avoid it no longer.  Then she finally pushes out a begrudging correction because it was the only thing she could do to save what remained of her face.

Haven't been around long enough to know longevity but the appliances are pretty much fully covered for 12 years. Trane is also pretty decent.

Goodman gets a bad rap, anybody with a license can buy them/install them so a lot of their problems come from bad installs, I personally don't mind them but they are cheaper for a reason and I do replace quite a few parts on them. In saying that though I'm rarely replacing multiple parts on the same unit.

Your safest bet is probably the Lennox quote, all their stuff holds up well. Just depends what features you want and your budget.

❤ **GFE - Girlfriend Experience** 

Come hang out with me on a more personal level with my GFE package! 

I prefer starting with a trial to see if we are compatible. Sometimes personalities don't mesh and that is ok. This is supposed to be fun for both of us and I find a trial really helps to determine that. 

**Please contact me through pm with more than a HI, tell me you're from Reddit, otherwise I will not respond. KIK - KikiPawg Serious buyers only** 

&amp;nbsp;


**All Packages to choose from last a week except Trial** 

* **TRIAL $75** - three day trial and there is no sexting session with this. This is a great option to see if we mesh well and have similar interests. I am happy to discuss fetishes, sexual likes and dislikes. If you would like to add a sexting session to the trial you may do so, but it would have a time limit on it.

* **CHAT ONLY $125** - Only chatting through the week. One 20 min sexting session. Good morning/Good night texts.  

* **ACQUAINTANCE $150** - chatting, pics, and occasional kik vids sent. Good morning/Good night texts. 

* **CASUAL W/BENEFITS $200** - Chatting/sexting throughout the week, vids and pics will be sent randomly 
throughout the day. Good morning/Good night texts. 

* **SERIOUS $300** - Gets you ALL of my attention for the week. I won’t take any other packages during this time. I am committed to you. Unlimited Chatting/Sexting throughout the day. Unlimited pics, vids sent daily. Good morning/Good night texts. Unlimited = as long as time/day permits. I’m not a sex bot ;p 

* **MONTH LONG GFE $600** - Can’t get enough of me? Indulge in me for a whole month. You get the same attention as if this is my $200 package each week. I don't like to limit the time of the sexting session if it is happening naturally/organically as time permits.

* Lack of support on particular subsets of devices, namely Microsoft Surface devices.  If you do it anyway, I wouldn't expect driver/firmware updates in the future to get delivered to a Surface device running an OS on LTSC. (If they even do now? Haven't deployed one with anything other than Win10 Education)


* Lack of new features you might want, until years later.  All those new Defender ATP features coming in Win10 1709?  You're not getting that on LTSC until the next release in 2019.  New features in client Hyper-V that your power users and developers might want to use? Same deal, they'll have to wait for years until the next LTSC. When it is time for a new release and users need/want it, they have to get manually get upgraded in person, or with a script + media source via your tool of choice. You'll be in a similar spot as you would have been for going between Vista to 7, 7 to 8.x, etc. Manual upgrade, wipe it, or leave it alone until it's unsupported.


* In regards to the last point, you have the same potential fragmentation issues as with older Windows versions.  Not so much an ""issue"" as it is just maintaining the status quo of the past, but this is one of the things Windows 10's servicing model specifically aimed to fix. Machines are continuously serviced with the newest builds, and you're not playing the annoying game of ""EOL-whack-a-mole"" like many folks did with their XP machines. (And are probably doing now with their Win7 machines) By choosing LTSC instead, you're forgoing this convenience and staying with the old Windows support model-- 10 years, and plan huge upgrades to the next version years later. Or let old ones die out naturally as you deploy new machines with the new version. In late 2019, I'll have an army of thousands of Win10 Education 1903 machines thanks to using the Semi-Annual Channel; However, folks sticking with LTSC may still have a mix of Win10 Enterprise 2015 LTSB (1507) and 2016 LTSB (1607), and they could potentially need to start introducing yet a third different OS into the environment unless a mass upgrade/refresh happens.


If Microsoft's say-so and the above points don't really matter, then do what you like. Just know the potential limitations and pros/cons of whatever edition you deploy and be prepared to handle any consequences either way.


We deploy Win10 Education for 95% of our users and equipment with a 4-month deferral period + prior testing. The other 5% are candidates for LTSC-- Digital signage, kiosks, science labs, machines running ancient or proprietary software/devices/drivers that may not survive feature upgrades, and so on.",1501545891

They owned at least seven ships, and held interest in others. The ships sailed from Massachusetts shores to Turkey, where they bought opium; from Turkey to China, where they sold the drug; and from China to Boston, loaded with tea, porcelain and silk.""

&gt;That person grossly over-simplified, as he was addressing a someone with concerns about being narcissistic.

How do you know they didn't mean it? You left out the second part, and I find it easy to believe that they were expressing their honest view, especially since in a new comment they repeated it. Probably many other therapists have the same view as well

&gt;&gt;&gt;The first is categorical and clearly a problem, the second is dimensional and almost everyone could be considered to have some level of narcissistic aspects to their personality.

&gt;&gt;Now you're trying to muddy up the waters here. The thread is clearly about people who would have an abnormal amount of narcissistic traits, whether or not almost everyone would have some level of narcissistic aspects isn't relevant.

&gt;Actually, this is my point, the water is already muddied. The ambiguity regarding the word ""narcissist"" is the basis of the conflict. Many of the people you've responded to have not meant it the way you are using it. Going forward, I would propose only using the terms ""NPD"" (categorical) and ""narcissistic traits"" (spectrum) to remove the possible ambiguity.

But even having a high amount of narcissistic traits isn't the same as everyone arguably having some sort of narcissistic aspect, so I do contend that there was some muddying.

Also, I've been talking about unofficial narcissists the whole time, with the exception of noting that some official narcissists must be in the therapist population as well. 

&gt;I think what you've interpreted as therapists acceptance of an NPD therapist, is in actuality, acceptance of an individual that believes they are high in narcissistic traits, yet not so high that they can conceive of being flawed.

This is a misinterpretation by you since that was not my interpretation, my contention is that simply being high in narcissistic traits is enough of an issue because of the nature of the profession, and especially because of how people talk about the importance of clients just putting complete trust in the therapist. I would consider them flawed for the job.

&gt;You may be uncomfortable about that, and that could be legitimate, 

Well I'm glad that at least someone has somewhat understood my point here. A rare occurrence. I wouldn't say I'm just uncomfortable about it though, I oppose it, for good reason.

&gt;but considering a major tenant of therapy (see quote infra), is it surprising that therapists would respond to that OP as they did?  ""Anyone can change their behavior if they're aware of the aspects that are problematic and are motivated to do something about it.""

Except there wasn't talk about ""change yourself first"" it was talk about just managing it. As I noted before it would be a better situation if they did make a lasting change.",1501545891

"homestead","t5_2s8lc","Our theory with the stuff we produce is to either increase the quality of what we consume versus the store bought equivalent of the same price or we'll decrease the cost by home production without a decrease in quality.  As a good example, just today we bought fresh strawberries from a local Mexican produce market at $1 a pound.  $4 worth of strawberries and about $2 worth of sugar made us six pints of fresh no-additive jam for $1 a piece.  Buying the same quality of jam would probably run $4-$5 each so my $6 turned into $30.

We do the same with homemade soap with a production cost of $2 or so a bar (or less) for something that would cost $6 were I to buy it.

Other options for home production in an apartment - wine, beer, mushrooms.

After that you have Reagan who set the stage for the debt based politics we have today by putting us in debt 3.5 trillion on the heels of the largest tax since at least the 1920s.

Bush was an incompetent full but honestly he didn't really do much to push the GOP agenda forward. 

At the end of the day Reagan was the most dangerous because even though he cut taxes and said the country spiraling into debt people still liked him and that's all timidly what makes the truly dangerous leader is when they screw up and people just deny it.

What you highlight is that if God is omniscient, then he is resigned to let a lot of fucked up things happen (not benevolent) or he is powerless to stop it (not omnipotent). It seems at first glance this is a somewhat definitive stance, but the way most knowledgeable people I've met will respond is with the Irenaean Theodicy which states that we consent to existing and while God knows we will fuck up, he lets it happen as a sort of learning experience. In essence, God is a teacher here to see whether we pass the test of life. That's a gross oversimplification of what it is (it goes a lot further justifying seemingly meaningless deaths and so on) but it does respond to your qualm.

Western - On the wood platform on the outside by the wooden wheel
Sugary - On the pink platform by the lemon on the outside
Cafe - On the bar on the inside
Original - No picture of him here
Modern - No picture of him here 

As you can see he has visited the Cushion on inside and outside spots in my remodels. I think the biggest factor in this is patience and making sure you catch him when he's on it. On Easter weekend when he was last in my yard on the Cushion I opened my game, checked my gifts, and Tubbs visiting the Cushion was most recent gift and I had been too late.

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","&gt;What I meant is that from what I can understand from Davis' argument, the lower amount of resources needed to produce calories for human consumption the better, right? 

The only resource Davis concerns himself with is animal deaths. So the only metric you would need to consider is animal deaths per million calories of human food or something.

&gt;From what I understand of Davis' argument is that eventually, a vegan diet will reach a sort of equilibrium where it will produce more deaths than it saves, and it is at this very point that Davis' is arguing against veganism, however from what I can infer from his underlying logic, until we actually are there we should use as little resources to in calorie production as possible?

I think that is a logical conclusion from the argument, though as I just said the only 'resource' Davis considers is animal deaths required to produce food. But yes, given the current consumption of meat is higher than what could be produced by pasture-forage livestock alone, such that human-edible crops are being fed to animals currently, the best thing you can do to reduce animal deaths from food production is reduce your meat consumption as much as possible (until a substantial proportion of the world goes vegan).",1501545898

"suns","t5_2szvb","&gt;Like many people have said about the Cavs, why are they under pressure to trade Kyrie? They're not, Kyrie is under contract for 2 more years, he has no leverage to demand a trade. 

The Cavaliers are under way more pressure to trade Irving than the Suns are under pressure to trade for him.   Cleveland has him under contract for two more years, so what?    If your top two players are feuding in August, that sort of thing could cripple your entire season.   So yeah Cleveland could tell Kyrie to have a seat and deal with it and Kyrie could go full Markieff and make them regret drawing the process out any further than it had to be.   


Cleveland lost a lot of their leverage once it became public that Kyrie wanted out.

The next thing I knew I was crawling back up the driveway in which I had fallen onto. The last thing I remember was passing out as people ran up to me. I woke up in the house and the area around my chin was being held up by my older sister. They rushed me to an emergency room where I almost died. I remember it as if was a dream that moment when I passed out. It was very peaceful no more pain. However I remember what it looks like underneath the thick skin covering your face around the chin.

Don't get me wrong, I think the NCAA is stupid for having these ""amateur"" rules; I could talk until my face was blue about how the NCAA's rules are terrible. However, I think that this was an extremely fair compromise given the rules. 

According to UCFAA's official press release, UCF submitted a waiver to the NCAA to allow De La Haye to remain eligible. The terms of the deal were that he could remain eligible he ""monetize[d] videos that did not reference his status as a student-athlete or depict his football skill or ability"" and put videos ""that referenced his status as a student-athlete or depict his football skill or ability if they were posted to a non-monetized account.""

It seems like a fair deal to me. He didn't take it, so he's made his bed.",1501545903

&gt; # [Todos al frente: estos son los 28 diputados que faltaron a más de la mitad de las votaciones](http://media.diarioveloz.com/adjuntos/120/imagenes/002/300/0002300540.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; Muchos de ellos son muy conocidos. Los que más se ausentaron son del FPV. Mirá la lista.
&gt; 
&gt;  Se sabe: en los años electorales la baja actividad parlamentaria se acentúa. En lo que va de 2017,
&gt; 
&gt; **28 legisladores faltaron a más de la mitad de las votaciones esta temporada**. Varios de ellos son
&gt; 
&gt; **muy conocidos**, como
&gt; 
&gt; [Julio de Vido](http://www.diarioveloz.com/julio-vido-a1194), Sergio Massa,
&gt; 
&gt; [Facundo Moyano](http://www.diarioveloz.com/facundo-moyano-a1383) y Carlos Heller, por citar los casos más trascendentes.
&gt; 
&gt; La información se desprende de un informe oficial de la Cámara baja yfue realizado en base a las ocho sesiones de este año, que van **desde el 15 de febrero hasta el 26 de julio**. Esta última fue en la que el ex ministro de Planificación kirchnerista, Julio De Vido, zafó de ser expulsado, ya que el oficialismo y un sector de la oposición no consiguieron la mayoría especial para desplazarlo.
&gt; 
&gt; En esas reuniones (una en febrero, dos en abril, una en mayo, dos en junio y dos en julio) **se votaron 53 proyectos de distintos tenores**.
&gt; 
&gt; Los legisladores Graciela Navarro, José Herrera y Mirta Pastoriza, todos del **Frente Cívico por Santiago**, son aquellos que ostentan la mayor cantidad de faltazos ¿cuántos? **48, 44 y 39, respectivamente.** Se trata de diputados que responden al ex gobernador **Gerardo Zamora**. Uno de los pocos proyectos que votaron los tres fue el que trataba la expulsión de De Vido. S**e quedaron para rechazarlo y favorecer al ex ministro K.**
&gt; 
&gt; Cabe destacar que las ausencias en las votaciones no es sinónimo de ausencia general en la sesión. Muchos pueden estar presentes a la hora de dar el quórum **y luego irse cuando hay que levantar las manos.** No es el caso de los santiagueños Herrera y Navarro, que tuvieron muchas ausencias completas que justificaron con **""licencia""**.
&gt; 
&gt; Massa, por otro lado, tiene pocas inasistencias en las sesiones -alguna justificada por ""Misión Oficial-, **pero muchas faltas en las votaciones**.
&gt; 
&gt; Además de los integrantes del bloque santiagueño, quien más faltó cuando de votar se trató fue el Frente para la Victoria-PJ. **Uno de los más cumplidores es Máximo Kirchner**. Tiene 9 ausencias. Su amigo Mauricio Gómez Bull, en cambio, faltó a 28 votaciones.
&gt; 
&gt; Esta es la lista de los 28 diputados que faltaron a más de la mitad de las sesiones, confeccionada por Clarín.

Unless self-supporting and not claiming EI, *all* seasonal workers are expected to work another job in the off-season. 

&gt;Low labour prices contribute to low food prices (and improved food selection) for Canadians.

US figures, but.....

&gt; A wage increase will mostly affect fruits and vegetables, because commodity crops — corn, soy, wheat, cotton, and others — are highly mechanized, so most of the work is done by machines. With produce, about a quarter of every dollar we spend at the supermarket goes to the farmer. A third of that quarter — about 8 cents of your produce dollar — goes to the farmworker. If wages increased 25 percent (from $12 to $15), and that cost were passed on to us, produce prices would rise 2 to 3 percent. The yearly impact would be in the range of $30 per household, certainly affordable for many but not for all.*

I suspect that increasing wages to a point that would attract Canadian workers would be good for the economy while not taking too much cash out of our pockets.

Page Insights is a great tool but it only checks thing like if your images have been compressed and css/js minified as well as other common factors like render blocking JS.

I suggest looking into ASYNC loading of images and webfonts. This will allow you to load quickly and display the initial content and the JS will loading the rest of the resources later or as needed. You may see a flash of unstyled text but its better than slow loading. 

Also, it loads in 2 seconds or less for me, try refreshing your cache.

Part of the perception that 105 should be considered the ""base level"" stems from the previous generation of groupsets, when it was a significant step up.

when you sign up for a contest (usually at various trade shows) and provide legitimate contact information, they then sell that contact information to other companies who use it to direct market to you.

you should never fill out ballots and contests anywhere. that information is always bought and sold over and over again. that's how telekmarketers get your number and call you during dinner.

you may get a prize or gift out of it but at the cost of having your info sold to every marketing company in the US who will then contact you and try to sell you on every product or service you can imagine, offering gifts and prizes to incentivize your participation.",1501545906

2. Dame could also just hide on TT, and have Turner take on Blake. 

3. Brogdon isnt that good of a defender, I love Anderson, but he plays PF best and is VERY slow, and PatBev off Dame is always bad news.
Payton is also a pretty decent PG in his own right. He averaged 12.8/6.5/4.7 on .471 FG%. He cant shoot for crap, but he can definitely score on Anderson, Brogdon, McLemore, and Ellis.

4. Covington can switch and theres always the fact that Vince is honestly the only other player than Blake who can consistently create his own shot. Ellis is not the player he was in Golden State and none of the rest of your team is good at making their own shots, meaning its much harder to abuse poor perimeter defenders like Lillard. Its possible to try and get Blake onto Lillard, but PatBev isnt a PnR threat and there isnt much reason for Lillard to not stay on him.

5. Its always chaotic in the last few seconds of a game. 

I thought the game could go both ways and the teams were very evenly matched, but when it came down to it, IMHO Lillard and Waiters had the edge closing out the game over Blake.",1501545906

1st: The plan was for the Tyrel and Dornish armies to siege kings landing together. With the ironborn defeated the dornish army is stuck in Dorn. The only way for them to reach kings landing is through the reach, but Dorn and the reach don't get along so the Tyrel army wouldn't leave until the dornish had reached them. So why aren't they there to fight the Lannisters? 

2nd: Bravos was founded by runaway slaves. They've fought and won multiple wars with other free cities and the resulting piece treaty with at least Pentos FORCED the abolition of slavery. They could not have done this without the aid of the iron bank. This the idea that the Iron Bank would be invested in the slave trade is ridiculous.

Brave Wizards,Many thanks for the amazing support, constructive feedback and great ideas we've got from you during the release weekend! We are excited to announce that we've decided to implement free movement in The Wizards. Lack of free locomotion is the most commonly raised subject in your reviews and comments, which prompted us to change our initial updates plan and focus on meeting your expectations.We plan to add free movement as an alternative and a complement to teleportation. It means that it will still be possible to finish the entire game with the use of teleportation, however, the players will also be able to move freely around most locations in the game and mix free movement with teleportation.Today our whole team started working on this new movement scheme and we hope to have it ready within few weeks. After free movement is ready, we'll start working on scheduled content updates and implementing your suggestions regarding combat and enemies. Stay tuned for more updates on the status of implementation of free movement. We're also working on a patch that will fix bugs you have reported and introduce several improvements to Frost Bow and Arcane Missiles. This patch will go live in the upcoming days.P.S. We've decided to use Onward as a reference while implementing free movement. Let us know do you think about this choice.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","Well, I'm not sure you understand the christian perspective on marriage if you think its about denying equal treatment. For christians, marriage is an institution created by god for the purpose of laying forth the ideal situation for procreation. This is actually true in a cultural sense as well. Marriage has existed, even outside religion, as a way of delineating the proper course upon which to raise the next generation. It marks the ideal familial situation in which to raise a child, that being with one father and one mother, both of whom are wholly committed to one another and to their children, all of whom are full blooded siblings of one another. On average, this set of norms, creates the environment most suited to raising balanced and forthright adults whom then are most capable of carrying forth the society. 

However, when you have a situation in which procreation cannot happen, not just accidentally, but in principal, such as between two men or two women, you really don't have any reason for the institution to exist in the first place. Its not really much different from the concept of marital fidelity. If marriage were to be redefined so as to mean that man and wife were not wholly committed to one another, but rather only tangentially or merely in spirit, it destroys the integrity of the institution. If a man is free to have children with a woman who is not his wife or a woman free to have children with a man who is not her husband, again, it invalidates the whole reasoning behind the establishment of the institution in the first place.

I think most christians are at a point where if the government is going to redefine marriage, they would rather just have the government do away with marriage altogether as a civic institution and have it replaced with some other method of acknowledgement that is apart from the idea of marriage, similar to the civic unions proposed by people(including Obama before he ""evolved"") some years ago. I hope this has more or less put to rest the idea that marriage is something christians are arbitrarily attempting to exclude homosexuals from, that is simply not the case. Marriage was an organic institution, a tool if you will, with a specific purpose that is no longer relevant if society no longer believes in that purpose.",1501545911

Title: **Employer hasn't paid me and I signed a serious NDA. I'm trying to collect my money, but I don't know what I can say.**

Original Post: 

&gt; I am wondering if anyone knows the legalities behind me talking about things in a NDA if my employer hasn't paid me for the work I did for him. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are individuals asking about the legitimacy of the business I used to work for, but I feel compelled to stay quiet since I signed a non disclosure agreement to not talk about anything related to the business that is not posted on their website. I am trying to sue my previous employer, and I've been talking to several people and have to be cryptic with what I say. I know that I can be subpoenaed in a legal case if it's pertinent to the courts decision, but do I have to still abide by the NDA?

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"Scotland","t5_2qkli","Margaret Thatcher and the British Government could've stopped it at any minute. They shouldn't have even let it start. All they had to do to directly save the lives of 10 men, (and indirectly save the lives of hundreds killed in the following years due to the surge in IRA membership and support after the murder of the hunger strikers) was to give in to 5 simple demands. 5 demands that they were bound by the Geneva convention to adhere to anyway.  They could've intervened and prevented the deaths of those men, but they didn't. They let them die out of sheer hatred and spite. 

If you are driving down the road one day and you see a injured man on the street dying. You know for a fact that he is going to die if you don't do something about it. You can attempt to help him yourself, you can put him in your car and take him to hospital or you can phone an ambulance to come and get him. But you decide to do neither of those things and continue driving, then you are complicit in the death of that man. 

Now not only did the British government ignore the dying man, but they created the conditions which lead to the man's injury in the first place. So change the analogy now to if you drove into a man with your car, knew he was going to die, didn't help him and he died. You're a murderer. Britain murdered those men. ",1501545915

Hook it up in your bedroom and close off your bedroom door, and closet door with some bath towels stuffed under the door to create a better seal and you're in business.

You can usually get a really crappy 5000 BTU window unit for $99 at Walmart. Portable AC's are a little more, but alot easier to set up, and they run about $250. Both of these options at about 5000 BTU will run off a 2,000w generator problem.

When it's 117°F outside our garage will be about 110. When the power's out the inside of your home would be upwards of 90.",1501545917

(Plus Im of the small minority that think Hendricks won that fight and made GSP retire LOL.) Woodley vs Masvidal sounds great to me.

This was my thought when reading but it always seemed like the ""go to"" answer.


&gt;I would start by checking to make sure the car knows the doors are closed. Do you get any door ajar messages? Do your interior lights stay on? On GM vehicles, the door latches tell the car when they are closed when the latches are secure. You can try lubricating the doors and trunk latches.

I will try this tomorrow and report back! I do not recall seeing any door ajar message or my interior lights staying on but will make sure.

&gt;Also, does the unlock button work on the inside of the car? If it is intermittent as well, you may unfortunately need a body control module. There are lock and unlock relays, but they are non-serviceable and soldiered directly to the body control module. I have heard of being able to wire in external relays, but I am not that familiar with GM vehicles. 

Hmm. I've never tried it sitting inside the car.

Is a body control module expensive? Fairly easy replaceable? **Eww. I just looked it up. I hope that's not the problem.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","While the question of ""is this a jebait or not"" is not my forte - Your country of origin or how many times you've been to the US isn't a guarantee you are going to be approved by Customs and Border patrol. They'll want to know things like why you're here and how long you are expected to be here. If you trigger flags (working in the US illegally, criminal record, overstaying, and priors of those... ), they send you back home. Barring any grievous circumstances he would have to look into getting a waiver to get back in. Hopefully Valve and lawyers can sort this out.

**EDIT**
Going to edit this to add a few points to address some things brought up in the comments as well as some information for context so everyone has a better assessment of the situation: 

* Sweden citizens are under the visa waiver program and typically have an ESTA.
* ESTA, B-visas (Tourist and Business) does not allow its holder to work in the United States. (see my visa video if you want more info!)
* Having a valid visa (even if its a work visa), does not guarantee entry into the US by customs and border patrol.
* While the hands of fate lie in the hands of that one Customs Agent, and *maybe* it does happen, they can't really deny you for ""whatever bullshit"" they feel like because a reason has to be entered into the system which goes out nationally to all other agents.
* All these are not limited to the USA. While the US have strict visa laws, each country have their deals and quirks so one must abide by that country's rules. Hosting a TI somewhere else can alleviate some rules, but we'd have to deal with other issues instead.


So when we argue ""WHY THE EFFING EFF DOES SWEDISH MILLIONAIRE WHO WENT TO US MILLION TIMES BEFORE  WORKING FOR VALVE GET DENIED!"" -- it doesn't matter how rich they are, how many times they've been here, who their sponsor is.... things that matter are if they're sick, committed a crime before, working illegally here, or overstayed their visa before.",1501545918

&gt;general perception of MSA today


Yeah I know what you mean. A lot of people say it's the pure Arabic language and the real language. But I think this more has to do with MSA being a prestige language than a religious language (which, strictly speaking it is not classical Arabic). MSA is spoken in the news media, formal discussions, official documents, taught in schools, etc. Also, since dialects aren't even standardized (very few dictionaries exist and grammar isn't proscribed), it's very hard for them to compete with the intellectual heritage of MSA. 

&gt; Reading material


I don't have any specifically about your question of why MSA is viewed so. However, their are a few studies about translating English technology terms into Arabic. I don't have the links right now, but one of the studies tracks student translations of English technology terms into Arabic. The way new vocabulary enters Arabic (usually via loanwords) and the creation of 'pure' Arabic neologisms to replace these direct loan words is very interesting. It might give you an insight into how Arabic is trying to be relevant in the fields of science and technology. MSA can be viewed as a alternative to using French or English words (which dialects usually borrow).



A classic example of the neologisms vs loanwords struggle is (haatif) هاتف vs (telefoun) تلفون. The word هاتف was coined to replace تلفون.",1501545919

100% more of something is double. 100% more of 2 is 4. You add 100% of the original. So saying 100% more of 2 is the original (2) plus 100% of the original (2), making 4.

50% more of something is 1.5 times as much. 50% more of 2 is 3. You add 50% of the original. So saying 50% more of 2 is the original (2) plus 50% of the original (1), making 3.

Best is underrated i agree.

Shearer is the all time scorer because he was in it from the very start up until his retirement 14 years later. Henry only spent 7 seasons in it and not only has a much better goal/game ration than Shearer, but he holds the record for most golden boots won. Also 2000s PL was of higher quality than 90s PL.

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"eu4","t5_2uqat","Without conquest, no, you can't lockdown America on your own, because Castile/Spain/England/France/Scotland/Scandinavia/Norway/Ottoman/etc will bound to show up eventually and start colonizing. 

But this is not to say you can't easily take them for yourself. You've moved your capital to Colonial region to prevent any CN from forming. You can go a step further, since your capital is now in a Colonial region, DoW on a CN will not involve the overlord. See where I'm going with this? So you really just have to focus on colonizing the key areas, and get the shitty provinces from the colonizers later via conquest. 

Secure the Caribbeans, then the Ivory Coast, followed by Chesapeake Bay (it's a big drain on your Caribbean trade stream if fallen to English/French hand), so you can benefit from the trade streams more easily, and they both feed into Servilla, giving you much higher income. 

Focus on taking the Gold mines from the natives first. So natives near Aztec, Cusco, and Potosi (?) needs to die. They'll lessen the burden on your income to support your colonization effort. 

If you have the spare time, feel free to conquer the N African muslims with the help of Castile, and vassal feed all horrible berber lands into a released vassal. Activate Direct trade power toward you. This way, you get a bigger share on the trade power in Servilla, without worrying about the conversion effort that'll go into maintaining the region.

"starwarsspeculation","t5_3a3kv","&gt;My understanding of George's thinking in all this is that having faith in something bigger than yourself and trusting fate was the metaphor.
        
Exactly. Trust in....the....force...
       
&gt;Not that the force just does things like an active character would.
               
Not in an anthropomorphic way. Fate. God in the Machine. Deus Ex Mechina. The Force.
       
&gt;let the will of the force do it's thing.
             
See you keep saying it and then you say it doesn't do shit.
        
&gt;But there needs to be balance between the two.
         
Exactly. A priest once told this joke at Sunday Mass : There was a very devout Catholic who was lost at sea. A great storm had capsized his boat. So he prayed to God for a rescue. A fishing boat came by. The man said ""I'm OK. The Lord will provide."" A cargo ship stopped to help him and the man replied ""I've got this. The Lord will provide."" The Mighty Ike (CVN-69) stopped to help him but again the man refused by saying ""I will not faulter in my faith in God. He will come to my rescue"" So the man drowned and went to heaven. The first thing he did was ask Jesus ""Was my faith not strong enough?"" Jesus smiled and replied ""I sent a fishing boat, a cargo ship and an Aircraft carrier!""  
            
&gt;Just like the force needs balance.
         
More like the galaxy needs balance. You don't balance God. God balances you.

"hockey","t5_2qiel","If you legit think perry's hart trophy season was better than lidstrom's peak you don't understand hockey and there is no point in having this discussion with you.

I'm sorry to be that blunt, but this shouldn't even be a point of contention. You can't have a discussion with someone when they don't have a fundamental understanding of what's being discussed. It's like trying to discuss calculus with someone who can't do 2+2=4. It's a fruitless exercise.

In that case, technically yes the burden of proof would fall on me to prove that the derivative of x is 1, but it would be pointless to try and prove that to someone who can't do basic arithmetic because they wouldn't understand the most basic part of the concepts involved.

If your reasoning skills can't go beyond, ""hart trophy voting is flawed---&gt;but lidstrom won 7 norris trophies!!!"" or ""i said lidstrom had more points than pronger---&gt;i think dmen value is based on points"" then I can't be bothered to help you understand why lidstrom's peak, career, and everything was consistently superior to pronger. I would have to start at such a rudimentary point that I would be writing a novel, perhaps multiple, of basic reasoning and reading comprehension concepts. Frankly, I don't have that kind of time.

I would recommend watching some more hockey. Once you've done enough of that to understand why a near ppg dman, who plays half the game against the other team's best line, top special teams, and does countless other valuable things at a consistency and rate better than almost every other player in league history is so good. And therefore better than corey fucking perry, you can begin to have a conversation about pronger versus lidstrom.",1501545922

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","Oh gosh, I really don't agree with the reasons for the divorce ...I still think we need a divorce because we have grown apart as a movement. I find that Trans Activists have attacked the LGB in LGBT to the point that it isn't sustainable. I have a friend that is a writer. I have posted her articles here on Gender Critical. She writes about Gender Non Conforming Women in History and states that they were women and shares Lesbian History. In no way has she ever mentioned the Transgender Community even in her articles talking about the vanishing L Word, she has never attacked the Transgender Community... yet she has been attacked and called a TERF, received Death Threats, Terf threats that read like rape threats.... she is not backing down even when she is threatened because she believes it is important for lesbians to know these things. 

Due to things like this I am stuck in a quandary as a member of the LGBT Community. I know LGB  raise money and donate for the Transgender community, I know that many if not all of the Organizations that support the Transgender Community are LGB Organizations, I know LGB media has bent over backwards to support the Transgender Community. I know many of the most vocal supporters of the Transgender Community are in fact LGB men and women. We have in fact been and continue to be compassionate and stellar allies. 

Yet what has happened in the community is.... Transgender Activists say that they are LGBT activists.... they are not they are solely Transgender Activists. Marriage Equality is something that is constantly thrown in our faces as a way of saying that Homophobia and Lesbophobia no longer exits so as a Community we have to focus solely on Transphobia. I resent that because I had more than one Trans Activist that would not freaking lift a god damn pinky to help pass Marriage Equality when we were fighting Prop 8 because they could already marry their same sex partners or they could already marry their heterosexual partners.... because they had already been declared opposite gender partners... to quote one activist ""It does not effect me. I am already married to my wife."" She was married to her wife before transitioning and transitioning did not dissolve their union, unlike all of the other lesbians who woke up on that day and had their marriages ripped from them. I really freaking wish I could say her name but I would be sued. 

We have LGB men and women being fired because they just wanted to stat a dialog forced to resign or face termination. The threats are palpable. So in the discussion of divorcing the T... I am on the side of dialog.

1) Attacks on women trying to be honest about LGB History and starting a dialog is unacceptable and abusive. I side with the ally who has always supported me as a gay man when the crap in my life hit the fan and not the one that has been the abuser. (look up Lesbians and the HIV pandemic... Lesbians as a Community were not effected in great numbers, but they fought for us and saved our lives. Every young gay man and every young lesbian needs to know about those acts of fierce brave love.) I am Team Lesbian because unless the T was effected by something themselves.... nothing. Also many gay men if you look at those videos of the Dyke March we cheered our sisters on and we have donated and fund raised for reproductive health and women's issues.... but never took leadership or tried to make those issues all about us unlike the Transgender Community has. 

2) LGB Continue to support the Trans Community yet our reward is to be constantly crapped on. 

3) As stated multiple times by the Trans Community when sexual orientation gets in the way of Gender Identity politics. Sexuality is separate from Gender Identity. 

4) The rewrite of LGB Community turning gay and lesbian members into Transgender figures.... this has even gone so far they say that Joan of Ark was a Trans Man. 

Our Community is facing some tough times with Marriage Equality threatened to be overturned calling it Religious Liberty, Assaults on Women's Heath, calling for conversation therapy before gay men can receive HIV treatments and Violence against LGB on the rise not being at all reported because we can only report on violence against Transgender Citizens as an LGBT Community. I am sorry the Transgender Community has grown, it no longer needs the LGB Community... our continued relationship is an abusive and one sided one. It truly pains me to say it, I truly hate hurting anyone... but we need allies that are real allies in the coming years and I am sickened by the attacks on lesbians and gay men to the point I can no longer see the Transgender Community as a healthy ally. I want a divorce. ",1501545923

Pharah's Rocket Barrage deals INSANE amount of damage at a concentrated area. And what makes this effective is Pharah's ability to utilize it in different angles.

No one other hero in the game has greater movement capabilities than Pharah. What does this mean? She can shoot it at you from the Skybox or do a sneak attack from the outside window looking into the objective, something no other hero is capable of.

Now imagine, what if she didn't take self-inflicting damage? *phewwweeee*, glad that's not in the game. She would be overpowered as hell! That means Pharah has the damage of a Reaper at close range as she can get in your face with no self-damage. And she would effectively be a flying Junkrat/Reaper/Tracer. Huh, fuck that.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Person C should have a reasonable expectation that sleeping with a married person with children will cause harm to people. Person C could be convinced by cheating Person B that no harm will come of it, but that's still a conversation that should be happening between Person C and Person B so that both of them are on the same page about not hurting other people. 

Human sexuality is a lot more complicated than leave it to beaver and human relationships can get pretty twisted and so long as everyone knows what's up - no one has to get hurt. But if you *know* that what you're doing is going to hurt people, then you have an obligation not to - maybe not legally but *morally*. I don't have a problem saying it's morally know to knowingly cause harm to other people. It doesn't matter what you want to pin ""the cause"" on, this doesn't have to be a court of law. It's the court of a couple's marriage, you don't get off on a technicality. 

Just as a recommendation, try watching [In the Mood for Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxUqmjdqVzk) - (*I don't know why the whole movie is up on youtube, I'm not trying to pirate it's just literally right there on the front page of search results*).

But just in general, the returns on star players being traded is never good, you always get young players and draft picks, you never get a blue chip player. The Love-for-Wiggins trade has a LeBron-sized asterisk next to it, because doing that trade was a condition upon him coming back. Furthermore, the fact that these 2 trades happened so recently, teams negotiating with Cavs can tell them that that is the market for an All-Star that's been set. 

Really, the only negotiating power the Cavs have is they have to really sell the idea that this is not broken between Kyrie and LeBron, and that they can actually hold onto Kyrie for this season, because I don't think anybody around the league believes they will. ",1501545925

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","A quick correction, LotV saw the boost in SC2 numbers, not drop. Prior to LotV at a summit we learned SC2's numbers had stayed the same since around 2013. Co-op has grown that number and now co-op is more popular than ladder. For most LotV is considered the best version of the game, especially for non-ladder players with the addition of co-op and improvements to the Arcade.

As for the multiple expansion idea, near the end of each expansion viewership and player numbers dropped. With only one expansion that came one year after the main game (following WC2, SC1 and WC3) then SC2 would be even worse off due to this decline. Also the loss of added units to multiplayer would add stagnation. Throw in the fact there is no way the story of SC2 could be told in the much smaller campaigns of the old style and we'd have a much worse campaign.",1501545926

When you create a bitcoin address you're basically generating a random number, then hashing it (making a new number from the first number) then adding a prefix to it so that the network recognizes it as a valid address. 

When you send your bitcoins to this new address you're just telling the network that you've signed ownership from address 1 to a new address 2, if you can prove you own the keys to address 2 then you can move them to another new address. 

You even send bitcoins to address which are valid, but who no one knows the random number which made them.

Did that help it have I made things worst? Basically the network confirms the address looks correct, if you generate sit yourself you can prove it and spend funds sitting there",1501545928

"forwardsfromgrandma","t5_2t776","&gt; Continuing a war isn't treason.

No, it is not. But sabotaging government efforts to end a war I'd imagine could be argued is attempting to levy more war against the US. But you're right, I could be wrong. LBJ himself believed the actions to be treason (of course that counts for nothing from a legal standpoint).

&gt; When did reagan give aid to Iran?

As /u/Commissar_Sae already indicated the aid came in the form of weapons. The Iranian forces at the time were supplied with American equipment from their time under the Shah and needed supplies that Reagan would later illegally supply. That aid was provided to them in return for their cooperation in holding the hostages for a while longer. Abolhassan Banisadr, who was Iranian President at the time, in a 1992 interview said:

&gt; It is now very clear that there were two separate agreements, one the official agreement with Carter in Algeria, the other, a secret agreement with another party, which, it is now apparent, was Reagan. They made a deal with Reagan that the hostages should not be released until after Reagan became president. So, then in return, Reagan would give them arms. We have published documents which show that US arms were shipped, via Israel, in March, about 2 months after Reagan became president.",1501545929

The diff drop uses median time past, which is the median of the last eleven blocks. The first slow block has to get six blocks deep before it will start affecting median time past.

[Here] is a table with expected block times. Block 1 is the first block mined after the fork. Note that the blocks before the fork are taken into account. The first six blocks after the fork are all at full difficulty. (It assumes 0.25% hashpower, but that doesn't change what happens to the difficulty in the first several blocks.)

Last time I tried to research this whole 'No dual citizenship' thing I couldn't find any evidence that a single person has ever had their citizenship revoked in any EU country that doesn't allow dual citizenship. It's essentially a non-issue. It's an unenforceable law. 

There's no way to prove if someone is or isn't a citizen of another country, without the cooperation of that other country. And we have no incentive to cooperate.

The point I'm making is that he already knows what choices they're going to make before he creates them. 

&gt;He also could have created everyone in such a way that they literally and physically could do nothing else but what he says to do. 

That's not what i'm talking about though.  He could eliminate evil choices and people would still be free to do as they please.  They could follow their passions, love each other, and lead a totally fulfilling life, if he can't he's not omnipotent.  Plus, he's already omniscient, so he already knows how everything plays out, is that free-will if he already knows the future?

It's being just because you set up the rules, they know they have to follow them, but they can choose either one.

You might want to consider playing with the supply valve while the toilet is howling so you can zero in on any changes that happen.

"weedstocks","t5_2zfqj","Did you read the article? Did you bother looking up the policy/data that is mentioned? 

The entire policy is based on the city's data and records showing a disparity in charges being laid for the same crimes across various races. 

&gt;What is unique to Oakland is that there was a parallel, illegal but tolerated business
environment for other people involved in the cannabis trade. **Following the California
legalization of medical cannabis in 1996 the Oakland cannabis advocacy community, which is
predominantly White, began experimenting semi-openly with various cultivation, manufacturing
and distribution business models. These activities proceeded, largely unimpeded by law or
regulatory enforcement to this present day as demonstrated in cannabis arrest rates by race.**
The City's support of this sector was so well known that in 2012 the federal government did not
inform the Oakland Police Department in advance of its raid on symbolic Oaksterdam
University, one of the few exceptions to the freedom of enforcement enjoyed by this cannabis
business community. 

...

&gt;The **differing enforcement policies** described above had concrete and lasting effects on
Oakland's community.

Conservatism means slow to change and wanting policies based on traditional values. Well, when those traditional values are built on a foundation of racism and bigotry it's easy to see that US conservatism is primarily just an excuse to try and disciminate.

Let's see, conservatism has brought Jim Crow laws, Banned same-sex marriage, is trying to discriminate against trans people.

Right now, the party of US conservatism has a mountain of evidence proving they have been committing racial and partisan gerrymandering.

This is no longer about people not seeing the truth, this people ignoring the truth because it's a hard pill to swallow for them. They don't want to admit that US conservatism has been taken over by bigots.",1501545934

A couple of young girls probably in their late teens  stopped by our car to inform us that a guy had been drinking and died in the next car over so we should all stop waiting for the train to move. People grumbled and exited the train. Curiosity got the best of me and I couldn't help but check it out. 

As I walked over to the next car, a group of policemen quickly marched into the car and began to perform CPR on a middle-aged looking guy who was laying on the floor of the train. A small crowd formed and several people began filming this. The officers lifted his shirt up and started furiously pushing down on his chest rhythmically. He had a large and pale beer belly. I could see his stomach fat move in waves like jello as the officers pushed his chest down, over and over. It was a comical contrast to a horrifying situation. He was an innocent child once. What suffering he must have endured in his lifetime to end up like this.

After a couple minutes I left the presumably dead man and the crowd at the platform, went shopping at the new Trader Joe's at City Point before heading home, making sure to take the 2/3 train instead of the A/C.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","OMG, We were in the upper reaches of the Underdark and had just defeated a group of Duergar with two slave Trolls. The Trolls were carrying a crystal chest that was masive and heavy for even them. It contained some sort of blood red liquid. There were magical runes sealing the chest. As the rest of the group were trying to set up a hidning place to rest up as we were pretty beat up, our Sword Mage desided that he wanted to check out the chest. He then proceeded to dispell the runes and what do you know, a necrotic Ooze slurpped out!! 

We ran, and were chased into another group of Duergar... Long story short I ended up dead after running back in to save our Ranger whom was surounded by Duergar and the ooze. I had to roll up a new character, but that's ok, I wasn't really liking Sword Mage anyhow.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No, marriage contracts say that the financial decisions you make, like staying at home or agreeing that your partner will stay at home, are joint decisions and will affect how you will be liable to support that partner if things go south. 

But the truth is that marriage is a partnership. If you don't agree with that than you are better off just paying for sex. And if you do accept it is a partnership you need to realize that you are entering into an agreement that has serious consequences. It is like you are co-signing a loan. Even after the relationship is over, you will be held responsible for the decisions (good or bad)  that you made. If you decided one partner will sacrifice their career and earning potential to stay at home, you are assuming the fact that this person staying at home has a value that is equal or more than their potential income. If you split after 10-15-20 years, there is no way this person can go back to the market and make what they would be making had they stayed in their jobs. They have no job experience. No history. And that is why you are financially responsible for them. The longer you were married the more responsible you will be.

Re prenups voided: I don't feel anything. It is simple reality. Prenups are not routinely voided, when they are, there is usually a reasoning behind it. The law is not perfect but people who simply get married without even trying to protect their interests are playing with fire. Just as the people who decide/ accept to stay home when so much shit can happen that will leave you in a bad situation.",1501545937

"footballmanagergames","t5_2s0w5","**Hi, /u/MrSlowFlow_. This post has been automatically removed as it did not contain one of the required tags. Your post must contain at least one of the following tags...**

**If you need advice/help with something, post in the Daily Help/Advice Thread that is stickied at the top of the subreddit. Posts asking for help/advice will be removed.**

**[Screenshot] -** For if you want to share a screenshot with the sub. This could be of a player that you found, an amazing result you got, or anything else you might want to share. 

**[Video] -** For if you want to share an amazing goal, a funny celebration, glitched animations, or anything else you record. Playthrough videos/series are not allowed, as they too have their own sticky post at the top of the subreddit. 

**[Meta] -** Used only when you want to discuss something to do with the subreddit rather than the game. For example, you can use this if you have suggestions on how to make the subreddit better.

**[Meme] -** I mean, you know what a meme is. Previously they were not allowed but they are now. If you post a meme about the game, please tag it. 

**[LFG] -** LFG stands for ""Looking For Game"". You would use this tag if you are looking for online games with someone, either short or long term. Keep in mind that online saves generally do not work out, do not last, and usually only work with real life friends, room mates, or class mates. 

**[Discussion] -** This tag is used on posts where you would like to discuss the game(s) in general, rather than a specific part of the game. Examples of where this would be used might be in posts about an upcoming Football Manager game, news regarding Football Manager, or posting a sale that you have found for a Football Manager game.

**[Experiment] -** This tag is used if you are posting the results of an in-game experiment you have conducted. Please do not use this tag to ask people if they would like to see a certain experiment, these will just be removed. Also, please post the results of the experiment in a self post (ie, don't just upload 100 screenshots to imgur and then link the album). [This is a good example of how to structure your experiment results post](https://www.reddit.com/r/footballmanagergames/comments/5sth2z/experiment_what_if_barcelona_and_real_madrid/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage). Add in links to images whre necessary.  

**[Story] -** If you want to post about something that happened in your save, or want to tell a story about the game or your save, then use this tag.

**[Guide] -** Made a guide, or found a guide that you think would be useful? Use this tag.

**[Database] -** Use this tag only if you have made the database yourself and want to share it with people. Don't share other peoples' databases.

**[Misc] -** For posts about the game that do not fall under any of the above categories.

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"food","t5_2qh55","this was my first time making this and I made it based off how I make my mac and cheese so here goes/I measure off my eye:

ingredients:
5 tbsp of Butter

4 cloves of garlic (diced)
3 chili peppers (diced)
1/2 white onion (diced; also fairly small onion)
1/2 green pepper (diced)
1/2 red pepper (diced)

1/2 cup of flour (if even that, you might not use it all)
2 cups of milk
3 1/2 cups of Shredded 4 Cheese Pizza (mozzarella, parm, provolone &amp; romano; local supermarket)
salt &amp; pepper to taste

Put a large sauce pan on medium low heat, add 4 tbsp of butter until melted, then add in all veggies at once, stir until cloves are kind of yellowish, and the chili seeds have a golden brown color.

Slowly add flour until you get a somewhat creamy consistency while you stir (I used a whisk, but a spoon or even a fork works fine), if it dries up (which it will) simply add the rest of butter. Once flour and butter are combined add both cups of milk and make sure to stir until combined and you get a nice golden creamy color to the milk.

Slowly add cheese, while stirring until you get a nice and creamy yet thick sort of consistency (may have to turn the fire up a tad but not too much). And voila, you're now saucy.

The next step would be to add in your bacon, pasta and chicken (in that order is how I did it) and fold it into the sauce on medium high heat, then add finely chopped basil leaves for garnish and enjoy!

I would pay off the student loans right now. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, go directly to your student loan servicer's website and pay it all off.

The I would go to your 401(k) company's site and increase your contribution to max it out, whatever percentage gets you to $18k/yr. You'll have to adjust it again in January, because this year is already half over.

If you're already spending only 50% of your income, I highly recommend reading [this article](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/). Check out /r/financialindependence if that sounds interesting to you.

But since you're not me and you have plans to buy a house, I'd suggest you increase your 401(k) contributions to 15% and save the rest in the highest interest-bearing savings account you can find for a downpayment. Ally is usually the one recommended around here, but I think other banks/credit unions have been raising their interest rates lately, it pays to look around.",1501545939

"formula1","t5_2qimj","You're providing outlets for drivers within certain development camps a seat. For instance, the Mercedes Benz F1 team only has two seats but they may have four drivers in their academy who are worthy of a seat. Deals may be struck around PU components in exchange for those seats.

Secondly, the junior teams aren't designed to remain at the back. It's a matter of resources to develop their car. 

Also to clarify, your NBA example isn't 100% correct (I'm an avid NBA fan and a season ticket holder). The NBA has a Development League, conveniently named the D-League, where players who can't make an NBA roster go to hone their skills. Each of these teams are subsidiaries of a current NBA team and are technically under contract for those teams. ",1501545944
"formula1","t5_2qimj","I think the way ""junior"" teams are usually created is somewhat different to what you are explaining. For one, in general, what you are describing does happen in F1: a newcomer comes in, and instead of getting hired by a big team right away, they dont want him-they want him to gain experience and prove that they are good. Then comes Toro Rosso, which essentially was created for RB to have a specific place where to put they juniour personnel, not just drivers. Then come other teams, that essentially want to have the same thing, but they go on about it a little differently. They have their own drivers, but still want them to prove themselves. They do this by making sure a small team hires them, by for example giving them cheaper engines. This is the case of Sauber for example. Sauber might want to take someone else due to their skills, but change their mind because they get something extra for taking on a specific driver of a bigger team. Essentially, this junior stuff is just big players setting up their drivers to be proven and essentially more skillful by driving at the back rather than the front of the grid. I would compare it with car development - do we need it? Well, essentially no, but it is here. Same way with people.",1501545944

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","So much is dependent on the amount of precision in drafting.  If there's a clear, unambiguous statement that Barcelona have an obligation to pay him 26M on August 1st, I would be skeptical of any argument that the obligation is conditional on any actions after the point where the obligation is triggered.  And if the lawyer is smart, they'll ensure those terms and obligations survive termination of the agreement unless Neymar materially breaches the contract.

The big factor that I would suspect is critical to any ruling would be whether exercising a buyout clause is something that represents bad faith or a breach on the part of the player.  In other words, the contract provides Neymar a mutually agreed method and compensation figure in order to legally terminate his employment contract without any additional penalty (sporting or civil).  So how can it be argued that he is in breach of the contract?  If he's not in breach, how would Barcelona be justified in withholding any payment they were obligated to make under the terms of the contract?

""This is how we lose lobbies, everybody needs to kick""... says the guy. No text to introduce or explain, just hostile.

I saw what I needed, and have never bothered to apply.

Beyond the overarching fundamentals that there is near universal consensus on, the differences are in the *details*. There's no doubt that there are topics like music in which there are differences in opinion. The fact is, as long as you have 2 people on this planet, you will have 2 different opinions on something. Part of Islam is that we learn how to deal with differences in such things because humans will never come to a perfect agreement simply because humans are not perfect. The Qur'an itself acknowledges that we will differ:

""Whatever you may differ about is for God to judge. [Say], ‘Such is God, my Lord. In Him I trust and to Him I turn"" 42:10

As long as the ruling one follows is given by a scholar who has done his best base it on the Qur'an and reliable hadith, then Allah does not task a soul with more than it can do. ",1501545946

I never just 'browse' Amazon but rather go there when I need to replace something, e.g. printer ink or HVAC filter.  I never go to 'deal of the day' or 'gold box' deals...just a distraction.  As with all shopping, you have to be somewhat disciplined.  If you're not sure, put an item in your cart and sit on it for day or two.  

I also recommend a couple good extensions you should have if you shop Amazon alot....Honey and The Camelizer.  Both let you check prices and The Camelizer will let you see price history and set price alerts too.  You'll change your mind on most of your impulse purchases if you can see that the current price is say, $25 more than the lowest price offered for that item.         ",1501545947

"Berserk","t5_2rru6","&gt;it's a complete misrepresentation to act like he's in complete control of his Ego

If Guts is out of control I think that would support what I'm saying of his character.

&gt;He largely isn't in control of his own actions because the rage took over his Id.

And here it is again. When Guts does something, it magically isn't actually him doing it. He is completely blameless. 'He' isn't even doing it! Also I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of Id. Rage doesn't take Id over, your Id is your rage or rather your lust for blood and sex. Not that anyone takes Freud seriously anymore anyhow.

&gt;All you do is post the parts the support your view of what you want Guts to be.

Yes, that's how people people argue, debate and discuss. If you can't counter my claims that should tell you something. Oh and by the way, it isn't how I want Guts to be, it is how Guts is.

&gt;You don't show the struggle he's had with the rage that literally takes over his Ego.

You keep dissecting his mind as though one part of it has nothing to do with the other. Gut's Id and his Ego are BOTH him. When you get prosecuted, there is no ""my Id made me do it"" defense out there for you. You are responsible for all your actions regardless if you are under the influence, tricked, heavily influenced, or otherwise. It is quite sad to see you think of Guts as blameless because his Id made him do it. But it is up to Guts to not let his Id take over, just as it is up to all of us. Similarly it is up to us to stay sober, to educate ourselves enough not to be sitting ducks, to not blindly follow people etc. You are responsible for your own actions. Period.

&gt;Guts isn't just some angry guy with a short temper. There is a literal beast of rage trying to take over his Ego.

Yes one that he created, one that is literally a part of him and therefore one that he is 100% responsible for and accountable for. To point out Guts' craziness or rage is hardly a defense.

&gt;What are you talking about?

The fact that Guts feels as though his current companions are **replacements** of those he lost. There is only a giant glaring panel in the manga about that. So no, what you said is incorrect.

&gt;Allowing yourself to get to know someone builds bonds and makes you more open to them in return. 

You can say whatever you want but Guts didn't open up to Schierke in that moment so that is not an example of Guts opening up. Was he building a bond? Sure. Are they the same thing? Obviously not.

&gt;First of all, as I've said before, the reason Guts is so closed is because of his past. Secondly, even if he was going to completely open up to someone, why would it be a child?

I never said anything about completely opening up. And again you can say whatever you want, teaching someone a simple battle move isn't opening up to them anymore than a math teacher teaching you how to add and subtract is. That just is not intimate/personal information. The fact that these are the greatest examples you have of Guts 'opening up' basically proves my point. Next you'll cite him saying hello or waving to them as proof.

&gt;On one hand, we have multitudes of examples and evidence that Guts past is the reason he is such a closed person. And on the other we have your personal opinion.

Nice false dichotomy.

&gt;Guts psychology is very obviously based on the Freudian theory of Ego vs Id.

First it's not Id vs Ego. It is Id versus SuperEgo. Second Freud isn't taken seriously anymore in academia, his work is primitive. It would be like trying to explain biodiversity using Lamarckism. Third, there is nothing very obvious about psychology which is why you probably like to talk about it so much (because it is mostly speculation). Let's talk about objective things. What does Guts do? We don't truly know what he thinks especially because he so rarely opens up to anyone.

&gt;Yes, he probably will.

I'll take that as a no. The fact that you have to say ""probably"" ought to tell you something about this character that you are defending like crazy as though it is perfect and can do no wrong. Out of all the things you said this is the first hint of doubt you display? Telling indeed.

&gt;I was being rhetorical.

Nothing rhetorical about it. That's called being creepy.

&gt;Griffith isn't Griffith any more. He's Femto, one of the literal embodiments of evil. There is no more debate about who Griffith is. He doesn't even exist any more, which he himself admits when he says he feels nothing and ""is free"" while looking at Guts, his former best friend.

Oh good now we are getting someplace. I will commend you a little because you at least recognize Griffith and Femto are not the same, but then you should also recognize that Femto and the Absolute (incarnated Femto) are not the same either. As a ""literal embodiment of evil"" he has saved both Caska and Guts' life even though they are rightfully his sacrifices. Saved the planet from Ganishka, stopped his reign of terror on the world and created a paradise on Earth. Guts on the other hand, has done how much to make up for his past? Smiled? Kept himself from strangling the handicap for a few weeks? I guess it is obvious then that Guts is the morally superior one!",1501545949

"formula1","t5_2qimj","From what I understand, nothing is explicitly holding Toro Rosso back from being as good as Red Bull, other than the fact that all of their drivers are contracted to Red Bull so Red Bull gets dibs on which driver goes where. It's just that Red Bull's budget is much bigger (mainly thanks to their past success), so they will tend to get the better cars simply because they can spend more. But STR operates completely independently of RBR, so other than driver choice, there's nothing that says they have to come in behind Red Bull. If Toro Rosso somehow ends up with the quicker car despite the lower budget (sort of like Force India vs Williams), it's not like RBR can go up to them and say, ""Hey, your car is better than ours.

Plus the dragons they come from are different. Nohr's family is direct descendants of the Dusk Dragon while Hoshido is from the dawn dragon. Also, Corrin is really special. You haven't played revelations or any dlc, so I won't spoil that for you.

Chrom is similar yet different from Corrin. Chrom advocates or peace, but he knows when he needs to fight. He doesn't actively avoid it either. He tries, but fails most of the time. Corrin is more or less forced into every fight. I'm not sure if Lissa is a correct cross character, since she seems rather uncharacterized when it comes to the views on fighting and war. I think Emmeryn is a more correct example, and would've fit Corrin's character better since she works to correct her father's sins.

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","I'm not the person you're responding too, but people generally aren't demanding that San Diego owes them affordable housing. There's a difference between affordable housing and housing affordability. Affordable housing usually refers to housing that is available to families with an income of a certain % of the poverty line. The availability and pricing of this kind of housing is up to the government, and not everybody can qualify, and many who do qualify will be put on wait lists until space becomes available. The government controls this sphere directly, by purchasing properties for the purpose of providing affordable housing, contracting with landlords to provide affordable housing, giving subsidies for housing, and requiring that new developments set aside a % of their units for affordable housing or pay a fee.

Housing affordability on the other hand is driven not by government but by supply and demand. If there's a high demand for housing and a low supply then property values go up. That is part of the reason why housing is so unaffordable in San Diego, because demand is high and supply is low. The issue is that the government has made it next to impossible to build housing for median income households. There's a lot of red tape, the amount of money developers have to spend just to build anything is very high, and zoning laws limit where and how they can build. The only way for a developer to make a profit is building luxury homes/condos for the upper class, but median income families are left out. 

The government doesn't have to make housing affordable, it just has to get out of the way for housing to be built. Increased supply would drop prices. It's always going to be more expensive to live in San Diego, its the sunshine tax. Demand will always be high. The issue is that supply is being artificially suppressed. ",1501545949

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","This is where i agree with you but not in the way you want.

The biggest practical difference that the chip makes is that it distinguishes it from the other products in the market. It wont make a big difference in the picture quality. The only way you'd be able to claim that the dedicated chip makes a practical difference is if you took a large set of users spanning the range of familitiry with picture quality and do a blind test. I can almost guarantee that the number of people who could truly tell the difference between a photo with a dedicated chip and software is extremely low. The performance gain may be more in os or something else but that also will be negligible and hard to truly distinguish with a large set of people.

The biggest difference that the chip makes is that it will allow the manufacturer to upcharge the​ overall cost of the device or not (see below). It will also allow them to heavily market the company's position on the dedication for high quality picture. You see this with apples ""shot on iphone"" ads. Even in those ads the picture is likely taken in a very controlled environment and with extra hardware not available to the everyday consumer. Youve to understand that a for profit company will not likely add a feature to benefit the consumer only out of a purely selfless act. They will upcharge or take a cut to heavily market the feature to distinguish the product from other products and to gain marketshare. 

And in the end. you have to practically be able to distinguish the picture taken on a chip vs software only phone. And what youll see is thats its really really hard to do that. So its practically not much of a difference. Theyre all very high quality.",1501545951

And keep an open mind to what they teach! But also stay true to what you know works and doesn't work for you. It's a fine line, but neither resist any recovery ideas irrational nor allow yourself to be lured into doing a recovery system that really isn't right for you. I know this seems abstract, but it's my opinion that it's important for people to consider all their recovery options and choose a program that will work for them. 

Above all, remember that you are primarily in rehab to get away from alcohol long enough to get a clear head. What counts most is what you do with your newly cleared head when you get *out*. Use it. Lay down a plan for life post-rehab while you're there, and stick to it when you get out. 

I went to rehab last year and stayed sober for 13 months afterward, and that's what worked for me. Fwiw.

We'd get enthusiastic about the recent translations of Linear B, and argue the best way to translate Etruscan.

And so we'd sit in a ditch of corpses in a World War, and discuss the world's languages, and how poets say that life is more than death, and how soldiers shout that the smoke above a battle-field resembles angels.

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","I'll give you the advice that worked for me. 

Don't go cold turkey. 

Don't go from being a person who indulges In food and doesn't exercise to a person with an extremely strict diet who exercises every day. 

If you want the change to be forever then you need to do it gradually. 

Write down what you wish your lifestyle would be 

Example: 

I wish I was a person who eats only 1500 calories a day consisting only of veggies and meat (no grains/ carbs / dairy) and exercises every day for an hour. 

Then wrote down what your lifestyle is right now

Example: 

I eat 3000 calories a day mostly breads, cheeses, and candy. 


Then make a plan of how over the course of a determined amount of time (maybe a year) how you will get there. 

Example: week one I will start exercising for 20 minutes 3 times a week, and switch from white flour to whole grain

Week two I will start exercising for 20 minutes 4 times a week, eat while grains, and limit my candy intake to only one treat a week. 

Etc etc. 

You keep failing because you are trying to be someone who you are not yet. But you can be that person you wish to be over time. Don't rush it. It took me a decade to go from 250 pounds to 150 and I failed a lot along the way because I kept trying to do ""diets"" and at home exercise programs like p90x which  was way too hard for me at the time.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Technically yes, if we go by the timeline of the Bible.

So the speed in which light travels is measured in light years. The farthest visible star we can see through a telescope is 13.3 billion light years away from earth. So if we know that a light year is just how far light travels in one year (about 5.88 trillion miles a year) then we can conclude that this star was emitting light 13.3 billion years ago and that the light has traveled 13.3 billion years multiplied by 5.88 trillion miles. 

The Bible says that in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. I'm sure some could argue that the heavens mean the other galaxies and planets in the universe, which might be what it meant. But, based on the Bible, scientists have concluded that earth cannot be older than 16,000 years old. Again that is how old the Bible says the earth is. If this is the case then nothing in the universe would be older than that. But if a source of light 13.3 billion light years away is visible through a telescope then that would mean the universe is at least 13.3 billion years old. Because when we look at something x light years away we are seeing how it looked x years ago. And if the heavens and the earth were created at the same time then nothing would be older than the earth. 

It's when I realized this that I also started to believe that there's no way the God in the Bible could exist. The universe is so crazy that a small part of me still believes a deity is what could have created us, but then I say it to myself and again just don't believe that could at all be the case.

"LibertarianDebates","t5_2tvku","&gt;First we have to establish definitions, which is exactly what I'm trying to do

No, I explained what you have been doing already. Look up like, 5 posts. Its right there. You haven't tried to establish one single definition yet.

&gt;So let's start with how libertarianism is compatible -- opportunity, as I'm defining it, is all avenues to a possibly (not guaranteed) successful outcome. 

I see. So, you say that people have equal numbers (or roughly equal, I'll accept a closies count here) of avenues to successful outcomes, no matter their circumstances at birth? 

&gt;Regulatory barriers are the low-hanging fruit under libertarianism, natural barriers are nearly impossible to remove.

Yes, natural barriers are much harder. Perhaps that's why such overelaborate systems have been set up in an attempt to do so.

&gt; I would classify ""startup capital"" as a natural barrier,

&gt;lack of capital doesn't create a barrier to entry,

""I'm trying to establish definitions"", you wanna define barriers to entry, here you are saying something both IS and IS NOT a barrier to entry. You aren't very good at this definition thing, are you? 

&gt; To clarify, if the startup costs for a franchise is $10,000 -- it doesn't matter if I have $1 or $1,000,000 in the bank; it's still $10,000. Having the money makes it easier, but not having it doesn't mean it's impossible so I fail to see the inequality when it's the same opportunity at the same price for everyone.

You don't see the inequality? Between one person being $9,999 short, and one person having an extra $990,000? What definition are we working with if THAT is equal? That's like saying I have an equal shot at kissing Scarlett Johansson as Chris Pratt does. Its possible it could happen. Right?

&gt;I'm still trying to figure out where you think libertarianism grants opportunity to some and not others?

Where did I say that? I'm saying that some get much easier opportunities than others. You have said that yourself several times here. Its not like the poor have no opportunities under many systems, just some are much easier for them. 

&gt;(to my original point) someone, somewhere with little-to-nothing had to earn that money.

And that has little to nothing to do with this. Just because your grandad earned a bunch of money doesn't mean you should have a free ride. Your original point is completely off topic.

&gt;in a few generations we'd be right back to this topic unless you also remove all market forces, inflation and individual interests being pursued.

Under libertarianism, that is an absolute certainty. Money leads to money (as you say, then say you didn't say, then say again...). But some systems let people get out from the bottom easier than others. Libertarianism doesn't sound like one of those. Other systems at least recognize this as a flaw in the system, but under libertarianism its almost treated as a feature.",1501545961

&gt; The Veil is a 2016 American supernatural horror film directed by Phil Joanou and written by Robert Ben Garant.

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Ken W. Hanley of Fangoria described the premise – that Jim Jones could have been right – as intriguing, but he said the rest of the film does not live up to the premise. Citing Jane's acting, Hanley concluded, ""Overall, even if it doesn't fully connect, The Veil is an ultimately-fascinating horror effort that is worth a watch."" Matt Donato of We Got This Covered rated it 2\.5\/5 stars and wrote, ""The Veil's constant visual greyness highlights the mundane nature of this supernatural cultism flick, even in recognizing Thomas Jane's wonderfully-demented antagonist."" Staci Layne Wilson of Dread Central rated it 3\/5 stars and wrote, ""The Veil could have been a truly-scary supernatural thriller about the power of a collective consciousness, but instead it's just a halfway-decent time waster that's mostly memorable for Jane's performance.""

&gt; We conservatives mocked Barack Obama&amp;#039;s failure to deliver on his pledge to change the tone in Washington even as we worked to assist with that failure.

&gt; Michael Gerson, a con&amp;shy;servative columnist and former senior adviser to President George W. Bush, wrote, four months into the new presidency, &amp;quot;The conservative mind, in some very visible cases, has become diseased,&amp;quot; and conservative institutions &amp;quot;With the blessings of a president have abandoned the normal constraints of reason and compassion.""

&gt; Where does such capitulation take us? If by 2017 the conservative bargain was to go along for the very bumpy ride because with congressional hegemony and the White House we had the numbers to achieve some long-held policy goals-even as we put at risk our institutions and our values-then it was a very real question whether any such policy victories wouldn&amp;#039;t be Pyrrhic ones.

1) The Patterns &amp; Characteristics of Codependence on the Codependents Anonymous website (I used to be able to provide links, but so doing requires a lot of review-&amp;-approval labor by the moderators here, and one can find all of these with good search engines);

2) ""The Five Stages of Recovery"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com and ""Sternberg's Nine Types of Love"" to see where one is in them;

7) Every so often rereading ""Jiddu Krishnamurti on Loneliness vs. Being Alone"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com, further quoting a young Krishnamurti on being *alone* vs. being *lonely*; 

8) Practicing some thought questioner &amp; mindfulness inducer like the ""10 StEPs of Emotion Processing"" at pairadocks.blogspot.com, so that one is able to continue to *sense* what is going on and know what to do about it;

9) Carefully reading the lyrics while listening to Alanis Morrissette's CD / MP3, ""Jagged Little Pill"";

10) Pia Mellody's book, *Facing Codependence*;

Body transfer illusion is the illusion of owning either a part of a body or an entire body other than one's own, thus it is sometimes referred to as ""body ownership"" in the research literature. It can be induced experimentally by manipulating the visual perspective of the subject and also supplying visual and sensory signals which correlate to the subject's body. For it to occur, bottom-up perceptual mechanisms, such as the input of visual information, must override top-down knowledge that the certain body (or part) does not belong. This is what results in an illusion of transfer of body ownership.

But the oscillating mode is nuts, it creates a steady drone that you tune with the density control, it can go from pretty low to very high pitched. The cool part is your playing meshes with the drone, it can temporarily override it too before being overtaken by the drone for very glitchy sounds. The coolest part is your instruments volume also tunes the pitch! So you can play a note and mess with your volume to do crazy stuff with the pitch of the fuzz!

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; Europe is underfunding its military.

Just because the US overspends on military does not mean that the EU is underfunding its military.

&gt; Yes they could mobilize their society to a war economy, but they're completely unprepared for a first strike.

First strike by whom exactly? Russia? Russia's army is 50% the size of the EU's combined forces, and spends 1/3rd what the EU spends on the military. The EU is totally prepared for a first strike by Russia, that's basically what the European military is for.

&gt; Hell France and Italy couldn't even handle Libya, they ran out of munitions.

They didn't run out of munitions, they simply said that maintaining bombings at the intense rate they were was unsustainable because they didn't have enough *laser-guided missiles*, which is what was used in those missions. Their stockpiles quickly depleted but never ran out, and they were forced to ask Germany to restock them.

However I don't think that proves anything, because the EU as a whole didn't run out of laser guided missiles, only two countries did. It would be like asking Texas and Pennsylvanian to fight on behalf of the whole United States, and then say that the US has an underfunded military because they had to ask Virginia for some laser-guided missiles before they ran out.

&gt; You're arguing potential lives saved VS lives directly ended.

No I'm not, because the figures that you likely have in mind regarding 'communist deaths' are largely deaths from starvation. So it is totally fair to point out that capitalism, still to this day, actually causes far higher levels of starvation than communism supposedly did. And like I said, many millions of the deaths attributed to 'communism' are **abortions**, and/or completely fabricated.

If you dispute this please cite me a source for these deaths that supposedly make communism the most lethal ideology ever, according to yourself?

&gt; You talk like a troll and a child, I'm not avoiding your arguments, I'm avoiding you.

You're avoiding me? Why would you then respond to what I said two times with insults? Really mature are you?

I would just like to add that the US doesn't want the EU to have a strong army, it's why the US has threatened to force the EU out of Nato if it goes ahead with its plan for a unified EU army, which when complete would instantly make the EU the second most powerful nation in the world and an instant superpower. It isn't in the interests of the US for the EU to be a challenger on the world stage. You're mistaken if you think otherwise, and that's part of the reason the UK and US have worked so hard to hamstrung the EU's military capabilities.

&gt; No I just don't argue with people who call me trumpets, and say I'm brainwashed by the media without any more context, and say wake up bro.

Why are you offended that I called you a Trumpet? You are aren't you? I looked at your comment history just below this comment string you posted on the_donald. So I was right, you are a Trumpet. Damn, you guys are right, winning this much sure does feel great...

&gt; and say I'm brainwashed by the media without any more context

Dude I told you why you're brainwashed, I did give you context. I will repeat it: thinking that communism is the most lethal ideology to ever exist. Not that Communism was ever achieved of course, and yes Soviet Russia and Maoist China was terrible, I agree, but Socialism/Communism/whatever you want to call it *definitely was not the most lethal ideology in history*. And that's by a very big margin man.

&gt; I'm not arguing with a child, I have better things to do.

Alright, guess I won't be hearing back from you then. Or if I do it will likely be an insult, rather than using your superior intellect and maturity to explain to my infantile and retarded brain why actually the EU is underfunded as the second most powerful force in the world, and why communism actually was the most lethal ideology in the world more lethal than nationalism, religion, or racism.

Clinton was the worst Democrat to court young voters and she will not be representing the Party in 2018.

Point is, if everyone has access to the same stuff in decade A, and one player is head and shoulders above the rest; versus everyone having access to the same stuff in decade B, and one player is arguably better than everyone else, the dominant player from decade A can still be considered as more dominant. Hopefully I phrased that where it makes sense.

Basically, it shouldn't matter that Gretzky's peers didn't have advanced technology to catch him, because he didn't have advanced technology himself. Gretzky was far more dominant against his peers than Crosby is against his. To me it doesn't matter what tools they had access to in their respective generations, I think ranking players by how much they dominated against their peers rather than looking at caveats like training regiments makes more sense.",1501545965

You're probably going to think I'm a little bit stupid as I express this, but I don't care. I'm just so happy to have framed it in a way I **finally** really understand, for the first time ever.

For years, she has told me she likes sex. She has appeared to enjoy sex. And she has told me she wants to have it more often, the same way I do. And I have, for years, honestly believed that she enjoys it based on her behavior in the moment. But I have been skeptical about whether she wants it more often. I've always assumed good faith when it comes to statements like that, but have been puzzled by them. Because I'm always up for it... if she likes it and wants to do it more, she literally only has to reach out to me.

And that dissonance has been eating me for a long time. I believe she likes the sex in the moment. That's really unmistakable. And I believe she's being sincere when she tells me she likes it and that she wants to do it more often. But that has left me without any way to understand why we don't actually do it more often.

This fills in that gap. I love the gym. Everything about it feels good to me. It's good for me. And I wish I'd go much more often than I do. I don't know how I never connected these dots, but I didn't until I read your analogy for the second time today.

Obviously this doesn't fix everything. Or make any difference at all outside my head, really. But it completely paves over the largest doubt I had about whether I should even be trying to improve things. I couldn't reconcile her actions with my need to assume she was speaking sincerely. And now I can.

I'll shut up about it now. But I'm **so** happy to have filled in this specific gap. It was really eating me.

Your point about needing to reassure that there's no pressure/expectations also rings true for me. I think I cheated myself out of a lot of fun closeness a few years ago, before I learned to communicate that. I think I'd go so far as to say failing to communicate that adequately was the biggest thing I did wrong to deaden our bedroom. I still kick myself over a couple of conversations several years ago where I got that very, very wrong.",1501545966

I thought that the game was just OK until I learned the Bash ability, which is when the platforming becomes really fun and satisfying and everything just clicks.

I can also safely say that the Ginzo tree sequence was my favorite escape mission in any video game ever, because of the fluidity that Mark mentions as well as that great music.

Lastly, while I did love the game I also realized by the final area that the Ginzo Tree sequence is when the game peaked for me. I personally wasn't a fan of how the late game abilities affected the gameplay (Climb, Triple Jump, Charge Jump and Dash made the platforming feel simple and almost eliminated the need to use Bash - the best ability) and how the following escape sequences felt more unfair and unforgiving. They were longer and seemed to rely more on pure memorization whereas the Ginzo Tree felt like the perfect difficulty.",1501545967

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","With the limited forms being a primary concern of the comments here, why not give the Animus a halfcaster spell slot progression table where spell slot levels are equal to a certain CR of things they can morph into? For example, a level 3 Animus would be able to morph into three creatures with a CR 1 or so.

Two things I noticed about the Disciplines. 

For the Entomology one, what does the Cocoon feature do exactly? Right now, it just seems to give you full cover but takes 10 minutes to put up. I'm guessing you meant it to heal or something? 

For the Paleontology one, the Tyrant King feature says you morph and gives some added bonuses, but it doesn't actually say what you can morph into. Is it meant to be a bigger version of one of your other shapes or are you able to morph into the T. Rex? I'm guessing it is the latter, but some clarity would be helpful here.

I haven't gone through everything, but those two things stuck out to me. I'm also not sure that the Discipline features are balanced against each other. Being able to swim and walk on land seems weaker than being able to become a CR 10 creature at level 20 for example.

All that being said, I really like the idea you have going here. I was thinking this edition needs a full morphing class and this is a great start!",1501545968

That includes larger subs like /r/worldnews which have a far more lax approach to moderating (or censorship as you like to put it), where circle jerks prevent the genuine exchange of opposing ideas and thoughtful analysis.  This sub succeeds in that regard because users demand good content and we moderate against bad content.

We respect the intelligence of users and the importance of honest discourse so we remove substandard content.  If I am a dog-walker then I pick up after my dog's mess.  I do not do so because I want to hide the fact that my dog poos or because I believe others are so stupid as to step in it.  I do so because I respect my fellow citizens (or subreddit users, in this case) and do not want the city filled with feces.

So I'm not even in any guild right now. I've talked to people like me in game chat and they also left the server and change to another server, or left the game. I've seen the top guilds recruit the top players that aren't in their guild with like BUYING THEM LUCKY TICKETS or sell the, crystal with a little amount of gold so they can get that person to join,and people fall for it bc they're top guild and thus people aren't active in the guild they were in.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Short advice: talk to him ;)

There may be many reasons why your man is not going down on you more often. You haven't provided us with much information, so I can only give you some general advice. Some of it may be obvious or may not apply to you. There are lots of things you can do:

**Share your excitement and pleasure**:
Tell him how much you like being eaten out and how the thought om him eating you out turns you on.
When he does it, show him how much you like it (sounds, words, body language).
Afterwards, tell him how great it was.

**Help him**:
If he's not already an expert, help him out. Tell him what to do, when to slow down, when to go faster etc.

**Hygiene**:
If you're clean, and he *knows* you're clean, it's more tempting. Make sure that you've washed yourself in the morning or perhaps even right before sex and make sure he knows. If you expect him to take the initiative, he may also need to know for sure that you're not about to have your period. Guys don't always keep track of that.

**Pubic hair**:
Ask him if he likes pubic hairs or not and if it bothers him when going down on you. Some people prefer a hairy beaver and feel that a freshly shaved pussy is vulgar. Others think that pubic hair is gross and are turned of when they get it in their mouthes. There's nothing wrong with either preference.

**Dominance**:
Some guys like to be dominant in bed, to feel powerful and in charge. Others like that the woman is in charge, tells him what to do, mounts his face etc. Find out what works best.

**Seduction**:
Foreplay and seduction is important if you want cunnilingus to feel like a reward for him instead of a chore or ritual.

**Be your best**:
If a man doesn't like eating you out (yet!), it can be that little things that make a big difference. Shave your legs, make your hair look good, put on sexy clothes etc. and stay fit. The more turned on he is, the more likely he is to want to eat you out, even if it's not really his thing.

Finally, not everyone likes eating pussy, and that's OK. But even if he doesn't like it right now, it may just be a matter of getting used to it.",1501545973

It's easier to see what is happening here, but the principal is the same:
https://bitcoinwisdom.com/markets/bitfinex/btcusd

It's super simple.  The chart is obviously the chart.  At the top you have the time interval.  1W -&gt; 1 week / candle 3D --&gt; 3 days/candle, and so on...

On the Right there are 3 sections with changing numbers.  The top is the sell orders.  You see people wanting to sell here.  The columns in the 1st section are Price &amp; Amount to sell.  The second section has the price, and the amount to get there.  So on Bitfinex, to get to $3000, you would have to buy about 3000 bitcoin (this does not include hidden orders, and should be looked at with a lot of salt.).

The middle section on the right side is the same, but for the buy orders.

The lower right section is the latest trades.  It shows the time, amount, and price.

Finally, the wavy-chart along the bottom.  I think the default is MACD.  You can ignore that for now.  Traders try to soothsay using those indicators as a guide.

This thing I had lugged around for years was more than just a useful tool, it was like an extension of my mind and body.

Everything was new and beautiful. I felt like a kid, gripped by that adventurous drive common to both childhood and psychedelic experiences. I will cherish that memory forever.

It doesn't feel right looking like someone you're not just because other people like it.

"dyinglight","t5_2xcav","Those are stupid changes. The NH Health is scaled already for 3v1 &amp;4v1 so it takes more hits to bring him down than it does in 1v1 or 2v1.

UV light works fine. It's suppose to last about as long as the stamina does when balanced. Connection issues shift that to quite some crazy degrees but normally they're not too bad. 

UV suppressor takes out flares? Are you kidding? That sounds like some whiny hunter who sits 500m away, tosses a long range UV spit, then waits for it to go off before moving only to whine that there's a flare there now. UV suppressor doesn't = free kill. That's not balance, that's wanting free easy kills. UV suppressor isn't about disabling everything so they have absolutely no counter other than a friend if they're nearby. It's about opening a chance to attack, either immediately or giving you a chance to take them out while their main defence is down. It's a competitive game that requires both parties to have defences/counters. You can ground pound flares out or take active flares out with UV suppressor. If you GP a flare they will not be able to UV and be vulnerable to a pounce for a moment. You need to be ready at that moment. 


If I was to change anything I'd make Pounce Slam knock the player back even if it fails so they can't lamp post camp without falling off, but disable the drop attack ability for a bit after being pounced otherwise that would just be unbalanced. It would also help to cancel drop attacks from people who got pounced in other situations. I think if you're going to be given a drop attack it should be earned legit by jumping at them, not just holding a button after falling off a lamp post. Either that or the human should be locked into an animation as long as the hunter can't move, so you'd be stuck on that lamp post until the hunter hits the ground. If he tries to GP like a noob right after, then go for it. 

Other then that, flares are fine. I mean if I was gonna say 1 flare only like they had for a bit, I'd say only in a 3-4v1 where others can contribute flares to those who are down, but really each individual should have a chance against a hunter as they can be separated. 2 flare limit is good because it allows you to make it through the uv suppressor duration, meanwhile a fully loaded hunter has 2x uv spit+ duration, air ground pound, and spit smash, as well as toxic to make you abandon the flare or die. Lets also not forget UV block duration x2 with the ability to turn either one of those into UV/health heal. 1 flare for a human against all that? Come on.

Probably the trickiest part will be learning all the assumptions that Rails makes about how things are named and organized. This convention-over-configuration is great once you know it because every app is set up the same way, but it means you'll spend a lot of time looking for the right file. But if you're working in it every day the knowledge just soaks in. 

The other downside to that is that very few docs/resources/tutorials tell you why things arranged as they are, or what's going on behind the scenes to make it work. They just tell you what to type. I hope you'll be working with some other Rails devs as you learn - use the questions why and how a lot. 

Using an IDE like RubyMine can be a big help, giving you the ability to ctrl-click on class names and have it open the correct file. Plus full project text search and stuff like that. 

Best of luck. Feel free to ask followup questions.",1501545979

Yes, at first it was awkward because that hour had finally hit it's stride in his absence; and when he came in he didn't know how/where to fit in.  However, once Dan got a little bit into the flow it was excellent.

Anyone else interesting in hearing Dan's responses to some of the great, off-the-wall questions that callers pose to Stu.  For example, I still want to know what 3 drinks Dan would choose on an island? (Tequila, Rum and Gravy?)

I think as a down season experiment (before NFL fires up) they should this wake and take format, allowing the callers to continue questions like that.  It builds a bit more of a connection with the audience to hear those type of responses.  It's better than the traditional local hour IMO.  More fun and laughs.

I swear, half the time HAES activists seem to be on the verge of insinuating that rational, realistic HAES debunkers are actively trying to *prevent* the morbidly obese from moving and becoming more fit.

Real ""jocks"" as well as average fit people have a better sense of their own fitness levels just by dint of being able to be self-critical and to recognize the limitations their bodies have for their relative fitness levels. That ability to be rationally self-critical is also how they improve. HAES activists with their glass egos insist that we not only lie to them about their outstanding, competitive fitness levels but also to ourselves. How does that help anyone? Not for nothing that so much of Ragen's time is spent spinning her wheels.

My kingdom for a decent owner!

##Homer Rankings

Who loves their team more than the average and who hates their team more than the average?

A positive Homer Score means that the ranker ranked their team higher than the overall ranking and a negative means they ranked them lower than the overall ranking. A 0 means they ranked them the same as the overall ranking.

*Through seventeen rankings

**[Homer Rankings](http://i.imgur.com/2v3ooEk.png)**

*Weekly Optimists*

* [](/BOS) BOS /u/fatguyANALittlecoat (+3) **[1 HoOTW]**

* [](/ATL) ATL /u/SeeYaLaterDylan (+2)  **[2 HoOTW]**

* [](/SDP) SDP /u/beso858 (+2)

* [](/COL) COL /u/drumline17 (+2)

*Weekly Pessimists*

* [](/BAL) BAL /u/cptcliche (-4) **[5 HaOTW]**

* [](/MIN) MIN /u/cardith_lorda (-4) **[3 HaOTW]**

* [](/CWS) CWS /u/puckyou (-4) **[4 HaOTW]**

*Couple of Notes*

* [](/MIL) /u/msgbonehead still holds the lead for Homer of the Year at +63 and  [](/PIT) /u/TheCaptainAndKing is the next closest with a +36. Of the Haters, [](/STL) /u/covane barely holds the edge for Hater of the Year at -55 with [](/BAL) /u/cptcliche within spitting distance at -54.

* [](/NYM) /u/Agothro and [](/STL) /u/covane are still the only rankers to have both a Homer and Hater of the Week award.

* 12 rankers had a positive Weekly Homer Score, nine rankers had a negative, and eight rankers were at ±0.  13 rankers were within the ±1 range.

* Another negative week, but only slightly this time, with a -4 Weekly Homer Score.  [**This graph**](http://i.imgur.com/G0LL3mG.png) shows how that's changed by week.  We were optimistic last week!  For comparison, [here's last year's graph.](http://i.imgur.com/TMXw8KA.png)

* Our only ranker with a ±0 Total Homer Score on the year: [](/TEX) /u/kcman011, who maintains the title from last week since they missed the vote this week.

*DISCLAIMER*

There's nothing wrong with being a homer or hater!

##Kelmon Table

Here's my **[Kelmon Stable](http://i.imgur.com/Z4XM4T8.png)** for this week.

##Loved/Hated

**[Figure 1](http://i.imgur.com/chfMlSN.png)** shows where everyone's votes are compared to the consensus for the whole season. It is read column by column. The green cells in each column are the teams that the ranker ranked higher than everyone. The red cells are the teams that the ranker ranked lower than everyone.  After a suggestion from /u/applepiedestroyer, it's now even more useful.  And colorful!

**[Figure 2](http://i.imgur.com/m8cUrna.png)** is a simpler form of that table, just showing which team each voter loved and hated more than everyone.

**[Figure 3](http://i.imgur.com/SpjKbwA.png)**, after a suggestion from /u/camly75, shows which users loved and hated each team.

"DNMSuperlist","t5_3itnw","&gt;ok: wsm go back to the past and start without a clearnet site. of course they can not do it and the fuck up [running a clearnet site in the first place] is big enough and reason alone to not list any market. markets have been shut down for smaller mistakes [e.g. ab].

You act like running a clearnet server is so incredibly hard/dangerous to do. It's really not. Anyone could put up ""clearnet servers"" for every market with a catchy domain in like 15 minutes or less per market.

&gt;market also puts itself in unnecessary danger.

Not anymore danger than posting on reddit.

&gt;running a clearnet site will always be more dangerous than not running one at all.

Yeah, to the customer it will always be a very bad security risk. But to the market, it's not anymore dangerous than posting on reddit.

&gt;leaving traces with the registration

I'm going to guess you're talking about domain and hosting registration. This process still isn't anymore dangerous than logging into reddit for the market owner. You simply find a registrar, and hosting company that are fine with a Tor connection and register them in much the same way you would create a reddit account. 

It's not like this takes soooo much effort/time.

&gt;timestamps of logins in the clearnet server

Which is the same as logins to a reddit account. If law enforcement wanted, they could get a subpoena for a reddit account and get all of the latest logins that have been kept.

If you're talking about logins from whoever is using the clearnet server: sure this attack is technically possible, but easily detected. It's overly complicated for something like a gateway (where it's arguable if LE could even legally make changes like this.)

&gt; what modifications have been made on the clearnet server

Sure, if they went to the effort to create an actual server setup. But again, you're acting like someone would go out of their way to put a bunch of effort into something that would be secure (web side) with a managed setup and 15 minutes of effort. Hosting a gateway is nothing like hosting a hidden service.

&gt; [law enforcement can find loopholes there and check if they exist in the real market server too]

Answered this above, but in the event you're actually talking about the market software:

This is a gateway, no market software would be present.

&gt;it is like listing a ticking bomb for the community

At least this ticking time bomb could have implementations in place that make it soooooo much better than the current crappy run of markets. It wouldn't matter if their server got seized/they were arrested if the market was setup correctly.

&gt; might come back under a new name and a complete different setup / design / writing style / . . . and we might not spot that the new market is wsm.

They've complied with everything else so far, so it's really not that crazy of an idea that they might put in the effort to do this too.

&gt;I think it is worth taking that small risk over listing the blatant threat that wsm poses to the dnm community.

That's an opinionated risk, and should really be reviewed by the other mods too. But we don't see them on this discussion.

&gt;I also think that since wsm is doing so well they will npot go through the hassle of re-branding just to get on the superlist.

The super list is one of the biggest gateways to the market. They'd be losing one of the best places for advertising by not doing this.",1501545987

"movies","t5_2qh3s","That would be epic and Stalingrad deserves a proper treatment in Western film after being neglected mostly (bar the pretty shaky Enemy at the Gates), and you could say the same for much of the Eastern Front.

One thing though, and sorry if I've misunderstood you here; I'm not sure that stripping away the context completely and just showing loveable characters on both sides get blown away, and isn't it all so tragic, is a good idea. Rather it might be better to demonstrate the reality as it was, and let that speak for itself, for two reasons:

1. Authenticity is more important than showing the war to be a universally cynical exercise even more so than it often was. The war doesn't need to be sensationalised which is what tends to happen when filmmakers go for the most cynical version of a historical event. We all know already that its a grim enough experience not to need this.
2. The removal of political/historical context is somewhat unfair on the Soviet side and would give Western viewers especially the impression that there is any debate as to who was right or just - the Soviets were terrible but the Germans were very clearly in the wrong, anything that tried to subvert this would actually *not* be an accurate portrayal. The war itself was to facilitate the worst acts of genocide in human history. I've seen before how easy it is for poorly done portrayals of WW2 in Europe to create the impression in people removed from the event that Nazism wasn't central to the war, and that the conduct of the army was somehow completely isolated. 

The movie shouldn't soapbox or moralise more than is due, if at all, but one of the most negative impacts history based movies have when done poorly is to spread inaccurate ideas about whole swathes of history. Often by accident too. Think about it this way - if Hollywood movies about the Western Allies involvement often don't hold back in portraying the evils of Nazism and why it was important to beat them, isn't it quite offensive to deny the Soviet's the same courtesy? Given that they literally faced a kind of annihilation that the British, French and especially American's didn't. This doesn't mean whitewashing the barbarity of the USSR by the way, I'm just saying that the symbol of their survival against the genocidal invasion to end all genocidal invasions probably deserves a bit better.

That lead's me onto another problem with being totally cynical about it. Representing the most important (arguably anyway) Allied victory of the war as a cynical struggle where people who are naturally good are turned into monsters, with stripped down historical context, and where nothing is gained or there is no tangible light beyond the clouds to it all, no redemption, is really a pretty big disservice to the importance of the event if not done carefully. If we're talking about a second ""Come and See"" I can get it but otherwise it sounds too close to presenting Stalingrad as a pointless struggle. As we both know it was far from pointless!

Gradation rates, domestic and sexual violence protection, family court, the teaching field, skewed pay rates in certain fields, and more. That quote makes nasty and counterproductive assumptions. 

I don't think MRAs all believe that feminism is inherently taking away men's rights, nor think that's a qualifying factor for being an MRA. In a similar way feminism has many different sects, Men's Rights advocacy branches into groups like MGTOW, MRA, and, in some scope egalitarianism. From what I see, MRA primarily focuses on gender equality in areas where men are disadvantaged and feminism primarily on areas where women are disadvantaged. As much as people like to redefine, interpret, and market feminism, the same can be said for the MRM.

Invalidating another group through broad assumptions is toxic and invalid in itself, whether it be to mischaracterize feminists as hysterical man haters or MRAs as bitter misogynists. 

""The Red Pill"" documentary by ex-feminist director Cassie Jaye gives a good glimpse of the MRA movement beyond the brief and sad exposure media has ever given it, and may elaborate on the conflict between the two ideologies.           ",1501545987

"dresdenfiles","t5_2s64c","A method actor might be the only mundane who could do it quickly, but if someone deliberately set about re-forging their sense of self with a dedicated purpose, it could be done. Identify the 'who' of you, including mannerisms, hobbies, preferences, etc., then design a new 'self', make specific changes (food you normally dislike? add it to every lunch. Normally drink coffee and only drink occasionally/socially? Drop all caffeine, have a beer or wine every evening. Pick up new hobbies, drop old, change your routine and where you live, adopt a new accent).

The 'who' of you will change. Not a lot really, but it doesn't have to be a lot, it just has to be enough. And to finish the job, chose a name variant (like a common nickname), and a slightly different way of saying it, and *practice* it in your new accent.

Depending on time and resources, I think an intelligent person who was dedicated to doing this could have their sense of identity beginning to shift away from their previous True Name enough to start providing a little protection within a week, or even a few days if they have a knack for it.

1) It usually refers to an API (= library) built exclusively on an already available API but providing more convenience and higher level abstractions. In this sense, it's sort of an informal term. A wrapper library would sometimes be expected to be able to expose functionality from the library it wraps, or at least mirror it very closely, in which case you could talk about a 'thin wrapper'.

2) It can sometimes refer to *function decoration*, a feature that allow you to specify reusable *decorator functions* that can take a function and wrap it with a *wrapper function* that processes the parameters and return values of the wrapped function (before and after it is called, resp.) In the abstract, the idea is somewhat close to 1), but here it's a language feature (present in Python but not in all languages) with its own syntax. It's a much stricter term here, with a technical definition. Function decoration can be a very useful (if somewhat advanced) feature, and there are tutorials for learning it in Python.",1501545991

Outside of a little terrain I've made here and there for D&amp;D following some YouTube vids I'm very new to all this (but have always been quite crafty with other stuff).

So when the challenge was announced I knew I was going to try and do my first scratch build, having already been inspired by a bottle of Matey bubble bath which looked liked a cool jet engine. After lots of blood, sweat and tears (literally blood.. don't mess around with those scalpel blades..) I finaly ""finished"".

Learned SO MUCH doing this project, made my life so goddam hard with so many mistakes, but I'm super happy with the final outcome even if my painting skills are still very undeveloped (this is the 2nd model I've painted, so give me a break!)

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","This is one of those aggrigated ranking based on various metrics. Deciding on what metrics to choose is itself problematic ([if you care about such things here's an article by Malcolm Gladwell about college rankings that are relates to any such ranking system](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/02/14/the-order-of-things)). Let's look at the criteria themselves:

&gt;Other measures — median SAT scores (28th), reading test scores (28th), math test scores (31st), pupil-teacher ratio (48th) and dropout rate (48th) — showed Oregon was below average.

Those test rankings hang out in the middle third and I don't find it too troublesome. Testing itself is constantly under fire and Oregon children are more likely than most to say ""fuck it"" to the man and intentionally bomb a test. It's the pioneer spirit I guess.

Student to teacher ratios are unjustifiable. Hire more teachers. Figure out how.

But it's the drop out rate that's always fascinated me. My theory is that the ghost of the logging industry still surrounds the Oregon zeitgeist. It rattles it's chains and proclaims, ""just start working and you'll live well."" Never mind that this hasn't been true for a generation. Still, every time I talk to a young person about to drop out they always say that they need to start working. Are their parents pushing them out?

"China","t5_2qh2v","Exactly. A few years ago I found myself in the city of Panzhihua in Sichuan province. Just on a stopover. 

The city was what I would describe as a concrete nightmare, complete with chemical plants and mopeds. Trip Advisor told me that it will be the ""worst experience of my life"".

I was quite taken with the place. Sure, it wasn't pretty, but it was interesting. Had some great 串儿. One of them was stuffed intestines on a stick (stuffed with some sort of vegetable puree that is), and it was quite good. The city felt like one of the Schumacher-era Batman movies. Lots of neon, hookers, drugs and vice. I liked it.

Eventually got my train to Chengdu, quite drunk and content. Good times.",1501545994

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","**Primord**

Primord faced the Chaos War. Here is a quick run down.

Chaos fills the Void. As a matter of fact, it is the Void of Chaos, the place where worlds *aren't*. Inside this Void are bubbles, called Planar Bubbles. Inside these bubbles are more bubbles, called Planes. 

Chaos corroded a hole through one Planar Bubble, and some gods from the Planes reacted. They were immediately smashed under the tide of Chaos that flooded in, and rose up as Corrupted gods, now lacking all reason. This quickly repeated itself, before the remaining gods closed ranks and were able to fight back.

The gods eventually managed to martial their powers, forcing Chaos back like a flame does spilled water. As the final push Pan* threw himself into the Void, hell bent on continuing to force the Chaos away from the Planar Bubble. The gods he left behind sealed the hole, and set to work.

Many gods fell in the War, most notably all of the Nature gods. The world fell into Chaos as the few survivors attempted to take over jobs once handled by hundreds. After hundreds of years, the lack of a Nature god to control the wilds has shown badly, but most of the rest is under control.

*Pan in this world was the patron god of Berserkers, and primal fury. Not the standard goat man of greek mythology.",1501545996

Since those tanks have such a large impact on team fights, Jarvan/Shen/Gnar get a lot of play because they can also lane well and bring something to the later game. Last, Renekton and Rumble are used as lane bullies to try and dumpster champs with shit laning phases.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt; Why did they decide to do that?

It wasn't an intuitive and newbie friendly system. It also lead to other problems.

Some skills were Must Have Skills. For example, Gladiators learned Flash early on (before level 10). This was the only AoE aggro generation skill, and newbie Marauders got Overpower, but it was a cone that cost a lot of TP, vs the circular AoE Flash. Marauders also had to Cross Class the skill Provoke! Imagine a tank without that skill. I ran into one once in a DF for Alexander. We had to kick him from the group because it was impossible for him to tank swap.

As a White Mage, I *had* to level a Thurmaturge to 25 to get Swiftcast. This skill I could cross class, making my next spell instant. Without it, I would not be able to instant-cast Resurrection in battle. As Resurrection has an 8 second cast time, Swiftcast is invaluable in getting up a fallen team member. If you were at end game, and didn't have swiftcast, you would be refused from raid groups.

There was also a large debate as to if a White Mage needed Eye For An Eye, which was a level 32 Arcanist spell. It wasn't a Must Have spell, but it was handy. And if a healer wasn't going to bother to get a handy spell for their toolkit, then how lazy would they be with raiding?

So people had to level other classes (and they might not even *want* to play those classes), just to get needed skills, but nothing actually *told* them they had to do this. And if they didn't, they would be kicked from groups.

&gt; What are people's opinions on not being able to use cross class skills now?

Overall, people are glad it's gone. Yes, some are upset they leveled classes they didn't want to for nothing now. White Mages were (and still kinda are) pretty salty about many skills they initially had by default are now converted to Role Skills, which they have to buy back to use.

But it was a shitty system and needed to go.

&gt; So they only reason to level an alternative class is if you want to play it then correct? 

Except Crafting. Crafting still has Cross Class skills, and that wasn't changed. ",1501545996

SARMs didn't have the edge that they were hoping for, but the fact that they even exist should at least show that there are some very intelligent people busting their ass to create something new.

This is exactly what newspapers in Europe do, you should look into it.  You file a complaint to a competent body (a ""court"" handled by the press corps).  Then if you're found guilty you do exactly as you said.  HOWEVER, adhering to this court is done by free will, not by coersion.

If the free press in Israel wants to act like you propose, they would have to come up with a court that is acceptable to Al Jazeera - where the members of the press can agree to abide by the rulings.

Is the press in Israel up for it?  Will they let, say a private court based in London rule on this?  Something like the LCIA, but for the press?  Or do they prefer to use the threat of force to win a propaganda war?",1501545996

Two things about this: firstly, non-Muslims are often told by Muslims that reading the Quran gives you a direct connection to God, and that the act of reading it is supposed to fill your heart and soul with a sense of faith. No-one makes that claim about Shakespeare.

Secondly, my theological issues with Islam are not based on my own interpretations of the Quran, or even hadiths. They're based on the modern interpretations of practising Muslims. To me, religion is not defined by scripture; religion is defined by how people that practice that religion understand and live that scripture.

&gt; Story highlightsThe bill would close the governor&amp;#039;s beach house during shutdowns.

&gt; The state&amp;#039;s General Assembly approved a bill Monday by a vote of 63-2-2 to prohibit use of state-owned property that is &amp;quot;Exclusively or primarily for the use of the governor&amp;quot; during budget-related government shutdowns.

&gt; A separate bill that would keep state parks open for seven days in the event of an appropriations-related state of emergency also passed the Assembly on Monday.

And most of Batman's villains are more heightened and flamboyant than grounded. This is mostly because the majority of DC heroes are larger-than-life characters, rather than the more down-to-earth counterparts over at Marvel. (This isn't a joke, I know that sounds silly when talking about the current slate of movies, but up until relatively recently, Marvel was considered the darker one, and DC was considered the brighter one. You can kind of see why if you compare the roster of the Avengers to the core roster of the Justice League, and look at the types of heroes on each and the traditional types of stories they're in.)",1501546004

Had a roommate in college that was super pumped to make donuts for the house. He turned the stove on and 20 minutes later I was like ""dude, why haven't you started cooking?"" 

His response was ... ""well I'm waiting for it to start boiling then i can put the doughnuts in there.""

I looked at him, turned off the heat, and threw a chunk of dough in to show him what he's done. That doughnut seared up real fast and was a rock solid black chunk of dough in a split second. 

Unnecessary edit, but some people don't know: oil does have a boiling point but you don't want it to get there. You want the oil hot enough to cook your food and not too hot to burn your food and not too cold to give you a soggy oily mess. 
Comparison: boiling point for oil is 570ish degrees f. Your cooking temp should be in the mid 300s, I think. ",1501546005

Im not really interested in talking about whats fair, or the injustices in our society, or how close to the theoretical free market we are. We'll probably agree more often than not. I've sat near politicians saying in speaches how the minimum wage might not be the proper economic solution, but it sure is fair, to applause. I was astonished at his honesty.

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;Deku, the whiny baby.

I'm amazed that you can watch more than two episodes of Hero Academia and still come to the conclusion that he's a ""whiny baby"".  See, the foundational part of a whiny baby stereotype is that their central character flaw dominates their life to the point that they're limited and controlled by fear.  Their fear causes them to shrink back under pressure and retreat into their shell, and their character arc involves them being slowly drawn out of it until they can stand on their own two feet without support.  Deku is more aptly described as courageous and indomitable, since even when he is afraid he's still willing to throw himself into danger to help someone in need.  The epitome of the classic ""the most courageous are the ones who feel afraid and still fight anyways"" thing.  We see this as early as episode 2.

The thing about Hero Academia is that it's extremely self-aware of the pitfalls of shounen stereotypes and never lets them get in the way of the actual plot.  Deku seems like a whiny shit for all of one episode but the rest of his character shines through strongly enough to make it mostly a moot point.

If you want to see an actual whiny baby, wait until [this worthless shit](https://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/bokunoheroacademia/images/6/66/Minoru_Mineta_Full_Body_School_Uniform_Anime.png/revision/latest?cb=20160118115800) is introduced.",1501546006

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Those are measurements of two different things, they can't be compared.  For example, you can have something that is 100V at 100A - it is both at once.  Or you could have one thing that is 100V at 0.01 Amps, and one thing that is 100A at 10,000V.

Volts measure potential - the volume that can flow if you hook it up to a conductor

Amps measure current - the rate of flow

The measure of how much energy is being transferred through something is power, which is voltage (Volts) multiplied by current (Amps).  So in order to answer your question you would need to provide more information.

&gt; A separate bill that would keep state parks open for seven days in the event of an appropriations-related state of emergency also passed the Assembly on Monday.

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","I could see it being a reasonable addition. The reason I'd argue No Mither would benefit more from being known is because it fundamentally changes the meta of how to interact with teammates, as a huge facet of altruistic teamwork is simply removed from the game and not possible. In the right situation, someone can be saved by Adrenaline without needing a teammate to offer the typical assistance, but the perk doesn't *entirely* prevent teammates from helping them out (thus making it a waste of time to get near the teammate like No Mither does).

I guess the other side of this discussion, though, is that a lot of the game is designed around players having to try to read their teammates and, if I remember correctly, the devs have talked about why they don't want excessive communication.

I think buffs to the perk could make it useful enough to justify not broadcasting to the team that a survivor is using it, but in its current state and place in the meta, it feels like it needs *something* to be anything more than a bane to everyone else on your team when you run

You give them space to work it out, you remind them that you are there for them even if they are frustrated at you, and if they seek repentance for how they treated you, your duty is to accept it and forgive them for it.

We mutually decided we were not a match wished each other well in our search and parted ways. It was bitter sweet. To be an adult and understand the situations you're in and to adjust to benefit yourself and others is difficult. Alot of people stay together because of convenience. It's easier to hang on to something you have than to search for something that may be difficult to obtain. In turn what's happens is you grow to despise that person and the relationship becomes toxic.

"titanfall","t5_2xh0g","I see your point, but I must bring my own. While playing easy and regular I almost never lose my Monarch. The mix between shields siphoon and batterystealing results in significant longevity, Also executing a Titan gives a bonus core, in addition then one you gain from merely killing a Titan as well as getting batteries (you get extra core for new batteries). This is why its important in FD to let Monarch execute doomed Titans. She becomes stronger and thus the team becomes stronger. Especially if she can heal folks (which she can with electric and energy siphon). I mostly use Turbo Engine so I can kill reapers before they can unleash a barrage by simply moving out of the way. I also maelstrom to kill 3-4 Titans at the same time.

I do agree that lower fire rate and increasing damage would be better. The Accelerator does that, but you run out ammo almost before u reach maximum fire rate. The new added ammo fixed that issue somewhat. Assuming you have arcrounds of course.",1501546013

the necromancer release was implemented poorly.  Prior to release they had feedback about various issues that were either bugged or flat broken.

---

The Lord of the Seven Kingdoms was perpetually opposed to arriving quietly. 

The door swung up, the guards hammer their heels against the floor once, and somewhere someone heralded Edric's presence. 

*""Rise for the King.""*

""Sit down."" Edric says just as quickly. A powerful stride brings him directly to the refreshment table set up adjacent to the small council's table it's self. Goblet and wine jug are in hand before the man even stops to take stock of exactly *which* small council members were assembled. 

At least he wasn't wearing armor this time. 

His antler crested chair at the head of the table is drawn back by a dutiful attendant and slide forward promptly to greet Edric's royal arse on it's descent. 

""My Lords."" There was an acute lack of mirth in the King's subdued voice of thunder, it only lightens for those that shared his blood.. ""Cousin."" Or his wife's for that matter. ""Good-sister.""

""The night of knives proved the audacity of our foe knows no bounds."" *Foe* not Targaryen, a choice distinction he was certain none would notice. The presence of a certain princess locked in a certain tower tinged Edric's wrath with doubt. Aye, his enemy had made the first strike, but he couldn't say without flaw *who* that enemy was. 

*Daeron will die, regardless.*

Smashing the dragon king with his hammer was always a comforting thought, almost as comforting as the goblet of wine he'd poured himself to nearly overfill. A sip, and the King wastes not a second more. 

""I consider it a declaration of war. The last time I checked, my kingdom is not prepared for a war. At dawn, we will begin to fortify this city."" A pause, a more than healthy sip of wine, and Edric allows a moment for his firm gaze to flicker between all faces assembled. 

""We are doubling the Goldcloak's roster, as well as the size of the royal fleet. My people are fearful and anxious, let us harness their concerns and put them to good use. Put sword and hammer in their hands, laxity will do nothing but compound the terror of the attack on the Great Sept.""

However you should avoid using transform.eulerAngles to get the rotation. Rotations are stored in transform as quaternions and multiple euler values can represent the same rotation.

With picks #24 and #25 I'm hoping to be choosing from 2 of Gurley, Cooper, Cooks, Gronk, Baldwin, Hopkins, and maybe Arod. 

If Gronk and Arod make it back to me I will highly consider securing 3 top players at their position and fill my WRs with WR2 types later.

&gt; Story highlightsThe bill would close the governor&amp;#039;s beach house during shutdowns.

&gt; The state&amp;#039;s General Assembly approved a bill Monday by a vote of 63-2-2 to prohibit use of state-owned property that is &amp;quot;Exclusively or primarily for the use of the governor&amp;quot; during budget-related government shutdowns.

&gt; A separate bill that would keep state parks open for seven days in the event of an appropriations-related state of emergency also passed the Assembly on Monday.

The tutor in skellige is different form those in other factions as skellige has to use cards that maybe useful down the line to rez cards. Whike skellige cards can grow strong in the graveyard, they also grow strong in the deck and hand. When you tutor a card out in NR you get the card and don't have to jump through extra hoops too play it but you don't get extra bonuses other factions do, reinforcements is better card than svangrie but henselt is far more niche than king bran. However, everything you said about the pirates and the ships are correct

And your argument for anti graveyard cards makes no sense. Anti graveyard cards are tech cards, all tech cards are there just in case a certain strategy gets too strong.

and then comes a boring infodump about druids:

&gt; She and a group of Druids [...] They had been tasked [...] the Druid Circles are a neutral force in the Five Kingdoms [...]


Now, druids are cool, but it's boring because as a reader I need a point of view, I have to rely on a character to enjoy the story: the character is the reader's avatar, he is a tool to get inside the story.


&gt;  She took out her dagger and stabbed its eye, silencing the creature.



this was the only cool part, because there is action, a sense of purpose, we learn about what she can do **directly** because you **show** it.


We could get more technical and I could add many things, but what's the point? you have to rewrite the whole thing anyway.


&gt; Morgana laid down her wooden shield. The battle was nothing like she had imagined. 


I want to give you one fast pointer, since it came up in the first sentence. try and write sentences of different length, because it creates a sense of rhythm. Sentences of the same length are annoying, except when you do it on purpose.



To summarize: **Focus on your main-character**, describe what she's doing, don't infodump, and let me hear her thoughts.

I'm a teacher, and I'm looking to for a less dressy (Chino/OCBD normal dress) looking oxford and/or derby to work into the rotation of my daily drivers.  Obviously on my feet for at least 8 hours a day with a lot of speed walking between areas of my school. 

I actually really like the way the Mark derby looks from Frye, but cannot find my size online (10.5). My local Nordstrom and Nordstrom rack don't have anything in stock, so I figured I'd look to Amazon prime so I can utilize free returns.

I found [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01K0NRZU4/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_VW7FzbAPBKKNB) on Amazon and actually don't hate the pre-distressed look from the pictures, since again I am mostly only wearing chinos with button up and maybe a tie. I wouldn't want to go too dressy looking. 

They're $160.  Has that become a decent purchase at that price point?

Also, if the answer is still no to Frye, what brands can also be found at the same price point? This is more of a need purchase than a planned want, so I need to act relatively quickly.

You're the one screeching here, trying to make accusations where they're invalid. 

Being an authority on myself, you might be a smidge presumptuous about who I am. I AM a minority, I've faced discrimination, I know how it feels to be sidelined due to the color of your skin, passed over for opportunities because who I was born as. And as much as you want to paint me as the pariah who wants to criticize Zazie based on the color of her skin, you're sadly mistaken. This is not that.

I would be criticizing her portrayal, but as you have so presumably pointed out in your incessant whining, we have not seen her act in this role, so there is no judgement to be made.

I can only judge the design and I have done so. You're such a fucking idiot that you're out of touch with the very people you want to defend, and i'm sorry for you. 

I hope your life wasn't as awful as mine when dealing with discrimination and that maybe in the future when you stop acting a victim on the behalf of others you can put your soap-box to good use.

Typical day might be to go to the gym at 6 AM, work from 7 AM to 6 PM, do some kind of activity for a few hours until 8, get home, relax, read, sleep at 10:30. And this is with a 60+ hour workweek. The premise of the original post was that one doesn't have time for any sort of a life during a 40 hour work week.

Would also like to see gem editing done differently as it  is very cumbersome moving  around to see what's  what and place it. Maybe selecting socket opens a large view of  weapon and your gems are all displayed below it. Then you can view, place or remove them. 

I also need a way to view my model and turn them around and look them over. I know you can see them on the current inventory screen but it is the worst camera ever.

Should also allow some adjustments to main HUD. Some of it is too big and intrusive. I actually think the PC HUD works well here. The skills could be in a bar, I don't need that obnoxious diamond to know what's what if you just put a little icon under each item in n the bar. Monster titles seems obnoxious as well.

&gt; Story highlightsThe bill would close the governor&amp;#039;s beach house during shutdowns.

&gt; The state&amp;#039;s General Assembly approved a bill Monday by a vote of 63-2-2 to prohibit use of state-owned property that is &amp;quot;Exclusively or primarily for the use of the governor&amp;quot; during budget-related government shutdowns.

&gt; A separate bill that would keep state parks open for seven days in the event of an appropriations-related state of emergency also passed the Assembly on Monday.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt;  There was little to no connection between the global stock market and the USSR's economy. There were no stocks to collapse and no markets to spread the effects of an economic depression.

This was true before the revolution as well.  The standard of living in the US was still higher Britain and Germany as compared to Russia after the collapse.  It was just a little closer because the communists had slightly unfucked Russia since it's tsardom days, and the stock market collapse had set back the western economies a bit.

 &gt;Some Americans even moved to the USSR for jobs while capitalism was in crisis.


And?  Americans have defected to North Korea before.  It doesn't mean North Korea is anything other than a totalitarian shithole. 

Also, you'll note that capitalism recovered rather nicely.  Communism on the other hand had it's crisis and fucking collapsed entirely.  I'm willing to buy that the USSR's disconnection to the rest of the world allowed them to dodge the majority of the effects of the Depression.

He was trying to better his life and go back to school in the fall, I thought it was a fling because of that, you know, have fun for the summer and say bye in the end. Well, it didn't happen that way. We agreed to try to make it work when he moved away for school and I was already in school. Fast forward 3 years, he graduates and I'm starting a doctorate program. Still happy but still long distance. He got a job outside of school that had him traveling and living all over the US while I finished school. We talked every day at least once at night for a hour, we talked about everything and anything. I honestly think that's why we were able to stick it out, we knew each other on a deeper, different level. He always flew back home for holidays and the occasional big event if he could swing it and I made sure to visit him when I could. 

He finally stopped moving around once I graduated and came back home. We've lived together for 6 months now and it's like our relationship hasn't skipped a beat. Happier than ever.  ",1501546023

Same goes for taxation to provide for the maintenance of that civilization, where the people who cry the loudest are the libertarian types who want something closer to a market free for all, even if that causes results the rest of us do not want.

If so, here is a good argument against your position: http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002

I feel that some conservatives appeal to straw man arguments and make some other logical errors. For example, the fact that ABC reported that a study said something that was incorrect isn't really a logical connector... that this study is incorrect. 

The reason people are freaking out is that the people in power in the US do not believe in something (or are afraid to say that they believe in something) that believed to be true by 90-100% of experts in this regard.

These experts include the US Military, whom you as a conservative would likely trust as a reliable source. In fact, the US Military Leadership views global warming as a major strategic threat:

"nonononoyes","t5_2xp2p","In the last 2 years, I have had to go to the ER twice.

The first time was when I was having trouble with a cough.  I had been seeing the doctor about it already, and he had already sent me for an x-ray where they could not find anything.  At 3:30 in the morning I could not stop coughing so I went to the ER.

They also sent me for x-rays, and gave me a mist that helped ease the breathing.  They also gave me prescriptions for the most common causes of such coughs, until further tests could be made.  It finally took an MRI to discover that I had pneumonia, it was just deep enough in the lungs that the x-rays were not seeing it.

The second time, I had severe abdominal pain.  From a previous bout of the same I figured it to be Kidney stones.  I went to the doctor (I do try to not use up ER resources), and he is the one that sent me to the ER, as they could give me better painkillers.  I ended up throwing up from the pain as I was being brought in to be looked at.  They gave me an IV painkiller that worked wonders, confirmed via another MRI that it was indeed stones, gave me a prescription to help with the pain and to hopefully get them moving, and set me up with a specialist the next week.  When I saw the specialist, he renewed the scripts, and we made plans for me to go in for day surgery in about 2 weeks’ time, if I did not pass them on my own.  Thankfully I did several days before the surgery.

In between, I had another MRI and an ultrasound for a worrying lump at the back of my jaw that turned out to be nothing.

So that is at least multiple GP visits, 2 ER visits, 2 specialists (Urinary and another for the jaw issue), 3 MRI's, 2 x-rays, and an ultrasound, the IV, the mist, and the possible surgery.

Since I live in Canada, in all that, the only costs that I incurred were for the 3:30 AM cab ride (and ride home) for the first ER visit, parking for second visit, and the prescription meds.  All the procedures and medications that were used at the hospital, as well as the surgery if it were needed, I did not have to worry about the cost of.

Meanwhile, I have a friend in the US that is looking at bankruptcy because he had to get his appendix removed while uninsured.

Yes, we have to pay a bit more in taxes.  But probably not as much as most Americans pay in insurance.  And as a bonus, I do not have to worry about the cost of going to the doctor if something is worrying me.  I felt a lump at the back of my jaw, so I went and had it looked at.  If it had turned out to be cancer or something like that, I could have caught it early, since I did not have to take a doctor’s visit cost into account, except maybe time off work.  That both improves the likelihood of success and, get this, COSTS LESS, then if I waited.  If I had put it off until later, and it was something really bad, it would have been both more difficult and more expensive to treat.

The procedures that you say people are flocking to the US for almost all fall into 3 categories.  They are either cosmetic, difficult quality of life but not lifesaving (and so there is a long waiting list), or experimental, and so are not yet covered.  Lifesaving procedures, and even most quality of life, which I would put my potential surgery under, you are usually seen to fairly quickly and without worry.

Like it or not, you have two choices.  You are either under an insurance of some sort, or you are not.  

If you are, then like it or not, you are still paying for somebody elses health care.  That is the point of insurance.  You pay into it so that you can use it when you need it.  Don’t you think that it would be cheaper if everyone was paying into the same pool rather than competing ones?  

If you are not, under the impression that because you are young and healthy you will not need it, I hope that you do not get into an accident or develop cancer, neither of which care about your age and general health.  Because then you will find out just how expensive healthcare in the US can be, without the bargaining power of the insurance companies.  ",1501546032

I saw more signs of psychological trauma than anything else. He doesn't come across particularly dehumanized,  he comes across as shell shocked. It makes sense considering he is single handedly responsible for Hodor dying, and for Hodor being, you know, Hodor. Add onto that the fact that he is literally being chased by an handful of unknowable ice monsters with a horde of ice zombies in tow led by a former man-cum-monster and suddenly some severe PTSD makes perfect sense.

"SecretWorldLegends","t5_3jiw7","One of the things that has baffled me for years is why there is no, like, Dark Horse comic line for TSW stories. Why there is not even an ebook of TSW short stories for the Kindle or anything. The dev team put five years into creating a world for the game, and then another 5 expanding on it. Supposedly they have Season 2 and 3 written down somewhere as well! That is an insane amount of world building. Freaking *Infinity Blade* has a novel by *Brian ""Doorstopper"" Sanderson*, so why is ""god I love this story so much"" TSW left languishing? Why was the IP never leveraged to make a little money and maybe pull in some new players from the tie-in? We can speculate the reason either has something to do with publishing rights (notice we don't see the ol EA or Nvidia logos on startup anymore!) or just that Funcom did the math and decided they just didn't expect enough people to buy a novel to recoup the cost. 

Anyway now is the start of a new chapter in the Secret World IP and it looks like Funcom is planning to franchise it out.  BTW Funcom if you are interested I have a killer idea for a SWL choose your own adventure book.",1501546036

I went to my friend's house and we went out and played in a creek all day (with shoes on).

Just a big plug of skin, and it left a crater in my foot where they had been. After that day, they never came back.

It involves going into the abuse (for purpose of reprocessing and resolving trauma) but that is really the only way I've been able to ""realise"" it happening to me. Because when you go into it, you start nuancing things, giving it context, letting it make sense in the narrative of your life (which happens because the trauma moves from the amygdala and gets integrated into your hippocampus or long term memory - the story of your life). So there's a reason it doesn't feel real. It doesn't feel part of your life's story because it's not actually processed and filed in your long term memory. With recovery this will happen, just trust at an intellectual level right now that it did happen and you weren't making it up. I hope that helps. ",1501546037

"HistoricFashionPorn","t5_3l1yz","This sumptuous evening dress has huge puffed sleeves which were highly fashionable during the mid 1890s. One of the advantages of these large sleeves was to make the waist look small by comparison. The shoulder width was counterbalanced by the size of the skirt, which widened at the hem - an effect that was achieved by gores, shaped panels, box pleats in the back of the skirt and stiff interlining.

The skirt and bodice is embroidered in beads with exquisite butterfly and ribbon motifs. Butterflies were popular in 1894. The Queen in April illustrated an example by the couturier Felix.

The label 'Stern Bros., West 23rd , New York' is stitched to the waistband. Stern Bros., one of the largest New York department stores of the time, imported models of Parisian fashions for copying.

Note that most tanks have similar internal layout. The driver is on the front, the gunner is next to the gun, the commander is behind him. Ammunition is stored below the turret or at the back of the turret (if big turret), the engine and fuel tanks are to the rear and sides, transmission is at the bottom all across the tank, and so on. 

So you don't need to review *all* tanks in X-ray mode, that's time consuming.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The vast majority of the American West cannot support agriculture without irrigation - often involving water from wells. It is a dry place, and this reality sets it apart from the other North American regions. It is depicted as a dry place because that is what it is. There are obvious exceptions to this, notably the Pacific Northwest, the coast in general, and various places hugging mountains where precipitation can be at its greatest. That said, crossing the expanse - by wagon or now by car or train - involved/involves a great deal of time crossing very brown terrain. Because water is key to settlement, the result is that much of the Intermountain West has been characterized as a sagebrush ocean - vast amounts of unsettled land with isolated ""islands"" of towns. It also has resulted in Nevada, for example, frequently appearing as the second-most urban state in the nation (the first being New Jersey - which has nothing to do with this modeling!).

Surviving journeys could be extremely difficult and resulted in many deaths along the California-Oregon trail. Crossing what was called the ""Great American Desert"" was not easy. People followed rivers as much as they could, but in Nevada especially, there was a forty mile stretch with no water, tackled at a point when the oxen were at their weakest. If you go back to the 1850s in a time machine, stay on the East Coast, or arrange for your teleportation so that you arrive in San Francisco. San Francisco has always been a great place. ",1501546040

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","In my opinion, agency begins when the game begins. If you kill off an NPC in the opening narration and that's where it starts, that's where it starts. You're not taking away agency by setting up the campaign to start in media res like that, I think you're creating an exciting hook. You could have left it in player control and the luck of dice rolls to see if the NPC dies, or you can use it as a part of the scenario to start like that.

Because it's something akin to setting up the scenario like stating simple facts (you're all from this town, or there are mountains in the north, or the evil king has occupied your homeland, etc.), I don't really see the problem. As a player, I prefer to know that the GM had a good scenario in mind where the stakes are immediately set up like this, but I can trust the GM that they won't rail-road me into a fake fight where everything's getting fudged to kill said NPC for plot purposes even though I can't actually do anything about it.

If you want to open the campaign right into a fight and are unsure of how to frame your PCs in the scene, you can always task your players to co-narrate on their own where their characters were standing and what they were doing and the likes, and then describe how the NPC was killed, put into the context they help set up. It could have been bad luck, a dastardly surprise attack, or something else, but as long as you can make it make sense, there's no harm in starting in the middle of battle like that with an NPC immediately dead due to narration.",1501546041

And Isekais, aka transported to a different world are what I consider to be a whole another genre, imo.

I suppose you are probably referring to the 'battle haremy' parts of the anime, which...is relatively very low in comparison to most battle harems out there. Heck, I'd consider Akashic Records as one of the better ones. As for the whole target audience thing, well, that's basically majority of light novel adaptations in a nutshell.

&gt; Joe Arpaio, the Arizona lawman who once proclaimed himself to be &amp;quot;America&amp;#039;s Toughest Sheriff&amp;quot; and was largely praised by conservatives for his hard-line policing tactics, was found guilty Monday of criminal contempt, bringing his tenure as a relentless crusader against illegal immigration to an end.

&gt; More than a month after lawyers wrapped up closing arguments, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Arpaio guilty for defying a judge&amp;#039;s 2011 court order to refrain from racially profiling Latinos during patrols.

&gt; Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Arizona&amp;#039;s Maricopa County before losing reelection last November.

Of course, it doesn't help that we're only 0.6% of the population (at least in the United States) From my experience, I've only talked to another openly transgender woman once. Everything else is text in an Internet forum.

What's your basis for assuming that ""chances are better that they (people making rape accusations) aren't"" lying? There are countless factors that must be considered to determine whether or not a rape accusation is likely true or false. You can't just say ""chances are better that they aren't"" lying. Only idiots take rape accusations lightly like that and side with the accuser without any evidence. It's because of people like you that there are innocent people who get their lives ruined by false rape accusations. 

/u/Mc_Dickles didn't even say anything about the girl in the video lying. Even if it were true that ""chances are better that they aren't"" lying, how did /u/Mc_Dickles ""just tell a rape victim they didn't get raped""? How did you even make that jump? How is saying Bari is innocent until proven guilty telling a rape victim that they didn't get raped? Is the law telling rape victims that they didn't get raped then? I'm actually amazed that you somehow arrived at that conclusion.

&gt; the fact that someone accused him of raping them means that we cannot definitively say that he did not do it until found not guilty (if he is found not guilty)

So why would you side with the accuser instead of remaining neutral?",1501546046

"rickandmorty","t5_2u4lp","**Your post has been DISQUALIFIED for breaking Rule 7a.** :

 

**7a.** Due to community feedback and the high amount of front page clutter we're experiencing, Content that's irrelevant to Rick and Morty will be removed. If the post itself has nothing to do with R&amp;M and only features a tangential reference to the show, or a quote as the title it may still qualify for removal under this rule. 

 

 *Common Examples:*
     
 * [A label](https://imgur.com/Frr7Eja) with [""Two](https://imgur.com/eazbI4K) [Brothers""](https://i.imgur.com/82haj9J.jpg) on it,  something tangentially related to [Lil'](http://i.imgur.com/ZwVyaOm.png)[Bits](http://i.imgur.com/GKEEoXJ.png), [Fake Doors](https://i.imgur.com/l6ezp7V.png), or shaped like a giant head. That [stock-art Pizza Man logo](https://i.warosu.org/data/g/img/0448/88/1414390964669.jpg), some chicken nuggets you found on the floor, Szechuan Sauce, The word ""Szechuan"" that you saw somewhere - perhaps on a Chinese Restaurant sign or menu, Mulan in general, a Shoney's Restaurant IRL, [etc](http://i.imgur.com/q9TLhA0.png), [etc](http://i.imgur.com/y01oIMk.png), [etc](https://i.imgur.com/OEPVqg6.jpg).

Westinghouse understated the engineering involved, oversold their unfinished design, &amp; Shaw bit off more than they could chew in construction space. Those factors are what hosed the project.

I agree about the pace though, would like to see more scenes of slower pace.

What I'm looking for is what made battle of the bastards so good. Moments in the battle with slower pace,zooming in on Jons ""dying"" or his moment as he stood alone accepting his death as the bolton horses rode against him or just silent slow moment shots of ordinary soldiers just poking their nose or being nervous, or having a cold. It gave a great build up to what then came. 

When comparing Eurons fight in s7e2 and botb all I see is chaotic high intense action, two generally disliked characters dying, but who is who, how many are they?  Theon becomes reek, is given a charactermoment in the end. But Jon got a lot of them in botb,  we were given connection to the other regular soldiers.

With that said , I did like the casterly rock montage. There was no backstory with characters we knew except for greyworm, the big thing here was how they got played by cersei. But now that they're gonna starve I hope it's not a 10sec clip, that we get a feel of that time has passed and they're suffering from the role time passing plays in a  starving siege.  Not saying "" show many clips of starvation. just don't start with the next step of it next episode. Maybe show some starvation for 10sec, then move along, let time pass so when we return we'll think of how much worse it could be now.

But then again the unsullied are very unpersonal, not interesting.  I'm just worried they'll miss out on how the contrasts between high pace and slow pace can help storytelling now.",1501546051

As for my experience, I started the game with a Ranger, then after getting to level 80 with that I made a Guardian which I played a lot for a while and had a lot of fun. It was my main for a few months, but when I made an Elementalist it became my main and hasn't changed since. 

Now, part of that is that I come from older MMOs which have many more skills and Elementalist was the only class I played that didn't leave me bored due to the number of skills available and the number of different things you can mess around with and do at once. That's much less of a problem across almost every class now with HoT, and Guardian feels much more fleshed out to me with the Dragonhunter spec.

In college Obamanation happened and I knew I didn't like Obummer but I also despised John McCain, mostly because he seemed the same as Obama and I thought Sarah Palin was an idiot. I very much fell to the SNL narratives. 

After '08 I was still pretty apathetic but when '12 happened I knew that Romney was a shill and that Obama was a piece of shit and I discovered the Good Doctor, Ron Paul. I was a HUGE Ron Paul guy and wrote him in. 

When the Great Meme war was just beginning I was a Rand Paul guy. Rand was the mand with the pland in my opinion. He didn't get far against the GEOTUS and I didn't recognize how legit the GE was. Eventually I stumbled upon the Molyneaux video UnTruth about Donald Trump where he systematically dispelled everything the fake news media was spewing. Then I got on T_D and joined the meme war in Ernest. I lost a few Facebook friends after the election, it was wonderful.

If you've already given it awhile, then it might help speed things along if you put the vest on only for ""fun time"" right now.  Vest on, grab toys, invite him to your usual play area, and give him several minutes to come around by nonchalantly roving around occasionally tossing or flicking a toy.  Or if he's into ""snuggle time,"" try using the vest then.  If those don't work, since he's at least willing to walk, bring a favorite toy along on the walk, watch his body language closely, and as soon as you see any signs of loosening up, try rewarding him with a short playtime (vest on).  If he accepts, end on that note and repeat again later.  In the meantime, keep doing full-length walks and training without the vest.  If you think he might be outright afraid of it, you could even try incorporating it almost like a massage tool into petting time, with treats accompanying it.

Illinois was literally the last state in the country to not issue concealed carry permits *at all*, except for a few limited occupational related licenses. An old lady sued after she was beaten half to death in her church, and a federal court said they had to issue *something* or other. Much debate ensued, and Illinois now issues permits, and while *technically* shall issue, the time, training, background checks, and expenses to get one are heavier than all but a handful of other states. Hell, you have to have an entirely separate gun license *first* before you can even begin the process. 

The thing with Chicago was that Illinois decided (rightly, I think), that the state should handle the matter, and not have a hodgepodge of different licensing and registration requirements (not to mention rules about what kind of handgun you could have) across 1200+ municipalities in Illinois. Given how stringent Illinois concealed carry regulation is compared to the rest of the country, this isn't terribly unreasonable. ",1501546054
"circlebroke2","t5_2tzax","LOTS of liberties were taken. But how dare they cast a black actress for Domino! lol People are very obvious in their racial bias or racism. Some mask it as ""caring about comic accuracy.""

Lets look at how accurate the first film was. I can give 15 examples of things that weren't accurate.

**1.** In the comics, Deadpool is said to have a gasoline + gravel voice, due to having scar-tissue in his vocal cords. Cable likened it to a male Demi Moore rasp. So really, he should sound closer to Beetlejuice if anything. lol 

**2.** Blind Al was Deadpool's prisoner in the comics. Unlike the movie

**3.** Wade met Al when he was hired to kill her. Unlike the movie.

**4.** Wade and Vanessa were never engaged in the comics. Unlike the movie

**5.** Vanessa was a teen prostitute when they met in the comic. Unlike the movie

**6.** Deadpool and Colossus hardly interacted in the comics. Unlike the movie

**7.** Vanessa was a mutant in the comics, and she doesn't get back together with Wade until after her powers awaken &amp; she's a mercenary. Unlike the movie. And she cheated on Wade, and he beat the crap out of her. 

**8.** NSTWH was a blue telepath in the comics lol In addition to not being important in Wade's life. The only ""Ellie"" of importance in Wade's life is his daughter. 

**9.** Vanessa wasn't the one of brought out the hero in Wade, as he tells Colossus. It was Siryn who did that, promoting some change in him.. Unlike the movie. 

**10.** Blind Al was white and skinny. Unlike the movie

**11.** If Blind Al did something Wade found bad, he'd put her in ""the box"", a torture room with glass, knives and swords, and he'd leave her there for hours. Unlike the movie.

**12,** Cable is the one who tried to bring Wade over to the side of good / better. Unlike the movie

**13.** Dr. Killebrew was responsible for Wade's mutation -not Francis. Unlike the Movie. Francis was just Killebrew's enforcer. 

**14.** Wade doesn't kill Dr. Killebrew in the comics. Siryn talks him down and he spares the doctor who ruined him. Unlike the movie.

**15.** Francis was one of Dr. Killebrew's experiments, like Wade, who ends up being the one to kill the doctor, with Wade trying to save him. Unlike the movie. 

But ALL those changes were fine. Meanwhile a black actress and different coloring for Domino just screws everything up. Pft...

I like the idea of events to alleviate the crunch and am not  adverse to building up a specific team (even nightsisters!) to invest in a future supply of better gear but these **narrow window daytime events** are the opposite of what I and many other want from a mobile game.  
Instead of 1 and 2 hour Windows over the course of a day why not 8/12 hour Windows over the course of a week? Keeps the events tab looking busier as well.  
Most of the tiers also have at least 1 'dud' reward, how about tying each tier to a specific gear piece or two so we can actively choose which we wan to prioritise.  
From chatting with newer players in guild it's clear not everyone is stuck on the same pieces and certain rancor gears are still needed by a lot of players due to very lob-sided drops, but at the end of the day it's the same old culprits, a few low level gears needed by everyone (+4 speed green piece etc) and then it's holo projectors (decent to purchase in shipments but should be in guild store) and the usual suspects, carbantis, cuffs and guns.

In months when they overship and months then whey don't, their dollar share is consistently higher than DC for the past however many months.

[No, certainly the sales were better a decade ago than they were today!](http://www.comicbookpage.com/MayoReport/2015/2015-05/Top300Comics-Dollars-MarvelDcOther.png) or maybe the [prices of comics just went up, surely they aren't selling more units?](http://www.comicbookpage.com/MayoReport/2017/2017-04/Top300ComicsUnitsByMonth.png) but at least comics that SJWs haven't touched, comics that still have a [white guy as their main character must still be at their peak numbers!](http://www.comicbookpage.com/MayoReport/2017/2017-01/Batman.png)

Or maybe we can just start actually looking at the industry beyond these cultural scapegoats and see that a distribution service that has a monopoly on the two biggest publishers, a lack of forward thinking in the online market, an overall fading demographic for *printed* media, and a steady trend among young adults saving their money and putting it into passive investment or big ticket events instead of weekly/bi-weekly/monthly store purchases should be addressed.",1501546056

You mean like, a typical car on the road?  After-market, or on the assembly line during production?

For one, it's probably possible, depending on the scenario, but I don't know why you would.  Cars are pretty carefully engineered for size, weight, strength, and material usage, among a dozen other things.  If a part is metal, it's probably intended to be metal.  If a part is plastic, it's probably best if that part is plastic.

So I'm not really sure what your question is.  Or why it is.

In general though, I was at a small event a few weeks ago for ""3D Printing in Automation"" and it's certainly something that is happening.  Plastic parts are still more common to 3D print than metal, but I expect more and more changes will happen over time.",1501546057

&gt; Joe Arpaio, the Arizona lawman who once proclaimed himself to be &amp;quot;America&amp;#039;s Toughest Sheriff&amp;quot; and was largely praised by conservatives for his hard-line policing tactics, was found guilty Monday of criminal contempt, bringing his tenure as a relentless crusader against illegal immigration to an end.

&gt; More than a month after lawyers wrapped up closing arguments, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Arpaio guilty for defying a judge&amp;#039;s 2011 court order to refrain from racially profiling Latinos during patrols.

&gt; Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Arizona&amp;#039;s Maricopa County before losing reelection last November.

Yes. I don't like the liturgical divisiveness in this sub. I find it depressing when Catholics ask how to go to Mass, because it makes me sad that Catholics don't feel we share a common liturgy, but this is a personal problem. I shouldn't have brought it up.

&gt; While I suppose you could call a completely spoken ordinary form mass a ""low mass"" that is definitely not what most people mean when they say low mass.

This is what we called it in grade school, high school, and college. It is absolutely the normal meaning of 'low mass'. A mass that is sung -- novus ordo or TLM -- is a sung mass. You can most definitely chant the full novus ordo mass, and it's quite nice.

&gt; And the mass they are talking about is definitely the TLM. St. John Cantius has the Novus Ordo too, in English and Latin, but it is famous for its beautiful TLMs.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","I have too many cherished memories but there two that immediately spring to mind. The first is the last Harry Potter book. 

I lived in a noisy sharehouse at the time and my bedroom was right near a busy road which was distractingly loud. I ended up getting my copy of the book at 9am from a supermarket (I feel slightly bad about that, I should have supported my local bookshop but they had queues and Big W didn't). While I was there I bought a big dolphin torch. I read the last book shut in my cupboard by the light of a hanging torch sitting on a pillow because it was the quietest place in my house. I read it all the way through and didn't eat, drink or use the loo all day. It wasn't until days after did I even realise the significance of finishing the story where Harry started his. 

My second memory was reading Wintersmith by Terry Pratchett. I was sharing a flat with my best friend who had to be up early the next day. I'd started the book late and was reading through the night. And then I got to Horace, the blue cheese that had so much character and personality it was adopted by the Nac Mac Feegle. Something about the idea tickled me in all the right places from his first introduction but when I got to the scene when they're in the boat in the River Styx I completely lost it. 

I could not stop laughing, I had tears down my face and my stomach was aching, I had my face shoved in a pillow so I wouldn't wake up my housemate and every time I calmed down I'd picture a dirty little wheel of cheese in a filthy kilt merrily humming Row Row Row Your Boat and I'd lose it all over again.

http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/10/us/sheriff-joe-arpaio-criticized-over-handling-of-sex-crimes-cases.html

13yo mentally challenged girl was raped by her uncle. She told her teacher the next day. MCSO collected a rape kit. They told the family no semen or signs of rape existed. The girl's family labeled her a liar and more or less cut her off. Her uncle continued to constantly rape her for 4 more years. **HOWEVER**, the lab stated the rape kit tested positive for semen, and asked for a blood sample of the suspect. Instead, the deputy marked the case closed, and never collected the sample. Eventually, someone else collected a blood sample and sent it in. Her uncle was then arrested for one single count of sexual conduct with a minor. It took a victim's advocate **pleading** with Sheriff Joe's office before they finally added several more charges.

I hope Joe Arpaio goes to jail for the rest of his life, lives to 150, and gets raped every single day of his life. I'd say I hope he gets stabbed, but that's too quick for someone as fucking horrid as him. He doesn't deserve a quick exit like that.",1501546060

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Let's take blackjack as an example. If the dealer uses a set number of decks of cards, 2, 6, 8 it is easy to know what cards equal ten and how many aces there. Let's use a 4 deck shoe. (That's four shuffled decks together once). Tens, jacks, queen's and kings each equal a ten in hand. So 64 cards. 4 aces a deck x 4 decks equal 16 Aces

You sit down to a new 4 deck shoe. It is easy to count the cards worth ten, easier to count the aces. If you can see how many cards are left, approximately, and how many aces have come out, you can tell if you should, hit, stay, double or split. 

Trust me, it isn't as hard as I make it sound. 

If you can keep track of those cards, and follow good strategy, you can make the house edge pretty close to zero. 

Counting cards is NOT illegal. However, casinos are private businesses that can refuse the right of customers at any time. If they know you have a keen eye for counting, they can, and will, kick you out. They don't want to keep you. You aren't a dupe. They want to make money. 

Be subtle about the count. Don't bet $100 hand when the count is good when you've been playing $10 a hand at the start of a shoe. Act like you've been there before. 

There is also a thing in craps. It is practiced throws. Much harder than blackjack. It involves throwing the dice to come up with ""place bets"". Those are, most commonly, the 6 and 8. That is another way to lower the advantage to the house. It is also way more advanced. 

Stick to watching the ten cards in blackjack. As a beginner, it will serve you well. Especially if you can find a 2 deck game.  

Edit: lemme check my math. 

My math was off 16 aces in 4 decks. My bad

Edit 2: if you are playing Spanish 21, the cards go A-9, JQK. No 10. But they will allow a surrender. That is when you have a bad hand, you lose only 1/2 your bet. 

Let-it-ride: only keep your bets on winning hands (Pair of Jacks or better), don't chase. 

3 Card Poker, play any hand Queen/Jack high or better. 

Roulette: never go top street. That's the 0 (and 00) plus 123. 

Mini Baccarat: flip a coin, player or banker. The odds are very close, but favor banker slightly. 

Red Dog : don't! Horrible odds, vs payout. 

Caribbean Stud: nope. 

The Big Wheel: keep it to $1 or $2 bets. You'll be less likely to be disappointed. 

Pai Gow Poker: I don't have enough time to go in on that. Lots of fun, you can lose minimally, study first.  Be ready for chain smoking asians. Not a slight, just my experience.

DLC characters though, I find to be extremely shaky ground.  For starters, you're asking EVERY t.o. to go out and buy every character per system they plan to run so that they can be prepared for any player.  Secondly, DLC starts to get away from what makes fighters truly great and make it more like magic the gathering. 

In fighters, you can't buy skill it has to be earned through practice and DLC essentially gives someone with more money the option to be stronger than you.  Imagine top 5 were DLC and separated into 5 different packs at 5$ per pack.  Base game is 60$, to gain access to the top 5, we're at 85$ in total and at what point does it stop? here comes another strong character, better pay up if you want to have strong characters.  The person who does pay up has an advantage over you because they paid more money? that isn't fighters anymore, its a crappy card game... 5$ is low balling it, I imagine it'll cost in the area of 15-20 per pack.  Top 5 at 20$ if they were all in different packs is 100$ + the 60 for the base.

imagine this running through the course of 7 years which is how long umvc3 lasted.  If at 20$ per character pack, to get all the character and buy the game, you very well could be talking a 1000$ game.",1501546061

let me also say i dont think they were cheating, their movement ability ALWAYS backed up good play, but that triple zing...frustrating for someone who enjoys stopping a good assassin charge with a kick to the face. usually the first zing is my queue to face the sound and be ready to give a tread sandwich.

outside of that Jugg felt like it was stronger this beta, and in a better place than before. Sentinals are no longer un-approachable, but still a major threat when attacked alone.

i do feel there is some awkwardness with the battle medic grenade reload, more than a few times i was sure the animation finished, switched to the pistol, then go to switch back only to watch the reload animation again.

The most obvious candidates are Sansa and Dany. Bit of a stretch to say it will be Brienne who will take Cersei's dearest thing away which is her power. Brienne is nicknamed the Beauty precisely because she is not beautiful.

Cersei's downfall has been predicted in the prophecies. She herself believes it. This makes it extremely doubtful that Cersei ends up victorious when she is foretold to lose everything she cares about and be killed while in her despair.

&gt; Joe Arpaio, the Arizona lawman who once proclaimed himself to be &amp;quot;America&amp;#039;s Toughest Sheriff&amp;quot; and was largely praised by conservatives for his hard-line policing tactics, was found guilty Monday of criminal contempt, bringing his tenure as a relentless crusader against illegal immigration to an end.

&gt; More than a month after lawyers wrapped up closing arguments, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Arpaio guilty for defying a judge&amp;#039;s 2011 court order to refrain from racially profiling Latinos during patrols.

&gt; Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Arizona&amp;#039;s Maricopa County before losing reelection last November.

One of the opposing team (no longer remember who) hit a foul that was close to the sideline. Moises Alou looked like he could make a play for the out, so he does.

 Enter Steve Bartman, a normal guy sitting near where that foul ball would fall. He had his headphones on, listening to the game on WGN. He sees the ball coming for him and instinctively reaches up for it, interfering with the ball and potentially preventing Moises from catching it. There would be no out and and the Cubs would go on to lose the game and indeed the Series. Extending their World Series losing drought to 96 years.

 Poor Steve was unfairly blamed for the loss, he was threatened with death, his personal information was published in the Chicago Suntimes, the Mayor said something to the effect that he would not protect Steve. It was bad. The Cubs would have to wait another 13 years to win it all.

Someone told me that I had to hear American Beauty and I figured it was one of those recs that Deadheads make, they like the images and it connects with them,  but it's probably not for me. So I brushed the guy off - no on has time to hear all the music in the world, and I can be pretty stubborn  about music anyway, but it stuck in my head, I guess because I liked the movie a lot. 

So one day I was driving from the East coast through flat-ass Illinois in my busted-ass car because I was starting a new life. I'd been driving for about 13 hours at that point and I'd listened to my audiobook and the albums I'd brought along already, and when I stopped for gas I pulled it up on, probably iTunes and figured I'd give it a listen. The sun was going down, there were no cars for miles, off in the distant I saw lightning over farms and what looked like funnel clouds forming, and I was thinking - shit, what am I driving into? I put the album on, and man, I'm not someone who believes in magic, but it was magical. I've probably never described anything else as magical. But I felt calm for the first time in months, and even excited. 

I've listened to it a bunch more times and come up with probably asinine theories about why I think it's so good, but I've never listened to another Dead album, I think because I don't want to be disappointed, or break the magic, or even to see them as a band of people rather than the product of this one basically perfect thing.

If anything the show runners said it was kind of what the world might have been if Oliver hadn't gotten on the Gambit but even that is a joke since there's no reason to think that without a huge shake up in Oliver's life that he'd have stopped cheating on Laurel.    

But setting his story aside,  I'm pretty positive that Diggle's greatest fantasy wasn't to be the Green Arrow alone with Felicity but no Oliver anywhere to be seen.  And Ray couldn't care less about his business and had gone on to fall in love with Kendra and had spent three years being in love with her, not to mention him wanting to be a hero more than anything else in his life.  There's no way he'd trade all of that for a mindless Felicity that twirled in the background.  

They aliens pulled strong memories from all of them twisting them in the process (like where they took Olicity lines and let Oliver and Laurel recycle them)  and mashed them (Ray, Sara, Thea, Diggle, and Oliver) together to try and create a cohesive world that seemed familiar enough to initially accept.  But it was a flawed program that Oliver started rejecting as unreal and wrong almost immediately.  If it was his ultimate fantasy, he wouldn't have gone poking around looking for problems with it.  And his subconscious wouldn't have created Smoak Tech as their portal home.  

Laurel was a significant relationship and I'm sure Oliver regretted she was dead, but it's hard to buy that he had been secretly longing to be with her when if he'd wanted that relationship, he could have had it.  Laurel in season two was open to it.  I'd say she was pretty open to it even until her death.  But, nope, he wasn't interested.   ",1501546067

He was no more humble than any other Angel.

You mean because He wasn't rebellious and He obeyed orders, He was humble??? Again, no different than any of the angels.

&gt;It's called love. It why Jehovah allowed his Son to die. It's why Jesus gave his life for us. 

But not humility, which is the discussion.

&gt;Jesus is [Michael](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/1200003035), here's why. 

Jesus isn't a created being and He definitely isn't Michael the Archangel. Simple logic disproves it.

&gt;Ego eimi ho Ohn is a quote from the Greek Septuagint.  The Hebrew phrase אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה at Exodus 3:14 means literally ""I will be who I will be."" This has no correlation to John 8:58. 

[Wrong]( http://vintage.aomin.org/EGO.html)

&gt;The Pharisees were falsely accusing Jesus of making himself equal to God. The prophesy at Isaiah 53 says Jesus would be falsely accused. Jesus never once said he was God or made himself equal. He only ever said He was God's Son. 

Wrong. The Bible never says they were **falsely** accusing Jesus's claim to be God. Jesus refuted their claims to be possessed by a demon and to be testifying Himself, etc. He defended Himself. But when being accused of claiming to be God, He just let it go?

**Spell Subtypes** *Non-creature spells may have subtypes that are referenced in other cards. These subtypes appear in all colors, but [U](/U) has the most interaction with these spell types followed by [R](/R).*

&gt; Doom Blaze [2](/2)[B](/B)
&gt; 
&gt; Instant - Fire
&gt; 
&gt; Doom Blaze deals 3 damage to target creature. If a creature dealt damage this way would die this turn, deal 2 damage to target creature or player.
&gt; 
&gt; *”It’s like Doom Blade, but with more fire!” - Me*

----

**Ability Word: Barrage** *(If this creature deals combat damage to a creature or fights and doesn't die, [Effect])* This is primary in [R](/R)/[B](/B), secondary in [W](/W), and tertiary in [G](/G).

&gt; Cavern Dweller [1](/1)[R](/R)
&gt; 
&gt; Creature - Kobold 1/2
&gt; 
&gt; Barrage - Whenever Cavern Dweller deals combat damage to a creature or fights and doesn't die, deal 1 damage to target creature.
&gt;
&gt; When a player casts a Fire spell, Cavern Dweller fights target creature.
&gt; 
&gt; *""No take candle!""*

----

**Keyword: Tactic [Cost]** *(You may play this card as if it had Flash by paying [Cost].)* This keyword is primary in [W](/W)/[U](/U)/[G](/G) and secondary in [B](/B). It can appear on ""mono"" [R](/R) cards but are combined with one of the other colors in the Tactic cost when it is. Sometimes an effect is added or removed when used as an instant. In the following card, you pay more and gain an additional effect, but it can also be worded to allow a quickly executed plan for a weaker effect.

&gt; Hulk Smash [G](/G)
&gt; 
&gt; Sorcery - Power
&gt; 
&gt; Tactic - [1](/1)[G](/G) (You may play this card as if it had Flash by paying [1](/1)[G](/G).)
&gt; 
&gt; Until end of turn, target creature gets +3/+3 and gains Trample. If the Tactic cost was paid, until end of turn it also gains Indestructible.

4 No, they are not needed. But they will score you points in the end and the chandelabrum might be worth it if you want to use the expert jump spell at astral.

5 How many do you have? I dont think ?oGD are needed in Fire or Earth. But Air is extremely dangerous and in your game so will be water since you've geno'd ; (You're supposed to geno ; AT water not before or else the game will fill the plane with other random nasties)

6 I have never been a fan of pets in the late game but if you want a strong pet you should try to get an archon which can be obtained from high level familiar spell in deep dungeon levels.

&gt; Joe Arpaio, the Arizona lawman who once proclaimed himself to be &amp;quot;America&amp;#039;s Toughest Sheriff&amp;quot; and was largely praised by conservatives for his hard-line policing tactics, was found guilty Monday of criminal contempt, bringing his tenure as a relentless crusader against illegal immigration to an end.

&gt; More than a month after lawyers wrapped up closing arguments, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton found Arpaio guilty for defying a judge&amp;#039;s 2011 court order to refrain from racially profiling Latinos during patrols.

&gt; Arpaio served six terms as sheriff of Arizona&amp;#039;s Maricopa County before losing reelection last November.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The year 1955, the place Mr. Brown’s old bakery shop’s basement. The knuckles cracked over the bakers face as a small dribble of blood began to run from Browns noise. These knuckles of course belonged to Mr. Bubbles the most feared mafia bruiser in all of New York City (the name made him chuckle but he didn’t like to admit it). 

“Where’s Mr. Donne's coke?” Demanded Bubbles with a rasp in his throat.

“I told you i don’t kn-”

A sharp jab to the baker's ribs made him cough up some blood and sent a pain rushing up bubbles arm.  

The baker took a deep breath and looked up with sorrow in his eyes…

“Not again.” whispered Bubbles

The baker began to sing, “Ohh the pain on my body, does not compare, to the pain in my heaaarrtt…”

A quick rolling pin to the side of the head ending that. “God i hate when they sing.” sighed Bubbles.

The back door burst open, a scantily built man in a dark coat posed a pistol towards Bubble’s head.  Bubbles threw his weight behind a lob of the rolling pin knocking the gun out of the man's hand, causing minimal damage. He closed the distance, pinning the man against the wall with his right elbow at the man's throat.

Grabbing the man’s chest with his left hand, then pulling him over his stuck out left leg, he brought them both down; Bubbles having advantage on top. Both men stuck out their arms to grab the gun beside them.. Their hands touched, time stopped; their eyes met... 

The man let out a nervous laugh, “Hey,” his eyes enchanting and exhibiting a smile to wake up to after many happy years.

Bubbles shook out of it, holding the man's hand to the ground, he moved his still pinning elbow up grabbing the man’s hair, a slow raise of the head lead to a brutal slam onto the concrete floor, creating a daze over the man’s eyes; two more slams and the man was out cold leaving Bubbles hand throbbing with pain. 
Bubbles reached across and grabbed the gun, he got to his feet, took aim at the head, contemplated what life would have been like with this 52nd prince charming he’d just beaten to a pulp; and pulled the trigger.

“Least it wasn’t another sarcastic asshole rat.”

"ftfanime","t5_3n1ly","I would like to give my own ha'penny on the Thermian Argument.

As you may or may not be aware, I have a reputation for writing things that are, in a phrase, incredibly fucked up. I often have nondiegetic justification, or in simpler words, I have points I'm trying to make in the real world. Or, if I wanted to include fucked up stuff just because, I try my best to take time to analyze the real-world implications of what I'm doing and account for that.  

However, I absolutely would defend the right of people to make horrible fucked up shit that would disturb viewers in real life and serves no real out-of-universe point. I even defend the right of people to include horrible fucked up shit that doesn't even really make sense in-universe. 

*As a rule of thumb*, I would say that putting in fucked up shit for no real reason tends to make a piece of media less effective. But, unless there is a serious public health or public safety concern, the only grounds I feel I have to give a fuck is A. I feel personally offended, B. I have an ideology/philosophy that requires me to speak out against whatever ideas are being expressed, or C. I'm annoyed purely because I have a different aesthetic ideology/philosophy. 

I don't think people make things intending to be bad and worthless. If someone makes, for example, a work of fiction that glorifies child abuse, then my criticism is of the *social* views and impact, which I separate from *artistic* integrity. I believe is thoroughly possible to argue in favour of, say, genocide in a way I can artistically respect while still being morally repulsive to the point where I would feel justifying shooting someone to stop further works from being published.

So if anything, had Viacom bought them, for that reason, they'd probably yank the Scripps networks from Vue in hopes of driving more people to the other providers. 

2. The Discovery going to Sling would seem like a more legit thing, UNTIL Cordon2 pointed out that Discovery, actually has had problems with Dish which may explain why Discover isn't on Sling (I did not know until he posted what that was about). So in fact, if bad blood exist, based on what Cordon2 suggest, then (and I doubt it), but as you said, you could see Sling lose the Scripps networks that Discovery now owns.

I say ""I doubt it"" because I don't think Discovery is as big of douchebags as Viacom so they probably wouldn't do that just yet.

The book may seem like a bit of a tough read, but I can assure you it's compelling enough that any decently inquisitive teen will probably stick with it. Logic and reasoning are great finds for teens, because children are so often told ""do what I say, because I said so."" and teens tend to rebel against that and question everything.

"starcitizen_refunds","t5_3fnj9","It is not in game footage. Indeed the game was so miserably broken that this footage was a created film to fraudulently show backers what they were going to get in 3.0.

If not to convince people to continue their financial support there is no other reason to show this film to a very disappointed group of backers at a convention expecting up to the last minute that 3.0 was going to be released in front of them. 

Its all smoke and mirrors, Hype and Bullshitting.

I would not be surprised to find that a significant amount of CIG's budget is spent creating these fake game play films to keep backers wallets open. All they do is keep pushing the date back and releasing videos. 

CIG is a perpetual fund raising corporation. There is no need to actually produce the game, in fact this may be harmful to their income stream. People would stop sending them backers funds and CIG would have to fire people and figure out a multitude of ways in game to have players convert cash to game currency. Its more lucrative to stay in development mode.",1501546080

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","My fire started back when I was in high school. I used to play sports but was never seriously into them, I just liked to hang out with my friends. I was probably 30 lbs over weight, ate whatever and played way too many video games. It wasn't until my junior year in high school that I had my ""fire"" light under my butt. It was time for fall sports, basketball for me, and my dad was the coach. After the first week of try outs my dad confronted me after practice and said ""son, you're not good enough to be on varsity (which I knew), so you'd have to be on JV"" I was stoked, easy practice, still get to travel with the team and have my fun, sounds good right? Until he said ""unfortunately we don't allow juniors on JV"" I gave him a blank stare not able to wrap my head around what had just happened. I understood and stuttered ""so...so.. you're cutting me?"" ""Yes"" he most definitely did. Being cut from the team by your own dad sucks, a lot. That was my fire. I signed up for the local gym after school and weightlifting classes during school. I had a mission to make my dad wish he had never cut me. After a year of hard work, better diet and a more active lifestyle I could dunk a volleyball during the next basketball season. He asked me to try out again and I refused. Mission success. Since then I have remained healthy and active. Being cut was a turning point in my life and I've never looked back.",1501546080

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; Init script wrapping is a clutch and was necessary maybe 4 years ago. Don't do that stuff.

I don't. But not every package has unit files, whether on Debian 9  or CentOS 7 so there is still few services around using it. That's what I was ""fixing"", not my own stuff, that is ported long time ago.

&gt; There is no ""end"" of boot order in systemd. The order is determined by dependencies. You did the right thing by using it and if you had been unlucky, your previously accidentally working scripts would have bitten you at one point…

Well, there is, it is called a target. Just that target is ""state of the system"", not ""all scripts were run in order""

&gt; IMHO, systemd's logging is one of the best around, so you don't actually lose anything with enabling the journal - just make sure to limit it accordingly or rotate. But I guess you already knew.

Then you do not know much. It is severly misdesigned and in edge cases (that are pretty easy to accomplish in ""normal"" system) it will make some operations slow and/or very unoptimal.

It can open [over a hundred files](https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2460) just to display status of freshly started service because there is no time-based index so it has to sift thru every log ever created for a given services, which even on SSD takes 3+ seconds, thrashes a bunch of cache and in worst case (HDD, actual server, actually logging stuff) tens of second. 

All of it could be fixed by simply caching last few lines for running service in RAM (or possibly just picking better backend)

It isn't really that fast either. If only they used something common, like SQLite, as format, it would both work better and be more easily accessible outside of systemd ecosystem",1501546084

Expecting to see the angelic figure of Blanc step-forward, i feel to one knee and prepared to swear my life to my one true goddess... and was greeted by CFW Trick. 

""Aww WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS HISTY?"" I s creamed as the robotic version of pedo bear began licking my Dakimakuras and bouncing around my room like an retarded ping pong ball. ""Oh, so many things to licky licky!"" he said. ""Shut the fuck up cunt, why the fucken fuck are you here you mongrel flea-ridden dog?' ""I was banished from Gamindustri for crimes against snow lolis"" Trick said in a low and sad tone, finally calming down. ""Great, just great, it was a trap all along to get rid of Gamindustris Loweecon.

""Well, what the fuck are we going to do about this? Lolis are 2D and your now in 3D, your a dickhead, and i don't fucken want you in my house"" I said with a deadpan stare."" ""Please sir, i have nowhere to go and without lolis my charecter has no motivation or plot"" with this, Trick began to cry.

""Don't cry you fagget, i guess i have to sort something out"" i exclaimed as i rolled my eyes. ""There must be something i can do to get this spastic lolibot the fuck away from me"" I thought to myself. Wait, I got it!

So i went down to the department store and bought a tablet Pc and a waterproof case, set it up with Wifi, and sent Trick down there. ""What are we doing?"" Said Trick who was obviousley shitting himself. ""sit down on the floor and shut the fuck up"" i said. I then picked up the tablet, went to Nhentai and typed in 'lolicon' into the search box. ""Here fuckwit, you can have this as long as you promise to never ever leave this basement"" i explained ""LICKY! I promise LICKY LICKY. 

So i went back upstairs, picked up the phone and called the police. ""Yeah listen, some sick fuck broke into my house and is watching lolicon in my basement, come arrest it"" No sooner had i put the phone down a swat team busted through my door, flew straight downstairs and dragged lolisaurus Rex out of my house.

""ahhhh!? HELP ME!"" screamed trick as he was forcibly shoved into a van. ""Nah, go fuckyourself"" i said as i watched the van drive away. I never seen Trick again.

"manga","t5_2ql0i","You can have 2.000 hours into something and still be a beginner if you never improved your ways of doing said thing (and were not good at it, to begin with).

You have read 200+ manga (which is no feat, considering you read ones which are 3 chapters short), which is fine and all, but no argument or even some reason why your behaviour is tolerable.

If you want to do a list about every manga you have read (because it seems like that at this point), just say it that way, because it is not a list about ""reincarnation"" aka ""isekai"" and anyone with a search engine should be able to find a better list, which is actually genre specific.

You can either change the formatting, do actually sorting and have a list going on.

The issue I have is that your list is not doing anything for those looking for real Isekais, etc. Just saying ""reincarnation manga and more"" and dropping some unrelated stuff abotu reincarnation is not what people would expect coming here...
They would look for stuff which is in relation to Reincarnation, like Isekais.

I have said the Term ""Isekai"" multiply times already, most likely even mixed it up when I wanted to say Reincarnation, because Reincarnation goes hand in hand to Isekai (Isekai = the MC gets transported to another world, through some god, reincarnation or summoning) but I think thats what you mean after I have seen most of your titles. (some Reincarnation Manga, which is not an Isekai, would be ""Tales of Demons and Gods"" (in this case a lot of korean mangas nowadays/the last few months are fitting here), ""The Scholars Reincarnation"" and ""Tsuyokute New Saga"" are some popular recent ones).

&gt;  i.e. this isn't specifically a list for beginners or specifically to help a bunch of people it's just me dumping a bunch of reincarnation(and other) manga on here

and this is the main reason why I am not a fan of your list, your description doesnt fit the content at all or misses the point of the description.",1501546086

If you do get a better Garchomp, Jirachi would probably be even better to pair him up with than Celebi, or you could pair Garchomp with Celebi and Jirachi. The reason is, that Garchomp is killing an opponents pokemon real fast and Jirachi buffs your whole team whenever an pokemon dies. Celebi is just real good in general, so you should train it anyway. I personally don't really like charizad very much, cause people seem to invest way too much into him, even tho he gets real bad past lvl 60.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","I definitely expected Dany to not believe Jon when it came to him mentioning WW and the undead, and her sterness during their meeting also didn't surprise me, but still, her haughtiness seemed like an illogical move to me. All Dany really has at this point are Dragons and Dothraki, a powerful force, but she lacks support of any of the kingdoms (she had the Reach and Dorne, both of which have been handled by Cersei), so I don't think she has the luxury of being so stuckup with a potential ally when she is clearly lacking in that department.

Jon also doesn't know Dany the way the viewers do, he was still much less haughty and rude than Dany, all he sees is a stuckup, hypocritical, highborn girl constantly claiming her right to a country she's barely ever been in. Still, Jon treats her gracefully and with respect (at least more than she shows him). I wouldn't say this was a sign of her becoming the mad queen, but it was definitely not a scene that shone a positive light on her.

Lastly, she's acting like the woman who already owns Westeros, which she is not. Jon isn't seceding from her country, it's not currently her country to begin with. She has tons of titles and a large throne room, but ever since she's joined the real Game of Thrones, she's been a total amateur. She's lost 4 of her 6 major pieces (Dorne, Highgarden, Unsullied, and her fleet), and she has yet to achieve anything in Westeros besides taking Casterly Rock (something that was effectively given to her by Jaime and isn't nearly worth as much as it cost her).",1501546088

"avast","t5_30cvn","Yeah it's not the least controversial part of Avast I'll give you that. I'll preface what I'm gonna say by clarifying that (as per the sidebar) while I'm a ~~mostly thankless internet janitor~~ moderator here I have no ties to Avast whatsoever, my opinion is my own personal.

If you've got some technical nous it's well within your capability to ensure software (particularly related to security) is configured to your taste and tested to ensure the result is what you imagined it to be. This is standard practice, right? The option you're not happy with is a tickbox in the settings - it's not like anything underhand is occuring here, and it would take 5-10 mins to go through every setting this software has. It's quite a common thing for AV software (both client and server-side) to attach a signature &amp; extra headers to emails - this is not unique to Avast and has been a thing for ages now.

As I said in the other thread I've seen AV-related email signatures in professional environments and nobody bats an eyelid. The Avast one is small, clean and looks reasonably professional - I've seen some real shockers in my time (""hey let's put a big 200k JPEG of our company logo at the bottom of every email! don't forget the 5 pages of pseudo-legal fantasy land bullshit and the big green reminder not to print anything *ever* because *teh enviromint!*"") and I'm sure you have too. And I'm pretty sure Grandma still uses Incredimail from an AOL account anyway ;)

As far as ""there are no attachments"" you don't necessarily need to have an attachment in an email for it to contain bad stuff.

Sorry bud I realise you and I probably aren't going to totally agree on this one (and that's OK, we don't have to :) and I do understand that ""hey wait this thing added something to my outgoing email and I didn't expect that"" is a concern and perhaps an unpleasant surprise for some people. I just don't see why it seems to be such a big issue for some when we are talking about a default setting they don't like that can be changed in 30 seconds flat.

Having said all that ... if I did my email on a Windows box, would I turn that Avast signature off? You're damn right I would ;)",1501546088

The reason why there might not have been a widespread strike at Tesla yet is that the complaints we hear about might not be as prevalent as one might think. 

You can be sure that the moment when the majority reach the point of alienation, strikes will follow. Strikes have likely not occurred yet because the majority are content.
 
Same can be said about any company, or even members of a population and those that govern them.

Again, I'm sure that these working conditions did not suddenly start when Tesla purchased Grohmann Engineering. Yet the timing of the purchase and the complaints is hard to ignore, given the view of unions when it comes to removing the human element from the assembly line; means less workers on the assembly line, and less union dues coming in.

*****
&gt; A majority of likely voters in a new poll doesn&amp;#039;t think the U.S. should build a wall along the country&amp;#039;s southern border.

&gt; The conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports poll finds that 37 percent of likely voters said the U.S. should construct a border wall in an effort to curb illegal immigration.

&gt; The House of Representatives last week approved a national security-themed spending package that includes $1.6 billion to start building President Trump&amp;#039;s proposed border wall.

Creating this false sense of rarity actually spurs people to buy within the allotted time so they don't miss out - while in fact CIG are making even more money. 

In the right environment, businesses will use an arbitrary limited time offer using the scarcity principle. They're doing this to sell more ships than they would if they were just always available with no hype.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Glorious visuals, but watered down plot and garbage character use in Valerian. And while Guardians had a formulaic plot, it took time to show each character's personality and quirks. It also established thematic connections to Star-Lord's past and helps explain much of the plot. Valerian, while based on a more original work, was simply not as good of a comic book movie. 

Just because it's original doesn't automatically make it great for a certain crowd. While Valerian helped inspire Star Wars, Valerian was too alien (heh) for American audiences. A comic book from FRANCE? Ooh la la! Meanwhile, George Lucas makes a much more relatable film with borrowed concepts from Valerian.

Star Wars was more relatable in '77 because it presented a youth struggling in the middle of nowhere and wanting to fight a tyrannical government that could destroy everything he ever knew. Sounds familiar... because the Cold War wasn't easy to miss. He then goes out and fights the evil Empire, thus earning the admiration of his new family and helping save the Galaxy. 

Valerian... a buddy cop space epic movie for '77 was too early for buddy cop movies in space. You had Star Trek and Star Wars... but a duo fighting countless alien species for a McGuffin of some sort? Cool, but the budget's gone through the roof and you have to sacrifice half the alien costumes or hire cheaper actors to not piss off the execs... again. Too much at stake with a volatile audience. Even Star Wars was thought to be a failure until people somehow liked it. A movie based on a French comic book is too far from what the audience wants in 1977.

&gt; A majority of likely voters in a new poll doesn&amp;#039;t think the U.S. should build a wall along the country&amp;#039;s southern border.

&gt; The conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports poll finds that 37 percent of likely voters said the U.S. should construct a border wall in an effort to curb illegal immigration.

&gt; The House of Representatives last week approved a national security-themed spending package that includes $1.6 billion to start building President Trump&amp;#039;s proposed border wall.

All these things run contrary to every other source.   But I turned it to be right. 

I even stated early in that the Snapdragon and the exynos were neck and neck and turned out to be right when xda and all other sites claimed it was inferior.  

And what about Jerry rig everything and other sources  claiming that the S7 relies on a mesh to keep water out and steam can pass through and destroy the device? 

Who's right about that one?

I may be controversial because I specifically only bother when the entire tech media are wrong but when have I ever been inaccurate?

A video demonstrating the lag caused by package disablers clear as day. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS7/comments/6awguj/this_is_what_package_disabler_lag_looks_like

That's how ridiculously religious some fanatics who cling to misconceptions have become. They literally downvote video evidence. You think that means I'm wrong? 
        
That just demonstrates why it took 200 years for people to accept that the earth revolved around the sun and why the Wright Brothers were debunked for 2 years in the US and had to go to France to find a supporter. It was unpopular because the establishment had a vested interest in the myth but popularity had no bearing on veracity.  

Your fanaticism has you believing things can only be correct if they are popular beliefs. That's ridiculous and no way to win an argument. 

And even if Gorilla Glass 5 turns out to be as scratch resistance as gg4 which is no one's experience at all. The Jerry rig everything guy claimed that his tools were leaving a residue and didn't even repeat the test. You are so bent out of shape about my coverage for some weird reason that you're completely missing the point.

But being part of a ""happy family"" when you're a child must be sooooo different from the experience of being the parent in a family, no matter how ""happy"".  As a child, you had no responsibilities, and if you had a good family then what you probably remember is feeling secure, always being taken care of, someone always there to run to to make things better, unconditional love, having a lot of the attention on you, getting lots of support and encouragement, etc.  But as the *parent* in a ""happy family,"" even if there are good moments, you won't have that same feeling of being secure and taken care of -- instead, it's now your job to have all the responsibilities, take care of everything, make sacrifices and make things about the kids instead of yourself, be a provider, be the giver of unconditional love (to a person who won't love you back quite the same way) and encouragement and support (to someone incapable of really supporting and encouraging you back), deal with all the difficulties and frustrations of taking care of little kids.  It's now up to you to do everything to make things seem happy and great for the kids.  As the parent, popping out a kid will not lead to those secure, carefree, loved, and happy feelings from childhood.  *Being taken care of* is a very different experience from having to *take care of others*.  So having a kid to try to recreate how you felt about family from your childhood seems very misguided and impossible.  And if you're in the other group of people that, rather than trying to revert to childhood, are chasing an imaginary ""happy family"" image, well then you have expectations of something that's not even real.

**Why Does the U.S. Government Borrow Money Instead of Just Printing More?**

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/why-does-the-us-government-bor/

You see, recently foreign governments and investors have in fact stopped buying US debt, which is a consequence of real inflation being higher than the interest rates provided. And the best part is that the government is now buying debt from itself.

&gt; But wait just a cotton-pickin’ second. (This is how they used to talk in the cowboy TV shows of my formative youth.) You want to stop the Treasury from BORROWING. But right now, if the Treasury borrows the money for one year by selling a one-year “Treasury note,” it pays a measly .25 percent. Yes, you read right: .25 percent! You could look it up. But that’s exactly the same amount it’s paying the banks to redeposit money with the Fed!

&gt; So retiring the debt by issuing more dollars — in today’s environment — wouldn’t save any interest payments at all!

That's right, every dollar we are creating to pay off our debts/interest now is adding a 1:1 effect on inflation (plus 0.25%). And when you manipulate the CPI to underestimate real inflation via the several 'adjustments' throughout the years (Reagans was one of the largest in 1983 via housing adjustment) and inflate the economy with basically no interest rates, the government saves money due to half the budget being entitlement spending (i.e. affected by cost of living adjustments). **You don't even need to believe whether or not CPI methodology is legit, the simple fact that the three major changes over the years have all produced significantly lower inflation rates means that people will simply be getting less.**

**So while 90% of the people have no idea why things have gotten so bad, we actually have a hidden tax called inflation and the government is using it to keep up with our debts and pay out less in entitlements by under-reporting CPI (the difference between real and reported inflation is the savings or hidden tax since many paid for these entitlements like SSI/SSDI).**",1501546101

Thanks again for your enduring support. I must admit I out of my league here and feel very lost and worried.

I have really confused things; stuffing up the password then finding the password, then changing the password but probably used a wrong seed because I have three of them.

I found the original seed I received on 18 Jul and have been using that with a new password but still no wallet with any movement 

I know all the litecoin were deposited into electrm wallet on 18 and 25 Jul; I even have a picture of it on my phone of 18 Jul deposit.

Can I still track down the wallet despite the mess I made of things? 

I have the original seed used for 18 and 25 Jul but still cant find wallet.

I'm totalling guessing here, but is it possible to uninstall electrum completely and using the same flawed password that commenced this problem with the correct seed this time and giving that a go.

I'm assuming thought the seed is the secret is that correct ?

sorry for rambling but I'm stressed.

Is there a better way to communicate rather than using this means?

thanks again Tangodelmar

*****
&gt; A majority of likely voters in a new poll doesn&amp;#039;t think the U.S. should build a wall along the country&amp;#039;s southern border.

&gt; The conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports poll finds that 37 percent of likely voters said the U.S. should construct a border wall in an effort to curb illegal immigration.

&gt; The House of Representatives last week approved a national security-themed spending package that includes $1.6 billion to start building President Trump&amp;#039;s proposed border wall.

"fo4","t5_2tzv4","I actually like that having it on the PS4 has limited what mods I have. I'm using a place anywhere, a scrap everything mod (if people were living there, they'd clean up the trash. Mostly I just use it to de-trash my settlements because I feel like you should have been able to clean up the trash to begin with.) a mod that allows for increased build height, and a mod that makes the settlement footprints a bit larger. (Super useful for Bunker Hill because you can put water pumps and that stupid ass Brahmin that's always in the fucking way outside the wall that way which really helps with space. My current project is turning bunker hill into a stylistically consistent but pretty place to live.) 

Also, I use a mod that lets me place trees and plants, cause again I feel like those should have been an option from the start.


And I have one that adds some retextures of standard build pieces, but I'm hesitant to use it because if I accidentally turn the mod off, my entire build disappears if I used the retextures. It's fun to play with but I'm paranoid I'll accidentally wipe all my work if I have to disable it for some reason. 

All in all, I like that PS4 mods force you to use in game graphics because everything still looks consistent. I can make things a bit cleaner and tidier without breaking visual immersion. 

But I hand build everything and avoid mods that do the work for me. I do like that there are mods that take care of some of the fussy details that bothered me before though. Seriously, all the trash.

Part of my interest in looking at historical singing is that I feel that modern singing has become extremely muddled in regards to vowel uniformity. 

I was listening to recordings of Vissi d'arte the other day, all world renowned singers, but I was struck by how differently each singer modified and approached their vowels. Also when I listen to early recordings (Mattia Bastianini) I am stuck by how different their vowels sound compared to modern singers. I have a theory that the advent of modern recording technology has resulted in the prevalence of dark and back singing. If this variation exists today, I can only assume that 300 years ago things must have been quite different. But it's all theoretical at this point. 

Historical research may provide some needed specificity in regards to singing technique and vowel production ",1501546109

Certain forms of racism will still exist but I think lots of millennials will be exposed to blacks and latinos, and as a result will not hate and fear them the way their parents did.

And being able to understand that thought process from an academic curiosity, I wonder sometimes if it borders on empathy. And it horrifies me to be able to see the ""worst people"" as human and understand how they get to a certain point via a combination of personal decisions and contexts that allow the behavior to happen. But, at the end of the day, that sadness dissipates because I feel very lucky to see what is going on, and not just accept a story from someone else ""this person is bad because of xyz..."".

*****
&gt; A majority of likely voters in a new poll doesn&amp;#039;t think the U.S. should build a wall along the country&amp;#039;s southern border.

&gt; The conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports poll finds that 37 percent of likely voters said the U.S. should construct a border wall in an effort to curb illegal immigration.

Given that they're compact and can fit four people in a single row, it seems like an ideal coaster for Knott's. My guess is on either an infinity from Gerstlauer or a Big Dipper from Mack.

By your description I'd cut the drain stack removing the p- trap and  the bottom cut I'd do low enough to fit the new drain. Then make up the parts dry fit and once it all fit glue the parts, then using  two no-hub connectors to connect my new parts to the drain stack.

"HistoricFashionPorn","t5_3l1yz","Sarah Maria Wright (1817 – 1908) wore this dress for her marriage to Daniel Neal (1816 – 1907) on 27 July 1841 at St. Nicholas' Church in Skirbeck, Lincolnshire. It was donated together with a spelling book which she inscribed with her name on February 15th, 1826.

In the 1851 census Daniel is described as living at Woad Farm House in Skirbeck, Lincolnshire, where he was probably working as a labourer in the production of woad. The dress therefore reveals the type of clothing rural labourers' wives might wear for their weddings. Such objects tend to survive in much smaller quantities than fashionable wedding dress as they would have been worn for Sunday best long after the event, or handed down.

Sarah chose a fashionable design for her dress with its full sleeves, low neckline, gathered shoulders and full skirt. It is, however, made of printed cotton which would have been cheaper than the silks and challis fabrics of costlier wedding dresses. The print is a copy of more expensive designs which again adds interest as such textiles do not tend to survive.

And I do consider it trifling bullshit when questions with clear agenda just get asked again and again and get the same answers again and again.

And the thing about the play book. It's accurate! So rarely am I surprised or taken aback by what these newcomers have to say. A lot of our regulars have rich, nuanced opinions of things, but these newcomers are so predictable, it's like they have a script.

So I'm not gonna sit here and go, ""oh wow, great question! I never thought of it like that before! This is so meaningful to the conversation!"" when all of that is a lie. It's a shit question.

"news","t5_2qh3l","I mean I probably wouldn't be mad about something a person I don't even know talking about stuff on the internet.

Also you made it pretty clear that a bunch of your family members wanted pain meds, that multiple of them were refused by doctors who were trained for 8+ years, and that what you say isn't reliable because of your emotional attachment. All the stuff and context you put out doesn't really matter when there is a lack of trust.

What I feel like I do know is that trained professionals didn't want to give you guys pain meds and that you got very upset because of it. I also understand that apparently your GF, dad, grandparents, and you have all tried to get to pain meds and I guess were turned down?

I never had problems getting pain medication for myself or my loved ones. It might be because of the locations. But the idea that you saw multiple professionals and none of them gave you proper pain care is very, very alien to me. The only type of medicine that I've ever had problems getting are psych meds and that's because I'm not even sure doctors know what to do with those things half the time.

My understanding is that addiction isn't even super common. It's something that happens to people though, any person, and it's a terrible terrible thing and anyone with half a brain would rather want to put up with a constant 2/3 on the pain scale then put up with something as horrible as a drug addiction.

Either way it sounds like they got the proper amount of pain care. When it comes to dying people opioids are probably the only relief out there besides weed and LSD. So hopefully when your Dad passed it was as painlessly and as dignified as possible. Every body deserves that.",1501546114

"uwaterloo","t5_2rb5s","&gt; So then your theory suggests that the UW population was tricked into voting for Opt-in with methods that you consider ""meaningless"".

&gt; I think that's a lot of mental gymnastics to avoid the more likely explanation that people just straight up didn't want their money going to a group that participated in things they didn't agree with.

You'd be correct, if the debate had been focused on BDS, but it wasn't. I also found grave issue with Opt-in members fabricating lies about their opposition. 

&gt; Of course, but your logic is that if WPIRG didn't do this controversial thing (BDS), there wouldn't have been an uproar. 

They had supported plenty of controversial things that many of us don't support, there was no uproar because no one really cared what they thought. Their referendum was virtue signalling and wouldn't have even accomplished anything. They fooled a bunch of people into supporting them, then Opt-in did the same.

How about an ability or a passive (Or an equippable ability that is purely a passive) that lets him automatically take a percent of all damage the rest of the party takes.  He has a hard time guarding the party so maybe he can get value as somewhat of an HP battery, while tossing out Chops and Hews.

Germany and France/Belgium/the British had created a line of trenches from the neutral Switzerland to the English Channel, basically resulting in a stalemate and the Russians where preoccupied with murdering each other over communism to be able to mount an offensive on the Germans on a large scale anyways. After Kaisershlacht failed, Germany had pretty much exhausted most of its resources/supply lines (food and ammunition couldn't be transported to the front lines fast enough since the German Sturmtruppen moved too far up and couldn't carry enough to sustain themselves for very long) and the English and French were depleted years before. So when the American ""doughboys"" rolled in they where able to reinforce the depleted allied lines, and since the Germans did not have such an advantage, the allies where given the upper hand, which I personally believe won the war for them.

 If the U.S didn't get involved I think we would've seen a much weaker Europe in the further years, since they would've had to deplete themselves further to win the war, one way or another.",1501546122

Example: a loser wins $1,000 in the lottery, buys a bunch of fun stuff, parties, blows the whole thing a few days.  A ""winner"" might take that money and add it to their savings, pushing the balance 3 or 4 months ahead of schedule on some project or plan that is being worked on.",1501546124

"politics","t5_2cneq","Highlights from Bill Browder's Senate Judiciary Testimony:

&gt;Russia has a well-known reputation for corruption; unfortunately, I discovered that it was far worse than many had thought.

&gt;When Putin was first elected in 2000, he found that the oligarchs had misappropriated much of the president’s power as well. They stole power from him while stealing money from my investors.

&gt;**in July 2003 ... Putin arrested Russia’s biggest oligarch and richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.** After Khodorkovsky’s conviction, the other oligarchs went to Putin and asked him what they needed to do to avoid sitting in the same cage as Khodorkovsky. From what followed, **it appeared that Putin’s answer was, “Fifty percent.” He wasn’t saying 50 percent for the Russian government or the presidential administration of Russia, but 50 percent for Vladimir Putin personally. From that moment on, Putin became the biggest oligarch in Russia and the richest man in the world**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**Over 25 Interior Ministry officials barged into my Moscow office and the office of the American law firm that represented me. The officials seized all the corporate documents connected to the investment holding companies of the funds that I advised. I didn’t know the purpose of these raids so I hired the smartest Russian lawyer I knew, a 35-year-old named Sergei Magnitsky.** I asked Sergei to investigate the purpose of the raids and try to stop whatever illegal plans these officials had.

&gt;Sergei went out and investigated. **He came back with the most astounding conclusion of corporate identity theft: The documents seized by the Interior Ministry were used to fraudulently re-register our Russian investment holding companies to a man named Viktor Markelova known criminal convicted of manslaughter. After more digging, Sergei discovered that the stolen companies were used by the perpetrators to misappropriate $230 million of taxes that our companies had paid to the Russian government in the previous year.**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;As I thought about it, the murder of Sergei Magnitsky was done to cover up the theft of $230 million from the Russian Treasury. I knew that the people who stole that money wouldn’t keep it in Russia. As easily as they stole the money, it could be stolen from them. These people keep their ill-gotten gains in the West, where property rights and rule of law exist. This led to the idea of freezing their assets and banning their visas here in the West.

&gt;**In 2010, I traveled to Washington and told Sergei Magnitsky’s story to Senators Benjamin Cardin and John McCain. They were both shocked and appalled and proposed a new piece of legislation called The Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act.**

&gt;Despite the White House’s desire to reset relations with Russia at the time, this case shined a bright light on the criminality and impunity of the Putin regime and persuaded Congress that something needed to be done. **In November 2012 the Magnitsky Act passed the House of Representatives by 364 to 43 votes and later the Senate 92 to 4 votes. On December 14, 2012, President Obama signed the Sergei Magnitsky Act into law.**

&gt;**Putin was furious. Looking for ways to retaliate against American interests, he settled on the most sadistic and evil option of all: banning the adoption of Russian orphans by American families.**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**since 2012 it’s emerged that Vladimir Putin was a beneficiary of the stolen $230 million that Sergei Magnitsky exposed.**

&gt;**I estimate that he has accumulated $200 billion of ill-gotten gains from these types of operations over his 17 years in power.** He keeps his money in the West and all of his money in the West is potentially exposed to asset freezes and confiscation. **Therefore, he has a significant and very personal interest in finding a way to get rid of the Magnitsky sanctions.**

&gt;**The second reason why Putin reacted so badly to the passage of the Magnitsky Act is that it destroys the promise of impunity he’s given to all of his corrupt officials.**

&gt;**There are approximately ten thousand officials in Russia working for Putin who are given instructions to kill, torture, kidnap, extort money from people, and seize their property. Before the Magnitsky Act, Putin could guarantee them impunity and this system of illegal wealth accumulation worked smoothly.** However, after the passage of the Magnitsky Act, Putin’s guarantee disappeared. **The Magnitsky Act created real consequences outside of Russia and this created a real problem for Putin and his system of kleptocracy.**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt; One of the most shocking attempts took place in the spring and summer of last year when a group of Russians went on a lobbying campaign in Washington to try to repeal the Magnitsky Act by changing the narrative of what had happened to Sergei.

&gt;**Who was this group of Russians acting on behalf of the Russian state? Two men named Pyotr and Denis Katsyv, a woman named Natalia Veselnitskaya**, and a large group of American lobbyists, all of whom are described below.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**Her first step was to set up a fake NGO that would ostensibly promote Russian adoptions, although it quickly became clear that the NGO’s sole purpose was to repeal the Magnitsky Act. This NGO was called the Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Foundation (HRAGI).**

&gt;**Through HRAGI, Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet intelligence officer naturalised as an American citizen, was hired to lead the Magnitsky repeal effort.**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**Veselnitskaya also instructed U.S. law firm Baker Hostetler and their Washington, D.C.-based partner Marc Cymrot to lobby members of Congress to support an amendment taking Sergei Magnitsky’s name off the Global Magnitsky Act. Mr. Cymrot was in contact with Paul Behrends, a congressional staffer on the House Foreign Affairs Committee at the time, as part of the anti-Magnitsky lobbying campaign.**

&gt;**Veselnitskaya, through Baker Hostetler, hired Glenn Simpson of the firm Fusion GPS to conduct a smear campaign against me and Sergei Magnitsky in advance of congressional hearings on the Global Magnitsky Act.**

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;As part of Veselnitskaya’s lobbying, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, Chris Cooper of the Potomac Group, was hired to organize the Washington, D.C.-based premiere of a fake documentary about Sergei Magnitsky and myself. This was one the best examples of Putin’s propaganda.

&amp;nbsp;
&gt;**On June 13, 2016, they funded a major event at the Newseum to show their fake documentary, inviting representatives of Congress and the State Department to attend.**

&gt;**While they were conducting these operations in Washington, D.C., at no time did they indicate that they were acting on behalf of Russian government interests, nor did they file disclosures under the Foreign Agent Registration Act.**

**SECOND EDIT; TO ADD:**

**From Trump's Interview with The New York Times.**

&gt;""The meal was going toward dessert,"" Trump said. ""I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about things. **Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.""**

"EternalCardGame","t5_3byur","I think the issue with lifeforce decks is mostly that they are heavily dependent on drawing katra and untapping with her. Blood call invoker is the only other decent lifeforce bomb but you also need to untap and make it to eot with him. He also remains fairly manageable even if you do go off with him on the board.

There are enough good lifeforce activators to make the deck between ayan, vara's favors, etc considering many cards in xenan give life and saw play before set 2.

However, many of these activators give response windows meaning your katra can get torched adding even more unreliability to the game plan.

As a result, lifeforce midrange strategies have a ceiling somewhere around xenan obelisk decks but require much more than just drawing and playing an obelisk.

Eventually there will be enough lifeforce bombs to make the deck that Katra is clearly designed for, but lifeforce likely won't be used except as a splashed mechanic for many sets (essentially being treated like heart of the vault is now).

Ayan is probably still worth crafting regardless if you intend to play xenan anything. He's a torch-able 3 drop but doesn't have much competition at that mana cost in xenan. He's probably best suited for an aggressive meta because he can drop down and eat a 2 drop but is much weaker against control.",1501546125

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","TLDR of the opening post: Author puts *(Lore)* in the title only to turn the entire thread into a not-so-subtle pseudo-political tirade. Smells like bait. 

But in case it isn't bait, let me put something straight. If you want to try and shove your ideology into a video game, at least make an effort and get to know its lore better.

Races of Eorzea aren't coherent groups with homogeneous racial identities. Just like the Eorzean city-states aren't built on racial homogenity. This comes down primarily to the fact that history of the Eorzean races and Eorzean civilisation is significantly longer than history of their contemporary city states. There were other states or state-like entities before, such as Mhach, Amdapor and Nym during the War of the Magi (also built on ideological rather than racial homogeneity) or Gelmorra after that. When current city states were founded Eorzean races weren't closely-knit groups isolated from each other.

If anything, city states are built on the political definition of nation rather than traditional racial/ethnic one. It's a matter of whether an individual both defines himself or herself as well as is perceived as a citizen of Limsa Lominsa, Gridania, Ishgard, Ul'dah or Ala Mhigo. Not a matter of being born of a specific race.

According to the ultimate lore source that is *Encyclopaedia Eorzea*, this is what racial structure of each Eorzean city state looks like.

Limsa Lominsa:

&gt; Sea Wolf Roegadyn: 40%

&gt; Seeker of the Sun Miqo'te: 20%

&gt; Plainsfolk Lalafell: 20%

&gt; Midlander Hyur: 10%

&gt; Other: 10%

Gridania:

&gt; Midlander Hyur: 40%

&gt; Wildwood Elezen: 30%

&gt; Duskwight Elezen: 10%

&gt; Keeper of the Moon Miqo'te: 10%

&gt; Other: 10%

Ishgard:

&gt; Ishgardian Elezen: 70%

&gt; Midlander Hyur: 20%

&gt; Other: 10%

Ul'dah (refugees not taken into account):

&gt; Midlander Hyur: 30%

&gt; Highlander Hyur: 10%

&gt; Dunesfolk Lalafell: 40%

&gt; Hellsguard Roegadyn: 10%

&gt; Other: 10%

Ala Mhigo:

&gt; Highlander Hyur: 60%

&gt; Hellsguard Roegadyn: 10%

&gt; Midlander Hyur: 10%

&gt; Seeker of the Sun Miqo'te: 10%

&gt; Other: 10%

With the exception of Ishgard Eorzena city states have highly racially heterogeneous populations. Don't even know where you got that concept of oppressed minorities from. If this is about Ishgard, then you're wrong, again. Internal problems of Ishgard are akin to class struggle, not racial conflict. While that struggle overlaps with racial structure of Ishgardian population partially, it's far from being a factor. There are no Hyur among the aristocracy, but not every Elezen is part of it either.

Why should Gridania and Ishgard pursue any sort of racial-based population exchange? Hyur of Ishgard are not Gridanian migrants, just as Elezen in Gridania aren't Ishgardian migrants (with some exceptions). The whole idea is even more stupid if you consider that Gridania, due to its specific circumstances, limits its immigration heavily. And Ishgard isn't Elezen homenland. They don't have one, as they used to be the race that spanned across entirety of Eorzea before all other contemporary races arrived via migration waves.

Same with Limsa Lominsa and Ul'dah. Sending Hellsguard to Vylbrand? Why? Just because they're Roegadyn? They're a functioning part of  Ul'dahn society providing widely sought services. And they don't even have that much in common with the Sea Wolves anyway.

TLDR: Stop trying to bend the lore to fit your ideology if you have no clue about that lore.

The idea of Eorzean Alliance becoming an empire is also laughably bad, but that's a topic for an entire separate post.",1501546127

I use voicemeeter banana as a soundboard, with this my system audio and my discord audio goes to different places (they eventually go to my headphones together, but they are processed separately)

with this kind of setup you should be able to record just the system audio without the discord, or you can ditch the bot and record everything in there.

the downside of ditching the bot however, is that voicemeeter will take both your system output and your discord output (and your microphone, of course) and record it into a single file/channel, so if you need/want to do more specific editing in the end this will be a worse option than the bot.

So I'd record my system through voicemeeter and let the bot record the users.

be aware that it is the system audio as a whole, so be sure to mark your discord as DND and close any application that might give you notification audio

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","**Lawful Good:** Laws are there for a reason, and I will follow these rules, regardless of circumstance. If I see a starving child trying to steal food, the law obligates that I turn them into the authorities. I will make sure the child is treated fairly and try to show the child the error of their ways. 

**Neutral Good**: Laws are there for a reason, but they cannot possibly cover all circumstances. If I see a starving child trying to steal food, I will give the child a scolding and pay for their food.

**Chaotic Good**: Laws aren't my thing, but that won't stop me from being good. If I see a starving child trying to steel food, I will distract the shopkeeper so the child can get away. I may or may not pay for what the child stole. 

---

**Lawful Neutral**: I have a strict code of conduct I abide by. I see a starving child trying to steal food. I may want to help this child, but if my code of conduct requires that I punish the child I will do so. Some may consider it harsh, but I will not go against my beliefs. 

**True Neutral**: I do not care for laws or causes or codes of conduct. I care only about my own purposes. I have been known to do both good and evil as it suits my purpose. If I see a starving child trying to steal food I may turn them in to the shopkeeper for a reward, or use the child's actions as a distraction to steal something myself. 

**Chaotic Neutral**: I'm a free spirit, laws or goals be damned. If I see a starving child trying to steal food I may sing a little tune to myself while contemplating if the color red that I see is the same as the color red that the shopkeeper sees.

---

**Lawful Evil**: I have a way of life that I follow, and I do not shy away in attempting to force others to submit to it as well. If I see a starving child trying to steal food, such conduct is not acceptable in MY city. I will catch the scoundrel and explain to them the error of their ways, even if I have to cut off a finger or two.

**Neutral Evil**: I have wants and desires, and I'll achieve them the easiest way possible. If I see a starving child trying to steal food, and I'm hungry, I'll let the child steal, then take the food from the child to eat myself.

**Chaotic Evil**: All things shall burn. I see a starving child trying to steal food. I slit the shopkeeper's throat and spill his coin across the street. I grab the child and force-feed them what they stole over and over and over again and laugh when they get plump. Some might ask me why I do these things. And the truth is, because I can. ",1501546130

"mvci","t5_3httl","In regards to DLC, the issue is based on the base roster, pricing and timing.

Let's speak strictly about the pricing and timing to avoid any character bias or desires.

You mention ""buy updated game separately bullshit"". If we're talking about UMVC3, the base price for that game was $40 and it added 12 additional characters to the roster (not counting Shuma and Jill at $5 a pop). If you bought MVC3 on release and then UMVC, you got 12 DLC characters for $40 (which should have been $60 at the same $5 rate). This was 9 months after MVC3 was released, due to licensing issues and mother nature shaking up plans (the 2011 tsunami). If you purchased both, that's a total of $100 in 9 months, or $110 if we're including Shuma and Jill. 48 characters total with major re-balancing and a visual overhaul.

With MVCI, We will be paying $30 for 6 additional characters in the first season pass, which has been stated will all be released in 2017. The game comes out in September, that means in 3 months you will have paid 50% of the cost of the game for 6 characters, or a total of $90. (and it still won't be the full game as we'll get a season 2 more than likely).

That ""updated game bullshit"" was actually a better deal than what we're getting right now.  

Regardless, I'm happy you and others are excited for the game, by all means I'm excited for the gameplay as well, but we can't turn a blind eye at the bad deal we're getting. ",1501546131

I feel that some conservatives appeal to straw man arguments and make some other logical errors. For example, the fact that ABC reported that a study said something that was incorrect isn't really a logical connector... that this study is incorrect.
The reason people are freaking out is that the people in power in the US do not believe in something (or are afraid to say that they believe in something) that believed to be true by 90-100% of experts in this regard.
These experts include the US Military, whom you as a conservative would likely trust as a reliable source. In fact, the US Military Leadership views global warming as a major strategic threat:

"Amd","t5_2rw0n","Yep, I agree with that.  I do think that we already have some examples of what FP16 can offer if we look at the newly released Nintendo Switch and performance in games like Zelda and Mario Kart 8.  These games respectively run at 720p30 vs 900p30 and 720p60 vs 1080p60 between Wii U and Switch.  I think there's a very definite disparity in performance scaling between the two where one benefits more from FP16 than the other.  MK8 is graphically simpler than Zelda and should therefore scale more easily to 1080p as it seems to do. 

Contrast this with Lego City Undercover where both Wii U and Xbox One look better than the Switch port despite running at a lower resolution.  I don't assume that shader demotion is the only reason for that but it does seem to be part of the reason. ",1501546133

"Harvard","t5_2qkkm","I did have a good discussion with the head of Harvard Housing about this in fact, because I was curious why housing wasn't available. Here's their take on it:

Housing is way short in supply and it has been getting shorter. Students in HES, unlike those in other schools, don't commit in advance to enrolling full time for a full housing cycle, ie, if an HES student takes classes in the fall and then a work situation comes up in the spring - whoops - it's harder to re-let the unit because the other full time residential students almost certainly leased a place for the full year elsewhere.

It's easier to just go with providing housing to the full time students who are in a residentially focus degree program, so Harvard Housing isn't left holding the bag.

For all those sensitive folks who fear the Harvard University Housing people are picking on HES students unfairly (because they don't like them or whatever), take heart: the person made it a point to say that their policy doesn't have anything to do with what they ""think of"" HES students: It's just economics.",1501546134

I don't think so, but I think you could make an argument that the wars that sprung from the breakup of Yugoslavia (the Bosnian Wars in particular) were actually closer to civil wars, than wars of aggression.  (There's a long debate over this very question with regard to the origin of the Bosnian War.)  

I suppose it depends on your point of view.  If you're one of the countries trying to break away, it's a war of aggression.  If you're Serbian, you would see it as an internal conflict to maintain your territorial integrity.  Just as another example, the Syrian Civil War has so many proxy powers involved that it feels like it's become a larger regional conflict.  But I don't believe any nation has formerly declared itself at war with another sovereign nation over Syria.  One could see the Korean War as essentially a civil war that never got resolved.

That number would be used to determine how much of the bill the government would pay her insurance provider. The government is saying you were entitled to receive zero. However when your wife filled out the information to get the insurance, she was entitled to get 9k in subsidies. 

Now the explanation seems to indicate that you didn't file an 8962. So you need to call the IRS tomorrow and make sure that is the case. If you did not file an 8962 then you will have to file that form. 

EDIT: You should have gotten a form 1095a that would have allowed you to reconcile these amounts. If you didnt get the 1095a I'm not sure how you filed out the 8962

Depending on how much work you do after shooting, both filters might provide you with extra options in that avenue regardless, and I think they can be relatively cheap - having just been to a fair during the day I was looking at picking some up actually.  Then again I also like shooting with a flat profile or log when I can - I'm from a computer background rather than camera and I like tweaking all the knobs and dials afterwards to achieve something I like.

If they suspect you of counting cards, first they'll wait and see how good you are at it despite distractions, free liquor, interruptions, etc, because counting cards incorrectly (losing count) actually makes someone lose faster than an average player.  They love players who have a system but keep making mistakes.  Those are favorites. 

But if the player persists and does well, then the casino will happily pay out their winnings and tell them never to come back again, because they've demonstrated that they'll cost the casino money again the next time.  No charges laid in either direction, because both parties are doing things (mentally counting cards, adding someone to the blacklist) that are perfectly legal and within their rights. ",1501546139

While I very much appreciate gifts from my wishlist, and enjoy sending pics to show you, I do not accept them as payment.

**Payment methods that are never immediate:** Giftrocket (can take a few days to fully clear), Mailed cash or agreed upon gift cards for those who plan well in advance. (I am not responsible for carrier issues. This method has the longest delay, because in addition to transit time, am unable to check my box often.)
