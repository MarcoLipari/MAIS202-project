Offsprings like my favorite band ever, but I havent hit too much on social distortion. Rise Against hits *the best* riot carols though. I still think ""Prayer of the Refugee"" is the official theme song of the WoW horde circa 2009.

I assume this part is serious and... yeah that's kind of always true. We get the luxury of having the highest tech cause its all we fund but... well, what's the old douglas adams quote?

To summarize: it is a well-known fact that those people who must want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do the job.
To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a problem.
And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in power that they very rarely notice that they‚Äôre not. And somewhere in the shadows behind them‚Äîwho? Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed to?‚Äù",1680307200.0

There definitely isn‚Äôt a single panacea that will fill the flexibility gap at a system level. 

The reason why I say DSR has a bigger role to play is because electrification is going to put enormous peak load pressure on the grid. Simultaneously, we have a proliferation of DER (like those you mention above) that can be dispatched with some degree of flexibility. Lastly, this is comparatively untapped vs supply side measures. 

Where I think DSR gets interesting for multi day is V2G, BESS, embedded longer duration storage, thermal storage etc. however, more importantly, simply incentivising consumers to use less energy when renewable availability is low",1680307200.0

I didn't scan the batch and immediately flagged down the warehouse worker. Told him there was no way that this was going to fit in my car. He resisted but I told him that I was okay with getting another cart but I wasn't going to take this one. He said that he has no control over it and I called him on it (I've done this enough times to know who controls what). So he went back into the warehouse and pulls out another cart.

He goes on to explain that he can't just exchange carts because I don't like the one I was assigned. To which I responded that it wasn't that I didn't like it. Just that I couldn't fit everything in my car. He ended up giving me a 3 hour cart that I finished in 2.5.",1680307200.0

"poker","t5_2qhix","The context/timeline is important.

I was a member of the HCL Scandal Discord group back in October/November of last year. In November I made a couple of posts to r/poker re: potential evidence of Nick Vertucci cheating (‚Äúevidence‚Äù that I believed to be valid at the time, but which I now think is flawed).

SnowMonkey put up his ‚Äúbounty‚Äù post (offering some amount of money to anyone who could reveal the identities of the majority of the 11 Discord group members at that time) shortly after I put up my Reddit posts on behalf of the group. Now, AT THE TIME my reaction to his ‚Äúbounty‚Äù post was not initially positive. Of course not. BUT I also did not jump to conclusions re: his motives for that post.

And soon after that, events transpired within the Discord group that led ME to question the motives of other group members. In fact, I left the Discord group within the next week.

Since then, I‚Äôve become privy to more and more information. And I‚Äôve grown to realize that SnowMonkey ‚Äî having been privy to inside information all along ‚Äî had good reasons for questioning the motives of certain group members. (I don‚Äôt think his ‚Äúbounty‚Äù post was made in bad faith, in other words.)

And these changes, over time, have allowed SnowMonkey and I to develop a good relationship. I now recognize that his motives were pure, and he also recognizes that mine were pure ‚Äî and that I‚Äôve tried to take steps to walk back the damage that I did.

This is the context for why I felt compelled to warn SnowMonkey when I saw his post about the other user (the one who had tried to have him banned).",1680307202.0

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Deus Ex falls in line with the Immersive Sim genre, going further than what usual Action RPG's do with it's interactable systems, much like System Shock or newer games like Dishonored and Prey (2017).

Besides that the term gets used way too often, you could argue that almost any game that has some sort of leveling, quests, XP or unlockable skills is called an Action RPG nowadays, ranging from Diablo and it's successors (shortened ARPG but written out it's still an Action RPG, the term is used for these specific kind of games) over Souls-likes to almost any newer open world game that follows the Ubisoft formula, it's clearly not as defined as it used to be.

Also, I haven't seen anyone who refered to action roguelikes / roguelites as Action RPG's, although most of them could fit into that too in broad term, the procedural generation, perma death and meta progression is what seperates them and gives them a clearer definition compared to whats called Action RPG",1680307202.0

Not only does it feel like it's just there to support the family drama (the only thing holding the arc's plot together) but it makes Naruto out to be a huge hypocrite for no believable character driven reason given his own reliance on Kurama.

In the movie Naruto at least doubled checked with Hinata (asking her to check his wrist with her Byakugan) because he didn't want to believe Boruto was cheating but in the manga he just assumes Boruto was and happened to be right to humiliate him while the anime came up with a flimsy excuse that doesn't work under scrutiny: that Boruto couldn't have known Purple Lightning. The story made it a point earlier that Naruto was unaware of what Boruto was learning through his training and that Boruto himself claimed to have learned Lightning style so him knowing Purple Lightning wasn't a hard lie to believe.",1680307203.0

He was at deaths door upon diagnosis because the doctor ignored my complaints and brushed them off as ‚Äújealousy over his new brother‚Äù‚Ä¶he plays now. He laughs now. He‚Äôs so different than he was in the year I took him every 3 weeks to see a doctor because I knew something wasn‚Äôt right. Do I celebrate for me? For my fight that kept him here? For how far I‚Äôve come? Or do I celebrate for him? Because he‚Äôs alive? Because even though he hates needles he takes it like a champ even when they hurt and he has to cry? I don‚Äôt know if I should make this a significant event in his life‚Ä¶or let it just feel like it was something always in the background so he feels ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, if that‚Äôs even possible?

Make sure that you have saved your comic to your computer as a .png image via the paint program you used to create your comic. If you have already done this step, try resubmitting your comic via a different device, as mobile users seem to have their comics automatically converted to JPG-formatted images when submitting on occassion.

"deaf","t5_2qi0j","Hearing person here. It is NOT weird of you at all to feel that way. You WERE deprived access to a language that would have helped you immensely to communicate and learn. That is just not right! 

My son has bilateral Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder. He is considered severe to profoundly deaf. He was officially diagnosed at just over 5 months, and confirmed at just under 8 months old. He is now 18 months old. He was referred to a program called Georgia Pines through Babies Can't Wait (my son has some developmental delays due to being 7 weeks premature, and some issued that started at, or within a day of, his birth). Georgia Pines help families with children with hearing and/or vision loss. I applied for their deaf mentor program, and we were accepted! We've had a deaf mentor for about 9 months now. We (my mom is learning ASL with me) still have a LOT to learn, but also have already learned so much from our mentor! 

My son had his cochlear implant surgery on March 3rd, and they will be activated on April 14th! Our mentor was a little concerned that I would stop learning ASL, and would stop my son from learning, if his implants are a success (they don't always work, even for kids who are a ""good candidate"" like my son). I assured her we would NOT stop! Why? Because, whether the CIs are successful or not, my son will always be deaf. Yes, I want him to be able speak and understand verbal language, but I also want him to learn ASL. I want him to have the best of both worlds, so to speak. Besides, he may decide later in life that he doesn't like the CIs, or just doesn't want to use them. IF that happens, he will already know ASL, so he will already have a language to communicate with. He may want to be verbal only, use ASL only, or do both. I will respect whatever choice he makes when he's older.

I got his implants done not as a denial of his hearing loss, or attempt to ""fix"" his deafness, but to give him access to sound. From what I understand, while they absolutely can help people who are implanted later in life (after age 3), they have the greatest chance of being successful when implanted at a younger age (under 3). I don't want him to feel like he was deprived of either, access to sound, OR language via ASL.

I wish you the best of luck if you choose to peruse learning ASL! It, like pretty much any language, is SO hard to learn with all of the differences between ASL and English (grammar, etc.), but it is a beautiful language and VERY worth the effort to learn!

Even with a deaf mentor, I still watch ASL videos and use ASL websites to help with signs I forget or haven't learned yet. Some of the ones I really like are,

[https://www.handspeak.com/](https://www.handspeak.com/)

[https://www.signingsavvy.com/](https://www.signingsavvy.com/) This site has videos for each sign, and also usually has any variations of the word/sign as well.

[https://babysignlanguage.com/](https://babysignlanguage.com/) (they have a little cartoonish drawing with an explanation of each sign, as well as a video clip with someone doing, and explaining the sign). This site says: ""BabySignLanguage.com is a project for parents teaching infants and toddlers early communication skills. We believe that early communication sets the foundation for accelerated learning, reduced frustration, and a closer relationship between parent and child.""

[https://www.youtube.com/@LearnHowtoSign](https://www.youtube.com/@LearnHowtoSign) LOADS of ASL videos broken down by professions, ""essentials"", conversational signs, and so much more! These are done by a hearing person who is an ASL teacher and interpreter.

"projectzomboid","t5_2sdk8","This game has quite a learning curve. It sounds to me like you're having trouble with the combat system, which will come with practice.  You need to learn to time your swings (not that hard eventually, as zombies are slow), and how to avoid being flanked or overwhelmed.

Here's a few random tips for beginners to help you survive a week or so:

-  Your normal walking speed is superior to zombies.  Do not use the sprint key unless you find yourself being flanked, and use it sparingly.  Your character does not have a lot of stamina.  If there's a lot of zombies, just calmly walk away

-  Every weapon has a different hitbox and swing speed.  Learn em.   On that note, be aware that stomping zombies when they're down kills them very well, but does not gain weapon skill.  It does save durability on the weapon, so I often do that early on instead of hitting them

-  When going indoors, either 'flash' doors by quickly tapping E twice to see what's in there, or open it and then immediately shove to avoid being attacked by a silent zombie within

-  If you're being chased by a lot, here's what ya do: walk calmly to a building.  Enter the building, break their line of sight, and use the sprint key to go to the other side of it.  Enter out of a window or door, and then proceed in a direction that further breaks the line of sight to that building - trees or another building. Half of the zombies will just bang on the outside of the house, and some will get lost inside, and the few that actually come out the other side won't see you when they finally get there.  If it's trees, just walk - dont run - through them

- As you said, guns are a death trap. Only use them sparingly.  At first, I recommend only using them after you get a car, just to practice.  That way, once you kill a few and the horde comes, you can just drive away

-  Your priority of things to find is as follows: a decent weapon (crowbar, bat, cleaver, etc), then bags (fanny packs, backpacks), then medicine and other survival supplies, then a functioning car and/or a base

As for a car, just be patient.  Keys are often found near the car, and often on a ground or a zombie's corpse near the car. Keep your eyes peeled for keys on the ground - they'll look like a pebble or bit of trash.  Check the ground's inventory screen when near it

Also, I highly suggest you create a custom world with infections turned off and zombie durability and numbers turned down.  It'll be easier and allow you some amount of mastery, then you can kick it back to default for another run.",1680307206.0

"MXTX","t5_23s9yr","I tend to lean GC transfer, but it's practically 50/50. My reasoning: 

a. for XL, he's immortal and invulnerable. For WWX he knew he was irreversibly hurting himself and signing away his life: he could never continue being JC's second in command, and most of his life revolved around cultivation. I'm counting not just 3 days of torment but the rest of his short and painful life being essentially crippled and ostracized.

b. Being stabbed into ""goo"" I would assume no longer hurts because there's not enough body left to transmit that pain, so at some points I have to assume XL no longer felt it until he healed. Meanwhile WWX was described to be actively in agony that entire time and he had to be in pretty good (but extremely painful) condition for the entire operation.

c. XL's torment was overnight, WWX's was 3 days.

d. IMO the psychological torment is worse because WWX didn't know if he and/or JC would survive, if it would even work. For myself if I'm lying about doing major surgery for my brother one huge aspect of it would be terror at the idea that he might die, and I'll be the one to have killed him, without strictly speaking asking for his consent. And of course if WWX died JC would wake up to a ???? situation too. And it was entirely possible the transfer wouldn't work and WWX would have to explain to JC that he mutilated himself for nothing and they were both fucked.

e. WWX had no one to blame but himself, and I guess JC. XL could say that BWX forced that situation, or the people forced him to do it, etc. Both those are kind of straight forward to me: he was violated by bad people. But for WWX he didn't allow himself to be angry because he arranged everything, and it was something he felt that he owed the Jiangs. idk I just always had the impression WWX had a lot of complex regret / blame / anger, even after he resurrected and had a GC again. It wasn't a sacrifice he wanted to make, it was a debt that weighed on him to repay (and it's extremely fucked up that he felt he owed someone else his own internal organs), and he resented that, but couldn't admit that he resented it, because it was ultimately completely his own choice and decision. At least that was my impression.

XL to me came to terms with what happened much better than WWX did, mentally.",1680307206.0

"MadeMeSmile","t5_2uqcm","I mean, username checks out, but that explanation doesn't make much sense. The only way to be locked into an early decision is to apply for early decision, an admissions program in which you make a commitment to go to that particular school if they evaluate you early and accept you (you *maybe* still can still be considered during regular admissions, but they've pretty much decided not to admit you). You shouldn't apply to multiple schools as early decision, but if you did, you would withdraw your other early applications after getting your first early admissions offer.

Way in the past, if ivies were competing against each other time wise (I'm not convinced they were), they may have offered a better financial aid package to the shining stars among the earlier admits, so getting that deal would influence your decision. In general, besides early admission, you have a standard period to accept or decline. In my day, it used to be about a month. So there is no real benefit to ivies ""competing"" to be first, though there might have been financial aid benefit to the student in receiving admissions offers in the first round vs the wait list round.",1680307208.0

"thelastofus","t5_2t7gp","Well, sounds like you discovered the biggest tip for Grounded which is to bathe in the warm embrace of your loving God, the brick. I don't know what exactly you've figured out about bricks, but here a few extremely useful abilities they have that are invaluable on Grounded:

* Throwing them at enemies will stun them and open them up for a 1 hit melee kill/2 punch kill (the punch kill doesn't work on Clickers unless they are already extremely close to death and the punch is the last bit of damage they need). A bottle can also do this
* If you try and melee with a brick equipped while standing still or moving at a walking speed (running speed does a different, less effective attack), you'll do a 3 hit melee attack which will kill any enemy except for Bloaters. This is extremely useful for Clickers, who are otherwise a bit of a resource drain when it comes to killing them since you can't fall back on just punching them to death. 
* Adding on to the above point, the brick only breaks on the 3rd hit. So if you're really slick, you can do the first 2 hits of the combo, quick switch to something else and finish them with a melee weapon hit/punch, and then take the brick out again and either repeat, or 3 hit kill another enemy. All of this only works with a brick; a bottle will just shatter on the first hit and stun the enemy.

Beyond that, here are some other tips:

* Stealth should be your default mode of existence. If you blow your stealth, try to run and re-establish stealth.
* If you're best is to directly fight, enemies are ultra accurate and more prone to getting critical hits on you if you're running directly at them, and take an accuracy hit if your running away. So, never run head on to an alerted human enemy. Either stun them first and then run at them, or run away and create some distance first.
* You might have noticed that revolvers and rifles are one hit kill on unarmored enemies on Grounded. But armored enemies don't have armor of their legs. So, you can get around the armor blocking one hit kills by shooting these enemies in the leg. All of that is also true of the bow so long as the enemy is not alerted.
* The contents of shiv door enemies are far more valuable than getting a stealth kill with a shiv. So, save all your shivs for the doors, and don't waste them on stealthing enemies. You don't get enough of them to be able to waste them like that. And along those lines, don't bother with the Shiv Master ability. Use the pills for weapon sway reduction, and additional health (and then whichever other skills you deem most important after those). If a Clicker grabs you, just take the L.
* This one is a bit of a spoiler, so if you don't want any spoilers, come back to this one once you get to Winter. >!When you play as Ellie, her knife kill is not stealthy, despite the fact that it's on the same button as Joel's stealth kills. You're best bet with Ellie is to actually just run past everybody. You don't need to kill any human enemies in her section if you maintain stealth (well, except for one as part of a boss battle).!<
* Specifically for the Hotel Basement section you're in, grab the keycard and check the exit door before you start the generator (Joel needs to check that it's locked before the game will let you use the keycard). This will spawn in a few enemies that you'll have to take care of, but it'll clear the way for you to just run straight for the door and ignore the Bloater and other enemies that spawn in, making the section just a bit easier.
* Most of the time there is a passage of time in the story, you'll get a free heal. Since this is your first playthrough, unless you reference a guide, you're not going to know where these time jumps are. So, and unless you absolutely need to use a health kit to finish the section your on, save it. You might be near a free heal.
* When you get the flamethrower, if you're going to use it, save it for infected enemies. It's far more effective on them than on humans. And along those lines, molotovs are better on infected than bombs. So, while your resources will dictate this more than anything else, if you have a choice between a bomb and a molotov in a situation, I use bombs on humans and molotovs on infected.

Hopefully some of these tips help. Good luck!",1680307209.0

IF you can invest the truer difference in costs between renting vs buying (Eg mortgage, property taxes, realator/lawyer commissions, repairs) you will often be better of renting vs buying BUT there is a risk of more instability with needing to move, never having full control over your living space, etc.  Being able to move to chase highest salaries every 18-24 months especially in your first 10 years of working life can make a HUGE difference in your lifetime earnings.

President Cleveland refused to allow the annexation and supported the native Hawaiian Monarchy.

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","It's the same as it is now, except each spell gets prepared individually. 

Currently: If you prepare fireball, you can use any level of spell slot (3rd level or above) to cast fireball, as many times as you have spell slots. If you decide, on a whim, say, around noon, that you don't want to cast anything except fireball for the rest of the day, you can do that. 

Vancian: You prepare fireball. You have *one casting* of fireball prepared, and you can only cast it at the spell level you prepared it for. If you think you might want to cast fireball at 5th level today, you need to specifically prepare one 5th-level fireball spell after your last long rest. You cannot use that spell slot for anything else, and once you cast that 5th level fireball, it's gone. You cannot cast anymore fireballs today. 

If you think you might need more than one fireball today, you need to prepare the fireball spell more than once. You assign each fireball to a specific spell slot and/or spell level. So if you wanted to be able to cast fireball twice at 3rd level, once at 4th level, and once at 5th level, you have to spend 5 of your ""prepared spells"" on 5 different fireballs. 

This makes it so sorcerers and wizards are *vastly* different, instead of being just a little different. Sorcerers functioned more like wizards do in 5e, where if they know fireball, they can just cast fireball at whatever spell level they want when they know they need it. Wizards had to plan ahead. You had to either spread out your spells so you'd have at least one for any possible occasion, or you'd have to focus in hard on the spells you knew you were going to need for a specific encounter. The tradeoff was that wizards knew *a shitload of spells* that they could prepare (I seem to recall that the game just gave you a shitload of spells, as opposed to how 5e gives you only a couple more spells and you have beg your DM to give you opportunities to find more), but sorcerers had a very limited selection of spells. 

A prepared wizard was impossible to beat, but an unprepared wizard or an ill-prepared wizard was little better than luggage. This also resulted in wizards being carried through a whole dungeon so they could unload all their specially prepared spells on the boss at the end, like hauling a cannon with limited ammo around behind your party.",1680307212.0

"Columbus","t5_2r373","The receptacle itself should be secured‚Äîie, a sturdy bin with a lock or stored in a room with a door that locks. Wherever I‚Äôve worked (offices that deal with PHI, PII, etc.) the individual employee with a bin at their desk is responsible for emptying it into a larger receptacle (usually a locked rolling bin with a slot), clearing their desks and locking their drawers at the end of their workday. The office itself is secure (employees have to have badge access to the floor). There is either a service like Iron Mountain to take away the paper to be shredded in a truck on-site or there is an industrial shredder on-site. I have not found medical offices to be nearly as careful. I was once a supervisor for release of information staff at a large medical center and was constantly butting heads with the office staff of individual physicians‚Äîlike the one who left an envelope of medical records with a volunteer greeter in the lobby who just handed it off to whoever asked for it, but when they came to get their hospital records, they had to complete a ROI form and show picture ID to pick it up. I got a phone call chewing me out for making it difficult for the patient. I had to school this ‚Äúoffice manager‚Äù in STATE LAW and HIPAA. The HITECH Act was passed in 2009 to promote adoption and meaningful use of health information technology. Assuming it took about 5 years for most medical offices to adopt some kind of EHR/EMR technology, the 10-year record retention statute per Ohio Revised Code is expiring, meaning that lots of offices are purging their old paper records about now. There‚Äôs only so much bandwidth in the system for destroying this stuff and storage space is expensive. I‚Äôm afraid this sort of thing is going to happen more and more as offices hire fly-by-night services to handle record destruction. They pocket the fees and then dump the stuff in municipal public recycle bins and hope they don‚Äôt get caught.",1680307212.0

I think the conflating of trans and grooming comes from the attention that children are getting from the trans community, and many have the opinion that young children shouldn't be taught sexualities and/or that the parents should be able to choose when to have those talks.

I think what I was trying to say was, if there's no difference between you and any other woman, then why the hate? If the only reason why you're getting hate is because you declare that you're trans, is it worth endangering yourself and your child?

How would the general public (you said there's some that don't want you in public) even know that you're trans?

I ask these, because it came up in another discussion on here about bathrooms, and I came around on the point that, if a trans woman is indistinguishable from a biological woman, then who would even know to care which bathroom you're using?

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","No, that option was not present at the time OP spoke to his son. It was only half an hour later that the school contacted OP and the other child's mother offer to give the little girl a ride.

So OP's son could have easily spoken to his GF about it, pick up the sister (which OP explained is NOT an usual situation) and drop her at home, and then resume the celebration date, *with the  added bonus of gaining massive brownie points with OP*.

And let me tell you, if I were the GF and he had brought up the situation, I would have supported a 1/2 h interruption and thought he was a *really* nice guy to care for his little sis. And probably it would have added brownie points from me too.",1680307214.0

"visas","t5_32edu","Have another look at the regulations quoted above:

> An alien admitted to the United States under this part may be readmitted to the United States after a departure to foreign contiguous territory or adjacent island *for the balance of his or her original Visa Waiver Program admission period* if he or she is otherwise admissible ...

https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-8/chapter-I/subchapter-B/part-217#p-217.3(b)

&nbsp;

If there is no balance of an original VWP admission period remaining -- because it's been more than 90 days since the person was originally admitted into the US under VWP -- then the officer has no ability to readmit the person for such a non-existent balance.

At that point, the officer must make the decision whether to grant the person a new 90 day VWP admission period. As mentioned, the officer's discretion plays a role.

&nbsp;

As you can see, that means that knowing when she first arrived in the US and began a VWP admission period can be important.",1680307214.0

The mezzo said that she carries a case of remedies with her, takes her multivitamins and minerals, and was prepared for any and all health contingencies.

The other three looked at her. The soprano said, very politely, ""I used to be like you. Then I had kids.""

The men agreed. The tenor said that his small children brought home minor illnesses from school all the time.

The bass said ""The bugs have had billions of years to adapt and evolve. They have been here far longer than we have. They WILL get you, you CANNOT get away from them, and the best thing is to accept that.""

The mezzo looked at the bass and said, ""But, you're Russian. My boyfriend's Russian and he talks like that all the time!""

Russian or not, the majority consensus of the singers was that the bugs WILL get you, and you just have to do your best to be careful and do what you can to get well when you get sick.",1680307214.0

Me daba una verg√ºenza atroz hablarle y le hable a una amiga suya que ten√≠amos en com√∫n, me acerque un par de veces para hablarle de nuestro grado (√≠bamos al superior de Inform√°tica) de eso pas√≥ que √≠bamos en cercan√≠as desde nuestro barrio y result√≥ que jugaba al WoW y bueno, desde el juego habl√°bamos m√°s y por TeamSpeak se hac√≠a m√°s sencillo hasta que empezamos a quedar.

Obviamente te recomiendo que en tu caso t√∫ inter√©s primario sea conocerla como persona y entablar una amistad que hoy en d√≠a es algo muy dif√≠cil.",1680307215.0

At first I had assumed that The Dolphins were a rebranding/continuation of the Redcliffe Dolphins, like the New Zealand Warriors compared to Auckland Warriors, Sydney Roosters compared to Easts Roosters etc - but I just saw that the 2 x Dolphins clubs have their own CEOs, so are they actually two entirely separate legal entities? Are they two entities under some larger conglomerate? Is it just an informal relationship and people just ‚Äúpretend‚Äù it‚Äôs the same club for the nostalgia factor?

I saw recently that one rationale for why The Dolphins had to drop the Redcliffe part from their name was that QLD Cup rules are that they can‚Äôt have the same name as a NRL side - but if that is the reason for the name change surely you‚Äôd promote Redcliffe to the NRL and they create a new club/name for the QLD Cup feeder side.",1680307215.0

Ruler is exclusively an extender while you're comparing it to two boss monsters. You don't summon Ruler to end on Ruler unless you got interrupted or ran out of gas, because it doesn't do anything on field. Its entire value comes from its effect the moment it hits the field and then the moment it hits the GY.

The problem with Ruler has absolutely nothing to do with its presence on board. Mirrorjade and Baronne are boss monsters, their purpose is to create difficult scenarios for your opponent to break. Ruler is an extender, its purpose is to provide fuel for you to create the cards that create those scenarios.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes, but I want to point out that it's not always COs, because there's a ton of ancillary staff inside of any prison.

Most prisons have a medical department with nurses of varying levels & a transcriptionist. Some prisons have dental staff. Some have educational staff (teachers, trades/vocational instructors). A lot of prisons have a psych/social services department. Every single prison in my state has an administrative staff (accountants, HR, IT, mail room, record-keeping).

In 17 years of working in the system (10 as a CO, 7 as Social Services) I saw a lot more of the ancillary staff get walked out for bringing in contraband than I did the officers.

Most of the officers I saw get walked out were for sex with the inmates.

\[Fun Fact\]

When dealing with the sex crimes (because fucking an inmate is considered rape by authority), if the staff were women (even thought they'd end up embarrassed on the news) they usually skated on any charges because the inmates didn't want to testify.

If the staff were men, however, the inmates knew they could get money out of the deal and would enthusiastically cooperate with prosecution.",1680307216.0

They don‚Äôt record all the episodes at once, they do them one at a time (or sometimes two at a time if there‚Äôs a Raw/Nitro/Impact after the PPV or other quickie bonus episode that they‚Äôre also reviewing separately). And it can sometimes be a few weeks before they‚Äôre all able to get together and record a single episode (and then it can take a few more weeks to possibly even a month+ to edit and post-produce just one episode).

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","I'm not sure with low carb because your body is seeking carbohydrate when hungry so you must eat only lean carbs (rice, pasta, fruit, even table sugar is lean) so you only take in 4 kcal per g of carbs. (Low everything else except the carb diet)

Chocolate for example could be over 10 kcal per gram of carbs. Crisps (potato chips), again around 10 kcal per g because of all the fat. Cake does slightly better with 8kcal per g of carbs (so long as there is no cream) but still abysmal.

So you'll eat 2 and a half times as many calories scoffing chocolate and crisps after a ride as you would eating a plate of rice (and some interesting fat free flavours) or just chugging some full sugar soda (many people say sugar is a culprit but it is actually a lot more filling than it looks although it is not nutritionally complete by any sense so don't use it as a multi meal replacement).

So your testimony supports my theory of satisfying exercise induced hunger means exercise affects the rate of weight gain or loss depending on the fat content of the diet. So you can both lose weight faster or gain weight faster with exercise.

What i am curious about is the appetite suppression of full keto diets, or whether it is the same as the appetite suppression of crack cocaine and the energy is just credit card cortisol energy.",1680307217.0

Early detection tests (first response pink line ones are best) should be accurate from about 12 days after sex with first morning pee if you're eager to test.

These days, we're at a point where disinformation (not ""questionable"" opinion, but false facts/ lies) and narratives are continuously pushed in TV: like Putin is someone you can ""absolutely not negotiate with"", Russia was ""to weak to attack UA in 2014"" & needed the time since Minsk, ... hilarious stuff like that.

Politicians appear in TV and state ""facts"" you can research as proven wrong, and their shit is left unchallenged. No war without propaganda - but this is where it gets really concerning.

People are even told a majority of them would be in support of arming UA, while to this day almost **every** poll has shown the opposite. In some newspapers' comment sections, trolls are up to ""debate"" each other, occupation rate 100%.

How do you feel when believers try to bring you back to the fold? 

If asked about religion and my lack of belief I give the most honest responses I can, but I don't proselytize because I don't appreciate believers doing it to me. Everyone is entitled to go to 'hell'in the handbasket of their choosing. 

The only time I draw a line is when they seek to force me to adhere to the tenets of their religion.

Other favorites: I had an adult sister who beat me with a broomstick until it broke, my parents later beat me for crying about it and for breaking her broomstick.

Of course the belt, a classic parental tool

If I didn't like something we were eating, I had to sit at the table until my plate was clean. Rice pilaf once had me parked at the table 6pm until 2am, trying to eat it then cold and gagging. I was like 7.

Lots of meaningless hard labor chores, if not complete, you don't eat.

Did something wrong? You're too old to be hit. Sit in this chair and get grilled and interrogated for 6 hours about it. One time, and oddly enough I can't recall what I did, the lecture was from 9-ish Saturday morning until after midnight. No food or drink allowed.

Spoke out of turn at the dinner table? Get up, walk over to dad so he can smack you full force across the mouth. If you cry you get the belt. Refuse to go get your punishment, he would bring it to you and a bonus belt session.

Silent treatment for weeks

The dichotomy of this: always yelled at by one parent for being fat and eating to much, but if I didn't clean my plate, the other parent got offended and wouldn't speak to me for days.

You both are acting like your job has more importance and more difficulty, maybe even a higher morality. Get over it, people are overpaid and underpaid all day long, every day, and that's life. If only there was a ""both parties have way too many F's to give"" rating. 

Giving credit, maybe OP simply made the comment to him in a ""You go!"" way and then his flatmate vomitted assumptions. But then you don't need give a pat on the back with that kind of statement. In fact, you really shouldn't at all. 

  
At the same time -  You made it a point to say ""working for a company answering phone calls"" almost as if it's just a simple task. Maybe that's his only duty, maybe it's not, but maybe you don't understand his job and the duties it involves either. Maybe your statement came off rather stale. Granted you can't control peoples reactions but I can see a bit of workplace moral superiority in play. I've never had to answer phones all day but I can tell you that would be the last job on Earth that I would take.  
He's also being presumptious that because you aren't tied to the phone, you don't have a difficult job. Making that assumption makes him just as bad. He didn't need to make a comment whatsoever about who's job is harder.

"polymerclay","t5_2s48h","You might look into *epoxy clay* since it will self-cure (after its two parts have been mixed together), won't shrink like air-dry clays, is quite adhesive, and will be strong/hard/durable once self-cured. 
   
It can be purchased in small quantities like GreenStuff/Kneadatite, or in larger quantities like Apoxie Sculpt--which also comes in a few mixable colors if you don't want to just paint its surface after hardening (and can also be colored by mixing in artists oil paints, I think).  
https://www.google.com/images?q=green+stuff+kneadatite+for+repairs  
https://www.google.com/images?q=Apoxie+Sculpt

&#x200B;

 

If you want to use polymer clay, the patch could be formed in place then (carefully) removed, and heated to cure (supporting it to keep the shape, if necessary), then glued back in place. 
   
Or you could cure the patch in place using a heat gun (supported well, so it won't move for the whole period of curing, and using a thermometer so you can tell the how far away will give you an accurate and constant 275 F), although more fiddly.

Hello /u/acousticadventurer,

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1284kyf/26m_idk_if_i_should_continue_my_relationship_with/) was removed for the following reason(s):

**Your title did not include at least two ages/genders or was not formatted correctly**

Posts must: 

1. include details about the involved parties including ages, genders, and length of relationship, and

2. request advice in real situations involving two or more people

The ages and genders can go anywhere in your title, but have to be in one of the following formats:

`44M` `35 F` `23-NB` or `M44` `F 35` `NB-23`

The automod rule can process the genders M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, and MTF but more can be added.

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

"196","t5_2v92f","There is some research to suggest that the act of throwing is hardcoded into our DNA. For instance, think about how everyone has a sort of instinctual sense for what makes an object good for throwing. You can pick up a rock and discern, based on its weight, approximately how far you could throw it. You can pick up a stick and immediately find the optimal spot in which to hold it to maximize throwing effectiveness. No one taught you this. No one sat you down and said 'Now Jimmy, let your old man show you how to analyze weight distribution'. Your brain just *does it*. Like breathing

The intricacies of technique for throwing are a different story, but pretty much everyone comes hard coded with the ability to pick a good throwing tool in the first place",1680307221.0

"Egypt","t5_2ql2m","""I agree that modern Egyptians do share a significant amount of DNA with their ancestors, including ancient Egyptians. However, it's important to note that the physical appearance of modern Egyptians is also influenced by a variety of other factors beyond genetics.

As I mentioned earlier, Egypt has been a crossroads of different cultures for thousands of years, and the population has been influenced by many different peoples and cultures, including the Greeks, Persians, Turks, Fatimids, Mamluks, French, and British. This has led to a mixing of genes and a wide range of physical appearances.

In addition, intermarriage and interbreeding between different populations have also contributed to the diversity of physical appearance seen in modern Egyptians. This has led to a wide range of facial features, skin tones, and other physical characteristics.

Overall, while modern Egyptians do share a significant amount of DNA with their ancestors, the many other factors that have contributed to their genetic makeup have also led to a wide range of physical appearances. The genetic diversity of Egyptians is the result of a complex mixture of historical migrations, conquests, and interbreeding between different groups over time.""",1680307221.0

#Your post has been removed because it is considered too short.

In an effort make submissions more successful, we are asking for post that are more compelling for people to relate to. This action is taken only when the total body of your post is less than 256 characters, including the url. We suggest the following:

- Your post be approximately 400 or so characters, and no more than 800 to avoid being a wall of text.

- Use the available formatting to improve readability.

- Include details that will help build credibility. For example, if you're looking for tuition assistance, include a picture of your school ID (redacted to protect your identity, of course). If it's for a pet, include a picture of your pet plus a handwritten note with your username. If it's to replace a home lost in a fire, a before and after photo of the property. Adding a handwritten note in the photo with your Reddit name helps even more.

- If you're funding a volunteer trip, include the pertinent skills that you have that would be of use there. Such things as specialized medical skills, or local language knowledge, or relevant certifications.

##Posts that only say to the effect of ""all the details are on the GoFundMe page"" WILL BE REMOVED.

"dndmemes","t5_35g8o","At lvl 5:

>Max of 5 fireballs and 1 extra small spell, or 4 fireballs and several extras, or 3 fireballs and a lot of extras. This seems stronger than spell slots here. 

>With 2 Fireballs, the maximum that spell slots would allow, you'd have 17 points left, allowing you to use 4 1st level spells and 3 2nd level spells... so you gain flexibility, and lose nothing.

At lvl 11:

>Both sides get 1 6th level spell. 

>Counting from the top, the spell points sorcerer would ""lose"" 2 1st level spell slots. In this case, there is a minor trade-off for the flexibility. That said, in combat you're unlikely to use 1st level spell slots, as damage cantrips scale. Gaining the ability to use more up-scaled or 5th level spells is much stronger in combat. This is still a buff unless you somehow use 4 1st-level spell slots per day while your cantrips are as strong as them in combat. 

I was about to do the same thing for lvl 17 because that's the next power spike, but then I saw that 6th level spell slots and above are still just 1 slot. Doing this for lvl 19 and 20 might be relevant for someone playing at those levels, but I've never seen a caster get to lvl 16+. For the duration of my average campaign, spell slots are exclusively a buff.

I'd argue that using this system should have fewer points. It's not ""more complex"", it's just a straight-up buff.",1680307223.0

So hopefully, the cramps will lessen as the days go on.  I take Advil or Aleve when I have bad cramps, and it sometimes can take a hour or two to get relief, but Aleve tends to work better and the relief lasts longer for me.

Here is a breathing technique that helps calm down my body a little when I have cramp pain.  Try to recline with your feet up and relax your muscles as much as possible. Take a deep breath through your nose.  Imagine the breath going down through your nose, down your throat and all the way to the bottom of your stomach, then exhale through your mouth and imagine grey clouds of pain leaving your body like breathing out dragon-smoke as you exhale. Repeat and imagine the breath going down to your belly and exhale through your mouth.  Keep doing this at least for 10 breaths.  However, if this doesn't work for you, there's no reason to worry, dear.  It's just one way to calm down your body and there are a lot of different ways to approach this problem of cramp pain.  Warm baths work for my friends and also eating healthy (no sodas) can help decrease cramp pain.

Its usually bad game design to put in bad feeling gameplay loops, as it's a real quick way to drop potential players. Just having ""another way to play the game"" doesn't matter if it's a shit other way. Example: Torghast in WoW.",1680307226.0

"abusiverelationships","t5_2ua08","A few things I‚Äôve learned.  

- we focus a lot on red flags and the other persons actions and behaviors. Still important, but I think a ‚Äúred flag‚Äù I overlooked more than anything was how *_I_* felt and my own body responded.  Increased anxiety, obsessive thoughts of being sure to please him, physical symptoms such loss/increase appetite, bowel issues, headaches, aches and pains, cardiac issues/symptoms. Cognitive changes as well such as confusion, inability to make decisions, forgetfulness, I am ND and my symptoms do worsen when I don‚Äôt feel safe with people. 

- I think it‚Äôs a red flag if someone actively pursues you when you‚Äôre in a vulnerable state/place in life.  This can come into play in the pattern of abusive relationships. If you‚Äôre still mourning and healing from abuse, be cautious of someone who actively pursues you.  *This person saw you at a low point and WANTED that‚Ä¶.* I don‚Äôt think this is a hard rule but be cautious. Ideally, we should happy, healthy and whole people fulfilled in ourselves and our lives.  Our partners should want that in us too.  I personally think if someone genuinely cared, they would be concerned of possibly taking advantage of someone at a low point and would love and support that person without crossing boundaries that could potentially jeopardize that persons healing. 

- someone said above boundaries.  Absolutely 100% this. I never felt like I could set, never mind hold, boundaries for myself.  I have severe RSD and the possibility of being rejected because I set a boundary is terribly difficult to face. As a result I‚Äôd end up being quiet because I‚Äôd rather silently believe the person respected me than to voice a concern only to hear them prove that they don‚Äôt respect me. 

- someone that encourages you to be vulnerable (or unmask for ND people) with them.  Why is this a red flag? Keeping our vulnerabilities protected (or masking) is a response done when there is a need for safety.  We do these things because we feel the need to maintain our own safety.  No one should TELL you to be vulnerable with them.  If they are genuinely safe people, you should be able to allow this to happen organically. They shouldn‚Äôt tell you to be vulnerable, they should be the TYPE of person who is safe to be vulnerable with.",1680307226.0

"oddlyterrifying","t5_2yo6b","They do have cycleways around here.

Trouble with people is they're idiots who think they're the main character, and they gather together on weekends in large groups with their bikes, dressed in skin tight lycra, and ride three or four abreast on highways and near industrial areas.

Then go crying to the gubmint when one of them inevitably gets smooshed under a 40t truck.

Shits me to no end when there are literally hundreds of kilometres of dedicated cycleways that the cyclists are simply bored of and don't bother using, and then think that they'll be safe on roads built for heavy transit.

Then government folds and builds more cycleways that these asshats still won't use because they're free to ride wherever they like.

Point is you can build whatever they ask for and they'll still not use it and put themselves at risk and traumatize more motorists. Nobody wants to go to work and run somebody over but cyclists really need a reality check when it comes to road safety. If truckers need continual training then cyclists should need to attend so they know exactly how a truck should react.",1680307226.0

"Tennessee","t5_2qy2y","Well, you are making a false argument. Mixing sex with identity.

Point is, drag does not equate to a sexual thing. It CAN be, but anything can be turned into a sexual topic. So no you are not challenging my point, you are mixing sex with drag, intentionally or not.

Does not matter. A drag person by itself is not a stripper. Your mind is doing that.  I've seen plenty of drag shows on tv (my wife is into it), a lot are about dancing, some about fashion. You know hip hop has people grinding at school, where kids copy that. At my highschool plenty of kids were grinding up in the dance hall.....

You want to ban hip hop too? Plenty of sexual and graphic topics on that.

True, stripping may be subjective (not to a school though, don't fool yourself).

You sound incredibly old, but I doubt you are old. You would have been that person in the 80's wanting to ban hip hop too.

Again, drag by itself...is not sexual. You are doing that.

Thanks.",1680307227.0

Admittedly, the whole situation relies on a lot of unsaid implications, but I do think that Schweppes was being genuine when he wanted to make sure that his men got out of there alive, as long as at least one of them lived. He very easily could've played dead and left Mellowlink to die so he could get away safely, but in the end his conscious wouldn't allow it.

"bodyweightfitness","t5_2tf0a","Hi there!
Unfortunately, your post has been removed automatically as it's been caught by our post filter, but it's nothing personal!
Our subreddit operates under a system where we only allow self-posts to the main sub feed for sufficiently detailed, discussion-oriented topics. As you can imagine, we get many users posting about a lot of the exact same achievements and personal anecdotes, asking a lot of the same relatively simple questions and other non-discussion-oriented topics, which gets highly repetitive and makes the main feed uninteresting for users to read, and a pain for mods to moderate.
If this is what your post was, there is a better place in our community for these kinds of things! You can come to the subreddit's [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/bwf) for live discussion with our users! You can also post to the subreddit's [Daily Discussion Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/search/?q=Daily%20Discussion%20Thread&source=recent&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).
However, if you are trying to start a discussion that is not simply a question about your own program and you still got caught by this filter, try expanding a little bit more in your post to make it a really juicy topic. Message a mod if you're still getting caught by the filter!

"brokenbones","t5_2s8d7","I had a trimalleolar fracture with ORIF in December 2021.  I just saw my ortho last week, celebrating one year of weight bearing.  I am not fully recovered, and when I lamented this to her she told me that honestly, it's a two year recovery.  ""It's considered a life altering injury."" I have to wear a compression stocking on that leg because I still have swelling.  I cannot wear any of my old shoes, and am starting to think Hokas are going to be the only shoe I can wear.

My foot feels like it's plastic.  When I showed her specifically where my pain and tightness was, she agreed to remove one screw (one of the very long ones in the back) because it may be pressing on the peroneal tendon.  Scheduled for the end of April.

Still, I am getting a little better each week.  It's not easy.  I do have an acquaintance who endured the same injury 5 years ago and she's running marathons.  I can't even do a downward dog.

Now, for you - have you tried a compression stocking?   It will help.  I wear the footless ones bc my toes are still not fully extended and I couldn't stand the sensation of the stocking on them.  You may need to get a temporary orthotic for that fallen arch until you can do the exercises to rebuild it.  I think you're also looking at hardware removal (at least some) down the road.  You should not be having bruising like that.  My ortho said she'd be happy to remove mine (I can feel one of the plates) but that it's another recovery and I'm not really ready for that, so maybe in a year or so, for now I'll just settle for the screw removal.

It's a long, long road.  Last year at this time I was just starting to walk.  Now I can move along at a fast clip.  I can take the dog on our favorite 4 mile walk.  When I start to get discouraged I roll the tape of my early recovery, it was hard on the entire family.  It got better for me and it will get better for you.",1680307228.0

"sandiego","t5_2qq2q","What's really interesting is that this happened back when I was in law school with a former combat vet who was accused of sexual assault by a fellow law school student (can't remember what state they were in when it happened, but it was definitely a law school-related event that took place outside of California). The victim reported it immediately, but there was a delay in charging him/disciplining him at the school level. Guy got all the way to graduation, only to have the University threaten to withhold his diploma...it was very high profile here and even nationally within legal circles, not just bc of the military angle and law school's (in)action, but bc his last name is Wacker. Headlines pretty much wrote themselves. 

To be clear, I don't know either the victim or Wacker personally, and I am pretty sure he was cleared of at least some of the charges...not sure whatever happened to him (this happened back in 2007). I remember a very high profile military defense lawyer took his case.  

But I bet UCSD is just as culpable as USD was for sweeping things under the rug. Very sad. I was assaulted in college by a drunk frat boy once, and it didn't even OCCUR to me to report it to the university since it happened off campus outside of school (and I was 18). To me, the fact that the UCSD victim DID report something that happened out of state through official channels, at the risk of burning career bridges at such a young age, speaks to how offensive and inappropriate, not to mention illegal, Fletcher's conduct must've actually been. Really shocking this hasn't come out before.",1680307228.0

How do you budget? I'm moving jobs and pay increase is slightly above 2x, not sure what/how to even get started.

I'd go to his house with a metal baseball hat, crush his fucking disgusting child molesting fingers, smash his teeth in, break his stupid legs and use the end to brutally smash his nuts with the end of the bat. Pedophiles, rapists, violent sexual predators who prey on developing children in a vulnerable place need to be put down or removed from society. That's my honest view, and I would say it straight if anyone asked me.. For the level of damage he caused me, our whole family, the ruined relationship with my brother... To not have to go to jail or be placed on a sexual offender list... he deserves something for his part. They all do.

My brother still lives there. If I could put him on blast I would tell everybody in my town. He deserves to be maimed, but had no repercussions. His mommy is rich so she got him off scott free. I can't even talk about it.

People treated her like absolute dog shit when she was heavy. People would mock her to her face. She didn't deserve that, she‚Äôs the sweetest fucking person ever. She would be ridiculed at the gym or any time she ate anything that wasn't a salad.

Also, I can't tell if you object to sex scenes in general or specifically /r/menwritingwomen-style sex scenes. If it's just the latter, then I've found female authors to be way better at writing sex scenes that integrate into the story instead of being voyeuristic and unnecessary.",1680307229.0

Rarely anything ever happens to them though, even though they're aiding their employer and committing a crime themselves.

What *will* happen, most assuredly, is they'll get the bare minimum pension at retirement, as their contributions to the national pension system will have been minimal to nonexistent. And that they'll have nothing to stand upon when they'll try to get a mortgage: the very first criterion a bank evaluates is how much the monthly payment will be compared to your income... Your official, taxed income. 

As to blaming them entirely though, I don't know. Some blame stays with them, of course, but...

They surely are being greedy in several cases, but they're basically the victims of a scam nonetheless. As in all other scams... Playing on a person greediness is the most common way con-men use to fleece a mark. In other cases, well... There are places in the country where, people tell me, it's that or nothing else, as this fradulent practice is so common and so rarely prosecuted that the job market is mostly made of this of unregistered ""black"" or ""gray"" employment. Especially in all sectors where workers don't need specialized skills or training and education, and the negotiating power is all in the hands of the employer.

If anything, the level of tolerance (or inability to enforce the law) for these crimes in my country is maddening, but it bothers me more thinking about fraudulent employers than defrauded (often just scammed, really) employees, which may be greedy, or maybe simply unable to refuse. 

On the other hand, well, sometimes, the ""employees"" are definitely to blame...

We had a kind of generous unemployment subsidy (which became too costly for the public finances and was abolished) that was making a difference in the lives of many of people, allowing them just enough financial security to be able to leave bad jobs or refuse bad offers, sometimes bordering on servitude, and seek better ones. Judging by the incessant litany of would-be employers who complained to newspapers about ""people not wanting to work anymore"" as they were unable to find people willing to work long hours on physically or psychologically demanding jobs in exchange for peanuts as before -and in some cases they complained because they thought they were being fair, by offering wages who were on par with the national average, but less than the cost of living in big cities where they were located, especially when factoring in the sky-high rents of those cities- well, it was very effective.

Of course, it was also abused, a lot: people kept working ""black"" jobs and started claiming unemployment, on top of it... In a few cases, outright criminals where getting the subsidy... One of them, it was later discovered, had a full-blown, undeclared, completelly illegal supermarket hidden in the building she secretly owned through a figurehead (in these cases people with bad mental health but not under conservatorship, or even homeless people and Roma nomads are paid to sign papers, becoming official owners of dozens of cars, buildings and even businesses while the real owners stay hidden and officially don't own anything: no taxes to pay, and there's nothing to foreclose on or confiscate/reposses, etc. etc. ).

See what I mean? I won't say this is why we can't have nice things, but it surely gives rethorical arrows to the bows of people not wanting to change the system.",1680307230.0

If you're using the pass through, OBS shouldn't matter - there shouldn't be any lag from the capture process - if there is it would likely be due to the capture card you're using.  If you're trying to watch it in OBS at all, there will always be lag from the capture process.

Did you seek out other positive male role models for your son?

If one of my children becomes a deadbeat parent, I would be devastated. I understand your disappointment. But he can make decisions about his own life. And you can make decisions about yours. Your son not claiming his child doesn't preclude you from becoming an active and supportive grandmother.

I think it helps the side-characters she interacts with were super interesting- judge Wilson and Kathleen always kept my attention! People may complain about Callie but her heart was in the right place and her drama was always the juiciest lol! 

Sadly ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think Maia is returning full time. They‚Äôre nearly done with s5 and Maia just finished wrapping two projects away from her home- one was an Amazon movie with Yara Shahidi and Bette Midler, the other was for her Disney+ series. IF good trouble makes a 6 season I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll cameo, but since Maia left the show to be closer to her family I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôd wanna return to LA for so long :/ I really would like to be wrong tho!

This Steelcase Series 2 is $617.32 (lol ok) if you select carpet casters: https://www.amazon.com/Steelcase-Office-Microknit-Licorice-Connect/dp/B08L8J5Q9K

Use coupon code SAFR15 at checkout for 15% off the following authorized returns from Crandall. I don‚Äôt know how long this coupon will be valid. I listed the prices without and with that coupon.

https://www.crandalloffice.com/shop/steelcase-authorized-factory-return-chairs/4108-steelcase-series-2-grade-b/ $490 ‚Äî> $417 (Includes lumbar pad. Minor stain on seat.)

https://www.crandalloffice.com/shop/steelcase-authorized-factory-return-chairs/4527-steelcase-series-2-grade-b/ $487 ‚Äî> $414 (No lumbar pad. Scuffs on legs.)

https://www.crandalloffice.com/shop/steelcase-authorized-factory-return-chairs/5263-steelcase-series-2-grade-a/ $579 ‚Äî> $492 (No lumbar pad. No identified scuffs.)

(Many more available on their site.)

The ‚Äú3D microknit air‚Äù back on the Series 2 is a mesh suspended over a flexible plastic back. I have an Amia Air at work without the mesh and it‚Äôs‚Ä¶perfectly fine. It‚Äôs not cushy but it‚Äôs supportive and will *never* wear out. So even if the mesh does start to give out, you still have the main support to last you forever. Some of these Series 2s also have an additional adjustable lumbar pad.

Especially seeing colleagues who can still enjoy running or playing sports with their children is a reminder that their was a debt being paid. It is compensation for our service connected disabilities, no different than a drunk driver crippling me. I can still work but deserve compensation for the loss of physical/mental enjoyment in our finite life.

"TwoSentenceHorror","t5_30tmh","Defending yourself implies an attack occurred, which is not the case. So in reality you are not defending yourself, you are attacking me due to your decision to ignore the majority of what I said.

The fact that your comments were deleted is imperative because you are the only one who can delete them, and it then hides the identity of the speaker. So you actively hid the fact that it was you, and used my ignorance of your identity against me. It's been nearly a month, and you expect me to remember the name of a person I never spoke to.

You have been nothing but rude and dismissive, claiming self-defense to justify an attack. From everything you've shown me, you probably did intend to attack the other person just as you're doing to me now.

Something must have gone seriously wrong to make you so angry you had to dig up a month-old post just to take out some aggression on a stranger like this. I hope it improves, but I will never be speaking to you again, as you have been nothing but toxic thus far.",1680307231

What kind of reasoning must someone twist and twirl to think that taking away a child's source of comfort and pleasure because they do not fit in is appropriate?

I am sympathetic to what teachers face day in and day out, but I have no idea of what this one was thinking. Even if she had a legitimate reason to take the book away ‚Äì and she did not ‚Äì she should have returned it at the end of the day. Not only did she deprive your daughter of her activity during her free time at school, she also stole time from her at home.

"java","t5_2qhd7","I've been working with Guidewire for over 17 years, after training and certifying with Guidewire in their (then) headquarters in San Mateo, CA, have delivered over 14 large scale implementations for customers in the US, UK and Europe, and now manage the Guidewire practice for a large international company.

Guidewire products currently come in two 'flavours' - a completely managed cloud hosted/SaaS version on Guidewire's own cloud platform (known as Guidewire Cloud), and a 'self-managed' version where customers are usually responsible for their own infrastructure, deployment and management.

Guidewire Cloud is ultimately built on top of AWS but has its own infrastructure architecture. It's fair to say knowledge of AWS is certainly a benefit, but a candidate would certainly require additional training for Guidewire Cloud deployment and administration in addition to their AWS knowledge. An AWS resource would not be able to go into a Guidewire project cold without that basic training - Guidewire have an excellent education programme and an AWS trained resource would be able to train up and certify in Guidewire Cloud in a couple of weeks.

For self-managed installations, customers have a number of options for deployment. Traditionally it was always in dedicated data centers, but is more commonly on cloud-based platforms such as AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Therefore, for an AWS deployment, it's just deployment and administration similar to any other Java based enterprise application, so yes, AWS skills would be able to deal with it.

As for an AWS dev picking up Guidewire coding - it really depends on their experience. Guidewire have their own proprietary language called Gosu. It's a VM based language which is very similar to Java. The vast majority of my Guidewire developers are from Java backgrounds and have easily cross-trained into Gosu. Additionally, it's quite common to call Java libraries and frameworks from Gosu, so a good Java background is a great start. In fact, we generally require it as a pre-requisite for Guidewire training.

As for 'learning on the job' - A standard Guidewire training course takes around 25 days to go from zero Guidewire knowledge to be a fully trained (and certified) Guidewire configuration and integration developer. And that's based on 5-7 hours of study/labs per day. And for that's for *one* product (ie, ClaimCenter, PolicyCenter or BillingCenter). As the product all share a common architecture and toolset, learning subsequent products are usually only around 10-12 days per product.

Personally, I would *not* recommend 'learning on the job' in an ideal situation. Of course, it is possible, but I've spent a large part of my career fixing poor implementations of undertrained developers. A Java dev can easily pick up Gosu learning on the job and start hacking away at code within a couple of weeks, but the Guidewire platforms are very complex and mature enterprise products, and there's a lot more to them than just writing Gosu code. A solid understanding of the products, the domains and certainly Guidewire best practices should be an absolute minimum for a *good* Guidewire developer IMO - although I understand the commercial aspects of Guidewire development, and customers are (unfortunately, IMO) often willing to hire very inexperienced developers due to it being a niche technology.",1680307233.0

Some of the states that are tentatively positive for Democrats are Montana (as you stated), Kansas, and Alaska. North Carolina seems like it's stuck in that perpetual 3% gap. I've read that the reason for that is that the growth in the research triangle isn't as drastic as areas around Atalanta which leaves it in this permanent holding pattern. 

My understanding that Milwaukee is a point of frustration in Wisconsin as Democrats can't seem to get the kind of turn out there that they need even if they're making it up elsewhere.

Stop your old school management tactics of being a heavy handed 'do as I say' asshole boss. That only worked back in the day when people were paid very well and there wasn't the exact same job with better pay and a better environment around the corner. 

If you pay like shit too, prepare to be a leader, not a boss. These aren't your subordinates they are your team and you need to reach your goals as a team. Collaborate with them. Fix problems with them. Your methods and ideas are clearly not successful.

Firing should be your last resort. Think of yourself as a teacher. If a teacher has a high volume of students failing, dropping out, or getting kicked out, it's very unlikely that the issue is the students.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","Agreed, the implication that a perfect God *wouldn't* want sin to exist is already a pain point.  


However, there's something that makes this more complicated. It is stated that after everything is finished and God recreates everything as perfect once again, that sin will never exist ever again for all eternity.  


This implies that everything was setup the way it is now in order to stop sin and iniquity from ever happening again. However, that's a ""greater good"" argument that almost harkens back to necessitating evil like in Olemas, which breaks the condition of God being ""maximally good"".  


If there is to be a maximally perfect or ""sinless and faultless to the absolute highest degree of measurability always making incalculatably perfect decisions"" God, then it is impossible for us to claim that God *is* perfect, as it is beyond our ability to calculate or comprehend. We can use it as an axiom or a pre-supposition, but then everything that follows must adhere to that standard.",1680307233

Prithviraj is good in action roles and he plays the hero well. But he is not able to handle aspects like comedy as well as Indrajith does.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Thank you Go_to_sleep_wallace for your submission! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

Your post has been removed as it is in violation of Rule 2: Posts must ask for advice.

# 2. Posts must ask for advice.

^According ^to ^Oxford, ^""Advice"" ^is ^defined ^as ^""guidance ^or ^recommendations ^offered ^with ^regard ^to ^prudent ^future ^action"".

* ***Your post MUST have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on.*** 

Posts that are too short, vague, or lacking of important backstory may be removed. The more detail you give us, the better the advice is that we can give you. Help us help you.

* ***""Why does this person do/say this thing?"" is not advice. We are not mind readers, we do not know why the person is doing that thing.***

* ***Rant posts, and anything like ""I just need to vent / need someone to talk to"" belong in r/vent, r/rant, r/offmychest, r/needafriend, r/casualconversation.***

* ***No random, general, or hypothetical questions. For general questions and answers go to r/answers, r/askreddit, r/nostupidquestions.***

* ***No posts seeking advice or ideas on revenge***

* ***Update posts are only allowed if you are asking for additional advice. Plain old updates should be added as an edit to the original post.***

* ***No posts offering general unsolicited advice.*** 

This includes motivational quotes and inspirational stories. Again; your post ***MUST*** have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on. 

* ***No advertising, proselytizing or self promotion allowed in posts or comments.***

Any self-promotion whether obvious or not (like if you feign seeking criticism to subtly try to drive people to your site) will get you banned.

* ***No soliciting money***

You will be banned instantly if you ask for money, donations, or link to a gofundme, paypal, venmo, anything. Try r/Assistance or r/Borrow.

* ***No posts about critiquing appearance or looks.*** 

These would be more appropriate in subs like r/amiugly, r/rateme, and fashion advice subs like r/malefashionadvice and r/femalefashionadvice.

* ***No meta posts.*** 

For questions about reddit itself, or if you are new to reddit, see r/help, or r/NewToReddit. If you don't know where to post, try r/findareddit. If you are asking for help moderating or creating a subreddit, try r/modhelp. No posts asking how to get unbanned from another sub. If you have concerns about this subreddit, message the moderators. 

* ***No asking to be privately messaged.***

Keep the conversation in r/advice. Posts asking for private messages will be removed. **Do not accept advice from unsolicited messages**. These users are likely either banned from the sub for whatever reason or are giving advice that they know is bad and don't want to post where moderators can see it and remove it.

Please [review the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/about/rules), and if you feel as though removal is excessive or in error, feel free to [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Advice).

Your post has been removed as it was in Violation of Rule 8: No obvious reassurance seeking.

## Do *not* message us ***unless you have read the rules first***. We can tell if you haven't read them, and will ignore your message.

If you are *also* asking for advice in your post which also contains reassurance seeking, simply revise the post in accordance with this rule.

# 8. No obvious reassurance seeking

*This subreddit is for advice. NOT moral judgement, validation, or to affirm your opinions/feelings or settle arguments.*

***Reassurance seeking vs. Asking for Advice***

**""What should I do?""** is asking for advice.

**""What do you think about something I already did?""** is reassurance seeking.

r/Advice is for the former, not the latter. Your post must be worded in this nature. Do not message us asking how to word your post, we are not here to write your posts for you.

Other common reassurance seeking examples:

* ***AITA?*** 

There is a whole subreddit just for that! This subreddit is not an overflow or a backup for r/AmITheAsshole. Do not crosspost from there, nor include any of the AITA abbreviations anywhere in your post. 

* ***Am I a bad person/friend/partner/etc?***

* ***Am I overreacting / being unreasonable / in the wrong / allowed to be upset / justified in feeling this way?***

* ***Was this ok / should I have done this?*** 

* ***Will I be OK?***

* ***Should I be worried?***

And many more. This is not an all-inclusive list, as reassurance seeking takes countless forms. 

Tip: Remember, if you are asking about something that already happened, and it can be answered ""yes"" or ""no"", you are seeking reassurance, not advice!

&#x200B;

but hey... I am a real-life Saudi, and I am willing to talk about both its positives and negatives:

Since your family will certainly look american, there are almost nothing you do that would create offense... why? because people would know that you are not knowledgeable about their culture, thus they will give you the benefit of the doubt that you didnt mean wrong.

for the dress code, it have reduced in intensity, currently, most places are socially acceptable for women to wear normal clothing (long sleeve shirts and pants), but there are still some places that would like it if women wore on top of their clothes an abaya (a long robe). As for head coverings, all major cities dont require it anymore, and it have become the norm not to wear head coverings in some areas.

As for a male, you should wear a shirt (short or long sleeves, as long as not sleeveless), and pants that cover to below your knees (but if you were working out, you could wear shorts, but you wouldn't be able to enter some malls and governmental buildings).

as for the offenses, remember, you will almost never offend anyone since they will understand that you are not knowledgeable about the culture, but if you are really careful, here is what you should not do:

1. dont insult the people
2. dont insult the government
3. dont be naked
4. dont drink alcohol or consume drugs

and that is it, really.

bro... I have a lot of philipini friends who have a lot of tattoos showing and it is okay, no one cares, maybe they would catch the occasional look or two, but no one cares. (also some other guy said that married people cant hold hands, yes they can)

the rules in Saudi have changed a lot in the past 8 years (since King Salman and crown prince MBS took power), both the legal and social rules. Anyone who left Saudi more than 2 years ago wouldn't know much about nowadays Saudi, that is why you should ask in r/saudiarabia or you could ask me.",1680307235.0

I (44F) was diagnosed with cirrhosis on January 2nd of this year.  It has been a shitstorm of ridiculous-Ness ever since. üòÑ üòÜ  But really.  

I have Celiac disease,  was diagnosed about 13 years ago.  I have been very strictly gluten-free  ever since.  I DO  know that once you have an autoimmune disease,  you're most likely going to be diagnosed with another one... or two, etc. 

Since being dx with end stage cirrhosis,  I've tested for everything on earth. I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism (Hashimotos) and Alopecia areata. Two more autoimmune diseases. And being tested for a few more. I believe I have Psoriasis and possibly Lichen Planus of the skin. (It's a gross weird rash or skin thing. Mist people get in the genitals, yikes, and mouth, also yikes. Mine manifests as a rash. Super!) 

My point is, so far, I've been looking into the correlation between each of these and cirrhosis.  And yep! Connected. I just started by giggling the disease and cirrhosis.  For example :  'Celiac disease and Cirrhosis'.  Lots of info out there. Also, stage 3 is easy to find info.  Dm me if you want to chat and swap knowledge!",1680307236.0

So when your going through 3 cows a week (that's what we used at my restaurant), you could theoretically end up with 120lbs after a week. That's almost 500lbs a month. A butcher would probably go through even more animals than we did. 

There's honestly enough fat in the rest of the animal that you don't need it for making grind. Besides, you want a softer fat for that. The cod fat is extra dense, almost wax like. When you cook it it doesn't melt and make tender juiciness, it's more cohesive, more chewy. You know how a suet cake feels? Like shortening? It doesn't have as pleasant of a mouth feel as soft fat, like the fat that's marbled into a steak.

I know this stuffed up feeling is terrible.  We‚Äôve all been through it.  Can you eat something hot / drink something hot? Sometimes that will relax your Eustachian tubes which will lessen that stuffed feeling. Think what do you do when you have a bad head cold. Also, I was told to gently move your head/neck/shoulders around to get the circulation up to help things. I don‚Äôt know if this helps as I was already doing that (I went back to work fast).

"StarWarsArmada","t5_32ym5","Here's the list: The general idea is to simply stay at range and POUND THEM. So long as you are attacking a shield zone, Mar Tuuk gives your ships +1 red die to their attack roll. All the upgrades on your ships either help re-roll or add more dice to attack with.

For example,  The patriot fist normally fires 4 long-range dice. But, with all the upgrades it goes up to 7 dice at long-range. If you are shooting at a shielded hull zone, 8 dice,With the firepower command, 9 dice, with the opening salvo objective your \~100pt ship is throwing **11 dice at long range.**  (To put that in perspective, it's considered ""good"" to throw half that at long range.)  Because of the Recusant's extremely wide front arc, it will gaze over the battlefield like the eye of Sauron. But, firepower isn't enough, re-rolls help make those attacks count.

Speaking of rerolls,  Shu Mai lets you re-roll 3 of dice for turns 3 and 5 for the recusant. For everyone else, Linked Turbo Laser towers let you re-roll a red dice for free  every time you attack.  This will help even out the bad luck and make your list consistent.

With the dice-fixing and firepower upgrades built-in, you can focus on the most important thing:  MANUVERING.  The **MANUVER** command **KEEPS** the target in the firing arc. When learning, if you don't know what command is best, ALWAY CHOOSE THE MANUVER COMMAND. And just focus on picking off each of the enemy's ships one-by-one.

By the way, I‚Äôm sure you know the tale but just for anybody who doesn‚Äôt. 

Regdar was the 3.5 iconic fighter but he was not meant to be.  He was forced on the art and writing departments because basically, ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt have a white human guy, can you really say you have a protagonist? I mean come on now. Let‚Äôs be pragmatic.‚Äù

Sigh.

So because of that, they killed him every damn chance they could in the art .

I think it‚Äôs hysterical, but a very famous example of a passive aggressive art, revealing a rift in a company .

(I have a couple others in the back of my mind, but they‚Äôre currently slipping it)

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","You should probably separate the events entirely, then. That is, you organise the events you like, he sucks it up and finds people that want to play games as he does.

If you have space, and enough attendees, you can separate it by room (and tell everyone in the invites ""also, the kitchen is for the play to win games,  lounge is for casual gaming and chat."") 

Or you split events, this one is for you and the gaming is just an excuse to gather. That one is for him, and the point is the games. You both accept that he won't be much of an appearance at yours, you won't get involved in the games in his. 

But I suspect that you know more people that want to come to game nights, but those people want to come to your game nights, with your level of social to competitive. If they didn't, they'd be gaming with him while you were chatting with whoever. So ultimately, you should probably both accept that neither of you will get what you want out of the other's preferred gaming party, he's not going to enjoy them, so he shouldn't expect to play (and you shouldn't expect him to stay). You won't enjoy his, so shouldn't go. That's okay - you don't have to enjoy all the same stuff together.",1680307238.0

"AustralianPolitics","t5_2snwr","From you? I need a definition, yes, because from experience your definitions can be highly creative.

From Britannica, slavery is defined as follows:

>There is no consensus on what a slave was or on how the institution of slavery should be defined. Nevertheless, there is general agreement among historians, anthropologists, economists, sociologists, and others who study slavery that most of the following characteristics should be present in order to term a person a slave. The slave was a species of property; thus, he belonged to someone else. In some societies slaves were considered movable property, in others immovable property, like real estate. They were objects of the law, not its subjects. Thus, like an ox or an ax, the slave was not ordinarily held responsible for what he did. He was not personally liable for torts or contracts. The slave usually had few rights and always fewer than his owner, but there were not many societies in which he had absolutely none. As there are limits in most societies on the extent to which animals may be abused, so there were limits in most societies on how much a slave could be abused. The slave was removed from lines of natal descent. Legally, and often socially, he had no kin. No relatives could stand up for his rights or get vengeance for him. As an ‚Äúoutsider,‚Äù ‚Äúmarginal individual,‚Äù or ‚Äúsocially dead person‚Äù in the society where he was enslaved, his rights to participate in political decision making and other social activities were fewer than those enjoyed by his owner. The product of a slave‚Äôs labour could be claimed by someone else, who also frequently had the right to control his physical reproduction.

From the context of the whole paragraph, we can glean that ""slavery"" means, well, what we think of as slavery: people treated as property and used to perform forced labour. We can also see that much of the definition doesn't fit Forced Marriage: your source documents that these wives still enjoyed the same moiety rights and restrictions under the law, not removed from lines of natal descent, wasn't without kin, still had relatives, wasn't a marginal or socially dead person.

Likewise, there has been a modern campaign to treat Forced Marriage and Forced Labour as legally analogous, but that's in a very specific context. There have been no efforts to apply the same analogy to history: indeed, it would be anachronistic to do so.

If you wanted to be clear, and make your points in good faith, you could have simply said ""Aboriginal people practised Forced Marriage prior to Contact"" and provided your source and that would have been that. But you want to make Forced Marriage akin to Forced Labour so as to sell the conclusion that slavery was practised before and after Contact: but the conclusion is misleading and anachronistic.",1680307238.0

I'm independent but definitely align with progressives on most issues, which makes this pronoun stuff all the more annoying.  You all look ridiculous arguing this nonsense, and are making a mockery of progressivism.  When kooks on the left kick kids out of events for this kind of stuff, it isn't a good look, and gives the right ammo against the things that *do* matter, like *actual* trans rights.  

The trans people in my life don't do this ""ask pronouns"" nonsense.  Read what trans people in this very thread are saying - they don't want it!  Asking pronouns is *so* cringe, just stop it already.  Make an assumption and then if corrected, proceed with the person's preferred.

Once they have their own income if the child wants something in particular then they can buy it themselves, plus they can start topping up the family groceries in case of emergency without needing reimbursement. Other things like clothes and toys and technology should be paid for by the parents until the child has their own income. Obviously if the child wants things that aren't necessities and the parents aren't prepared to pay for them then that's something they can save up for with Christmas money. But once the child has their own income from youth allowance or a job then they should be buying those things themselves. Necessities like glasses and medication I would say the parents should pay for even if the child has an income, but if their child is an adult then those necessities can also be paid for by themselves.

School items just occurred to me as an example. Parents should pay for primary and high school books, supplies, and uniforms, but if the child goes to university then books, supplies, and fees should be their own responsibility. But if the parents choose to help then that is a much appreciated kindness. For example, with my own situation, my mum was in the position to help so she paid my fees up front every semester to get the up front discount, and then I was able to pay her back for less than if I had gotten HECS.",1680307240.0

- If you‚Äôre making msupps and the facility is adjacent to a frontline scrap field or salvage mine you‚Äôre winning big.
- If it‚Äôs a frontline ammunition facility making 120 or 150mm and it‚Äôs on a scrap field or salvage mine you‚Äôre winning big.
- If it‚Äôs making anything ELSE besides the basic con mats needed for those ammunition or a simple vehicle pad or two, you‚Äôre wasting your time.

(Tripod facility gets out-teched fast, and any other facility building requires too much to be frontline. The Emats for ammunition can be imported easily btw.)

If you build either of the two above or both, and it‚Äôs NOT at a salvage mine or field then you‚Äôve created a huge amount of extra work for yourself. The only other input required for them is diesel, coal or petrol.

"FemdomCommunity","t5_2whne","A couple ideas you could implement however you want that my Dom has used before.

1.) Have her make you cum to something she wants, whether it be her teasing you or making you watch specific porn or even just her humiliating and degrading you.

2.) Ruin it, after such a long time locked away nothing is worse than being so close to release and having it ruined. 

3.) Mix edging in with some Cbt for a while before you cum, it makes the anticipation and release that much better but also entertaining for your Dom.

4.) For the humiliation aspect of it, some fun ideas are to have her make you cum on your own face, or cum on yourself and go to sleep without cleaning it off. Maybe smearing it on your face or ruining it into your hand and than doing it. And my own Don‚Äôs favorites, to cum on and in your cage and than put it straight back on as a reminder.

I play cricket in Yorkshire and also have experience of the academy system, not going to go into too much detail as I don't want to dox myself. What you tend to find with young Asian players is that their parents tend to either not have much money or, more often than not, are unwilling to spend money on club fees or coaching, they do tend to go for the cheapest option. (Before anyone complains I have seen this firsthand numerous times even when the kid has a real talent and has a good shot of making it.)

 Whereas the 'white' parents are willing to send their kids to either the clubs with high yearly signing on fees or private schools with even bigger fees but better facilities and coaches. There is a reason why so many clubs which are predominantly Asian end up going under, and its an issue that really needs addressing if things are going to improve at grassroots level.",1680307243.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","We implement a quantum error correction algorithm for bit-flip errors on the topological toric code using deep reinforcement learning. An action-value Q-function encodes the discounted value of moving a defect to a neighboring site on the square grid (the action) depending on the full set of defects on the torus (the syndrome or state). The Q-function is represented by a deep convolutional neural network. Using the translational invariance on the torus allows for viewing each defect from a central perspective which significantly simplif ies the state space representation independently of the number of defect pairs. The training is done using experience replay, where data from the algorithm being played out is stored and used for mini-batch upgrade of the Q-network. We find performance which is close to, and for small error rates asymptotically equivalent to, that achieved by the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching algorithm for code distances up to d = 7.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","Yeah the social aspects of the game are also nonexistent. I understand why they don't let people just enter text--not only would language barriers likely be an issue, but you have harassment, toxicity, offensiveness, safety, etc as concerns. I get that moderating that would be a massive undertaking. But there should at least be a few premade messages you can choose to send people. Not only would that make it harder to abuse the system, it would be translated into whatever language the user was playing the game in, so it would make it *easier* to communicate across barriers.

The raid damage bonus for raiding with higher friendship levels is nice. But people have been crying for unlimited distance on lucky trades since basically forever--I know they want it to be an all-in-person game, but we live in a global society and sometimes even friends and family you're close with IRL aren't geographically near you. Lucky trades are a hard enough grind to get to it wouldn't be completely gamebreaking to allow that.

I get that they want to make social events, and I admit I like it when that actually works! Elite Raids have brought my local community out in person, and I like that. But again, I think there needs to be a balance. People can't play together *all* the time. Keeping players happy and engaged when they're not together too makes them more likely to want to get together again next time.

I notice a kind of ""economy"" on PokeGenie, where very in-demand bosses have long queues of remote raiders, and less desirable bosses have long queues of open lobbies. As the game has gotten more and more hostile to remote raiding, I've been noticing the balance shifting, to where there's usually a lobby queue. Most people playing outdoors don't get a group together when the queue is longer than the raid timer itself, they just give up on raiding. When the game was friendlier to remote raiders (free weekly remote raid passes, discounted bundle of 3 in the shop, rare candy rewards not nerfed) at a certain point the queues would be self-limiting in the other direction--people who *wanted* to remote raid more *couldn't*, because there was a shortage of hosts. There's only so much remote raiding *can* grow without people hosting. An abundance of remote raiders makes hosting easy and fun, and encourages people having trouble getting into a raid to go out and host one instead. A shortage of remote raiders makes hosting tedious and time-consuming and frustrating, and encourages you to just give in and buy a remote raid pass if you want to do a raid. Remote raiders are part of the ecosystem that actually paradoxically encourages people to go out in person and find raids to host. Going out and looking for raids then leaves some space open for serendipity, where you run into other players and don't even need to host it.

(I'm not sure more raiders making for a lower-level Giratina would incentivize everyone either, since plenty of players don't PVP. I agree that there needs to be *some way* for a person who can't find local players to complete a raid, but third-party apps with the game friendly to remote raiders was actually doing a pretty good job of that I thought--helping people who can't find anyone local, rewarding the host for getting out there, giving the remoters something to do in their downtime, and making a bit of money too.) 

I have a playstyle kind of similar to yours and have accumulated premium passes several times, but I burned through most of them during a few events where the raids were particularly good, and I'm kind of glad I did because depreciating remote passes actually *also* depreciates premium passes. Premium passes are worth more to me if I know I can reliably complete a raid. Without remote raiders, it might not be possible or I could just be flushing away money. Remote raiders eager to spend their pass creates value for the premium pass too.

And thank you, I know the mom story is like awkward to tell (she's doing better than she was then but honestly it's not great and I'm still worried) but I wanted to illustrate how like, people have lives and reasons for not being go go go go all the time, and that doesn't mean we're never out there being active or we're lazy couch potatoes. I just felt so judged, like the game was telling me I was bad for not going outside and chasing raids right that second. I honestly felt insulted. Like, I'm trying to keep my mind off dark shit in a hard time and I'm literally ready to throw money at you for entertainment, but you don't even value my money and you shame me for not going outside when there's actually a very good reason for that? Players who pay you money to remote raid aren't the enemy, but Niantic is treating them as such, and acting like there's no overlap between players who pay money to remote raid and players who do raids outdoors and meet other players--when the most engaged players are likely to be *both* of those things.",1680307244.0

"shoptitans","t5_10twfn","First things first, promotions. You have a couple heroes here who are promoted and were not worth the investment, to be brutally honest. Titan Souls are one of the most scarce resources in the game so it's crucial to [use them wisely](https://st-central.net/promotions-and-you/). Second, your roster could use some serious work as mentioned in my other comment.

Now for the good news - this is absolutely salvageable. You have a working roster right now, and that's a big deal by itself. 

Disclaimer: This comment will be focused around advice for general-use heroes in common team styles. Most specialized builds / team styles such as Immortal Quartet, Hypermax builds, and solo / duo specific setups are not likely to be covered here, with the exception of Polonia Trickster due to them being the most common specialized team. Additionally, this is a game first. Please don't feel like you NEED to follow anything mentioned here. If you want to do something else, go for it as long as you have fun with it! Finally, this comment will only be focusing on skills. Gear is its own animal which will not be specifically covered in this comment (plus it is not included in the most common export of this tool).

When you start phasing people out, remember to only fire 2-3 at a time so you don't cripple your roster. Don't hire new ones until you fill the empty slots and have people you're going to keep around. For the new guys, I think you'll want to start transitioning into elemental barrier teams (if you're not already). If you're not sure what an elemental barrier is or where to start planning your teams, [more detail can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/shoptitans/comments/z74i7s/comment/iy951go/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I'll be dividing these into three categories - ""Keep"", ""Fire Later"", and ""Fire Now.""

* ""Keep"" is self-explanatory. They're good enough to stick around permanently, but may need one skill swapped. If a hero isn't specifically called out as needing to be fired, consider them in this category.
* ""Fire Later"" ones can stick around for a while. They're a little too weak to be useful in the long-term and will have a skillset that's a bit too flawed. This is usually two skills that are wrong or too weak. They'll be great workhorses until you replace them.
* ""Fire Now"" aren't worth holding onto at all. Pick two or three of these guys and find the nearest cannon to shove them into. Hire two new ones and start the [rerolling process](https://st-central.net/retire-rehire-and-you-v2/) until both have two good skills. Then pick the next two of these Fire Nows and reload the cannon with them. Repeat until they're all gone, then start on the Fire Laters.

I'm probably going to recommend some skill rerolls here and there for the heroes who are worth keeping. One big thing to remember is that not all rerolls are created equally. Some skills are awful and are doing nothing for the hero, and these should be rerolled first. If a skill is mentioned as ""functional"" or ""low priority,"" it's OK to hang onto it for a while. Dice can be a bit scarce (even now that they can be fused) so it's important to use them wisely. The weakest skills will give you the biggest gain when swapped for something better, so start with those.

While I won't be going into specifics of gear as mentioned, we'll briefly touch on it because it's pretty important. [This guide](https://st-central.net/min-maxing-gear/) will get you pointed in the right direction.

With all of that out of the way, let's finally get to it! I'll call out any potential Soul targets as we go. If you're not sure why a hero is or is not being mentioned as a good promotion candidate, check out [this guide](https://st-central.net/promotions-and-you/) for more detail. More details on any of these ratings can be found in my guide series on [what goes into making a good hero](https://st-central.net/what-makes-a-good-hero/). If you have any questions on any of these, please feel free to ask!

* Yrene: Fire later, bordering on fire now. The defense from Shining Blade is the only thing helping you here.
* Marigold: This is unfortunately one of the purest examples of my initial note - she really should not have been promoted. That said, it's done. If you want to keep her around, then reroll Whirlwind Attack, Caltrops, and Cleave in that order. If you don't want to reroll most of her skillset, then she's one of the last heroes of this bunch that you fire.
* Winifred: Tough call. Acrobatics is hit or miss for most Fighters. It's one of those skills that's not great on its own but excels when it has other good defensive skills to work with. Spear Master isn't doing much for your either. Probably a Fire Later.
* Joppo: If you have Royal Merchant, he's one of the last heroes you fire. If you don't have Royal Merchant, then reroll Crossbow Master and keep.
* Sirius: This is a good case study where every skill is ""correct"" but superior options are available. Reroll Perforate and Backstab first. Crossbow Master is fine but outclassed by Gun Master / both Epic weapon skills. Still, it's a weapon skill at all, which is crucial.
* Jasmine: Probably a fire now. This skillset is pretty confused.
* Ninja Girl: Solid, definitely worth keeping. Reroll Sword Master, then Backstab. Double stacked weapon skills doesn't work out so well unless the character has a ton of bonus Attack.
* Dancing Miss: Reroll Sturdy first since it's easily the weakest skill here. It's probably a good idea to reroll Bow Master to a better weapon skill down the line, but that's lower priority.
* Olivia, Morgan, & Vestia: All three are Fire Later. These skillsets are fine but underwhelming.
* Nayana: Could be better, but not bad. The main thing here is that you have a lot of CD but no CHC to use with it. You'll want to reroll Hex first since it's the weakest skill here, ideally for Eagle Eyes or All Natural.
* Sgt Pickles: Fantastic. Reroll Shield Master and you're golden.
* Elyse: Pretty good as well. You need a weapon skill here. Reroll Sturdy for one.",1680307244.0

This is a red flag you are showing that says you aren‚Äôt ready, you need more time, and you will be going in self sabotaging every date you will be going on if you don‚Äôt pump the breaks and EASE into dating again.

You gotta be in a head space where you are t crying about your ex to go on a date with someone new.

You should feel excited to meet this guy, not so upset because he‚Äôs not your ex.

Edit: Hit send too soon but wanted to add I was 3.5 months broken up with my ex when I started to date again.

Weirdly we were in a strange grey area of FWB/situationship post breakup that for at least me made the transition easier to then date again. I don‚Äôt recommend this for everyone as it‚Äôs uniquely my experience and could backfire for others who attempt to do this with an ex.",1680307245.0

"ShuumatsuNoValkyrie","t5_vzop7","Not gonna lie.

 I liked the characters.

 The fight was kinda bad.

 And they where kinda wasted.

 Somehow we had the biggest optimist fighting the most depressed nihilist and saw nearly no development between the two or how they affected each other, instead spending just as much time on an already dead character as one of the current combatants, and far too much backstory for Beelz with next to no actual development during the fight itself.

 That irks me FAR more than the fight itself imo. Adam vs Zeus is STILL my favourite fight despite it... Mostly being punches just thrown back and forth the whole time. (But yes, it would've been nice if the SCIENTIST didn't end with ""ora ora ora - hah, sneaky ora from behind!"" As their finishing technique, but to be fair once I saw the mecha suit I sort of figured we where just gonna get more punchy in the fight anyway)

 The ending was kind of lackluster and rushed to be honest. There was still more to be done - but I also don't think the chapter needed to go longer, we should've just had less time spent on the past and more on the actual present.

 I don't know. I'm kind of dissapointed - which is sad, cause I genuinely felt a lot more attached to Tesla than the previous round combatants, and even Beelz was still interesting to me, but I just feel like neither of them really went anywhere. I'm glad Tesla got to stay optimistic at the end and motivate people but we've kinda had that this whole time.

 What I REALLY wanted to see was him spread his optimism to Beelz during the fight and reignite some passion for life. Hell, even Hades cameo seemed to hint at Beelz learning the lesson of what Lilith truly wanted for him, but... That just hasn't happened.

 And... What was the whole Satan thing about if it's just not going to even come up? Chekov's gun went unanswered - I mean, I guess you don't HAVE to tie the backstory into the fight, but... It'd sure make things more cohesive.

 I don't know. I got more enjoyment out of the bets than the actual fight by the end of this round.",1680307245.0

I was going to cancel and break up with her but I heard her on the radio making a dedication to me and bantering with the DJ about how she was looking forward to our ski week together.   That, and I heard from some friends that she told them that she had never gone away with someone and always wanted to. She was a really sweet girl and the idea of hurting her really bothered me. So we went.  And she had planned these little romantic scenarios and dropped a lot of hints about having amazing sex.  I was thinking maybe we could just avoid it and after the trip I could find a way to break up.  But she was definitely not going to have us avoid it.  It happened the first night and the next day and night and everyday and night.  It seems like a lie that I didn‚Äôt want to have sex with her but I felt conflicted and didn‚Äôt want to. I just couldn‚Äôt take this from her.  I had to go through with all of it.",1680307246.0

"entertainment","t5_2qh0f","Amazon Studios¬†has won a competitive auction and sealed a high-six figure outright purchase of¬†The Dwelling, an unpublished short story by¬†Aaron Jayh.¬†Michael B. Jordan¬†and¬†Liz Raposo‚Äôs¬†Outlier Society¬†are attached to produce. Jordan is potentially starring. ¬†

Adapting the mind-bending story will be¬†Aaron Guzikowski, the scribe best known for Denis Villeneuve‚Äôs¬†Prisoners¬†and Apple TV‚Äôs¬†Raised by Wolves. Jordan and Raposo will produce with Ground Control‚Äôs Scott Glassgold.

Several studios bid and put together talent alignments, but it came down to Amazon and Netflix, sources said.

The Dwelling¬†tells the story of a newly divorced father who discovers a house buried in his backyard. He is a former all pro football player trying to ease into retirement, and the hits he took on the field starts to make him unsure what is real and imagined, as things begin to go awry.¬†The short story has a fantastic male lead at its center. ¬†

This comes at a great moment for Outlier, which is coming off the $250 million global success of¬†Creed III¬†heading into its fifth weekend. Outlier, which has a deal with Amazon, is lining up its next film. ¬†

An unsung part of this story is that it is the eighth sale of a short story for Glassgold‚Äôs Ground Control and Verve. Short stories, particularly in genre, are becoming a very viable way to broker deals and draw talent.

Two weeks ago, the duo sold¬†I Am Not Alone¬†to Netflix with Jessica Chastain to star and Misha Green to write and direct, with Glassgold¬†producing alongside Simon Kinberg and Craig Flores. The month prior, they packaged¬†The Occupant¬†for New Line Cinema, with¬†Barbarian‚Äôs Zach Cregger and Roy Lee producing alongside Glassgold.¬†Other short story sales¬†include¬†My Wife & I Bought a Ranch¬†and¬†We Used to Live Here¬†to Netflix,¬†Caretaker¬†to Universal with Sydney Sweeney to star,¬†I Think My Mother-In-Law Is Trying to Kill Me¬†to Sony 3000 and¬†Wilderness Reform¬†to Paramount.¬†

Glassgold is currently in post-production on Sony Pictures‚Äô¬†HorrorScope¬†and is readying Zeek Earl and Chris Caldwell‚Äôs follow-up to their Pedro Pascal starrer, Prospect.

Outlier is represented by WME, M88 and Johnson Shaprio Slewett & Kole;. Guzikowski is represented by Verve & Adam Kolbrenner at Lit Entertainment Group; Jayh and Ground Control are represented by Verve and Ashley Silver.",1680307246.0

Language sounds are diverse. I‚Äôm most familiar with Yoruba, which is a very tonal language. Meanings of words can change differ depending on the tone. Also, dialects differ from region to region. 
Arabic is also a very common language in Africa. Very complex and influenced by local languages.    E.g. Chad Arabic is different Somali Arabic.

Southern African languages use clicking sounds 

African visuals- Nsibidi (wakanda shapes) is probably what most people recognise as African visuals. But each region as a different dressing style, arts, textiles and tradition

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I had an experience emergency c section with my daughter 4 years  ago, everything seemed fine at first but the took a long time to get her out and then they rushed her up to neonatal. Immediately afterwards my spinal completely failed. I knew something was wrong because the pain I was experiencing was excruciating and was creeping down my body (they were also trying to stop a bleed) . I think because I was going into shock I couldn't hardly verbalise, I was just making this awful groaning sound and rational brain was telling me they are Dr's they know what they are doing, perhaps this is normal.

By the time I could feel just above my knees I fully understood what was happening, it hit me like a freight train I knew the spinal had failed and in the next second before I can try and tell them i can feel my legs, the surgeon and her assistant start arguing about swabs. Turned out they had lost a large swab somewhere inside me. So they put their hands back inside and starting rummaging through my abdomen, and then they started to remove parts of my intestine out onto the outside of my abdomen, I felt the wet and warmth of them on my skin as they moved them.

The pain was like having red hot coals being shovelled into my stomach and mixed around. I couldn't breathe, speak, think. It was awful.

 Worst thing was the surgeon was barking orders at her assistants telling them step by step what they should do so I knew exactly what was happening.

Primal animal mode kicks in I start lashin out at them, hitting their hands to ge them away from me and screeching but still couldn't actually get my words out coherently. At some point I black out in a panic and ripped the dividing sheet down. I come too and they are replacing the sheet and restraining me to put me to sleep. I wasn't even fully out before they started trying to intubate me which was also difficult, let me tell you now that shit is rough I am amazed they don't injure necks and Jaws.

 I am still having therapy 4 years later. Screwed me up for life.",1680307248.0

"CODWarzone","t5_2clyzt","I‚Äôve played controller and KBM on various games for 25 years. I still play both. 

I started WZ1 on controller. Upgraded my PC and switched to KBM. For WZ1, KBM is marginally better IMO, but barely. So if you can be equal in all other measures, I think KBM wins. But for some people, they just can‚Äôt be good at both so they gotta do them. 

For WZ2, there is no question, controller is superior. The aim assist in WZ2 is way more powerful than WZ1. If you disagree, I challenge you to go play 5 rounds of WZ2 to calibrate your mind, and go play 1 round of WZ1 immediately after. You will feel the difference in the pregame. 

True enlightenment is when you can adapt the input for the game. I play Fortnite KBM, I play WZ2 controller, etc.

Edit: I assuming a non-standard controller. I use an elite because I like it more than scuff, but the paddles make a difference.",1680307248.0
"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","I was having a dried out Cuban cigar once on the most peaceful evening I‚Äôd had so far in Kandahar. The sun had just set and the night was that just-past-dusk deep blue. With the heat of the day gone, the air was pleasant and dry, the sound of the bugs and occasional thumps of an AC-130 doing routine training a nice background to the rare day off.

Suddenly, a fire mission went out from a battery I had no idea was nearby, but seemed to be just over the T-wall from me. An LZ had to be cleared for some guys somewhere. The night sky lit up and the roar filled my chest as I leaned back in my chair and puffed that crispy Cohiba, watching the lights arc off into the darkness.

I legit assumed you thought I was a trump voter the way you came in all hot.  And because I brought up the dossier thing which you had a huge problem about.  My bad I was wrong.  ""Curious denial, honestly."" lmao 

I brought it up because it is relevant in that it happened in the same cycle and both received with campaign funds.  I was only giving context of similar events.  Though I have stopped holding my breath it would be hilarious to see Trump behind bars, but all I ask for is consistency.

We will not agree about HRC's problematic influence during that primary where she ""lent"" the DNC millions some believe without strings attached.  Where her very good friend and DNC chair went to work in her campaign after being forced out for her behavior.  **Which of these comments is the conspiracy?**  The way the rich and powerful behave in this country and push boundaries to get their way as is ingrained in our corporate culture, I am supposed to believe she did not behave exactly as people would expect she would when she had that much leverage given the money and key people in positions of that organization?

"soccer","t5_2qi58","At the end of last season we basically had a complete squad, and one that had been playing together for a long time. We had a lot of matches yes, but we had the quality and depth to play them. We lost key pieces over the summer and did not replace them adequately. You could see that because the performances to start the season were unbelievably bad, and results not much better.

And our injury crisis this winter was honestly much worse than last year. We had more players available, but far less quality to field. So yes, I think Tuchel's start to this season and then Potter's takeover afterwards were much, *much* more challenging than anything last season.

The idea that the sanctions were super impactful is kind of a joke, honestly. And money spent on players does not mean a good squad. In fact, a ton of money spent on players who are clearly not ready for the prem makes your job a *lot* harder.

IMO the only manager who stepped into a worse situation than Potter was Frank in the first season.",1680307249.0

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","A few questions that will give me a direction for advice:

#1) What does your social circle look like? 

About how many close friends do you have? 

How many acquaintances (people you could hang out with on a weekend via invite) do you have?

#2) What are your expectations in your partner? (Ask yourself this, don't need to answer here necessarily.)

a) Income and Lifestyle

How much do you roughly expect your partner to earn? What kind of lifestyle is the minimum for you to be satisfied? Are you requiring marriage?

b) Appearance and Fitness

How physically fit must they be? Height? Race?

c) Values and Beliefs about Relationships and Family

Do you want a traditional relationship? What are your views on faith and religion? Do you want a family? Are you willing to forgo work for a family?

d) Personality and Interests

What is the range of your humor? What are your hobbies and what do you expect your partner to participate in? Are you solitary or outgoing? 

#3) What do you feel like is currently standing in your way?

#4) How have your last few casual dates gone?

#5) Are you available to even date?

Hopefully asking yourself some of these questions opens up some ideas as to why you may not be having the level of success you want.

I know for many women, the frustration with dating seems to be that many men fall into one of two camps, socially competent men who only want sex, and weirdos and neither are paths towards the relationship one would want, so I can definitely empathize with the pain.",1680307250.0

So they are claiming that calling dolls creepy leads to physically banning doll collectors from events and causing emergency services calls.  I find this hard to believe and wondered if anyone had actually seen this happen.

Sounds a bit extreme to me and I can't imagine it happening but maybe not here in the US? Maybe somewhere else?  But this person also thought that calling a doll creepy meant that you were terrified of it.  They were calling people ""pathetic"" for calling dolls creepy and claimed it was hypocritical to call dolls creepy if you were a collector.  They were really upset about people calling dolls creepy.  I just followed up because I was curious what caused them to react so strongly.",1680307250.0

"SatisfactoryGame","t5_gs464","The train will take the shortest path *that is signaled for its direction.  ALSO, trains treat a station as added distance.*  This means it will avoid stations and go around them on a longer path if it is not stopping at that station.

If there are three rails, and none have a station, but the outside ones are one-way each in opposing directions, there is no purpose for the middle one.

Trains cannot pass one another except if there is a station involved where one stops there, and a path around the station looks shorter to another train.  

If you have a station on each of the outside paths (one-way, then the two-way path in the center can be used as a bypass, but of course you have to use path signals to determine which is going to go first.  I have to go AFK, but I'll try to draw a diagram later.",1680307250.0

>In a long-awaited reckoning on election misinformation, **the Department of Justice readily agreed that most of Mackey‚Äôs antics before the election were protected First Amendment speech**. He created memes of fake endorsements of then-candidate Donald Trump by celebrities like Lana del Ray, Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande, usually sporting ‚ÄúMAGA‚Äù hats. 

>**Prosecutors say, however, that Mackey crossed the line when he posted images encouraging Hillary Clinton voters, especially Black women, to ‚ÄúAvoid the line‚Äù of polling stations by texting the word ‚ÄúHillary‚Äù to a five-digit number.**

>Giving the fake promo a deceptive veneer of legalese, the fine print read: ‚ÄúMust be 18 or older to vote. One vote per person. Must be a legal citizen of the United States. Voting by text not available in Guam, Puerto Rico, Alaska or Hawaii. Paid for by Hillary For President 2016.‚Äù

"berlin","t5_2qt49","It's a molecule that's very close to the LSD molecule, but has a slight change in it. They're called analog drugs, or designer drugs, and they usually have a slightly different effect than the original drug. I believe that in Germany each analog is considered a new drug, and the government makes each one illegal as the labs develop them, but there's a bit of lag time. So the labs making these drugs have to constantly come up with new analogs to stay ahead of the law. 

I've never tried it myself because that's not my thing, but I live near one of the stores. It's been closed for a long time now with a paper sign in the window. I imagine it says that they're out of stock, which probably means the previously sold analog is now illegal and they're working to stock a new one. But that's just my best guess.

It's shitty that the don't refund customers who ordered one analog and then will possibly receive a different analog once they have it in stock. That should void the contract and they should refund immediately. Maybe there's a way to take this up with your bank if you didn't do a direct transfer.",1680307250

Interesting perspective. I was mainly talking about the general sentiment. We are still at bottom levels considering the ATH price. Also, I was curious and asked chat GBP for a definition of Bitcoin bull market.   
>  
>""A bull market in Bitcoin is generally characterized by a sustained period of rising prices and overall market optimism, where buyers outnumber sellers, and the demand for Bitcoin exceeds the supply. In other words, there is a positive sentiment in the market, and investors are confident about the future growth of Bitcoin.  
Bitcoin has experienced several bull markets in its history, with the most notable being the one that began in late 2020 and continued through the first quarter of 2021, during which the price of Bitcoin increased by more than 400%. During such periods, there is often increased media attention and hype around Bitcoin, as well as an influx of new investors seeking to profit from the rising prices.""",1680307251.0

**OnlyFans Models - Please read below:**

* **We are not saying you are not an OnlyFans Model.**  We are saying we didn't see an OnlyFans link as a comment under your post.
* **THIS POST IS NOT DELETED** it is just not viewable to the subreddit until an OnlyFans link is added.
* **DO NOT DELETE THIS POST** This post will be approved once you put an OnlyFans link as a comment.
* **We are asking you to put your link as a reply/comment.** So that we can approve this post.
* You can reply/comment your OnlyFans link on this post and **we will approve it.** 
* We will not go to your profile to verify you are a creator.
* **It must be an OnlyFans link under the post** URL redirectors or OnlyFans Trial Links are not recognized.
* Comments are not locked on this post, if you are seeing a message saying so, you are trying to reply to the AutoMod comment and not your post.
* If you are getting a message that says ""Please Wait"" before you can commment that is Reddit that is slowing down how often you post.  We cannot control this, all you can do is wait until Reddit will let you comment.  This is especially bad on the Reddit app for mobile, but again we can't fix Reddit's issues.  Try a PC, or post slower.

"metroidvania","t5_2tvxq","I think my quintessential MV moment is after you get into the castle in SOTN, and **‚ÄúDracula‚Äôs Castle‚Äù starts playing for the first time**. One of the most amazing songs in ANY game, the perfect song to pump you up.

Aside for that, here are some standout moments:

1. Playing Metroid Prime for the first time. I don‚Äôt think I have a single standout moment, but the entire experience is possibly my overall favorite playthrough of any game. I bought it around 2006, but didn‚Äôt end up playing it until 2014.
2. Reaching the City of Tears in Hollow Knight was great. It really sunk in how big the game was. Also really loved the Colosseum.
3. Environmental Station Alpha - beating the plant boss ‚ÄúOvergrowth‚Äù. I really struggled with it my first playthrough, but dying didn‚Äôt frustrate me. It was a fun boss to fight, and I always remember when I finally beat it.
4. Aeterna Noctis - just the whole first half of the game (up until the planet area). That first half is the best MV experience I‚Äôve had since Hollow Knight.
5. Axiom Verge - getting the drone. One of the coolest upgrades ever in a game. And upgrading it was maybe even cooler!
6. Super Metroid. I HATED it as a kid. I finally gave it a proper spin around 2014 and I will never forget it. It stands as my favorite game ever.
7. My first Super Metroid ROM hack - Hyper Metroid. It introduced me to a HUGE new world of hacks that would end up as some of my very favorite MV‚Äôs ever.
8. Oh, and can‚Äôt forget the first playthrough of Aria of Sorrow. To this day one of the greats! A standout moment is farming for the Curly soul. It must have taken 100 attempts, but felt AMAZING once I got it.",1680307253.0

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","Brit Commandos can still do the sneaky things like in CoH2, reliably win close range engagements,  but you can't use them as elite mainlines anymore (brenmandos). They have a snare, which is nice, but those are generally less impactful now.

SSF feel a bit underwhelming for their massive cost. They have less HP than rifles now that those got buffed, which should probably be adjusted. I've tested some common matchups to see how the Johnsons behave and in theory they are really good. They can comfortably beat upgraded jagers at all ranges for example, though they generally lose to assault grens and pgrens (wehr) at close range, as expected. But in practice I feel like their impact isn't that big. The reason for this I think is that they have kinda weak alpha/burst damage and no explosive grenades. That means they can win long engagements, but can't quickly kill stuff if the opponent refuses to take those. As a result they usually end up with fairly low kill count unless the opponent does stupid things like charging into them. The ability to switch between zooks and BAR-like LMGs is very good tho, the 5 second cooldown makes them very flexible. I understand why you have to pay the premium, since this ability is unprecedented, but still I'd like to see them a bit more lethal or durable.

Haven't tested pgrens much, but they seem to behave exactly the same as CoH2 pgrens. I like them personally and I think hacing 1 squad for flanking and pushing would be good in any build order, but the opportunity cost is high. 

Stosstruppen are just like obers. They can be used to punish squads out of cover just the same. If you are in the lead and the opponents is forced push into them, they do pay off. If you are losing, facing a lot of tanks, and forced to push, you're in for a bad time. Basically a ""win more"" unit.",1680307253.0

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 50 words.**

"gamedesign","t5_2qimq","You don't get your first job in the games industry because you are creative, but because you have actionable, technical skills that can contribute to game development.

There are plenty of posts on this subreddit about how ""idea people"" aren't a thing in game development, but the short version is that everyone on game dev teams has ideas.  Game dev teams are not short on creative people with creative ideas (and the large majority of those ideas never get used as teams are busy working on someone else's game).

Both jobs you listed, concept art and writing, are extremely niche roles (and generally considered more senior roles), so even if you are exceptionally skilled in those areas, you are going to have hard times finding this sort of work out of school as they are highly competitive/selective roles that require significant portfolios of work.

If you want to get into game development, start looking into the various roles on development teams, see if any appeal to you, and start working towards them. Look for educational paths that feed into roles that fit with your skills and interests.

If you want to hedge your educational/career bets, study programming. There is always a need for coders in game dev, and if/when you burn out and want to leave the industry, or never make it in to begin with (a very real possibility, there are countless game dev students with sizable student loans and no game dev careers to show for it) coding has the most laterally applicable skills to other industries and makes the most sense when taking educational costs/debt into account.

I appreciate this may be discouraging, and to a limited extent that is the point.

You are looking to enter a field that is *EXTREMELY* competitive to break into due to millions of people that have the same aspirations as you.  If you want it, you can get it, and you have a good runaway in front of you to get momentum to get there if you focus your educational efforts (both official and/or self-guided) going forward.  

Just please understand that game development isn't easy to get into or even stay in.  Don't confuse a love of consuming games with a love of making them.",1680307254.0

It's not because of coworkers or difficult students or parents... It's because of the administration and the school board. They don't back the teachers at all. They blame a child's poor performance on the teachers, but also kneecap the teachers any chance they can.

Last year, her school needed new laptops, as their current ones are Chromebooks from 2018. The board ultimately denied the $120,000 request as it was ""too costly.""

In the same meeting, they approved a $7.5 Million renovation on the HS football stadium, for a team that hasn't won more than 6 games in a single year since 2009. In totally unrelated news, three of the board members had sons in HS football or going to be in it the following year.

She had to look out her classroom window last spring at the field and bleachers being re-done, as her students had to share laptops because so many were broken. Oh, and the AC in her room was broken(since the year prior), so the windows had to be open so she had to listen to the heavy equipment all day.",1680307255.0

Hi, I'm the r/coins AutoMod.  

Looks like you're trying to **identify your coin**?

Check the [Frequent Coin List](https://docs.google.com/document/d/197f3Xk4In-vnfBQFzk_jhxE-1TS9AkiD55ymsoIQNns) first.  

If that doesn't help, we have some awesome tips in the FAQ.  Here's a link directly to the [""What Is This Coin?""](https://www.reddit.com/r/coins/wiki/faq#wiki_1._what_is_this_coin.3F) question in the FAQ.  

If I misunderstood your post and my comment isn't relevant, sorry!  I'm still learning.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

>‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ôº∏ What does this mean?

>‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

>‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","First off, I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through such a tough time. Breakups can be incredibly difficult, and it's natural to feel a whole range of emotions afterward. But I want you to know that there's hope, and it all starts with learning to love yourself.

I know you've been through a lot and it might feel like love has been sucked out of you, but I promise you that your capacity to love is still there, just waiting to be rediscovered. You mentioned that you've tried various things to rekindle your loving side, but maybe what you need most right now is to focus on yourself and your own well-being.

Learning to love yourself is a journey that takes time and effort. It's about discovering who you are, what you value, and what brings you joy. It's not something that happens overnight or that you can simply look for; it requires intentional effort and self-reflection.

Start by taking a break from the dating scene for a little while. Give yourself the space and time to heal and to rediscover your own identity outside of a romantic relationship. Focus on things that make you happy and fulfilled, whether that's hobbies, friendships, or personal growth.

When you start to feel more at peace with yourself and your life, you'll find that you're able to approach relationships with a newfound sense of clarity and self-assurance. You'll no longer be seeking validation and love from others, but rather, you'll be able to offer those things to yourself and, in turn, to others.

Remember, there is no perfect person out there, but there are people who will be a great match for you once you've built a solid foundation of self-love and self-awareness. Your capacity to love is not gone, and you won't be stone cold forever. It's just taking a break while you focus on the most important person in your life: you.

You've got this. Keep going, and trust that you're on the right path to discovering your own joy and self-love. Once you find that, I truly believe that amazing connections and joys will follow.",1680307258.0

"flexibility","t5_2t7mg","When stretching your hamstrings, you can bend your knees to help with hinging from the hips. It's better to have a slight knee bend and good form than lock your knees for the perfect straight leg stretch. 

I also have ADHD and really struggle with regular, self initiated exercise. I've found paid classes at a predetermined place is my best strategy to have a regular routine. Otherwise i have the best intentions but struggle following through. 

I currently do rollerskating once a week ($18 for an hour class) and its been great for my brain. The music and atmosphere is great, and its really easy to ignore how hard I'm working my muscles in the drills. I found its also helped my flexibility more than my yoga classes did. Yoga helped a lot with body awareness and stability, but the active stretching of skate means i have been able to touch my toes for the first time in my life. 

The first three to four classes for skate is the hardest, there are a tonne of tiny muscles and movements involved in balance, and it made me so sore. There's also quite a bit of cost in getting the appropriate safety gear, which is needed the most when you're newest.",1680307258.0

"Madden","t5_2rjpr","depends on the skill and how much you as owner like them. I resigned my 30yr old LE Janarus Robinson to 3yr 14.4 mil deal and he turns 31 in the season. reason I resigned him was his low ovrl his is still 76 ovrl so (cheaper deal) but he played 6seasons for me. I resigned him after my first year( fantasy draft) I gave him and Joseph ossai both 5 yr/ 22mil contracts as they were low overall and ossai is now 28  but he's wanting a deal that is in the 40mil range so I let him walk. robinson has put up double digit sacks for me since his sophmore year and he has over 100 career sacks so I'm attached to him for his massive production but only 1 pro bowl due to not being enough spaces for  my LE on pro bowl roster. but Robinson had years  of 18.5 sacks, 24.5 sacks. 22 sacks, 18 sacks 14 sacks as a rookie then I think another 9 sacks as a sopmore.  so his ability to constantly win of the RRE spot I put him at exclusively he's just a beast for me. I'm going to resign my 28 yo  FS 99overall SS Javon Holland to a 5yr deal because even tho his 7yr 92mill deal is now on his last yr, I grew attached to him as a leader of my team before they got really good. so I'd plan out every year smart if your resigning older guys to big deals.  I just traded my 94 overall 24yo RT who's a star and coming off his 3rd probowl in 4 years. I picked up his 5th year option which was a no Brainer at 12mil but I have  to give my 99 overall qb and my 99 overall FS and my 87 overall LG that all need new contracts, so you gotta trade some great guys in order to keep a certain teammate group together. even tho he's the second best rated RT he doesn't want to be with my franchise. I never over pay and I only keep guys who WANT to be here have a green bar or max green bar. I usually will sign certain requirements that the players motivations are before resigning them so don't be afraid to pick up a vet mentor a 2mil for 1yr just to get the deal done then cut them after so you can keep that 2 mil üíØbut I'll say after I see a sharp decline In there on the field play that's when I look to cut a vet and get younger but if they still goin strong into their 33yo season. ill give them a 3yr deal to keep the possibility of them becoming a mentor for my younger draft guys",1680307259

Even if you disregard 2020/21 and consider 2021/2022, being it was the last season he was here before he got shipped off on loan, Nelson himself was either injured or on loan for the most part, Saka was starting on the right, and Pepe was the depth option on that side of attack. He wasn‚Äôt considered on the left, meaning he was never competing with someone like Martinelli or Aubameyang. Willian was no longer at the club. And even when willian and Nelson were here, I recall Pepe playing a lot of football for Arsenal, almost entirely on the right wing. Ultimately, it was his inability to provide effective cover for and to compete with Saka that got him loaned out.

"Cornell","t5_2r0sd","This is my mockup of what a campus-specific bus system would look like. Unlike most other campuses, Cornell doesn‚Äôt really have its own bus system. Cornell relies on TCAT which has benefits such as broad coverage but downsides such as not being great for trips that only occur within campus. 

Some benefits of intra-campus bus routes:

* Fewer delays, shorter routes mean fewer cascading delays. An issue downtown won‚Äôt affect service on campus and vice-versa.
* Faster service. Everyone scanning their card at the front door costs time. A bus system, isolated to campus, can board from the front and back door (all door boarding).
* Frequency. The short routes plus loops are designed so that buses come as frequently as every 5 minutes. 
* Better ridership distribution. TCAT buses get packed on campus sometimes. Dedicated campus routes alleviate crowding on TCAT. Again, this means faster trips for both the Cornell community and people traveling in Ithaca. 

This isn't perfect and I'm sure there are downsides. Feel free to share thoughts. What kinds of changes would you like to see for bus service on campus?",1680307260.0

*Edit since they blocked me after their last reply (BTW, everything I quoted was their original comment):*

>Did what? They didn't do anything. They just took out the brig. 

They finally removed the brig after 4 years of it doing nothing. To me that says ""we don't want a situation where 1 player can brig another"".

>Just because you don't agree or see it from a different view doesn't mean that they couldn't have or that it couldn't have potentially been a good addition to the game. Especially for solo slooper captains doing open crew. 

No matter how they implemented it, it still creates the problem where one person can ruin the session for the other simply for being captain.

*Edit for the continued editing of their comment:*

Kinda funny that you have so much to say now that you've removed my ability to respond.

How was I not civil? I pointed out that Sloops had their brig removed and explained why they shouldn't have done what you think they should have done.

"worldwarzthegame","t5_kffr0","It's probably for the best that I'm not sure how to reproduce this, but if you're curious, here's the outline:

* Started Rome 3 as solo HR with Unshakeable and Deep Pockets
* Picked up a Flamethrower off the ground with 203 ammo
* Swapped with a bot's RPG
* Spammed Big Earner (If you haven't heard already, this part's an established quirk where the heavy ammo earned isn't set properly when you transfer a bot's heavy to yourself. This means that Big Earner gives 20% carried ammo back based on the original 203 capacity of the Flamethrower, even though I switched to an RPG. Any ammo earned before is also carried over.)
* Up to this point, the RPG's capacity remained at 2.
* After the fixer joined, the first instinctive 'R' press gave it a reload of +2 RPGs.
* Thereafter I could still load more one-by-one. I didn't have time to identify a limit in this match.
* One more thing I encountered later: While I had the rocket launcher unequipped for some time, it did a bulk reload of all my carried ammo into the pipe. Maybe this has something to do with Corporate Power Nap.
   * I tested that as a solo maxed Fixer and it did **not** work, but that was the previous version of the game. Perhaps the heavy reloading only works on other teammates. I'm not sure at this point.",1680307262.0

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Can't verify if it's true but it is something I've heard: aren't there studies that show that people with a license/gun are more likely to suffer gun accidents rather than those without guns/licenses?

Also, if you're going down the route of using pepper spray for home defense, you should know this stuff? If someone breaks in, slip on a gas mask and spray in a wide arc, I doubt most robbers or murderers are expecting to be hit with pepper spray.

Also, doesn't pepper spray also target the eyes? A mask to hide your identity is good and all, but you still need eye holes to see, ergo, getting sprayed in the face will blind you and allow the victim to get away, I don't see how this contradicts OP's point.

As a final note, I just don't see how a potentially faulty gun, in the hands of an inexperienced, shoddy marksman, is better off than an easy to use can of pepper spray which is effective against most types of criminals in most cases.

You'd be more likely to shoot your own spouse than the robber, and the after effects are much more severe.",1680307264.0

Just letting yourself relax and indulge in your feelings by your lonesome.  Get it all out.  In time you'll find yourself at peace and feeling much better.

Although it may just work specifically well for me due to my ADHD.  Having that secondary background noise makes thinking much easier.

Music in general helps for me.  Having something to do both mentally and physically completely balances everything out. 

It's what got me into enjoying music so much more and learning more about it.  Perhaps one day I may be able to make my own tunes.  We shall see.

It's also interesting to be able to visualize music.  I don't mean like visualize a story or some physical circumstance around the track.  Like visualizing the vibe itself.  The sort of thing you can't describe but you understand if you understand.

The natural ability to hyper fixate on small details helps a lot to.  To be able to lock in the vibe and appreciate everything about the track.  Mix that with good headphones and every song is an adventure.",1680307266.0

What I mean is - generally, not just in reply to your comment - that now it's a case of treating the game as though scoring is to beat a boss on a level. You understand one effective tactic and repeat that exact tactic until you wear them down. It's boring. 

There is far too much of that in this FIFA. I play the game because I love football and I like to try and work my way through teams, not just spam runs and through balls.

I'm not a bad player. I was Elite div in Rivals every season last year and got 16 wins twice - usually getting 14. This year its just a monotony. I stopped playing for a couple of months just before TOTY. It's just boring and anti-football.

I've had to start playing 5 at the back sometimes (which I hate) just so I can double up on pricks running to the byline non-stop with Jairzinho. What's the point in playing like that?

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Yeah. You are told they exist as props, and the reveal is that there's only four real people. I'm not sure how there could even be much confusion about this, because Monika's entire motivation revolves around the fact that she lives in a tiny fake prison that doesn't have much to it, and the other three aren't even aware how tiny it is, since they can't see what they aren't supposed to based on their role. She doesn't have to delete anyone else, because there is no one else. She deletes the three, accidentally breaks some stuff, and is left with an empty room. And when she talks about doing this there is never any indication of there being anyone else. She just talks about deleting the other club members. 

This is also reflected in the scenes you can have outside the school. Where despite everything there isn't really any indication that anyone else exists. You and sayori don't seem to have actual parents, and so you walk into her house with no indication anyone else is there who you are saying hi to. Because the only things that ""actually exist"" are the things necessary for any given scene. This is indirectly alluded to later when Monika complains there's no piano, despite the evidence of her playing piano. Because she isn't actually playing the music on an actual piano.",1680307267.0

This holds a punishment up to:

e. Maximum punishment.
(1) Design. Dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 2 years.
(2) Neglect. Bad-conduct discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and confinement for 1 year.
 
Usually just an NJP if the unit is that upset. 99%+ is prob gonna be neglect and end up in paperwork or asschewing, or both. Dr Peckerworker might get it a little harder due to the nature of the missed movement. Or he might rub it out with SATO and no one will ever know.

I‚Äôm a freshman (15F), and my friends consist of a group of 4 other freshman (all 14), who I‚Äôll call S, J, I, and C. Now ‚ÄúC‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äù are boys who are very careless. They hang with random older guys (around 17- 20ish) and are very sneaky with where they go. Although they are good friends inside of school, it‚Äôs hard to trust them when they ask to hang out because I have no idea of what will happen to me if I‚Äôm with them. Now on the other hand, ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúJ‚Äù are girls who are a little more cautious with who they‚Äôre with, but they have no problem following the boys around which also makes it hard to trust them because they are just as careless sometimes. So ‚ÄúS‚Äù invited me to hangout Saturday, and I gently told her no because of the same reasons I stated above. She respected my decision and I‚Äôm glad they don‚Äôt pressure me, but I still feel a little guilty because I know I was wanted there, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to feel completely safe with them - especially when I‚Äôm the only one who actually acknowledges these kinds of dangers. I know that we‚Äôre kids and they won‚Äôt be worried about the things I worry about, and that‚Äôs what makes me feel guilty.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I hope readers realize what is the position that u/BogMod is defending here. It is some version of *epistemic relativism*. If the sufficiency of the evidence is significantly subjective -- or cannot be sorted out objectively due to the lack of criteria --, then we cannot know that anyone is really right or wrong about practically anything -- it is all just personal opinion.

To give you an example, while the Jan. 6 committee may judge that the evidence that ""Trump asked rally crowd to break the law"" is sufficient, other equally competent observers may simply conclude that it is not sufficient, and *there is no way to decide who is right*. So, both of their beliefs are equally (un)justified.

Now take this and apply to all other violations of the law, science, history, and practically every other belief you can think of.

It is a very dangerous position because any claim (even racist claims) can be considered rational and justified because at least some people will conclude the evidence supporting those claims is sufficient -- and you can't claim otherwise because this assessment is significantly  subjective/relative.

If u/BogMod thinks I'm misrepresenting his position, I would ask him to provide some clarification.",1680307268.0

"OnePiecePowerScaling","t5_34km3c","Lmao you sound kinda stupid with what you said im sorry. First of all, this is a fiction, and yes titles in this series is also important however, in a work of fiction, even oda has to show feats and portray things as evidence that the title are what he meant it was. Mihawk, never defeated shanks at their prime. He stopped fighting shanks when shanks lost his arm more than a decade ago from the current timeline. That time mihawk was not the WSS nor was shanks a yonko. So what does it take to become the WSS? How do one swordsman acquire a title if that someone never defeated every single top swordsmen out there because one thing is for sure, he never defeated shanks lmao. So is it an assumed title? Or a title branded by the government? You see how stupid your logic is? All of this needs to be proven by the author to show us the audience that the title you guys are so obsessed off is legit. Im not doubting the title and that mihawk is the greatest swordsman rn however, saying he is stronger than shanks overall is stupid because he never defeated any known top tier opponents in OP. Him and vista even met eqch other for the first time lmao. Mihawk never defeated vista in the past nor in marineford and yet the title of WSS was given to him lmao. Oda never portrayed mihawk as someone who can overwhelm yonko commanders, Oda portrayed shanks to be able to clash with yonkos and split the sky. Oda loves hyping his characters, he does it for a reason. He could have made mihawk one shot vista, a named and strong character, to portray that he is that guy. But instead oda made mihawk look like a joke against vista. So for you to say that ‚Äúhe didnt want to anger wb‚Äù is soo stupid and just copium. He attacked WB to test his strength lmao, and now you‚Äôre telling me he didnt want to anger the strongest man lmao. If mihawk really was bored, that was his best chance to make things interesting. Anger the strongest man alive so that strongest man will come at him so he could test his abilities but no, he aint like that. He even walked away when shanks came lmao. All these excuses that he is the WSS but when given an opportunity to show off, all mihawk did was run away making him look like a fraud.

As for kaido, when kaido was given the title of strongest creature, the narrator said ‚Äúin 1v1 nobody can beat him‚Äù and nobody could kill the guy to the point he wanted to commit suicide. When we first saw him there‚Äôs a feat, he mopped all of the worst gen, and he one shot first commander level luffy. We‚Äôve seen mihawk so many times, in marineford his performance is ass. Even ben beckman looked a lot stronger when he pulled up. Portrayal and feats are very important in fictional like these, titles are just tool to hype, but you need evidence to support it. Otherwise buggy would have been a real deal üòÇ",1680307269.0

E.g. when they have a 10% stronger ability but give it a chance to fail, or it picks one of three random abilities but they aren't any better than a normal ability of that type.

If this is genuinely a 90s buff on a 90s cooldown that is \*incredibly\* over the curve already. There's randomness, but they all do the same thing to various degrees, and not three different effects which you may not want. And all three effects are extremely significant, there's honestly not really a 'fail' chance.

At worst, it limits what you want to have him fighting, but even then it's still significantly better than most every other defensive buff in the game simply because of the massive duration.",1680307269.0

It's a feature that is supposedly there to help prevent burn in with static images, but frankly, it sucks. They only just fixed it with the 3 series after being called out by the likes of HDTVTest for removing the option from the service menu entirely on those new sets. No one knows if they are going to push updates to older sets, but I'd say its 50:50. 

Given the age of your TV though, I would look up the process and do it. You should be out of the official warranty period anyway, so no worries there. If I still had my E8, I would have done it by now as well.",1680307270.0

They turned out to be things I purchased but hadn't named. Regardless, I realized that a guest could easily plant a camera, or other device on my wifi and I'd never notice. It totally freaked me out.

Hello /u/BaxterTribe,

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1284lyx/no_marriage_for_cheating_woman_f31_or_how_to/) was removed for the following reason(s):

1. include details about the involved parties including ages, genders, and length of relationship, and

2. request advice in real situations involving two or more people

The ages and genders can go anywhere in your title, but have to be in one of the following formats:

`44M` `35 F` `23-NB` or `M44` `F 35` `NB-23`

The automod rule can process the genders M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, and MTF but more can be added.

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

"dizqueTV","t5_2zkqnl","I‚Äôve been breaking them up back into their individual segments. Pretty easy with free tools available for Linux. Not at home at the moment so I can‚Äôt tell you which - mkvsomething possibly. 

I‚Äôm creating folders of different types of small videos:
 
- commercials
- promos (‚Äúcoming soon on ABC‚Ä¶ Three‚Äôs company‚Äù)
- station identification (‚Äúyou‚Äôre watching PBS‚Äù)
- public service announcements
- trailers
- cartoons
- shorts

The commercials have file name tags that include the approximate year in them so I can limit commercials to their correct period. Station identification likewise has the network in them so I only use correct ones. 

This is all groundwork for recreating a week of tv exactly as it was back in time. I‚Äôm currently working on the week around Oct 7, 1978, because new tv shows always started after summer and when school‚Äôs back in, and it‚Äôs not a holiday.  1978 is peak broadcast era stuff. And it‚Äôs before the avalanche of cable tv so there‚Äôs only a dozen TV stations to recreate. 

There are some parts of the day that are difficult to find - the news for the day doesn‚Äôt exist but I‚Äôve put together important news segments from around that time that get merged into a single video file so that the viewer at least can see what was topical. Sports events are limited to whatever I can find of that sport from that month and year. Some tv movies don‚Äôt seem to be available so I swap in similar ones. Morning kid‚Äôs shows are challenging because they‚Äôre often just intros followed by a few cartoons or video shorts, but I can usually create similar enough ones. 

Interestingly, there‚Äôs less than a dozen Wonderful World of Disney shows out there because they were really just 3 minute intros done by Walt, followed by an hour tv movie. Funny I didn‚Äôt really notice or remember that.  The movies themselves are available but the intro and outro for them wouldn‚Äôt likely exist. 

A day‚Äôs programming back then usually didn‚Äôt start until 6 am or later, and finished around 1am. So there‚Äôs several hours of nothing. That shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, but the quandary I‚Äôm facing at the moment with putting all this together is with clock time. 

A big part of what I‚Äôm trying to recreate is both the passivity of the viewer, and the ‚Äúfamiliarity of regularity‚Äù (for lack of a better term).

Watching TV back then meant turning on the TV and watching whatever was on. The only choice you had was what channel to watch and when to watch. Compared with today‚Äôs active ability to pick and choose, pause, skip ahead, and jump to something else completely random, it‚Äôs fun to experience this lack of control over what to watch. 

Right now on my dizqueTV Bewitched is about half way through; some boring soap in droning on over on ABC, a Three‚Äôs Company repeat is over on the local channel and some wildlife show from the 60s is on PBS.  And the rest are movies, talk shows, or community tv. 

So my choices are limited and I‚Äôm finding great enjoyment in that. It forces me to watch something I may not have bothered to watch (‚Äúlet‚Äôs see if I still hate Three‚Äôs Company 45 years later.  Oh wait, yep.‚Äù), and I get the additional little kick from the 70s commercials and maybe a coyote/roadrunner short at the end of it. (Commercials etc only play at the end of a program which I‚Äôm happy to accept.) Then if I don‚Äôt touch anything, Happy Days just starts playing and I lazily just settle in to watch it, which I almost certainly wouldn‚Äôt have thought to watch using plex the normal modern way. 

No decisions, no being overwhelmed by choice. Fun. 

And the ‚Äúfamiliarity of regularity‚Äù is knowing that if I try watching dizqueTV and it‚Äôs 9 am on a Saturday, I‚Äôm going to get only cartoons or sports. If it‚Äôs 7:45 on a Friday, I‚Äôm going to get one of those ‚ÄúFriday Night At The Movies‚Äù or ‚ÄúNBC Mystery Movie‚Äù  movies like Macmillan and Wife or Columbo or McCloud. That‚Äôs already started of course. 

So this fairly fixed schedule gives a predictability that‚Äôs also nice to recapture. But there‚Äôs a problem with that. 

If I adhere to having disqueTV stick to the correct time slots for each show and channel, then it significantly reduced the ability for anyone to watch the breadth of programming that‚Äôs available. They may only get a chance to watch dizqueTV on the weekend, and so miss out on what‚Äôs playing Wednesday afternoon. 

But if I allow dizqueTV to cycle the programming 24x7, then the familiarity of regularity is lost. 

And that‚Äôs a quandary.",1680307270.0

>As for you claiming Barca‚Äôs domestic success was due to Negreira despite there being 0 evidence of any wrongdoing and claiming they struggled in Europe

I didn't say it was due to that, I said it was due to lack of depth, the Negreira case is just an additional layer that could affect it. Barca has been remarkable unsuccessful despite spending far more money than Real Madrid in the 2010's.

After Pep's Barca they only managed 1 CL in the past decade despite having Messi, Suarez and Neymar. They had several embarrassing exits like the Roma comeback, the Liverpool comeback and the Bayern 8-2.

>Why don‚Äôt you count the number of UCLs this century and tell me who has the next most after Real Madrid?

She did contribute to women‚Äôs rights, which is a pure win. Unfortunately it‚Äôs like the DNA guy (not Crick, the racist one) contributing majorly to science but being awful otherwise. 

Thanks for your nice response to my rant, I‚Äôm sorry for going off on you, just thought people should know the rest of her story.

Edit: just a note, if you do try to research her, you‚Äôll mostly find partisan sources (on both sides) with pretty dubious scholarship. It‚Äôs so politicized you almost have to go to primary sources only.

See, when you get irked by the notion of someone explaining D&D to you, and then you say a paladin and a barb are as far apart in role and function as a chef and a doctor, you paint the whole argument into a corner. That sets us both up for unnecessary conflict.

Nothing about that Path of the Zealot//Oath of Vengenance build fails to make narrative or mechanical sense. When they both run up and sanction someone with a two-handed weapon, the classes are not doing two incompatible jobs. But if you find something inherently self-defeating there, by all means elaborate.

If the goal is to get two subclasses, then you go 3/3. If getting ASI's ASAP matter, and it does, go 4/4. From there you'll eventually land at the Extra Attack impasse.

When they pay ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES wages that allow them to thrive.

When they provide ALL OF THEIR EMPLOYEES with generous parental leave.

I also was never allowed to be angry as a kid, and pushed it all down as an adult, so once I opened that door I could not shut it. Didn‚Äôt want to shut it. I was feeling EVERYTHING for the first time in my life and it was scary and also amazing.  
As long as you are safe and have a safe place to do it, be ANGRY. My favorite spots were in my vehicle, and in the shower. I also took up (rage/cry) walking (though I avoided screaming outside so as to not scare the neighbors). After my year (or so) being angry, it started to get better. The rages, the crying, the screaming episodes slowed down. Now I still have them on occasion, but they are so much less violent because it‚Äôs not supported by decades of pent up rage and unfelt feelings.   
My friend says ‚ÄúYou be there if you need to be. You be there and you FEEL it. Your feelings are valid. But don‚Äôt live there baby. You feel it as long as you need, but eventually you need to move on.‚Äù

He has to quit compiling all the time and whining to refs. he has to quit the acting and sulking when running back up the floor. He has to not focus on that and needs to focus on becoming a better defender himself and committed to the game vs. showboating.

As far as his teammates are concerned. Yeah, I think a good center like someone like Ayton would be a good fit for them. Clint Capela, Poeltl, Mitchell Robinson come to mind as I don't think they need the center to be star, but fill a role like you stated. 

I also do not believe Kyrie is a good fit on the Mavericks and honestly I would not want him on my team in general. I would let him walk in free agency and try to get a center like you stated and examples I gave and pair Luka and that center with Christian Wood. I would then look to add 3 and D wings and yes back up point guard. I know they can't get him by I think a guard like Dejounte Murray or even Deangelo Russell would the ideal fit next to Luka that can play a combo guard role and run the PG and SG off the ball.",1680307275.0

"MagicArena","t5_3nbzd","In addition to what I already mentioned regarding drafting, a word of warning: You'll find that the progression (or Economy people refer to it) is not designed for people to jump into Explorer and expect to be able to build multiple decks.

Consider that a typical explorer deck requires between 20-30 rares (if you include the lands) and that if you were to purchase 100 packs, you would get about 17 rare wildcards. So you essentially need to open 100-150 packs to build a deck, minus the rares you already have. If you're just opening packs, you'll run out of wildcards after half building a couple of decks and then you'll find the rate of wild card adcquisition painfully slow or exhorbitantly expensive if you want to use cash. 

Because of this, its better to branch out to other formats, mainly standard, while you build a robust collection.

I'm a decent drafter (about 55%-60% win rate) and I do about 10 drafts per month. This gets me around 120 rares from drafting and another 120 packs from prizes and free rewards from the mastery set and ladder climbing.  Over the last couple of years I've been drafting and completing the rares for each set. Thanks to that, I've been able to build all the tier 1 decks for pioneer and many of the tier 2 and 3 decks (I have almost 15 decks now), but it didn't happen all of a sudden. 

I think the best way to enjoy Arena is to grow your collection set by set through drafting and mostly playing in the Standard format, and accepting that you'll only be able to build one or two explorer decks at first but that you'll be able to build more as you collect each newly released set and get more wildcards.",1680307276.0

Denmark is so confident in himself he can not see what would happen if he loses and never wants to look week in front of Norway his best friend. The Nordic meeting episode where they trick Iceland into coming to a meeting that is really a birthday present of his. Iceland never wants to celebrate his birthday due to he is not a kid anymore. The episode where Iceland gets a DNA test and finds out he is Norway's big brother then Norway torcher's him by making him say big brother. BIG BROTHER!!! STOP IT!!! BIG BROTHER!!! So funny. Then I really love Bon Son Valentino, yes I am a Gertalia fan there just so cute together. I also love Hetalia of the dead. Poor Italy just wants to enjoy horror movies with his friends. Poor Italy tried to enjoy horror movies with his friends and ended up peeing his pants because he was so scares. Poor guy. Also the smile Germany gives Italy when he passes out asleep after being so scared is just  Hidekaz begging us to see a cute Gertalia moment and its adorable.

"massage","t5_2qmyc","Unless the men are doing uncomfortable things or acting weird (your gut will know) erections are common. The body is being stimulated so its a natural response. Now, because you are so young 100% some guys will that as an opportunity to take advantage. You just have to establish those boundaries immediately, stay professional, and wear professional scrubs or even a uniform. Sometimes gym attire will attract the wrong attention. It just happens...
I also will flip the client over to a prone position if they have an erection because half of the time they are also embarrassed. Just tell them it's a natural reaction and just to relax. You're not judging them, don't not say anything. That's the worst response and will make them self conscious. 

Make sure your male clients know you're a massage THERAPIST and NOT a masseuse cause then you're entering shady territory and creeper ville. Educate them on what you do and be assertive and direct about it. It's all about boundaries.",1680307276.0

Before that, 

1. Report the car to the police as many times as needed

2. Report the rude security guy to building management. I mean. he had one job, if i told you how many times the security guard at my building came up to me just to tell me i forgot the lights in my car id spend a week typing. 
Thankfully, mine was kind and went above and beyond, yours is not doing the bare minimum.

3.If the building is managed by a developer, report building management to them along with the security. 

4. If the units have individual landlords, call them, tell them the situation. If they say they can't do anything demand a reduction in rent because of this inconvenience. The parking spot is part of the rent.

But it's also unreasonable of her to expect that you leave your wife alone in her grief.

Charge right into the lane. Smash into the best offensive player on D while going for the ball, come what may. Limited DEFENSIVE moves. So make no mistake about it. Nurse knows what he's doing. He knows EMBIID will get injured by stepping on the triple teams feet. He knows his schemes are limited and this is how he can BE DOWN BY 20 AT HALF. He knows people will pass when he drives, think twice on their drives, etc. He will only be stopped by a stronger coach and/or fearless coach like Kerr, Budenholzer, GLENN RIVERS, etc. Or by an obviously more skilled coach with equal Type A like Mazulla. He didn't intend to injure, but he certainly intends to show you that he doesn't care if you get hurt when he rumbles into you. At least that's how I used to coach But that was streetball.

So I have close friends and maybe fake friends (that I‚Äôm  kind of starting to notice)

Everytime I post something (like links to my singing covers, etc.), none of them supports me at all. But they do for each other. I support them, but nowadays I wonder why I don‚Äôt get the same energy back from them. (My singing isn‚Äôt that bad and isn‚Äôt that good, but it‚Äôs at least decent for me personally. You can check out my channel ‚ÄúLizziese‚Äù on youtube.) 

I did confront them once and told them how I really felt about it, but none of them say anything back to me. They just ignore me. This has been ongoing since mid 2021.

Not to mention‚Ä¶but, most of them really like to outcast me for no reason back in high school (except my best friend of course). One even invited my best friend to hang out right in front of me, but didn‚Äôt bother asking me if I wanted to join (and I was also friends with that person btw).

All I ever wanted from them was just to show me they care or at least acknowledge a bit about my existence. But I guess they never did.  

I‚Äôm just going to find new ones in university. If I can.",1680307279.0

"DirtyWritingPrompts","t5_312kw","Elves? Demons? Angels? All those, and more, I always assumed were nothing more than myths. But today, I met one of those mythical creatures. 

A fairy, of all things. You wouldn't assume fairies would be immortal, but this fairy girl is. 

And apparently, she's horny as heck. 

""I've finally found you! My beloved! I knew you'd reincarnate sooner or later, but I never knew you'd be THIS big! Or a human."" She hugs my manhood ""I'm so happy! I'll finally be able to reunite with you; it's been WAY too long since you've satisfied me! There's just the problem of *size.*""

I'm now worried. Is she planning on shrinking my tin soldier?

She looks me in the eyes. ""As your soulmate, I can read your mind. I would never shrink Mister Tall! I couldn't get filled that way. Instead...""

She grows from a mere six inches tall up to my own size. What the heck? Ah, screw it; as long as she's this horny, I don't really care. Plus, at my size, those wings of hers are just **so** hot! Also, since she's a fairy, she's not exactly wearing underwear. I can see everything except for her holes and nipples. I don't think I've ever been more turned on. 

""Yes, there's my beloved! You'll remember everything in just a moment, I promise! She pushes me on my bed and mounts me. In a second, she has her wet hole on my soldier. A second later, her hole has swallowed it. 

Then, an unusual thing happens. From our connection, I feel a strange energy flowing into me. It flows inward from my manhood, towards my mind. However, it also seems... familiar. 

Finally, it reaches my thoughts; and, I remember. My mouth opens for the first time since she appeared. ""Minkati! I remember you now! Ah! Ah! I rememberrrrrrrrrrrrrr!""

Unfortunately, the rush of energy causes not only a surge of memories from my previous life; it also makes me climax prematurely. We both fall sideways in a huff.",1680307279.0

Please be aware that [**ducks make terrible housepets.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/duck/wiki/careguide#wiki_1.2._ducks_make_terrible_housepets)

Ducks are farm animals and should be kept outdoors like other farm animals. Here are a few points to take into consideration:  

1. Ducks are highly social and thrive in large flocks. You cannot keep a large flock in your house. 
Because of this, pet ducks are often raised alone. This is terrible for their welfare and results in a shortened lifespan due to stress.  
2. Ducks need to live outdoors so they can exercise and forage for bugs and grit.   
3. Ducks cover everything in liquid poop and cannot be toilet trained.  

For further info about duck care, please read our [complete guide](http://reddit.com/r/duck/wiki/careguide).

"NISTControls","t5_3j0gs","Recommend you stay the course in learning more, browse the cmmc subreddit, watch videos from Jacob Horn (Summit 7), Ryan Bonner (DefCert) and others on YouTube to educate yourself better so you then be more informed when engaging with multiple consultants for quotes (never stick to one quote), the goal would be to weed out snake oil.

You should always ask for the following when engaging with a consultant: a details statement of work, defined deliverables (ask for examples to look at), and whatever else you think will give you strategy and recommendations that are actionable. Pay attention to their experience if they are exclusive to having a business and experience around CMMC or have dealt with less than say 20 clients it‚Äôs likely they won‚Äôt be best for you, make note of the number of clients they have supported (ask for customer references) and their experience with dealing with organizations that look like similar to you (your size, tech stack/infrastructure, the business you in whether your organization sells products and/or services and how they are provided to your DoD clients).

Unfortunately with CMMC being more hyped it has turned into a bit of a Wild West in the private sector and there is a ton of snake oil and over priced service providers with non productive deliverables being given

So instead of spending 1 point on a mastery (since you were already getting the armour / evasion nodes anyway...) now you spend 4-8 points pathing to a mana wheel and getting a completely dead stat for 99% of all builds?

Sign me up for this buff train! These buffs are sizzling hot! I love spending more points to get useless stats just to fit the defensive auras the game is balanced around! So cool!

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","If you don‚Äôt have a diploma it will be harder for you to get a job. If you can‚Äôt get a job, it makes it harder for you to earn money and most likely makes you dependent on this guy to support you. You absolutely *do not* want to be dependent on someone else because they can mistreat you and you will again feel like you have to stay with them because you don‚Äôt feel like you have another choice to leave and get money for yourself. 

Education provides more options and freedom for your future self. You‚Äôre talking maybe 12 months total (2 months as a junior and 10 months as a senior) left of high school. In the grand scheme of life that is such a tiny amount of time. Do yourself a huge favor and get that diploma. You will feel proud of yourself when you get it and will be able to use that to get jobs. 

Also, I personally would be *very* concerned if someone wanted to get me pregnant at such a young age‚Ä¶you still have a lot of living to do and while babies can be rewarding, they‚Äôre a TON of work. You will have very little time for yourself and babies do not make relationships stronger. If anything, they can stress out couples because of lack of sleep and time. You should only have a baby when you and your partner are both ready. If he is trying to convince you, it definitely raises red flags in my mind that he wants you to be dependent on him because he thinks you won‚Äôt leave him. But that puts you in a really bad spot. If he loves you, he won‚Äôt pressure you to have a baby or drop out of school. He will want you to have your education and have a baby later, after you‚Äôre prepared and ready.",1680307283.0

Some rats can be dicks and be mean to an unwell rat but chances are they‚Äôre just gonna welcome him back and be chill about it.

We haven‚Äôt had many surgeries in our group but I‚Äôve always put them back right after and it was fine. Just watch them for a while to see if it‚Äôs ok I‚Äôd say. Or if you‚Äôre unsure separate for 2-3 days and then put him back when the wound has closed a bit.",1680307284.0

In a purely random chemical reaction you would always get a mixture of Ls and Ds. However, biological systems are very specific. The molecules have to fit into the enzymes.

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","Although I like the idea, the whole point of resin is to limit progression so I don't ever see Hoyo adding this. Knowing this fanbase, a lot of people would find it annoying. A few days ago I saw people complaining about handguard farming because apparently it was too grindy. 

I also think the amount of progression we currently have is fine but there is definitely an issue where combat feels like lacks meaning outside of resin usage and the abyss. And it would be nice if we had more of an incentive to explore. The direction of the concept was nice imo but I don't think it should be tied to resin or maybe even progression at all.",1680307285.0

Yes there is a way we could all be safer.  Just today FLOUR was recalled due to Salmonella contamination.  If we irradiated our foods then meat would be safe raw for a certain period after irradiation though obviously not indefinitely just as nothing is.  If fruits and vegetables were irradiated they'd last for weeks longer as the bacteria fungi parasites and, to a lesser extent, viruses would be killed and thus reduce decay.  But especially Americans are too afraid of the word ""radiation"" it isn't marketable so it isn't done.  I'm sure the nut jobs will now come out in droves.

"researchchemicals","t5_2rhqm","Nose Burning üî•.  Honestly, Imma keep it üíØ.  The 2MAP is a great alternative for Opioid heads looking for potent yet a decent synthetic replication of H. 

It's fantastic because there is NO worries of  Fent or fetty 
analogs in it as well as that nightmare Tranq crap. I believe it's called Xylazine. 

Of all the types of drugs they could have used to cut the the fent and in turn, give it ""more legs,""or attempting to elongate the effects of the already super powerful  Fentynal. Now u have a Zombie drug. Cudda just used one the many RC Benzos out there to do wut they were setting out to with maybe still risky but less horrific results.

ANYWAY 2MAP to me is almost exactly like regular 
H. The only difference being that for the first couple lines I snort (which I have always done even back in H days.)
I don't have the veins  for shooting up. 

But BURNS your nose like crazy, you will tear up and definitely  need  a time out before the next fix. Afterwards it easys up on there a bit  because its a powerful  pain killer used to treat end-of-life cancer patients in China (Brand name is Bucinnazine). 

But Yea to me it's worth the very unpleasant burn typically will go away or dull within the first half hour to full hour if use. I'm typically just a  two gram of 2MAP type a guy once a month to two months as not fall back into full fledged addiction back in my 20s. 

TL;DR :  2MAP  a no joke real deal synthetic alternative to          
                Fentynal and H which today since 2015 has been 
               also basically Fent. BUT GOT DAMN THAT SHIT 
                BURN ur nose like crazy when first snort those 
                first few lines. Street opioids today are just to 
                dangerous.",1680307286.0

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Drop D is simply tuning your low E down a full step while leaving the rest of your strings tuned Standard. Once you're in Drop D, from this point on, every half step down the drop tunings is tuning ALL of your strings a half step down.

So to go from Drop D to Drop C#, you would tune all of your strings down a half step. Drop C# to Drop C, same thing. Drop C to Drop B, same thing. Drop B to Drop A#... you guessed it.

If you happen to have a drop pedal (I have the Digitech DROP Pedal, which I highly recommend if you can spare the expense), you could tune your guitar from Standard to Drop D. Then you pop on the pedal and every turn of the knob is the next step down in drop tuning. Straightforward concept once you get the hang of it.

EDIT to say a drop pedal also works for standard tuned guitar. It's just taking whatever physical base tuning of your guitar and lowering it however many steps. You could drop DADGAD or John Mayer's ""Neon"" tuning if you wanted to.",1680307286.0

I have a gen 2 mcr with a lynx match lower with 1500-2000 rounds thru it and it has been nothing but reliable for me. So far I only have 100 rds thru the keltec. So I can't speak on reliability of one over the other. The keltec is much much lighter so if that's a factor I'd say keltec. I live on a farm so my thoughts for the keltec is to keep it handy as a truck/tractor gun and maybe take it out on hikes when I want something light to carry around. The mcr to me is more of a ""range"" gun for doing drills/ 3 gun stuff.",1680307286.0

"politics","t5_2cneq","That's only part of the story.  The insurrection was never the plan - it was a last ditch effort to stop the certification because Pence refused to play along with the plan.

The plan was for false electors for multiple states to file to certify that Trump had won their state (which they did) and then for Pence to use this as a pretext to declare those state votes in dispute and disregard them so neither candidate had enough electoral college votes to win.  Then the president would be voted on by the states with each state having one vote.  Because Republicans control more states, they would win that vote and install Trump as president.

Pence refused to play ball so the purpose of the insurrection was to either get rid of him and proceed with Grassley, or at least prevent the certification from proceeding. 

For his part, Grassley somehow got the wrong end of the stick and thought Pence was not going to show up at all:

*He suggested Pence was not expected to attend but Grassley‚Äôs staff later said that was a ‚Äúmisinterpretation‚Äù and that Pence was expected to be there.*

https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/2021/01/05/grassley-suggests-he-may-preside-over-senate-debate-on-electoral-college-votes/ 

Pence not only showed up and refused to play ball, he also refused to leave when the SS tried to evacuate him.  If he'd left, that would have allowed Trump to call off his mob so the vote could proceed with Grassley in Pence's place.

The part I bolded is not necessarily a fact.  It's just your opinion, and a good defense attorney might be able to shoot it full of holes (pun intended).  Just because bad guy got shot and fell over, that doesn't mean the threat is over.  He could be reaching for a weapon.  He could be trying to get up and re-engage his attack.

"exvegans","t5_109235","Leaving veganism was very much like leaving religion for me. It was scary, confusing, isolating and a very painful divorce from a deeply ingrained belief system. 

Start with byproducts. Start small. If you drink coffee or tea, use a half dairy/ half plant based milk and then just sit with your emotions after the fact. Make a homemade soup and add a meat broth in, sit with your emotions. Liquids are easy to incorporate because it‚Äôs just flavour. There‚Äôs no texture or chewing and it‚Äôs blended in well with other flavours. 

Then start adding sauces in sandwiches that may be dairy based or salad dressings with cheeses in it. As you work through your emotions about changing your lifestyle you can keep slowly challenging yourself into the next steps. Sample foods that are unfamiliar. Don‚Äôt even ask what‚Äôs in them until you‚Äôve tried it. Desensitizing the emotional landscape at your pace is what worked for me. I‚Äôd try something and then back off a bit and then try something else. I was back and forth on incorporating animal products over a few months until I was ready to start eating meat. Be prepared to face conflict if your social group is mainly vegan based, I lost all my friends when I stopped my vegan lifestyle but I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve ever really missed them after the fact, it was the only thing we had in common. 

It‚Äôs okay to go slow on it but it‚Äôs also important to challenge yourself and be thoughtful about where your beliefs stem from. My ex husband is vegan and we have a 14 year old who has never eaten meat we share custody of. It‚Äôs always an option for him and I try to be respectful of his desire not to but I also worry about his well-being long term. I think if he were to voice an interest in trying new things in his diet this is the layout I‚Äôd go with. Broths/liquids/ sauces or garnishes (like bacon bits). Slow and steady if it‚Äôs having a big emotional toll. 

I will say, that when I did finally decide just to fully drop veganism my mental health drastically improved almost overnight. I wish I had done it with so much less trepidation because now I could never imagine living the way I did. Good luck!",1680307288.0

Part of me wonders if somebody really smart is creating ""very obvious"" bots as cover for their ""moderately clever"" bots. 

I only bother checking if the comment sticks out like a sore thumb, so usually when the bots get unlucky. 

So it's entirely ***possible*** that sometimes they're pretty good at hiding, but we never notice.

**Edit:** 

The first agree-bot I called out on this account was almost 4 months ago, which I believe is before the current wave of popularity for GPT or whatever.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I was pretty shaken up, but I rode to the bottom of the run and yelled at my buddy who was chilling in the lodge. Boarding in deep powder on difficult runs should always be done with a buddy for this exact reason. 

I was pretty traumatized from it. It made me scared to live life for years. Then I went the other way. Started doing triple digits on crotch rockets and going way too fast in cars on public roads (with nobody around or in extremely light traffic). I got really addicted to going fast, but I could still get a form of adrenaline dump that replaced snowboarding. I still feel super comfortable speeding in vehicles because I feel like I have control. A good contrast would be riding horses. I hate it and won't do it, because I've seen horses buck people off because they've gotten spooked by a floppy hat that I was wearing.

Often it's the same with genji/muradin getting hit mid air by things like butcher lamb or Deckard root.

I feel like there should have been a special status for these kinds of abilities.  Maybe not full invulnerable like maiev but at least immune to non-targeted abilities or something.",1680307290

"custommagic","t5_2sbcz","What power level are you targeting for this cube? These seem like they'd supercharge even a powered cube. Depending on the deck / environment, one of these fully on color might even be better than an off-color Mox.

Even increasing the cost by 1 it would still speed up almost any format, even powered cube. Without knowing anything of your cube, I think adding one hybrid mana pip for loose color requirements or one generic pip if you want none would be a safer place to start.

If the format is much slower than you'd like, it might require tweaking a larger number of cards by a smaller degree. If this cycle is significantly more powerful above the rest of the cube, it could just lead to blowouts for whoever gets them. I don't know your specific cube & plans for it but it could be that by throwing in [Ravnica Signets](https://scryfall.com/search?as=grid&order=name&q=signet+%28game%3Apaper%29+block%3Arav), [Coldsteel Heart](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/301/coldsteel-heart), [Prismatic Lens](https://scryfall.com/card/tsr/272/prismatic-lens) type ramp + increasing overall cost efficiency & buffing aggressive strategies, you could tweak it to the speed you want.",1680307291.0

For people who've already bought into it, it's obviously much harder, but that's why it's also important to give them no ammo, no fuel for the fire, no letting them say ""you're more hateful than us"". Just put the motives and the past transgressions of their leaders on clear, public display and give them all the proof they need to see they're being taken advantage of by people who don't care about them.

You can try to whitewash it all you want. I've directly witnessed enough war crimes and the fallout of legal investigation after the fact to know one when I see one. I'm not arguing that taking out the soldiers that are in the fight isn't permissible, just that using explosives directly upon a clearly severely wounded soldier in the hopes of killing everyone gathered around him isn't. It's not rocket science, using a wounded man as bait to set up an attack is not permitted and was actively decried when the Taliban did it. Why is it okay for Ukraine to do it but not the Taliban?

Thank you for your post! Make sure it follows the following rules. Failure to comply to one rule once will get your post removed. Twice (or two rules) will get you a permaban.

* Rule 1: Your post should contain a photo or video of a comparison. No, your hand or leg does not count.

* Rule 2: Do not share pics of others without their approval

* Rule 3: Do not beg for upvotes or ask for them in any way. This is a rule across reddit actually.

* Rule 4: If you only want to ask people to compare to you, there is a daily stickied post for this on the subreddit. So just go to the [home page of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cockcompare/), and find it and post there.


Now that all of this is done, consider going to [my Pornhub page where I (woman and cuckqueen) share all of my videos for free](https://www.pornhub.com/users/homemadehornygirl)

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I played all ACs up to Odyssey last year, even the DS and PSP games & AC Chronicles. 

My Top 5 are

1. AC II - Top tier story + music and massive improvements in gameplay over the first one.
2. AC: Black Flag - Story is not bad, but gameplay is top notch and music / shanties are incredible. Loved the setting as well.
3. AC: Brotherhood - Improved most things from ACII but story is not as good.
4. AC III - I love Connor/Haytham and the new gamplay mechanics introduced. Music by Lorne Balfe is incredible as well, my second most favourite AC Soundtrack after AC II.
5. AC: Origins - I loved Bayek and Aya and the story is great. The RPG mechanics were good as well and they did not go overboard with side-quests and collectibles. The best setting in AC history for me, Ancient Egypt was great.

I live half a mile from the Robinson Integration Resource project (in the GMNP) that opened 10k acres to logging, and the devastation has been shocking. It's angered a lot of folks around here. 

Mature and old growth forests are only renewable if you allow them to be--the US Forest Service does not. Less than 5% of US forest cover are over a century old and dwindling. The science behind the significance of old forests to carbon sequestration is well established, to say nothing of their benefits to wildlife and recreational users. Although timber extraction has been practiced in national forests since their founding (owing to the ideology of Gifford Pinchot) that was not its raison d'etre. They exist to serve the public interest and presently the need to conserve as much pristine wilderness and sequester carbon serves a higher purpose than logging.",1680307295.0

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","So crazy, I came to look at your posts for an item your wife made you on ‚Äúvisible mending‚Äù and I find you are from Spgfld!  I live near Mountain View/Eminence. I lived in Spgfld for 20 years and actually went to James River, until I knew an old man who had so faithfully tithed to them (in cash) and spread the gospel, inviting everyone he met to come there, who swallowed his pride and asked them for help with food after he managed to cut all of his fingers off on one hand and could no longer support him and his wife. They turned him down after looking at his tithing record!!!  That was years ago and it just knocked the wind out of me with them. I‚Äôm not dogging them, because I think a lot of good comes out of there, but that was disheartening. 

Now‚Ä¶onto the subject at hand. It made me really sad to see how many people were responding in a mocking manner. I believe in supernatural healing (I went to church with a boy who was arm braces & shoes attached to a board crippled & he was healed instantly at our children‚Äôs church camp service one evening‚Ä¶he was running around the tabernacle shouting for joy‚Ä¶it still touches my heart today) and I‚Äôve seen it once‚Ä¶41 YEARS AGO. So, she may have been healed, but it‚Äôs just the kind of thing Satan uses as an opportunity to outright mock God. This was irresponsible leadership. I haven‚Äôt heard other Christian‚Äôs talking about it much, but I‚Äôm two hours away.",1680307296.0

The new card is an UHS-II card but your camera is hosting UHS-I interface. Thus card will run in UHS-I compatibility mode. Which is slower. You will get UHS-II speeds only in UHS-II compatible devices. If your cardreader supports it it may be able to read at advertised speed.  


Bad news don't stop there. Unfortunately all Digic 4 cams (like your 550D) with SDcard slot share the same limitations:   
\- Maximum transfer speed is limited to 25 MByte/s  
\- There is no overclocking available for Digic 4   
\- There is no compression feature for Digic 4  
Frankly: Running 1080p in raw/MLV continuously is out of the question. Even with 10 bit bitdepth option. Calculation:  
Required write transfer speed = horizontal pixel count x vertical pixel count x bit depth x frame rate / 8   
1920x1080x10x24/8 = 62,208,000 Byte/s = 59,33 MByte/s

\- lou is the boss of mr p (and gale)?  tick is caoptain to darryl?  bonnie adoptive father to stu?  jessie mother to pam?  

\- bibi and crow aren't in love with eachother

\- ""actually, sporuts pronouns are it/it"" - ü§ì

\- gus isn't related to buster

\- why are arcade trio labelled specifically as friends?  they don't even have any official artworks together to prove they are friends.

 Monitor traffic for clients via splunk, including JVMs, routing IDs, and logs. We work with databases, SQL, and Linux, and occasionally make changes to data in the CLOB XML. We also decrypt and encrypt client IDs in the database, disable users from the database, and bounce servers (JVMs) and clusters. Additionally, we accept changes from development teams into our database and deploy artifacts in Jenkins, although we do not build them. Also update and renew certificates.

( the difference of getting a asst off dive and kicks and a floor general making the offense flow). and honestly it kills the mood when he goes on his tantrums. maybe not for his teammates but maybe? 

im not saying this is his fault as hes clearly the best player and has the most impact on wins on that team. but that's the difference between super stars and all timers. they win games. either by elevating their team or elevating himself and will games. in a league where damn near 2/3 of nba teams make the playoffs/ins. its pretty bad look if your considered the best player or contending best player in the league and the one of the faces of the league. 

as much flake trae young gets. and how much ppl write him off because to small no defense. dudes in the playins with a wrose team and having the most uncharacteristic horrible start to the season iv ever seen coming off a historic year. one thing i always like to mention in the luka trae debate ( i know there is none to most ppl) but trae and luka arnt the same pnr player. trae is a pass first pg ppl dont know this. luka is score first. the way they run their offenses are different.

I visited a willing victim's base, asked him to build 3 chests, wooden and iron, and I was able to destroy and loot the item (1 fur) inside. 

I could also damage his building. Also repair.

Likely what happened is someone visited my base, destroyed the chests, since only they were missing, and then when I switched Tree Bases, the items that dropped from my chest didn't carry over to new base and stayed in the tree they were looted at. So when I saw my new base, I didn't see the chest drops from the broken chests.

It's POSSIBLE that this isn't the 100% reason, and it was a glitch, bug, or something else. But given this recent testing, it just soared to the top of my suspect list.",1680307298.0

"guitarpickups","t5_36akc","Don't get high-output pickups if versatility is your goal.

First of all, get a $30 Tube Screamer clone pedal (like a Joyo/Harley Benton Vintage Overdrive) for whenever you want to push your amp. 80% of all tones ever were just that: a TS into a Marshall.

Then, if you're still not pleased with your pickups, get some dirt-cheap vintage-voiced Alnico 5 pickups, like:

* Fleor or Donlis from AliExpress/Amazon
* Warman
* Dragonfire True Texas (for the single coils) and covered Guardian (for the humbucker)
* Tonerider City Limits (for the single coils) and Alnico IV Classic (for the humbucker)
* IronGear Texas Loco (for the single coils) and Blues Engine (for the humbucker)

You want the single coils to be slightly overwound, around 6-6.5 KOhm (similar to Tex-Mex/CS Texas Specials), and the humbucker to be around 8-8.5 KOhm. A covered humbucker has smoother highs than an uncovered one. That's why vintage-style HSS guitars usually come with a covered humbucker. Also, Strat-type bodies have less mids than Les Paul-types, that's why an Alnico 4 humbucker with more mids is usually more suited than an Alnico 5 (which has a more pronounced V-shaped frequency response).

But. 
My fellow twin mom sold me her brand new still in the box Evenflo max gold car seats for a huge discount so my stroller Option I chose with Evenflo Pivot expand. Mostly because it attaches to the carseats I already have (all you have to do is buy the stroller and an extra toddler seat, which my husbands Grandma did as a shower gift). 

My friend recommended it bc it's light weight, it's easy to maneuver (she let me test hers) and it will fit easily in the back of my Kia soul. 
She also sold me her wego carrier, which I will use for the first little bit.
I also put the twingo carrier on my registry and my boss got it for me. (I like this bc You can always buy an extra strap if the other parent, friend or family wants to carry a baby for you)

As for a bassinet I chose the Simmons twin bassinet, which I got off Facebook marketplace for like $60 (to save money) and I got two Ikea cribs in perfect condition on Facebook marketplace as well. (For about $200 for both)

I chose a double bassinet because we have a small house and it just works for us better that way.

"cancer","t5_2qixx","You probably heard from the medical team to go straight to ER when you get a fever. That's because that would be the only sign of infection you have during the cycle.

Epi and ifos will tank your WBC hardcore. Your maturing WBC are all gone at the start of the chemo. Thus, your old mature WBC will decline steadily and would be the lowest around 10-14 days from the start of the chemo. That would make your body most vulnerable to infection (scatches, viral, bacterial, etc) around those days.

I try to avoid eating out during those days, especially uncooked stuff. 

I don't know how your workplace is, but maybe asking your co-workers to wash their hands often as well could decrease the chance of infection. Using gloves can help, but you will have to put on a new pair of gloves often to prevent cross-contamination from one surface to another. 

&#x200B;

ps. I don't know how you are working during chemo especially ifos. I'm on my 5th ifos and the brain fog and not being in the 'mood' to talk is huge for the first week. I was also on a different anthracycline last year, but that wasn't as bad for me.

Pero tambi√©n dice que no tiene la confianza de decirte lo que opina, tal vez no le gustan tus reacciones a ciertas cosas por que ""ya sabe como te pones "", o tal vez es muy amable o tal vez es muy insegura as√≠ que observala y trata de entender sus razones. Tal vez le miente a todos o tal vez lo hace mas contigo en ciertas circunstancias. 

Observa primero si es indecisa e insegura, y de ahi comienza a tomar decisiones. Porque si le falta amor propio y asertividad entonces los reproches le van a incentivar a mentir mas. 

Te digo esto porque si me pongo en lugar de ella entonces a mi definitivamente no me gustar√≠a que me dijeran que pierden la confianza en mi cuando decido cambiar de opinion o por que ni se como decirle algo a mi pareja sin recibir una amonestaci√≥n.

He pasado por lo que te pasa y te prometo que la mejor soluci√≥n es darle un ambiente donde la aceptas por lo que ella es sin la mascara de la mentira, las mujeres inseguras acaban as√≠ porque los hombres en general han fallado fundamentalmente en darles un sentido de protecci√≥n.",1680307301.0

"politics","t5_2cneq","DeSantis is of the same ideology as Trump, who rants about Marxists and communism. Communism is stateless and classless, which hasn‚Äôt been achieved. By that definition (and ignoring the red scare propaganda), how is he a communist? Communists want the working class to democratically own and manage their workplace while fascists want to privatize everything, give control to corporations, and establish an ethnostate. None of those are comparable to communism and it‚Äôs disingenuous to do as such in a moment when coincidentally workers are asking for better conditions and fascism is propped up as the next thing because corporations are afraid of a threat to the power they hold in this country. Politicians all across the aisle (especially Republicans) would rather distract people by blaming immigrants for taking their jobs, a shooter that happened to be trans now meaning that being trans is a ‚Äúthreat‚Äù to society, colluding with corporations which allows for all these train derailments instead of actually offering solutions; 

like, 
- understanding how corporations use all individuals in desperate economic conditions (regardless of identity) as the buffer for the service industry and retail jobs where productivity has gained but wages have remained stagnant,
- the fact that shootings have nothing to do with the type of person, but the mental health of all Americans in general and impoverished conditions that have led to a lack of access to adequate healthcare and the lack of regulations that prohibit gun ownership by those unsuitable while ensuring that the 2nd amendment isn‚Äôt restricted,
- regulations against corporations have been either rolled back or stagnated from becoming law due to the corporation influence of money in politics and the fact that workers like the railroad strikers tried to warn people about the lack of regulations in this industry",1680307302.0

"politics","t5_2cneq","One thing to remember about Trotsky was he also participated in brutal oppression. Some like to portray him as an almost savior of communism, but he was still a part of the totalitarian soviet experiment. Totalitarians and autorcracies cannot bring about an egalitarian future that draws so many to socialism. Democratic socialism is the only way forward my friend. For socialism to work, we must democratically overpower capitalist opposition and coexist. As much as their misguided system has hurt the world, without a diversity of thought socialism will be used by power-hungry tyrants",1680307302.0

So, set aside one evening just to focus on him (don‚Äôt do him first if that means you won‚Äôt get to you a different night) and things that feel good. The point is that the goal is not intercourse and that should not be an option that night, but finding various erogenous zones and how different pressure, touch, stimulation affects each of these areas. You learn about each other and about yourselves-something we tend to move past quickly in relationships and may not get back to.

"montreal","t5_2qnmr","That's neat, but what I think u/llcoolbeansII meant is that you can report the phone number marked as the sender of the text message as a spammer. I understand the content of the text is a code.

I'm just saying that it is only somewhat useful to mark a number as spam given that there is no system to verify that the sender of the text really is who they claim to be.

Current phone systems have no mechanism to track the source. There is a field, and operators just do basic checks such as is the number valid? 1-111-1111 would be rejected

When I configured my voice over IP service, at first my call were being rejected by some operators because I didn't know I needed to configure that field so my calls/texts appeared to come from BLANK. Realistically, I could put any valid number in there and nobody would be able to tell.

EDIT: I guess the takeaway is, if it really was a legitimate Desjardins client who put your number for 2fa by accident and you blocked Desjardins' number, then the texts will be discarded. You're also blocking a legitimate business, which is not an issue if you have no business with them, but if you forget and you open an account with them, you may not be able to set up 2fa with them until you remember.",1680307304.0

Plus, if there is a problem with the new part or it does not fit right getting it exchanged or returned would be a headache.

  Incidentally, you mentioned insurance- if there is an insurance company involved they generally specify the exact brand, part number, and supplier in the collision estimate for the shop doing the repair.    A collision shop working from an insurance claim estimate is not going to let you bring parts you get yourself.

-They were not useless or heavily weakened by water or oil. Did you pay attention during the fight? Hobin used the water against Taehoon to be more advantageous but he still almost lost and got his ass rocked. Seongjun literally beat the shit out of Yoo Hobin so fucking easily with no difficulty.

-Yeonwoo was oneshot by a Judo Throw coming from Baek Seongjun who scales above Seong Taehoon who also scales above Yeonwoo who then scales above every Weak Hero character.

-Shattering a dudes finger isn't a wall level feat and ain't that impressive. Yoo Hobin has casually broken bones of his opponents before and that was pre training. Also Humin was only compared to a sledgehammer he outright wasn't stated to be equal to one and also a sledgehammer isn't even wall level 

-So like I said before the best Humin feats you got weren't even wall level so Juwon brushing Humins throw ain't that impressive to compare against HTF characters 

-That never happened. Infact the opposite did. Mangi was literally back kicked in the testicles and still almost killed Yoo Hobin.

-It also takes way more Weak Hero character punches to take down HtF characters who have tanked wall level punches, wall level throws and literal metal bats and shit. Baek Seongjun even tanks like 5 stab wounds.

-Their durability isn't greater at all unlike HtF who has fought against opponents way stronger.",1680307305.0

This may have been appropriate when you were a teenager, but this generation is different. The fact that he was trying to come inside after tells me he was fine doing this, had he known it was expected of him.
And then you SCARED an actual CHILD into leaving, and never even spoke to your daughter about it. You could have had him come inside and spoken to them both about the respect of a relationship and toward each other, but instead you used your stature to insinuate a threat to him, I‚Äôm assuming since you made your height vs his clear in the post. 
You went inside and instead of explaining to your daughter your viewpoint and your expectations, you told her to ask him after you had already literally threatened him over something that he was already trying to rectify. Of course he called you a ‚Äúfucking lunatic‚Äù and it sounds like scaring the ‚Äúshit out of me(him)‚Äù was your goal.

Chakotay was in good enough health to have been made Captain of the USS Protostar a few years before _Prodigy_, so it's unlikely he's mentally debilitated.  It looks like _Prodigy's_ second season will see Janeway and the kids rescuing Chakotay and bringing him back to the normal timeline as well, so probably not deceased either.

You may be thinking of Tuvok, who _would_ have ended up mentally debilitated if Voyager hadn't made it back to the alpha quadrant when they did.  He had a disorder that required a mindmeld to cure, but none of the vulcans on Voyager were compatible.",1680307306.0

This is a goal that would be reasonable to work up to after several years in the business, and even then it may not pan out.

You *CANNOT* have an outdoor show without first submitting detailed plans to the FAA that follow their guidelines, and even then they can ask you to modify your show plan or deny it entirely. You have to do this every time you do an outdoor show where the beams are not terminated OR they travel across an area which is large enough in which to perform a helicopter emergency landing.

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","OP, why wouldn‚Äôt people buy at ‚Äúthese levels‚Äù and what‚Äôre the actual implications of this ‚Äúlevel?‚Äù 

Can people time the market? No. People can get lucky, but the literature on forecasts maintains they‚Äôre, reductively put, worthless. 

Is a 5% fed funds rate so high as to preclude businesses from making money or growing? Inflation too - does that stop business? They‚Äôre far from insignificant, but lot of businesses will still make a lot of money for equity holders!

Yes, higher rates and inflation compress (immediate) valuations, broadly. Yes, you can generally expect both forces to have negative effects on business profitability and, accordingly, indexes (e.g., the S&P). 

If you can only make money in the most accommodative conditions then you shouldn‚Äôt try. If you invest on macro theses, you‚Äôre market timing - you can try that, but you shouldn‚Äôt. How can I know that? I‚Äôm just parroting researchers - public info, not tough to find. Just read one of Jeremy Siegels books, that should be sufficient. 

1) Money is being made. Expect that trend to continue. 
2) Macro forecasts, yours as much as any large institution, are worthless. 
3) Short term market moves cannot be explained, absent a clear, material event (Google to find out why). 

The market went up. You were pessimistic. Other people made money. As they say, be greedy when others are fearful. I was greedy - it‚Äôs easy to be greedy after reading things like this. 

I‚Äôm not trying to knock you by the way. My greed won‚Äôt always work out! I‚Äôm trying to help, because your approach won‚Äôt.",1680307308.0

I usually talk about two or three degrees of separation in Adventism--on a global basis.  I'm continually surprised at how I am connected to other people because of Adventism--particularly since I don't really have much extended family to speak of.",1680307308.0

At the moment the oceans are lowering and will continue to do so for about ~1600 years as they enter an ice age. Than for the last 350+ years as the ice melts waters will rise rapidly even beyond the levels they were before hand.

Their towns tend to be a mixture of wet and dry areas, either building dykes like the dutch or canals to spread out and widen the flow of rivers.  
Their biggest city is actually built in a huge lake just beyond the equator.

---
Once the ice melts they'll welcome the more warmer waters near the poles which they'll explore, while some coastal areas will become flooded into islands.  
Since they stick to coastal areas or lakes I would also like one or two inland areas to flood into an inland sea. Being merfolk they'll mostly live in and around the waters and explore the land areas over time.",1680307308.0

"gatewaytapes","t5_3pymti","Yeah that's crazy (not literally). I've never woken from a dream ever thinking it is even close to reality, and I'm sure neither has anyone, so what you experienced wasn't that.

I'm with you on this. I've, for a while, landed at thinking that consciousness is likely fundamental.

I'm also down with the idea of it all being a shared projection of mind. I think it's possible that many things that we all share in common about how the world around us is, is immutable, simply because each of us are assuming that immutability at the same time.

We all believe with utter conviction that gravity is a constant, that physics work in a certain way, that fire is hot etc etc, so much of that stuff won't change, no matter how hard you try, even within the concept that we are the creaters of all of it collectively.

But on an individual level things are changeable. Your reality and how your life plays out can, and is, projected from your mind within the constraints of the consensus reality that is playing out.

And I tend to think that maybe we are not only all creating the shared reality around us, but also inextricably linked (perhaps we're all the same ""thing""), which could explain how the reality you create, comes to you at the hands of others, at least partly.

We're not conscious players in each other's game, but we are players in each other's game. Hence, no real coincidences exist.

I've often wondered if this also accounts for how people report different things, such as with UFO sightings. Or why paranormal activity can be experienced by some and not others.

Is this their individual manufacture of their reality, working within the confines of the consensus manufactured reality?

Who knows.

To your point, all we really know is that we're conscious. But even further than that, all we can really say 100% for certain, is that there is ""something"" that exists... there is not ""nothing"".

Anyway, just my thoughts. Not trying to convince anyone. Also, if I seem to be saying something is definitely the way I've said it, like it's fact, I'm not. Just my use of language and my thoughts on it, it may be none of us ever get to know the truth, or even close to it.

"Chiraqology","t5_3k1kj","Where does he say that? I can't find any evidence of him saying that. He said he moved to romania so women cant tell the police someone raped them without any evidence. And let's get this straight, I'm not a Tate fan. I just don't take sides based off assumptions.

To me, it sounds like that's just what everyone translated it to because everyone believes guilty until proven innocent. And people saying he's a sex trafficker because he coerced women into doing camera work is not sex trafficking, but rather scamming. He's not forcing you to have sex, he simply tells you the benefits and see if you're naive and dumb enough to follow his advice. If he's truly a sex trafficker, then he would be in prison for a long time.

Sex trafficking does not equal to scamming. I think these people forget that these women become cam girls just from simple conversation. In my opinion, if that's all it takes for you to be a camgirl is someone telling you how great it'll be, then you were already destined to be one.

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","> But a specific like actual compressor settings is weird.

Is it, really? It's a very old thing in any case. Take the 1176 snare trick: attack to max, release to min, ratio to 1:4. Gets a specific sound which it turns out quite a few people liked and dates from the 80s if not earlier.

The only thing that doesn't make sense is sticking to the the threshold and gain makeup (or input & output level) set in the preset.

Many famous hw compressors are essentially fixed one preset devices where you can only adjust the input and output gain (eg. LA2A and many guitar compressors), occasionally with an extra parameter (DBX160). The point is to improve workflow and not have to discover the good sounding settings yourself. There's value in being able to quickly check if a processor works for the sound you're aiming for without getting stuck adjusting a dozen or more controls (just see how many famous mixing engineers stuck with a few barely tweaked factory presets from famous reverb units).",1680307312.0

So I cannot use salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide personally because of that. But I find that my skin tolerates the Dial white antibacterial soap bar (it has Benzalkonium chloride 0.1%) just fine. 

Also I think a bar of soap wrapped in wax paper is much more environmentally friendly than a bottle of acne wash.

Sure, the world-class mathematician can probably solve some simple calculus question. Are their skills rusty? Probably. That's essentially the case for doctors, most of the time. 

It's more equivalent to saying the head chef rarely cleans the cooking equipment. Sure, it's easy from what I remember working in a restaurant. But the people closing shop daily are dozens of times faster at that than anybody else working in the restaurant, and the same is for this situation. 

Typically in a hospital, it's nurses that do the IV's and stuff. You don't waste a doctor's time on that stuff, especially when you need the doctor to do the overview of approving medication for like 12 different patients, and you have 4 nurses working on the floor who were hired for that exact purpose.

Also, you mentioned how you know how to stick an IV. Have you been doing this for a few years and know how sickle cell patients and certain fatter people are just such annoying hardsticks for IVs and locating veins? It's not always that easy, unfortunately.",1680307314.0
"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","They get more hate than they should for that. The main reason they chose to repurpose those chips in that way was to address the fact that basically no budget market existed and formerly ""budget"" cards were selling at 2x-3x MSRP, if not worse, which meant huge numbers of people were totally priced out of the market.

The 6500xt, if it were on pci 4.0, and if the IQ settings are chosen to acknowledge its shortcomings, was basically a 580 or a little better, if memory serves. We can drag them for it, but at least they made an effort to create a budget offering AND attempt to keep it at MSRP. It was actually kind of a chad move from AMD. There's no way they were making significant money selling that thing. They just had a bunch of chips that they had to find some purpose for, and that's what they landed on, and it happened to put an extra product on that market that was actually affordable for people who aren't rolling in money.

If the crazy market of the last few years didn't happen, the 6500xt and 6400 would never even have existed, at least not in the form that they did.

I'm more pissed about them for missing their RDNA3 performance targets so badly on the 7900xtx, because if they were actually able to compete well with the 4090 the entire stack would have pressure downwards, and nvidia wouldn't be able to get away with $1200 for the fucking 4080.

Until your account reaches those levels, you won't be able to post any threads. We don't disclose the minimum comment karma you'll require as spammers might find that information useful.
Until then, **you'll still be able to comment (but not post)** in /r/FemBoys. You can amass comment karma in this way, and by commenting in other subs on Reddit. Soon enough, you'll find that you'll be able to post in /r/FemBoys.
You can bypass the karma requirement by submitting [verification](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemBoys/wiki/verified).

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Thank you jo_lycxn for your submission! Unfortunately, your submission has been removed for the following reason(s):

Your post has been removed as it is in violation of Rule 2: Posts must ask for advice.

# 2. Posts must ask for advice.

^According ^to ^Oxford, ^""Advice"" ^is ^defined ^as ^""guidance ^or ^recommendations ^offered ^with ^regard ^to ^prudent ^future ^action"".

* ***Your post MUST have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on.*** 

Posts that are too short, vague, or lacking of important backstory may be removed. The more detail you give us, the better the advice is that we can give you. Help us help you.

* ***""Why does this person do/say this thing?"" is not advice. We are not mind readers, we do not know why the person is doing that thing.***

* ***Rant posts, and anything like ""I just need to vent / need someone to talk to"" belong in r/vent, r/rant, r/offmychest, r/needafriend, r/casualconversation.***

* ***No random, general, or hypothetical questions. For general questions and answers go to r/answers, r/askreddit, r/nostupidquestions.***

* ***No posts seeking advice or ideas on revenge***

* ***Update posts are only allowed if you are asking for additional advice. Plain old updates should be added as an edit to the original post.***

* ***No posts offering general unsolicited advice.*** 

This includes motivational quotes and inspirational stories. Again; your post ***MUST*** have a clear question on what you are seeking advice on. 

* ***No advertising, proselytizing or self promotion allowed in posts or comments.***

Any self-promotion whether obvious or not (like if you feign seeking criticism to subtly try to drive people to your site) will get you banned.

* ***No soliciting money***

You will be banned instantly if you ask for money, donations, or link to a gofundme, paypal, venmo, anything. Try r/Assistance or r/Borrow.

* ***No posts about critiquing appearance or looks.*** 

These would be more appropriate in subs like r/amiugly, r/rateme, and fashion advice subs like r/malefashionadvice and r/femalefashionadvice.

* ***No meta posts.*** 

For questions about reddit itself, or if you are new to reddit, see r/help, or r/NewToReddit. If you don't know where to post, try r/findareddit. If you are asking for help moderating or creating a subreddit, try r/modhelp. No posts asking how to get unbanned from another sub. If you have concerns about this subreddit, message the moderators. 

* ***No asking to be privately messaged.***

Keep the conversation in r/advice. Posts asking for private messages will be removed. **Do not accept advice from unsolicited messages**. These users are likely either banned from the sub for whatever reason or are giving advice that they know is bad and don't want to post where moderators can see it and remove it.

Please [review the rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/about/rules), and if you feel as though removal is excessive or in error, feel free to [contact the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Advice).

Your post has been removed as it was in Violation of Rule 8: No obvious reassurance seeking.

## Do *not* message us ***unless you have read the rules first***. We can tell if you haven't read them, and will ignore your message.

If you are *also* asking for advice in your post which also contains reassurance seeking, simply revise the post in accordance with this rule.

# 8. No obvious reassurance seeking

*This subreddit is for advice. NOT moral judgement, validation, or to affirm your opinions/feelings or settle arguments.*

***Reassurance seeking vs. Asking for Advice***

**""What should I do?""** is asking for advice.

**""What do you think about something I already did?""** is reassurance seeking.

r/Advice is for the former, not the latter. Your post must be worded in this nature. Do not message us asking how to word your post, we are not here to write your posts for you.

Other common reassurance seeking examples:

* ***AITA?*** 

There is a whole subreddit just for that! This subreddit is not an overflow or a backup for r/AmITheAsshole. Do not crosspost from there, nor include any of the AITA abbreviations anywhere in your post. 

* ***Am I a bad person/friend/partner/etc?***

* ***Am I overreacting / being unreasonable / in the wrong / allowed to be upset / justified in feeling this way?***

* ***Was this ok / should I have done this?*** 

* ***Will I be OK?***

* ***Should I be worried?***

And many more. This is not an all-inclusive list, as reassurance seeking takes countless forms. 

Tip: Remember, if you are asking about something that already happened, and it can be answered ""yes"" or ""no"", you are seeking reassurance, not advice!

If you don‚Äôt think Sam‚Äôs definition is most peoples definition of free will, why have human systems of justice long included torture, retribution, and the death penalty?

As an ex-religious person, free will for me had to have Sam‚Äôs definition. Having me as a holistic system ‚Äúcapable‚Äù of choosing was not the same as  free will.

There's nothing strange about what you say to me. It might be helpful to consider the reality that many men are not ""manly"" and many women aren't ""feminine"" and many people are trans and nonbinary, and they date and find lovers amongst cis people too.",1680307315.0

But it's not going to run out of money - either benefits will decrease, or we'll give it more funding.

&#x200B;

The ""Social Security fund"" doesn't exist. The money people pay into SS goes into the Treasury as just another line item, which then pays out benefits from the total pool of money it has available.

Once you've started yearly payments, good luck ever trying to stop them. Meanwhile, each new black child born, what about them? Don't they get payments? Do their mothers get the payments? If a woman has a child a year, does she get yearly payments for them?

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Two main take aways here. First off, there are bacteria everywhere. EVERYWHERE. Anything left sitting out will have bacteria on it within a minute. And if that thing is a good breeding ground, the bacteria will grow and spread. That said, the USDA guidelines are VERY conservative. They err way on the side of caution. Most of the regulations and recommendations you hear are probably for restaurants, that serve hundreds of meals a day. You serve hundreds of people all the time, any mistakes will make people sick. You, cooking 3 meals a day? The risks are WAY smaller. Sure, it's best not to leave meat sitting out. Is it literally unsafe, will it almost certainly make you sick? No. Odds are tiny that the few bacteria that started growing within two hours would be enough to effect you at all. If you serve the public, not a risk to take. You personally in your kitchen? Miniscule risk, you're in more danger driving to the market to replace what you would have thrown out.",1680307316.0

And again your entire point about offensive system is asinine. The only thing that matters about an offensive system is does it work. And everyone who actually watched the eagles last year realized that Jalen was the engine that made it work. The idea that the system a qb runs is more important than how productive it is is an absolute no doubt about it clown take. It‚Äôs nothing but mental gymnastics. But of course you didn‚Äôt actually watch Jalen play because you‚Äôre claiming that he never dropped back which is just absolutely not true and anyone who watched him knows that. He dropped back plenty and sat in the pocket to allow himself to throw deep balls far more often than jones actually.

"CrumblCookies","t5_38sc1b","Snickerdoodle Cupcake: This was a good cookie  - I'm not the biggest cinnamon cookie person but I thought this one was soft and had a good flavor. That being said, I'm a cream cheese frosting fan so having a cookie dolled up with it was bound to make me like it. Not my favorite cookie from Crumbl, but I would buy again. I asked the employee what the best selling cookie was this week and she said this one by a landslide.

Peanut Butter Creme ft. Nutter Butter: Unpopular opinion... I thought this one was bland. It's not a bad cookie, I just didn't get really much flavor of anything. I truly think it would be better if it wasn't chilled because the chill muted all the flavors for me.

Niacinamide moisturizers and cleansers are also helpful for preventing acne, but again, this ingredient might be a bit irritating for your skin rn. I really recommend the brand Naturium for the benzoyl peroxide and niacinamide moisturizer. They also have lovely cleansing oils/milks for you to use as a first cleanse before the benzoyl peroxide cleanser, which will leave your skin feeling so nourished and soothed.

Resident Evil 2 - 4 Remakes

Guardians of the Galaxy

Dead Space Remake

DOOM 2016

DOOM Eternal

Deathloop

Outriders

Chorus

Starlink - Battle for Atlas

Bloodborne

Sifu

Donkey Kong Country - Tropical Freeze

Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury

Pikmin 3 Deluxe

Hyrule Warriors - Definitive Edition

Hyrule Warriors - Age of Calamity

All of these games are under 30 hours, have simple UI's and gameplay loops and are mostly linear if you follow the main objectives. A couple, like Bloodborne and Starlink, are kind of pushing the envelope, but they're great games worth playing. My personal recommendation? Deathloop. That's the slickest game I've ever played.

People don't think on time scales of existence.  It's entirely possible there was a race of intelligent beings before humanity millions of years ago and for there to be little to no evidence of such. 

The point being, yeah humanity is bad for Earth, but just Earth in the now.  Millions of years from now life would almost certainly bounce back.

"SkincareAddicts","t5_37kq2","I took doxycycline (also an antibiotic) for 3 months as well & not too long after my acne came back but WAY worse.

My skin is clear now, but dealing with scars  thanks to the nasty acne I got post-antibiotics. We often don‚Äôt think about doing our research because we think we should trust doctors. They‚Äôre the professionals after all. But after this experience, I‚Äôve learned you have to go in with some idea & advocate for yourself.

1 orb spawns per pack. That has 3 charges. Each player can only remove one charge on it. Making it a minimum of 3 players have to hit an orb to ""defuse"" it.

1. Makes explosives a team responsibility not just a healer/tank priority. But also doesn't require all five members so that you avoid issues with 1-2 players not being able to do it due to other mechanics. 

2. Avoids overly siphoning damage output from going towards mobs/bosses, which overly punishes teams as they push higher keys and push against the timer.",1680307322.0

The issue I came across the most with lego is it not having the sizes you want or not having a durable enough input/output shaft.

The best 3D printed gears with bearings/Metal bushings really out shine lego in flexibility of use and being able to design it to spec. Though where you can you should use lego gears as they are over all more durable due to being injection molded even with the compromises they do have in design and capabilities that come from being a standardized toy.",1680307323.0

Though I'd also step back and ask WHY you are inviting regrades in the first place. What purpose are you trying to accomplish with that? Because what works best will depend on the intended function of the regrade policy.

I've been teaching full time 20+ years and have never had a regrade policy, and never even had a student ask for one, aside from flat out mistakes in grading, which I don't consider a regrade, just a necessary correction - and I work hard to keep those mistakes as rare as possible.",1680307323.0

My only complaint is that the whole thing is narrower than other racks. It‚Äôs that way so the crossbars fit in the OEM rails. If you get their full, it‚Äôs not as narrow since the crossbars aren‚Äôt meant to fit OEM rails. The two drawbacks to this are the look (strait on isn‚Äôt quite as badass as the wider racks) and when I‚Äôm sliding drywall or plywood on top, I have to be more careful of hitting the corners of the roof. 
The cost of the full aluminum 7/8 was only 900 back when I got it and there weren‚Äôt so many other companies making racks, but if I had to do it again I‚Äôd probably get something wider and shorter like the Prinsu. I haven‚Äôt been on LFDs site in a while, but you used to be able to buy side rails and a fairing a la carte. No doubt that would be the cheapest upgrade for you.

Also when added before importing it doesn't import the public key and private key automatically. After entering them manually. Those postUp and preDown key don't make it in the final .conf file.

I'll ask in the forum to see what happened. I like to have them too ;)

"IndiaSpeaks","t5_3d4x4","I'm a photographer/cinematographer.. last year in December i was hired by a spiritual/fitness type of a content creator of Indian origin from Netherlands, had fairly decent following on Ig and was visiting India after 16 odd years..

middle of the shoot, while on break in a cafe, she asked me if i can help her with a viral video, where she can get in trouble with a local organic food shop owner we were going to go next, and then she began to explain what it all would entail..she said she'd film the end monologue herself in her hotel room on phone and then i can edit a reel off of it. Basic idea was to showcase how difficult it is for visiting foreigners to shop in india..

i had no idea what to do in the moment, i kept asking her questions and enquiring what exactly will happen and what not..i got what she wanted. I just wasn't sure what to do, because it was middle of the shoot and i also didn't want to loose the client, ik I'm sorry i really needed it at the time. 

so, i told her, let's see if we have some time left before we get all the required shots and then maybe..i spent next 2 hours making excuses, taking longer than usual time at a spot for pictures and thankfully by the end she had to rush back to her hotel, she has somewhere else to go that evening, so it worked out for me. 

But I'm still not sure what would I have done if she had forced me to just film any kind of altercation, where she intentionally gets in fight with local shop owners just to get views :(",1680307326.0

edit: I should add that I know this sounds dumb, but I think you could probably use solar panels inside of the Earth, which would allow an extremely small amount of energy.

Years ago, when I was in college, my then boyfriend also had a problem with my small breasts. I didn't before him, and I don't now. I love my little boobs. It was only a problem for him.

He was manipulative. He would bring it up when we were intimate, fantasize about them being bigger, and finally convinced me to briefly take some bullshit supplements that were supposed to make them grow but were only making me nauseous.

One day, when I was putting them in some oatmeal, I just had an epiphany about how fucked up it was.

I was literally putting something in my body that was making me feel sick to try to change my body in a way that I didn't even want. For what? This loser?

I called him that day, told him that, and said, ""Why am I not good enough for you just the way I am?""

Nobody should be making you feel bad about yourself or trying to convince you to make changes to your body that you don't even want. This is not something wrong with you, or something detrimental to your health---it's entirely about HIS preferences for YOUR body.

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","The ring states that the beast itself was named ""The Evil Eye"" and the resemblence to an eye is just a coincidence.  
  
While ""the evil eye"" is undoubtedly an unofficial name likely used only in Astora, the list of creatures with prominent eyes is relatively small. To get a name like ""the evil eye"" suggests eyes were prominent.  
   
My guess is a Basilisk. We know from Dark Souls general logic that the more souls you consume the more powerful you become, and for many creatures this can lead to considerable increases in size. We also know this is possible for Basilisks due to Dark Souls 2, and the fake eyes on a Basilisk are it's most prominent feature. In addition, Basilisks kill very quickly with their curse breath which plate armour offers no protection against, and assuming they don't eat stone it means the act of killing essentially -is- eating for them which would explain how killing while wearing it restores health. A single Basilisk that chooses prey carefully can bring down many many people.  
  
The fact that the ring contains it's spirit suggests the beast was beaten and killed, which also gels since Basilisks are agile but not terribly resilient to physical attacks. If the ""eye"" within the ring is a literal eye then it could be that of one of its offspring or just a regular Basilisk.",1680307327.0

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","This is always going to be a difficult topic, because all definitions of identity labels carry some vagueness, and must carry some vagueness in order to describe a diverse group of unique individuals with shared experiences. However, I do not believe the current usage of ""asexual"" is harmfully overbroad.

First, I don't see any regular confusion about what (black-stripe) asexuals, gray asexuals and allosexuals are supposed to refer to, and what sort of experience typically falls into one or another. So the only question is whether an unqualified use of ""asexual"" should refer to both black-stripe asexuals and gray asexuals, or exclusively the former.

At this point, I believe it's important to back up and consider why these labels exist at all. Many of the LGBT+ labels are ones we really shouldn't need, but do need because our society has many, *many* absurdly restrictive and dangerously wrong ideas of how gender and sexuality and relationships work. Every label like ""lesbian"" or ""bisexual"" or ""polyamorous"" or ""transgender"" is about referring neutrally and factually to a group of people whose existence is denied or villified by cisheteronormative institutions, thereby presenting them as... just a group of people that exist, because that's all they are.

That's why I'd rather the default, unqualified use of ""asexual"" (outside of dedicated forums like this one) include the gray part of the spectrum. Gray asexuals, demis, aegos, liths, etc. are all outside ""the norm"" just like black-stripe asexuals are, and as a result experience many of the same hardships and prejudices. The fact that I am gray asexual rather than black-stripe asexual did nothing to prevent my partner from feeling hurt when I was not attracted to her nearly as often as she expected (if anything, the grayness made it *more* confusing).

In a hypothetical future where aphobia was drastically reduced, and awareness was so high that we mostly figured our identities out *before* having bad experiences, perhaps the tradeoffs would shift towards different definitions. Or maybe we'd stop feeling the need to use most of these labels at all. But, even optimistically, that's a long ways off.

As a comparison point, one example of a usage I *do* think is harmfully overbroad is when people say ""gay"" to mean all LGBT+ people of any kind. Hopefully it's obvious why I take umbrage with that one.",1680307327.0

I have a strong liking for some of my players, and then, in honesty, I've fallen out with my best player because I fined him for getting sent off and he kicked up a fuss. I feel different emotions to each player, who feels completely unique.

This team feels like mine. These are my decisions, and the wins feel that much sweeter. I just beat Real Madrid 1-0 today at home, and that feeling was incredible. I was so happy, and I felt a connection with my team. Its so weird how a game gets you feeling like that, but I love it.

"homeowners","t5_2r9c1","First - based on your info, it appears the damage/water leak is likely a pre existing condition. Since it is pre existing, your current policy will not cover the damage and deny the claim. 

Second - aside from the likely hood of preexisting damage, water leaking over time and causing damage is usually not covered either. Insurance is for sudden, accidental damage - not maintenance issues that happen over time (whether you were aware of it or not). 

Do not sign any forms giving authority to the water damage specialists on your behalf. They are flat out wrong about the subrogation piece and it seems you don‚Äôt know what they are actually requesting you to sign. Mitigation/damage specialists are notorious for overcharging and unnecessary/incomplete repairs. Search the various home improvement subs and you will find other stories about mitigation companies trying to pass excessive charges to insurance which are denied, thus leaving the homeowner on the hook for the balance. 

Finally, How much are the estimated repairs? How much is your deductible? Insurance should really only be used for catastrophic damage - like the house burning down, or a tree crashing through the roof. If it is only a couple thousand dollars over your deductible and you have the funds you are better off paying out of pocket. Get more than one estimate of you haven‚Äôt already.

 It is so hard to see anyone else's views than your own when you are in that state of mind. I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After therapy and medication, I could see how difficult it was for my husband to deal with. To try and help me and me throw it back in his face. He actually ended up getting me hospitalised, which finally led to me getting professional help. At the time, I told him I hated him and some truly nasty comments. But I see now it was the right thing and I'm thankful every day that he stood by me all those months and was brave enough to take such a huge step to have me hospitalised, knowing how angry and upset I would be at him. 
If this is something you need to do in the end, just keep thinking of the end result and how you will be stronger than ever as a couple once she has the help she needs. 
I hope you both get the support you need, and she is doing better soon. Make sure you have someone you can talk to and offload to. Please don't feel alone in dealing with this situation.",1680307329.0

"manchester","t5_2qhjj","If they were built for a specific use that is no longer required, why is it that many have been successfully been converted to other uses which still guarantee their structural integrity and existence?

Your argument about continued improvement and innovation is also not entirely correct. A large number of mills were not built in the middle of towns by razing to the ground significant structures. If anything, a number of towns grew to be what they are now because a mill was built there in the first place.

I also fundamentally disagree with your view that the fact Manchester is a working city with a diverse economy is a good reason to demolish wholesale just to build bland glass towers. With the proper care (and at a significantly lower cost), a number of existing buildings could satisfy the needs that boring glass towers purport to solve. But that is the thing, it has nothing to do with meeting the demands for Manchester, it's about making healthy profits by selling real estate to foreign investors. Likewise, these towers do nothing to relieve housing issues you state are a concern, if anything they make it worse by making housing even more unaffordable.

None of these towers needed to be built but they were because someone could make obscene profits off selling them.

Also, can you seriously sit there and tell me that glass towers that look identical to eachother and have no architectural value whatsoever can genuinely add to the history of Manchester?",1680307329.0

Obviously there is a lot more to unpack than what a few redditors can reasonably do, so take any advice with a grain of salt.

That being said, it is rude to invite someone to only part of an event when everyone else is invited to all of it, effectively singling them out. Since this is a party for your daughter and is a complicated situation relationship-wise, I think that taking into strong consideration what she would prefer is the right course of action. If she would not like to have him there for all of it or even part of it, I think those desires are justifiable given the situation. It is her night to be celebrated, and unless you feel unsafe around him, I would recommend deferring to her desires without trying to sway her or lead her to what you want.

You can always be civil for one night if she wants him there for the entire party. Him not paying child support is lousy, and I understand wanting to gatekeep some of the specialness of the evening, but again, leave it to your daughter if you can.",1680307329.0

He is described in the game as *""dead, but he dreams he lives""*. He dreamed himself a living god.

Some times brevity isn't my strong point as well.  And sometimes I tend to write metaphorically, which throws people off big time; or I know what I'm thinking but not expressing it in a way that would avoid misunderstanding.  It's something I shall try to work on. 

My memory definitely isn't what it used to be and that darn Discovery has so much information in it, I normally have no problem when people refer to it to refresh my memory. For reasons I won't get into here, that particular time I went Snarky instead of responding to your comment. And I swear I was sent for a spell to the reddit penalty box. 

To finish, I have no problem with your response about NA and the mail, as it makes sense. It was the accusation that I was implying something else. Perhaps I was. The question I want to ask at this point is why didn't they simply have their mail held for them at the post office?   Regarding ""Shanann's"" income, I explained that in my comment to your post, as you know.

Sorry I applied a modern lens of analysis to your boyfriend. Yeah I've

completely stripped him of historical and semantic context so that I

could fit his story and tropes into my own moralistic view of the

world. Yeah he's practically flavourless now. In fact this was the

original boyfriend and you're a problematic historian for thinking

otherwise.

#yeah i did an uncreative feminist retelling of

your boyfriend #he's now neither historically

accurate nor narratively compelling but you're

not allowed to point that out #he's really

popular on booktok though #sorry

I get that the timing wasn't great.  The timing of your boss' request wasn't great for you, either.  Chances are, the gf won't be around in another 6 months.  His sister will be.  Honestly, at 17, I would have been far more impressed if my boyfriend had said ""Hey, emergency plan change.  Have to pick up my little sister.  Can she come along and I'll make it up to you?""

Hi /u/camm267!


Your submission was removed per Rule 4:

>####RULE #4 - NO UNVERIFIED OC

>* Do not post yourself unless you are prepared to verify with us.

>* Don't post or claim to know the person(s) in the photo. This is a bannable offense.

>* Don't post someone you know from Facebook or Instagram or any other social media platform. If we find out, it violates this rule.

**Any further submissions by you, without verification, will result in a ban.**

---

#**[\*\*READ THE FULL VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS HERE\*\*](https://www.reddit.com/r/milf/wiki/verification)**

#Verification must follow these simple rules:

Please provide `3+` photos of your nude/semi-nude body from `3` different angles, holding a paper sign with your user name, today's date, and /r/milf written on it.

* The paper should be crumpled and smoothed, yet still readable.

* Your hand(s) should be visible holding the sign.

* Shoot the pics from as wide an angle as you can manage. Photos cropped in close will be rejected.

* New and low karma accounts cannot be verified. If you've only been on reddit for a short time, have low karma, and/or you haven't done much NSFW self-posting on reddit, you'll be asked to build up your posting history for a month or so before verifying here. Posting nudes isn't for everyone, and we want you to ""get your feet wet"" by posting in some smaller subs before you jump into the deep end of the pool.

* **WE DO NOT VERIFY MALE-RUN ACCOUNTS**

Show as much of your body as possible. If we can't match the body depicted in your verification pictures to the body in your past and future posts, then it's not a meaningful verification. So while you do not have to show your face, we do need to see a good amount of your nude body.

Thank you for your cooperation!

-The /r/MILF Mod Team

They literally have flex drops so when you have fewer than 6 bombs or arrows they will drop them for you, or if you have fewer than 3 hearts, etc, and have the chests have that stuff in them anyway.

We‚Äôd send them to the nurse‚Äôs office every couple of days when we saw live ones crawling (and no, they no longer send kids home for lice). There was a social worker involved but it did no good. They‚Äôre still home schooled since schools reopened after virtual learning and I‚Äôm 100% sure they still have lice.

I initially was hesitant because of A&F reputation as being a d-bag brand. Now the style reflects more of my personal taste which is like streetwear with a tad of prep. 

Much of their stuff is copied from Aime Leon Dore which I base alot of my style from but IMO alot of A&F's pieces are better quality. Aime Leon Dore's sweats are surprisingly rough and scratchy, A&F's sweats are super soft.",1680307332.0

I am going into this with the assumption that if I have it, it's mild. But EDS seems to progress for a lot of people so this is also preventative. From what I've read, this is what made me suspicious:

&#x200B;

\-lightheadedness/vertigo/dizziness: I've been checked for POTS, but the symptoms aren't consistent/frequent enough for it to be that. But the dizziness on standing happens most often after I've been crouching, has varied in intensity and consistency since I was 11 or 12. 

 \-Balance problems: about once a day, I'd say, I stumble for no apparent reason. Often when standing up I'll have to compensate/lean heavily not to fall over. 

\-Oscillopsia and transient monocular blindness: now, I have no idea if the would be the right diagnoses, and I definitely don't ever fully loose vision in one eye. But sometimes my eyes just go \*weird\*. I'll be convinced one eye has gone temporarily blind, for example, but  when I close the eyes individually, they both work. But as soon as I've got them both opened again it feels like only one is working. Also sometimes it just feels like I'm looking at the world through a fish-eye lenses, I guess? Its not quite accurate to what it feels/looks like but the closest comparison I can think of right now. 

\-Hiccups: Drinking tea, specifically, seems to trigger them. I haven't been able to figure out a patterns, but it happens less than once a month so idk. 

\-Its not constant but sometimes my head just feels really big/heavy. I feel like a bobble head, like my weight is unevenly distributed. Not super frequent. 

\-One of the articles said ""pain referred to the shoulder"". I'm not totally sure what that means, but I have chronic pain around my shoulder blade. 

\-Stiff neck. 

\-Depression

&#x200B;

\-This last one wasn't listed anywhere, but my neck is constantly crunchy. I was putting books away today (which involved leaning over to an extent) and every tiny movement I made resulted in a crunch. Ranges from right at the base of my skull to maybe C7 (I'm guessing obv)",1680307333.0

So seeing someone in a situation I could've been in, but missed by mere millimeters, it would be too much for me to handle.

The point is, at a very low entry level you can easily get to high yellow and probably even reds without the enchant and the boots. Spellslinger VD DD still has strong clear and damage. All that you need is to get some currency in day 1-2 and just get the items that would bump your build even more just like every other day. The 6 link is not needed, the boots are not needed, the lab enchant is not needed. When you get to the point of the game that they are needed you will have the currency. 

The whole point about crafting a helmet also makes absolutely no sense, would you really be trying to craft end game helmet day 3? I started with arc spellslinger last league and it was literally fine all the way to Shaper with minimal investment. Not the greatest, sure but fuck me calling it ""bad, slow and unenjoyable"", you truly sound like somebody that's played seismic trap every league. 

I didn't claim the skill was strong, I just said ""its not looking too bad"". It's in a lot better place than it was last league. FML dude I can see why every one of your comments is downvoted with this shit attitude.",1680307334.0

Always have some money built up for that, just in case.

And if it helps, we've lived in Hunt Military Communities and Liberty (Lincoln) Military Housing (in 2 locations - including our current home). Hunt was the more expensive for us than LMH.

Since you're moving out next week, this advice might be really difficult to tackle, but just make sure that house is the cleanest in the world. Deep clean that sucker. Make sure that every surface of that house (including walls) are cleaned up. Make sure that all the bigger holes are spackled. The less work that they have to do to get it ready for the next tenants, the better it is for you.

I really hope that you don't have anything that needs repairs, because they'll likely charge you for that if you didn't get them taken care of before you put in your notice. Carpets are always a biggie as well, especially if they're under 5 years old (but that varies, depending on the state you live in).

This was our experience. I'm sure it won't be the same in other places.

I would check with your housing office and see if they have a list of move out charges that you can take a look at, so you have an idea of what you could be paying.

I already made an argument. You shat yourself because it required you to read above a high school level. 

> one ""hub"" network owns all the hospitals in a large area around I live and has reduced local hospital activity to drive them towards ""the hub"".

Networked hospitals aren't the same as a hub and spoke model. You would know this if you spent the time trying to dig up dirt on me on actually reading what I linked. 

Under a hub and spoke model, patients aren't needlessly transferred to random locations. Healthcare needs are identified and taken to the proper location. They don't just drag you around until they can treat you, because they already know where you need to be treated. 

> You are advertising a model that ""requires assembly"" to maximize capital.

All hospitals need to generate revenue in order to stay afloat. Sorry if you had to find out from me.",1680307334.0
"GTA","t5_2ra77","Firstly, the guns were handled in RDR2 single handed, because that is how the revolvers were designed to be fired. Weaver grip wasn't developed until the 70's and that was to accommodate the newer designed handguns in competitions.

Second... I could say it can be included though because people fire modern guns one handed, and one hand fire could be implemented as the first loose aim, say hip fire with no aim button pressed. Then when aiming they lift and aim one handed then click analog and they go two handed.

Or implement those animations when carrying a long arm in the other hand. 

Or make it so the aim style is affected by gun size and attachments.


No matter what they do I hope that the weapons are realistically depicted on the character, and there are different holster and carry options we can buy and select so I can have a drop leg, or shoulder, or hip, or back or appendix or all of them. And I can only carry the weapons that I have holsters to accommodate. Of course throw in the default waistband carry for the single starter pistol.",1680307334.0

"longboarding","t5_2qvgw","When we are talking bushing hardness it's really just a lean discussion, as ""turn"" is determined by angles. Tuning your bushings won't affect the lean-to-turn relationship.

Static testing, I want my front and rear both to lean pretty far without biting, and without either one lifting off the ground (at least not one before the other - and if one lifts first, it should be the rear, and only slightly).

To static test, I would just distribute my weight normally and use my normal foot position. Hold onto something stationary, lean hard, and roll - if you don't get wheelbite or wheel lift, and you are able to lean near the limit of where you would otherwise get wheelbite, that's perfect.

**Edit:** To clarify a couple of things, 1. you WILL get wheel lift at some point if you don't get wheel bite first on the static test - that's fine, I just want it to occur relatively late in the lean, and 2. It's not always a bad thing if the front lifts before the rear, as long as you get plenty of lean first. The ideal situation is front and rear lift at the same time, or the rear lifts slightly first (for split angle DH, or pump setups), but as long as you aren't getting a ton of lift without lean (front, rear, or both) it's all good. The MAIN purpose of the static test though is just to make sure your setup isn't going to dump you on the ground. Then you go test it skating to see how it actually works.",1680307335.0

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","I have a similar starter but a different build. I go Italian infantry for Gustatori.

3 PGrens -> 8rad -> PGren squad upgrade -> optional fast marder for a fast stuart -> Medic Truck -> Gustatori -> mg42 on all the PGrens -> 2-3 marders (might add a mg in there somewhere)

You are playing mind games on the UKF player. You don‚Äôt select the battlegroup til you are ready to get the Gustatori. The 8rad opening make the UKF player spam boys AT which is horrible against your upgraded PGrens and Gustatori. The occasional booty trap further devastates their infantry.

Currently the UKF player loves to spam boys AT so you bait them with the 8rad which as said here is excellent for killing retreating squads but you don‚Äôt go heavy into vehicles later since that would play into their hand. Later against their vehicles, 2-3 marders will keep their vehicles play down and an AT grenade from your PGrens will make them slowed down for your marders to finish off. It‚Äôs ironic playing DAK as an infantry faction but people don‚Äôt expect it.

Seriously PGrens are horrible early but once you get past the initial hurdle, they become really good infantry.",1680307335.0

They spent insane sums on transfers without much return. Debts mounted, and they had to start selling their best players like Ferdinand to rivals United. That caused them to miss out on CL and have to sell even more players. 

Only 3 years after the CL semi they were relegated and spent 15 years stuck in the 2nd and 3rd tiers, occasionally dipping into administration, getting points deductions, owing the tax office millions etc.

I‚Äôd advise to find some online or local communities for hobbies or interests. Find things to do that you feel you can contribute to. If it maybe helps, the thing that helped me get through those days where I was lonely and felt things would never change was asking: 

‚ÄúCan I enjoy TODAY without finding that someone?‚Äù 

That answer for me most days was a yes. I could find something for that day to do that I enjoyed or found meaningful. There were of course always some days where it was unbearable to think it would be this way forever. 

Find a therapist to talk to and I‚Äôd advise another man. If you are unhappy, other people can often tell and that is just as big of a turn off. Be the best you that you can be. Work towards a place where you know you are worth being friends with (or a relationship). If they aren‚Äôt interested because of a superficial thing, they were likely not worth your time. Not blowing smoke at you. All of this is hard. Unfairly hard.

But evangelicals and mega churches have a LOT of money.  That buys a lot of influence, a lot of congresspeople, a lot of ad time and coverage.

Most people in the US for example support a woman's right to choose, but based on the 'He Gets Us' groups that put millions into Super Bowl ads you'd think that wasn't the case.

Churches are realizing their numbers are dwindling and people aren't interested in it so they are becoming more aggressive in attempting to convert.

They're louder, but their numbers are smaller every year.

""
In all the scenarios, Christianity's share of the U.S. population declines. ‚ÄúDepending on whether religious switching continues at recent rates, speeds up, or stops entirely,‚Äù the report says, the Center's projections show Christians shrinking from 64% of Americans of all ages in 2020 to between 54% and 35% by 2070.""

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Oh boy. I am 59 year old. And I figured out my ADHD about four years ago. Since then it‚Äôs been one lightbulb going off after another. Since the third grade, I tried each day to figure out what was wrong with me. Now, I understand! And now my life, every piece of it, fits perfect. It is barely a life at all. I avoided friends, family, relationships because of my shame. I would feel awful about myself all the time. And punish myself. Since becoming an adult, I have not celebrated a birthday or any holiday.
Sorry for long intro
I also have, an overflowing amount of unbelievable, operatic life-changing humiliating events that , when I might try to tell the story, my friends might simply not believe me, think I was exaggerating, or whining.
When I was young, there was no dealing with it. I thought I would die, or I wished I would. And so I would stay dark and angry and sad. And then slowly, time would diminish the event. Or, a new one would come along.
My first lesson was, it won‚Äôt feel this bad forever. I don‚Äôt consider that much of a comfort, but I made note of it, and referenced it when stuff happened. And it was helpful.

I would be so dark at times, eyes down, simmering sadness. It was so serious, and no one could understand. I could not do my homework, I was not good looking or athletic, but, I had a lot of energy, could talk (or bullshit) really fast. And,luckily, I was sort of funny. So, I started getting away with some stuff, could talk myself out of trouble. I became a goofball. And I found, if I could maintain my sense of humor in those terrible moments. Laugh at myself, make some witty comments. Nobody wants a serious or dark scene. Even if you feel totally like the world I‚Äôd over, try and smile, try and find the humor in it. This is not easy. It took me years not to jump into dark despair. I‚Äôm terrified and intrigued at every zoom meeting.I make stupid mistakes all the time. I have never been in a hotel room where I could find/operate the heat/A/C. But I carefully look in every place it could be. But I can‚Äôt see it, and I have to call down and I have someone come up. I tell whoever comes up. I have never, not once, not had to call down for help. And it‚Äôs always in the most obvious place, do simple to use!
Zoom. I did not start talking to myself until recently. But it‚Äôs pretty crazy. When I realize I‚Äôm doing it, I close my lips. I keep talking, but my mouth is closed. Really spooky crazy sounding. I keep an eye on that mute button. Sometimes, I‚Äôd just like to hit it and get it over with. I‚Äôll laugh, blame it on the cat or something.

The VAST majority of them said that they would start living as the gender that corresponds to their new anatomy. Pronoun change, clothing change, the whole shabang. So I would probably press the button. Also consider that if any old white men in the government were affected and wanted to go back, the accessibility of gender-affirming care would probably skyrocket.

My (22F) partner (24M) and I have been living together for a couple of months now, but I‚Äôve noticed he‚Äôs slowly started filling all of his time up with work-related things; he‚Äôs really passionate about his job, and he wants to learn all he can about it. I am very happy he‚Äôs found something he‚Äôs so excited about, but that being said, I feel like there is no room or time for me in our relationship anymore. Even when he does make time for me one-on-one, he‚Äôs talking about his job and all of the new things he‚Äôs going to get into soon. 

Well, I had a pretty major surgery that has been planned for months (septoplasty). He said he would take off work for me to help take care of me for two days, which he did- during these two days, though, he still participated in his hobbies which kept him majority outside while I was inside sick. Today has been the worst, and I was really wanting ginger ale to help my stomach. I asked if he could run to the store that is about 10 minutes away, which he agreed to and I‚Äôm so thankful for that. However, about an hour after he left, I called to ask if everything was okay because I was really feeling sick and didn‚Äôt like being home alone like that. He said yeah and that he was heading home then. 

He walked in with a Lowe‚Äôs bag. He said he wanted to go ahead and stop since he was already out and ‚Äúget some things he‚Äôll need for his hobby tomorrow‚Äù. I‚Äôm conflicted on how to feel because on one hand, he doesn‚Äôt have to take care of me at all and I‚Äôm really thankful he is. All of my family lives 4 hours away (I moved with him to his hometown, so I don‚Äôt really know anyone else to depend on). But on another hand, this is the sickest I‚Äôve been, and he still can‚Äôt fit me into his schedule it seems. AITA for being upset?

 I'm a photographer/cinematographer.. last year in December i was hired by a spiritual/fitness type of a content creator of Indian origin from Netherlands, had fairly decent following on Ig and was visiting India after 16 odd years..

middle of the shoot, while on break in a cafe, she asked me if i can help her with a viral video, where she can get in trouble with a local organic food shop owner we were going to go next, and then she began to explain what it all would entail..she said she'd film the end monologue herself in her hotel room on phone and then i can edit a reel off of it. Basic idea was to showcase how difficult it is for visiting foreigners to shop in india..

i had no idea what to do in the moment, i kept asking her questions and enquiring what exactly will happen and what not..i got what she wanted. I just wasn't sure what to do, because it was middle of the shoot and i also didn't want to loose the client, ik I'm sorry i really needed it at the time. 

so, i told her, let's see if we have some time left before we get all the required shots and then maybe..i spent next 2 hours making excuses, taking longer than usual time at a spot for pictures and thankfully by the end she had to rush back to her hotel, she has somewhere else to go that evening, so it worked out for me. 

But I'm still not sure what would I have done if she had forced me to just film any kind of altercation, where she intentionally gets in fight with local shop owners just to get views :(",1680307339

Have you ever pictured Lord Voldemort changing diapers?

He hasn‚Äôt, either.

Crack though very well written. Really seeing a Tom Riddle taking care of a baby Harry because he is his Horcrux and reconciling with in Burgin Burke's life is worth it.Although unfortunately incomplete.



A Graveyard Reunion- ElliahRose

https://archiveofourown.org/works/24043756/chapters/57855103

The real reason Voldemort murdered the Potters was not so that he could kill Harry, but so that he could adopt Harry as his own. It all goes wrong, but perhaps Voldemort can finally get his family at the end of the Tri-Wizard Tournament?

Meanwhile, Harry has no idea how he ended up being kind of kidnapped by the man who murdered his parents. Said man who only wants to become Harry's new dad.

Fun and interesting Voldemort is still unhinged but has a love/obsession for Harry which leads him to kidnap him.It's not a dark story I promise.
Unfortunately also incomplete.


Innocentia (H.P)-goldenhjp
https://archiveofourown.org/users/goldenhjp/pseuds/goldenhjp

Harry was always curious about the beautiful green curse that ended the lives of those that stood against the great Lord Voldemort or, Harry giggled, Tommy. Harry wanted Tommy to teach him it, It couldn't be that hard after all, could it? Tom knew Harry's innocence would be the death of him...

She used to do it more often but... it's been so long she's actually isolating herself more, therefore hanging out with less people - and even when she does, wearing her girl outfits doesn't even bring her that much joy anymore.

HRT sounds nice.... but I'm unsure on how safe it is to proceed when her healthcare is paid by her parents, idk how much access they would have to her medical treatments or even just how many consults she's having.

Es wird auch dort immer Schwankungen geben. Im schlimmsten Fall k√§me eine Deflation in Gang, was die komplette Wirtschaft bzw. die Gesellschaft ruinieren w√ºrde.",1680307341.0

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","Things like this are what made me a very private closed circle person. I only ever talk to my gf, my best friend, and coworkers (who are not by any means my friends lol)

The friendships you had are an incredible stab in the back, in the most devastating way possible. Losing your reputation, physical health worsening, losing those your thought were your friends. I went through the same thing, the only thing I can‚Äôt relate to here is your health, and I really wish you could‚Äôve gotten proper information about your health. You should be able to sue for withholding of information, no? 

Perhaps there‚Äôs other legal action you can take to better your situation but holding on to revenge will only lead you further down the path of resentment, guilt and stress. 

Cut off anything and anyone who doesn‚Äôt serve you and your purpose. 

All we really need is one solid partner in crime and you can conquer the world. 

Also, that friend your mentioned who turned on you. People like that were never your friends, jump temporary pests. It‚Äôs a good thing you had to deal with this now than later on. Fuck them all, their opinions aren‚Äôt facts, and by no means define you.",1680307341.0

If you need to test that it works with a different option or parameter, that's a second test. Add it to your test framework. Now when you run your test framework, both things get checked.

It starts to become unit tests when you start thinking about and testing for the different ways your code could be used. And also how it could be used wrong by stupid users.  Like passing None for each parameter. Test edge cases too.

Then you look at every function you created, then create a test that calls just that method.

We encourage you to resubmit your post though!  Just resubmit and add [Image], [Gif], [Album] or [Video] at the beginning of the title.  We know....we're a bunch of rules Nazi's.  We don't like it either.  The tags just keep things organized, let us set flair automatically, allows for filtering and It also stops bots from posting in this majorly [OC Content] sub, which I think we all agree is a good thing!

"PhD","t5_2qiyl","My research is in AI/ML for healthcare. I've found that r/MachineLearning is a good subreddit for the most part. There usually seem to be good discussions there. r/machinelearningnews is also a decent one, it's more of a feed of interesting papers, etc. I don't know what quality of answers are on StackExchange, but most of the AI/ML questions that show up on Google from their sister site StackOverflow have well thought-out answers.

I have found that on some of the more general programming/CompSci subreddits, people often want to prove that they know more about AI/ML than everyone else, because it's a hot topic. I think many people have an introductory understanding of it, but underestimate how abstracted their knowledge is, as well as just how complex and fast-moving the field can be and how little consensus there often is. I don't think the level of knowledge is an issue, it's more that people are convinced that they know it all.

I find Twitter is simultaneously a good source of information and a terrible one. There is a good community there of people who are genuinely interested in AI/ML and lots of interesting research being shared, but also some prominent figures claiming to be experts with large Twitter followings who routinely broadcast questionable statements about nebulous and/or philosophical topics related to AI.

As for elitism (or percieved elitism), I have mixed feelings on it in my field. I've yet to see anyone say ""you don't know what you're talking about for the exclusive reason that you don't have a formal education in this field,"" but people definitely do try to make a big deal out of their credentials and belittle people who are asking genuine questions or making honest mistakes. At the same time, I've seen plenty of people without a formal education in the field making statements and releasing independent (i.e. non peer-reviewed) research with huge fundametal errors and refusing to admit they're wrong because they see themselves as victims of elitism.",1680307345.0

"writing","t5_2qh2n","First off, I'm sorry. I know how much this hurts, and I'll try to help you as best I can. (I had a story I was very proud of mocked by a teacher at my school, and this is what helped me.)

A lot of these comments are, frankly, just dogshit. See, this is an emotional problem stemming from an emotional wound. Just like no level of emotional maturity can help you solve a complex mathematics problem, no level of intellectual maturity can help you solve an emotional problem. Emotional ability and intellectual ability are wholly separate. (Keep this in mind when soliciting advice from Reddit, as most Redditors have the emotional maturity of a particularly unpleasant seven-year-old).

What you have here is an emotional wound. You let your walls down and someone close to you left a wound. That's not to say that you should never let your walls down, but that you need to process this wound emotionally. Advice such as ""don't listen to the haters :)"" is just covering the wound up and hoping that if you ignore it it'll go away, which it won't.

From your post, it seems like you don't have the ability to heal the wound just yet. That's okay. Just like nobody is born able to solve calculus problems, or read and write, nobody is born with emotional ability either. Normally, it's up to the parents to instill this ability in their children, and schools are entirely focused on intellectual ability. If your parents didn't give you the tools you need to heal yourself emotionally, it's fine - you can get them now. It's not a quick fix, but you can get skills that let you not only heal this wound, but protect you from future wounds.

Most people alive right now either grew up during, or had their parents grow up during, a time when emotions were seen as bad. It was a virtue to hide your emotions, and pretend you didn't have them at all. You can still see echoes of this online, as ""you're upset therefore I win"" is a common sentiment online. This lead to several generations of people who have basically no emotional ability whatsoever, which means that had no ability to pass on healthy emotional maturity to their children.

Everyone has emotions. Every human being, no matter how much they like to pretend they are ""rational"" or ""objective"", has and makes decisions based on emotions. The only difference is if they're aware of it or not. (Note: when I say ""everyone"", that's not hyperbole. Our brains have several structures entirely dedicated to emotions, which you can't just turn off or ignore. They aren't standalone, they are wired in to the rest of your brain. Their effects reach into the whole brain.)

So, back to you: you have emotions, you suffered an emotional wound, and nobody's taught you how to deal with that. That's okay! Like I said, nobody is born knowing this stuff, and schools don't teach it. You're actually a full step higher than most people in this comment section, in that you realized the problem and asked for help. So, what do you do?

That's complicated. Imagine the scenario: someone is having trouble walking because they say ""my leg hurts"". As someone online who's never seen their leg, how do I know if they have a broken bone, a bruise, a sprain, flat feet, bone cancer, or if they just exercised too much last night? The diagnosis and treatment for each problem is wildly different, even though the symptom is the same. I'd have to recommend them to see a doctor. In the same way, I have to recommend you go to a therapist or counselor. If money's tight, try to find clinics with a sliding scale (university students and psychiatrists-in-training need experience somewhere! Don't worry, they're always supervised and guided (sometimes behind the scenes) by more experienced professors and professionals.) Go to a therapist and tell them exactly what you told us; and just like a doctor can find a diagnosis from ""my leg hurts"", a therapist can find a diagnosis from ""someone hurt me and now I can't write"". Just note that therapists are people, and not all of them are necessarily perfect or right for you. Don't be afraid to shop around, or even ask for a different therapist (if at a larger organization with more than one).

If therapy's not an option for you; hope is not lost! It'll just take some work on your end. Like the previous example, it's possible to diagnose your own leg pain if you go online and gather information and learn about the structure of the leg and so on. There's no easy way to get the exact answer (there's a reason WebMD always returns like 15 results for a given symptom), but you can do it. Just be careful - a lot of scammers and scummy ""alpha males"" like to prey on emotionally vulnerable people, so they will always be recommended to anyone searching for this kind of thing.

I'd start by (and actually did when I was going through similar) doing a few things: Mindfulness meditation, and journaling. You don't have to do mindfulness meditation for long if you find it unpleasant, but it's really important you at least start. Mindfulness meditation is about feeling everything going on, so you can find the problem. It's like a car's dashboard; if it's blindingly bright outside, you can't see the lights on the dashboard to know what the problem is (this is when you have no emotional skills). General skill in emotional maturity is like driving into a dark room, so you can see the engine lights on the dash; and the combo of mindfulness meditation and journaling is like plugging in an OBDII scanner to see the exact state of the car and engine. (It's also been proven in studies that it permanently increases your ability to focus and improve cognition, if that helps you to stick with it.)

You don't have to do much mindfulness at a time (like, one minute a day is fantastic), but journaling is a long-term solution. You can only hold on to so many thoughts at once, so writing them down (can be digital or physical) lets you stop holding them in your mind so you can think more thoughts and dig deeper into how you feel. I just use a standard note app on my phone, and write down anything that I don't want to forget and ideas/realizations I have. You don't have to ever return to or read any of these journals, and bullet points or streams-of-consciousness are all fine. The point is to get some thoughts out onto the page so your brain has room for the next thoughts, and the next ones, and so on.

Without knowing more about you (your past, your childhood, potentially traumatic experiences, emotional hurts that haven't healed, so on) I can't give you a solution - which is why I recommend a therapist or counselor, because they can get all that info and guide you through it. Mindfulness and journaling have benefits, but I'll focus on their use for diagnostics; it helps you be aware of yourself so you know what's wrong. It's hard to fix a problem when you don't know what the problem is, which is why I recommend those two.

"CreditScore","t5_2rzva","Generally not. Consider the first month that you get a new card. You'll have a balance as soon as you make your first purchase. At some fixed date, usually the same day of the month, the bank will total up all of your purchases to date and generate a statement. It will have three crucial pieces of information. One is the statement balance which will be the sum of all of of the purchases you made as of the date the statement was prepared. The other is the due date, which is about three weeks after the statement was prepared. Note that you may not receive the statement on the preparation date, especially if you still use paper statements. The third is the minimum payment due, which will typically be much less than the statement balance. 

If you continue to make purchases between the statement date and the due date, your balance will increase as the purchases are applied to your account, making your account balance as seen online above that of the statement balance. 

If, on or before the due date, you pay the statement balance in full, your actual account balance will not be zero. It will be the amount of the purchases you made after the statement date. This is by far your best strategy. You'll hear it described as ""Paying the card in full every month"" or ""Not carrying a balance"", but unless you use the card very rarely, there will be technically the balances of the purchases you made between the statement date snapshot and the time your payment was received. 

The ""Minimum payment due"" is what the bank hopes you'll pay. Unless you're in a dire financial emergency, always pay the balance in full before the due date. If you can't, then pay as much as you can but at the very least the minimum. If you pay less than the statement balance, even by a penny, the bank will charge interest on at least a month's worth of purchases. Lock the card up, freeze it in a block of ice, or other wise make it difficult to use until you've paid the statement balance in full, and work on your budgeting skills.

That's the basics. 

There is a case where you may want to pay more than the statement balance. Credit utilization is a part of your credit score. Let's say that you have a relatively high limit on your credit card but you rarely approach the limit. This is low utilization, a good thing. Now you make a large purchase that would increase your statement balance to a substantial portion of your limit. If you pay for that purchase before the next statement is generated, the payment will reduce your statement balance by that amount and your utilization will remain low, boosting your score. It also decreases the risk that you'll accidentally go over your credit limit.",1680307346.0

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","I read something the other day that said, ‚ÄúComparison is the thief of joy.‚Äù This is so. damn. true. For every aspect of life, too.

I disagree with other posts that this is a product of law school. It isn‚Äôt. While it‚Äôs normal to sometimes feel envious of others, the feeling you describe is 100% unrelated to competitiveness and 100% how YOU choose to live. If you choose to measure all of your worth and successes by what other people have and how they‚Äôre succeeding, you will never feel fulfilled or be able to celebrate the milestones on your own path. Honestly, this is also a common ego issue (no shade) in law that only you can manage and reframe for your own benefit. In the real world your grades mean diddly, and nobody cares how popular you were.

Do yourself and the world a favor and get off of social media. And limit your use of LinkedIn. The science is pretty conclusive as to how the endless scrolling through social media feeds negatively affects our mental health in the way you‚Äôre describing. Constantly subjecting yourself to bear witness to how others are succeeding (or at least purporting to succeed‚Äîremember a lot of it is puffery) is not mentally healthy. Also, be a little kinder to yourself on the small stuff. We all make mistakes and say the wrong thing, it doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person. Nor does this kind of self-talk help you become the best person and professional you can be. If your school has counseling services or if you‚Äôre able to afford them, take advantage of them.",1680307347.0

with DRG, it's less about the destination, and more about the journey, if that makes any sense.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","I have a G9, EM5.3 and recently got an S5II, and have been shooting m43 for about 4 years now. I‚Äôd generally agree with these points, and also would argue that m43 has a lot of great computational features like pre burst, compositing, in camera stacking and HDR that shouldn‚Äôt be ignored. Pre burst is incredible and I believe basically only exists on the highest end Nikon and Canon bodies. 

I sometimes think that the IQ issues people note (outside of lowlight and not using exposure stacking for DR) have more to do with the fact Olympus has a pretty clinical jpg engine that asks you to adjust highlight and shadow curves for best results. 

we‚Äôll see how it shakes out and if it actually ends up replacing my m43 gear. I‚Äôve read too many regret posts. So I figured I‚Äôd rather just end up trading in the FF gear if I don‚Äôt like it and getting my m43 grail lens (300m f4) if it comes to that. There are definitely situations where I can see the difference, but it‚Äôs also absurd to me that with m43 I can fit 8 lenses and a body with batteries and charger into one of those $20 s-zone camera cubes from Amazon. I can fit the S5II and a second lens at best into the same space.",1680307347

Broadly speaking, it is the frontal/subcortical brain systems that tend to be more involved, and these are the regions that underlie executive functions in the brain.  Therefore, it is possible to have difficulties in visual planning, but usually this results more from executive (planning, problem solving, working memory) difficulties rather than from core or primary visual-spatial problems.",1680307348.0

"WTF","t5_2qh61","People really don't realize just how fucking awful deep snow is to deal with. There's a reason it put the fear of God into our ancestors. It's cold, it's wet, it's heavy. And even in powder form it's a fucking nightmare to traverse without proper gear like snowshoes.

I live in the mountains in the Pacific Northwest. We have a world class ski resort ten miles away.

I was having fun casually flying my drone at a family members property. I had a propeller snap on takeoff and it flew away. In front of their property is a highway, then a deep ditch. Then a raised train track slightly above the highway. During the summer it's a pretty simple walk. Just a few feet up in a vertical sense. Then after that is another ditch. Probably about twice as deep. (I'm talking like an 8 foot drop with a totally walkable hill. I crossed these all the times as a kid because on the other side is a massive lake I used to fish in) then it goes back up to a second set of tracks

Well my drone landed right between the first and second set of tracks. When this happened snow had built up over the winter. It was actually Christmas day. It wasn't terrible. At the deepest point probably about my knees. (I'm just slightly short of 6'4"") But we had rain the past week that led to about a quarter inch (if even) of ice on the top

By the time I managed to get to the first track. I had to stop myself.. for almost fifteen minutes to catch my breath and regain my energy. I was so insanely out of breath and lightheaded from moving that snow with nothing but my legs on an incline plus that tiny bit of ice that I just assessed the situation.. and decided that $600 was not worth the risk. Going Between two train tracks. Absolutely exhausted. Completely out of sight if I hit the ground and passed out. I took my single flyaway with dji and used my remaining energy to get back out of there

And to be clear I'm not wicked out of shape or anything. This video just reminded me of this. The guy doesn't even go that far and is presumably in pretty decent shape. In the summer that walk (or even run) probably wouldn't have even left him short of breath. But those few feet really take it out of him.

Don't fuck around with deep snow unless you're prepared. That shit is SCARY. Nevermind being trapped upside down like this. Zero chance you break free on your own. And I mean ZERO. Even with light fluffy snow",1680307348.0

AI and automation should used and taxed to allow people to truly live lives of their own choosing. Being able to commit enough time to every important relationship.

My mother was a middle child of 6-8 children. When my maternal grandparents died, my mother did not even mourn much because there was not much of a relationship to mourn.

I personally don‚Äôt ever want more than 2-3 children. Not just because of cost, but also because I want to be a father not just whatever Elon Musk and Nick Cannon consider themselves.

Pro-natal and pro-family policies are intrinsically tied to automation, AI and increased productivity. If you gave people $2 million over 20 years per every child they have, the birth rate would increase a smidge. 

As people get more educated and learn the limits of their lives. We only get one life and limited time. Less people are naturally inclined to support birth rates above replacement level.",1680307349.0

This could be correct, but I have a difficult time believing that someone that honestly believes they're a different gender can *feel loved* if someone refuses to refer them how they prefer. They already have a hard enough time dealing with their feelings in a culture that often shuns and outright oppresses them. They likely already know about our doctrine regarding human sexuality. I don't feel the need to reinforce those beliefs by being obstinate about how I refer to them.

It might not be out of hate, truly, but I'm personally inclined to want people to feel included and cared about, showing love in that regard. I personally feel that people are more likely to feel The Spirit that way.",1680307351.0

"Nails","t5_2qhwc","When you say 'acrylics', are these just a full cover tip with gel polish? They have the look of a sculpted nail (powder and liquid) but the overall shape of a press-on.

Maybe you want to share a photo from a different angle? If this is a sculpted nail, from what I can see, the nail is completely lacking an apex, which is super important for an enhancement that length.

Building an apex on an acrylic nail is an important step in achieving a strong and durable nail extension that is less likely to break or lift.

The apex is the highest point of the nail where the stress from daily wear and tear is concentrated, and should sit in the back third of the nail. By creating a defined apex, the acrylic is reinforced and provides a stronger structure to the entire nail. Without an apex, the nail will be weak and prone to breaking.

In addition to providing strength, building an apex also helps to create a more natural-looking nail. The apex mimics the natural curve of the nail bed, and without it, the nail may appear flat or too thick in some areas. The nails you have done here have some great points; the cuticle area looks pretty tidy overall. I'd be interested to hear back from you with regards to how durable these are.

EDIT: I somehow managed to miss that there were three other photos from different angles - my apologies! Forget what I said about 'did you apply powder and liquid', it seems clear you did. Everything else I said stands. Your work is very neat; work on the apex and I think most people here would be envious of your work! :)",1680307351.0

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","> Since 3.15 game is downward spiral of constant nerfs. That's a fact.

No, that's an opinion, the downward spiral part. Yes, nerfs have constantly been happening. Buffs too. We are stronger now, will be stronger next league, than we were at 3.15... if you know how the game works and can adapt to the nerfs to your build. If you can't, and you keep trying to force the same thing to work... then yeah, you are on ""a downward spiral"". But that's skill issue, nothing more.

>Amount of nerfs vary between leagues, but they pretty much never felt, nor feel ""fair"". 

Opinion. I disagree. One could even say objectively wrong, nerfs will never feel fair (to you) unless they nerf something you agree is too strong - but then that's unfair to people that like how strong that skill was.  Fair depends on your perspective, and balance should virtually never be evaluated on ""how fair does this feel?"".

>Toxicity is always a reaction to something.

True, but not always a valid reaction. You can choose to react in a lot of ways to things. I could choose to slap someone for asking me for the time... that's a reaction to something, but an invalid and unnecessary one.",1680307351.0

We don't know, but taking your uncle's words at face value for the sake of discussion...

It depends on a lot of factors including launch titles, price, whether it's backwards compatible, and ""pending"" games I still have on the Switch.

If it's backwards compatible, I'm probably getting it at launch unless it's too expensive, and sell/give the Switch to someone else. Otherwise I'll probably wait; would rather not have multiple consoles connected to the TV.",1680307351.0

Circumcision is a permanent procedure that can affect a person's sensitivity and sexual ability. Many nerve endings in the foreskin can increase the sensation and enjoyment of sexual activity. Circumcision violates a person's right to bodily autonomy and to decide what happens to their body. A person's freedom to make decisions regarding their body, including whether or not to get circumcised, must be respected. Circumcision at birth, of course, does not help with this. Even though some people might not consider circumcision to be a big deal, it's important to understand that it can have impacts on a person's health and well-being. Everyone should be entitled to make their own decisions about their bodies, and we should respect their choices and autonomy.",1680307352.0

"BAbike","t5_2sfn4","as many others have said, the morning is the ideal time strictly from a wind perspective. mornings are colder and sometimes can have a decent amount of condensation from the fog.

there are also significantly less cars, and so depending on how you descend from the top of hawk hill, if you go back down the front side (or come back to the roundabout from mccullough), the preferred time is the morning. anyone who has descended in the afternoon knows it's a giant clusterf because of all the cars going in/out of parking spaces.",1680307354.0

I was just diagnosed a couple of months ago at 55 and I had always assumed my anxiety and depression from about age 5 stemmed mostly for a) heredity and b) stress about my mother's poor health.

It's not that you believe it's rude to honk for a date--that wouldn't fly with either me or my husband, nor would it fly with any of my friends whose kids were going on a date--but rather due to how you handled it. 

If a young person isn't aware that it's rude and disrespectful to honk for a date instead of walking to the door and ringing/knocking, it's not their fault. It's on their parents for not teaching them about manners. You could have easily have used the time you took to be intimidating to instead say, ""Hey, this is a date, and it's not cool to just honk, so please don't do it again. The better way to pick up a date is to walk to the door and ring the bell, so how about we give you a mulligan on this mistake? Turn off your car, take the keys out of the ignition, and walk to the door to ask for her, ok?"" 

He'd probably have found the entire thing extremely old-fashioned and even bizarre, but it's still a much better outcome than the existing mess.",1680307354.0

* **Model of your computer** - For example: *""HP Spectre X360 14-EA0023DX""*
* **Your Windows and device specifications** - You can find them by going to go to Settings > *""System""* > *""About""*
* **What troubleshooting steps you have performed** - Even sharing little things you tried (like rebooting) can help us find a better solution!
* **Any error messages you have encountered** - Those long error codes are not gibberish to us!
* **Any screenshots or logs of the issue** - You can upload screenshots other useful information in your post or comment, and use [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) for text (such as logs). You can learn how to take screenshots [here](https://screenshot.help/windows).

All posts must be help/support related. If everything is working without issue, then this probably is not the subreddit for you, so you should also post on a discussion focused subreddit like /r/Windows.

Maybe look like the raw scores you get, you might be getting close Ni/Ne scores, but that would still mean your Dom function isn't Ne (when I do most tests it is pretty clearly my favored function). You could do sarkinova as well, my recommendation is look at the percentage for the functions and if some are close then read about it and see which you relate to more, the highest is your Dom function and look at the type possibilities that have that first.

If everything is stock wiring wise it's possible a ground cable on the frame is dirty and keeping something awake.

It's very unlikely it's battery the 6 volts you see now does not indicate only half of the cells are connected, that's just not how these batteries work. If there was an internal short in the battery it would still charge to 12v but the current supply would drop significantly under load. This is what the machine your parts store tests for.

I know many people here have said it but I do think you have a parasitic draw, the question is what is drawing it down.

If you could tell us what region your in this could help.
Ex. If you live in the northern US they use slot of salt on the roads and this combined with water can severely degrade the braded ground cables, which could lead to a draw.

If you want to work to supplement your UBI but there is no work then some will be giving up a lot. 

This will not be utopia, it will be millions of people that have lost jobs that allowed them to live better than they ever could on UBI.

X isn't CB... X isn't GG... X is acting on his on volition. Then they had those 2 clowns join that zaceed and Jay Hobb try to start random shit. Nobody even knows who they are.

You don't get to start something with CG and take their time away from the shit they are doing just because you so please. If they don't warrant you worth their time then so be it?

GG has chosen that path to show they will initiate over nothing, pivot, and inevitably backpedal. They had their opportunities for war. They refused them.

Now when CG are in an arc and don't want to humor their tiring attempts for conflict you try to paint it is what? They just aren't interested man. GG has been way to wishy washy for them to want to RP with them it is illogical.

They go from ""WAR"" to Jay Hobbs or Zaceed sitting on the block trying to be chummy. You understand how weird that becomes? Then 20 minutes later ""but were at war.""

They are just weirdos dude trying to get a piece of the pie at any cost. Their entire gang was built upon that.  


To top it off CG would just mop them rinse and repeat then wat? 2.0 hits tomorrow they hang up ALL of their other RP cause GG wants to go out with a bang? Clownshow like I said.",1680307357.0

I (26 F) am married to K (25 M) , i met him a few year back when my best friend and his best friend started dating, after that our friend groups kind of joined together. So all of my husband‚Äôs friends are also my friends and all my friends are his friends.

I‚Äôve know my best friend (A) for 15 years, we‚Äôve always been extremely close and lived together at one point, she‚Äôs literally part of my family, she comes to all of my family events, my siblings refer to her as their sister and she just been extremely involved in my life for years.
Now, me and my husband have a 6 month old daughter. My dad is extremely wealthy so he helps us out financially until my daughter is old enough to go to school, then i will take a job at his company that pays well. My husband has a job that he works from 7am - 4 pm and then afterwards him and his friends often hangout at my house or at one of their house‚Äôs. 

Here‚Äôs the problem, my husband‚Äôs best friend cheated on my best friend a few weeks ago, she‚Äôs completely heartbroken and since they lived together my husband and i agreed that it‚Äôs okay that she stays with us until they work things out. She‚Äôs not really up to seeing him just yet. A is a huge help with the baby, she‚Äôs so good with her and the baby loves her. When my husband and his friends get home they normally talk until 8 pm ish so he doesn‚Äôt help with the baby too much when he gets home, which i don‚Äôt mind it‚Äôs just nice to have a little help. Yesterday night my husband opened the front door , peaked his head in, looked right at me and A , rolled his eyes and walked out. Him and his friends came in a few moments later and were all being cold and rude to A all evening. After an hour or two my husband walks right up to me and A and says ‚Äúdoes she always have to be here? I want to bring (friends name) here tonight.‚Äù And rolled his eyes, i responded ‚Äúif i want to bring my best friend into the house my dad paid for, i can, and if i choose to have somebody help me with the baby that you‚Äôre not looking after, it‚Äôs going to be her.‚Äù His friends just sat there silently and he just walked away and sat back down . He‚Äôs giving me the silent treatment and A left and is staying with her mom as she feels uncomfortable being in the house now. So AITA?

"musicproduction","t5_2rfyt","If people are pushing their preferences it should only be for reasons regarding their software being superior for their specific practice. You don't see film composers using or recommending FL Studio over Cubase/Logic for good reason - same way you don't see Engineers recommend Cubase over PT.

* If you want to work with live loops: Ableton
   * Logic's looping system that was introduced a few updates ago is really strong, but I feel like Ableton's is still better and the UI allows for really practical and easy use - especially considering that it's also available on Windows and pairs well with the Push.
* Recording: Logic Pro or Pro Tools (PT recommended more)
   * Pro Tools is still the go-to software in studios across the west and for good reason. The modularity of things like count-ins and impromptu time signature changes that don't actually affect your project file is insanely powerful and the playlist system is great for organising your takes. Logic is also great but even as someone who has used it for almost a decade now, recording feels like a slower process on it just because of the small micro-seconds of extra work here and there in between takes or with sudden unexpected changes in project structure mid-session.
* Working to picture: Solid choices between Logic Pro or Cubase (PT is good too nowadays)
   * Logic Pro is much easier on the eyes and you get the benefit of Apple's incredible handling of low-latency audio. On the other hand Cubase is significantly more modular with things like infinite subfolders and a lot more flexible signal flow for large scale templates and orchestral projects. In contrast, Logic Pro only allows for two subfolders deep. PT used to get stick for their rubbish MIDI handling but it's been polished. The benefit of working in PT is that when the time comes for a recording session, exporting stems and reimporting into a fresh PT file is nice and smooth.
   * I'm not sure if Cubase has the alternatives system, but Logic's alternatives allows you to have multiple versions of projects under a single project file. It's really powerful and I'm able to have multiple versions of a cue within one file and keeps it really clean.
   * It's worth noting that for all Logic users the budget for a mac that can process loads of sample libraries and effects without breaking sweat is a wallet-burner, so building a system for cheaper that can run Cubase or PT on Windows is an option, or even as slave machines to host sample libraries with Vienna Ensemble Pro.
* Electronic production: FL Studio, Logic Pro, Ableton
   * If we're gonna pretend for a second that the ahoy hoy pirate ship doesn't exist, the price of FL isn't that far behind the other DAWs, so if someone's going to buy I would recommend just holding on for something like Ableton or Logic. I used FL 10 & 11 and remember how easy it was to create really bad habits due to the old UI and workflow (especially as a beginner who didn't know anything about EQs, compressors or reverb), but it looks much better and beginner-friendly now. The other DAWs speak for themselves. Great stock plugins and an easy workflow.

Free trials teach you nothing unless you're already proficient in a DAW and can see how other ones behave and achieve the same results. At that point, all you're comparing is the workflow and stock plugins. The notion that people shouldn't recommend certain DAWs because it only matters how you use them is valid, but also ignores the fact that they all have their obvious strong suits.",1680307359.0

There‚Äôs absolutely no drama at all, jus her wearing the most expensive outfits and diamonds and goin to photo shoots when she‚Äôs not with her kids. She tries to sound like she‚Äôs still a normal person in society which is so funny to me cuz she uses her private jet more than her car. Her friends are yes people who agrees with everything she says because they love the perks that come with being friends with her. She donated stuff to kids in need but she did it in season 1 and this season which indicates she only does it for show since I‚Äôve never seen her post anything about it on her social media.

Reason I say 100's is it will help you understand your worth in the job market. What you're over qualified for, underqualifed for, etc.. and also what you are and aren't interested in.

Like there are ways to handle the champion zed and denying him the snowball is the most important part. Every time he roams if he doesn't come back with a kill against a competent mid laner he's losing xp gold and plates.

Maybe Kirsch was just a name Richie chose but Bailey being a fake name makes a lot more sense to me and adds a slither of a justification. 

During that monologue Wayne could have said ""I had to disappear from the news circuit, get a fake name, cover the tracks of my kids too and have them play along"" but inherently them covering up themselves is impossible without the most thorough flashbacking and explanations that could explain how it was possible. It would have been better not to do at least not in this generation of film fans who pan a film if it's in any way implausible.",1680307361.0

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz",">A more realistic example is gambling at a casino poker table. You could play, lose, and blame it on luck or you could be the guy that learns to count card. With this context in mind, you could say that luck isn‚Äôt the biggest determinant and that you‚Äôre still using luck as a scapegoat because you‚Äôre blaming luck instead of on your own actions.

This is actually a good example. Yes you can gain an edge by counting cards but only at select few games. If the casino implements a continuous shuffle machines no amount of learning how to count cards will give you an edge over the casino. In such cases trying to claim that people who made money by gambling was a result of their effort/actions is the cop-out argument.

"EvilGeniuses","t5_2ucso","I kinda think Inspired and Jojo need to be separated. I don't think they're as great of a mid-jungle duo as a lot of people think.

As a fan, it was irritating to watch that interview they did in the middle of the split where they admit they don't take the regular split seriously.

I agree with you about FBI and Vulcan. FBI is getting a lot of flame in the main LOL sub....which is fair, because he sucked this series. But I also just don't think FBI is a Jinx/Zeri player (at least not this split), and I could not understand why EG kept drafting Zeri and Jinx today.",1680307362.0

I would never physically punish animals but I don‚Äôt think you can actually claim that positive reinforcement is the best because it doesn‚Äôt have negative effects. Positive punishment is the most effective way of getting animals to change their behaviour. In humans it‚Äôs obvious that the long term effects of positive punishment often result in long term dysfunction (as much as adults like to pretend that they‚Äôre grateful they were spanked as a kid) What negative effects are you referring to? Unless it‚Äôs like peeing indoors or a something else that negatively impacts the owners, I think that barring ethics that the ‚Äúbest ‚Äú training method for results remains punishment.",1680307362.0

"demsocialists","t5_3hs93","So roughly in the late 18th century liberalism was kinda the first modern ideology that proposed democracy and equal rights. They were also big on economic freedom understood as the freedom of enterprise without interference of the state. 

As time passed, it turned out that most liberals of the time kinda stopped their support for these ideas at a certain point. 

So they supported representative democracy, buut often with wealth requirements to vote, and God forbid workplace democracy! What about economic freedom of the entrepreneur to decide what to do with their capital and their employees?

They supported human rights to freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equality before the law and all that good stuff. Oh and especially property rights! Unless you're a woman, than you don't get any of that. Also, worker rights? Nah, what about economic freedom of the entrepreneur to decide what to do with their capital and their employees?

So then along came early socialists and started saying things like wait, why do poor people have no say? Why do workers spend their whole days putting their noses to the grindstone at the factory and are still barely able to afford food and shelter? They proposed expanding the understanding of democracy and human rights.

So over the next two hundred years liberalism has been greatly influenced by socialism, to the point they conceded that democracy needs to apply even to women and people of color. Liberalism also influenced socialism somewhat, giving birth to social democracy and whatnot.

However there's still that fundamental difference in how liberalism and socialism understand democracy and human rights, despite the fact that both ideologies consider them important. 

**TL;DR Basically most socialists consider liberalism not to go far enough with this - liberal democracy is not fully democratic, and we deserve more human rights than what liberals are willing to concede.**

I called myself ""Fatimamansioned"" after the 90s Irish indie band  Fatima Mansions (infamously named after a notoriously run-down Dublin housing complex ).

I thought the abrasive FM lyrics of the late Cathal Coughlan seemed strangely prescient of the  world of the 2020s.

"Tsukihime","t5_3104d","> Not a fan of that change. I liked that it wasn't acknowledged. Made it kind of dark. Holds even more weight after her backstory is revealed.

That's just dark for the sake of being dark which I would not call good writing at all. Shiki acknowledging what happened makes sense since Roa's host are fully aware of what happen even if they don't have full control. Shiki is just a good human at heart and he cares about Kohaku, the fact that he shows regret for what happened even though it wasn't entirely his fault is logical and fundamentally a good change in regards to Shiki's character overall.

> Personally, one of the strongest selling points for tsukihime and fate, for me, was a serious work that didn't shy away from sex scenes.

Sex scenes are a pretty low standard in the visual novel medium honestly, Tsukihime and F/SN are also among the visual novels that have sex scenes just in order to attract the eroge audience and by extension extra sales. They are essentially the worst quality porn you can find, and it's even worse if you read them with an English translation, because Japanese porn does not translate well at all into English.

I think what the remake did is a good alternative as far as Arcueid's route is concerned since Kinoko essentially wrote the beginning of a sex scene. This keeps the maturity of the original work, while intelligently handling the censorship.

> My perception of the character changed, and i named the key reasons for it. 

You didn't, though? You could have elaborated on your argument by saying that she looks/sounds a lot goofier because of her voice actress, or the sprites, but you don't. To me (like many of your comments) it appears to be just for the sake of complaining since you seem to have a strange hatred for the remake.

> Then we can agree to disagree. But Shiki did totally ogle those godly Ciel thighs at the start of the game. You could say ""it set the tone"".

This is probably one of the most in-character scenes for Shiki, lol. He's one of the horniest visual novel protagonists around, and Kinoko didn't censor that at all in the remake, which is a great thing. Regardless, there's nothing wrong with having comedic scenes here and there, in a serious and tense story like Tsukihime. Even a visual novel like Muramasa is [pretty heavy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1abxtnt-ao) on [comedic scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oi89YIK5HqE) and that doesn't ruin the serious tone or anything. If anything I'm grateful that such scenes exist, because you can't really build a tense atmosphere without introducing some fluff.

> Can't buy digital goods in my country unfortunately. Maybe the near side+far side collectors edition box in 2045.

Amazon.jp doesn't deliver in your country? Besides the original Tsukihime and F/SN, you can still get the PC version of Mahoyo or Tsukihime RE quite easily there.",1680307363.0

"Crainn","t5_2s6vv","Hi glad to hear she's had some respite. Over my adult years I've become housebound often for several months at a time due to overwhelming dread and panic being alone around strangers in enclosed spaces. I have dropped out of three university programmes over 6 years due to repeated panic attacks in classrooms for one example. I also have some issues with germs but that one has become completely manageable thankfully. I only mention all this as I also have been a cannabis user my entire adult life. I will say be extremely careful with edibles. I have had the worst panic attacks of my life from edibles in recent years. I am a cannabis user of 10 years only having quit 5 months ago due to inhibiting me socially and worsening my anxiety in general for years now. 

High potency thc strains are inbalanced and typically contain less than 1 percent cbd with lowers levels of cannabinoids generally, these strains have been criticised in recent years for mental health dangers with good reason and make up a huge percentage of the irish black market. If edibles work for your daughter then that's great. But I only caution you because my experience, the many users I know and just information about cannabis generally is that for a huge proportion of people and most that I know is that it heightens self awareness, anxiety and socially reserved behaviours/ reclusiveness. It's extremely easy to become a daily habit and something that may have acutely brought relief with acute usage can become debilitating with regular usage. I am certainly not anti cannabis and intend to use infrequently from now on, maybe few times a year. I'm not telling you not to give her edibles especially if they are bringing some relief just advising you to be very careful with dosage and regularity and be observent. Many cannabis users are daily users and dismiss these problems so I'm making sure you know yourself, for susceptible people what may be only mildly negative to some may be much worse for another. 

I have a pot by noids machine which would save you a lot of hassle decarbing and infusing oils. You can find their website by googling pot by noids. Literally just push a button and zero guess work and massive reduction in smell. Not to mention not ruining your bud by overdecarbing/ overheating which is easily done in an oven. There's always some loss. They aren't too pricey.

I would also advise looking into ashwaganda ksm66. It lowers cortisol and has serious stress reduction properties. Just make sure to do some reading on it as it stimulates thyroid and may not be suitable for certain people prone to hyperthyroidism for example. I will say that this stuff was absolutely a lifesaver.

I also would recccomend looking into L theanine which is a green tea extract. Stuff is also very effective and easily available in chemists. It works for a large percentage of people. Both it and ashwaganda have research and supporting data if you use Google scholar.

Lavender oil has some research supporting it too. Not to mention cbd is incredibly effective in my experience but i find personally this is best used in higher dosages and bought from European vendors which are much cheaper. You also need to know how to check quality too as a lot if stuff for sale here is overpriced low potency or just snake oil on the shelves here.

Lastly anxiety/ depression has correlates with magnesium deficiencies which is a vital component in basic nerve action. I would check basic deficiencies as these also have suggested to play some part in anxiety and depressive disorders. In particular fish oil d3. D3 should ideally be taken with magnesium and k2.

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","> Not necessarily. A relative of mine was headhunted and then given the sack. The HR department mocked him (I mean, what professional does that?) as they told him he couldn't sue them for unfair dismissal. He didn't. He sued them for wrongful dismissal. And won handsomely. 

So, to give clarity on how your relative may have been successful for *wrongful* dismissal in this entirely different scenario would be if they dismissed him, but didn't provide the correct amount of notice, or didn't follow a procedure that was outlined in the contract, or both - that would be an occasion where an employee is *wrongfully* dismissed.

In OPs (entirely different) situation - where there's a failure to agree to an amendment to the terms of contract, the employer (again - in this scenario) could effectively dismiss the employee and there'd be no recourse. 

If the employer fails to pay any contractual notice (or statutory in the absence of a contractual notice period), or fails to follow a process as outlined by any contractual agreement, then they'd have a potential claim to wrongful dismissal. 

However if they met their contractual obligations (or statutory obligations in relation to notice periods), they wouldn't have any claim to wrongful dismissal.",1680307365.0

"gameideas","t5_2rh2b",">In MMO games, we often see online guides for powerleveling new characters in order to maximize efficiency. This has been especially true for WoW Classic, where ""speedrunning"" the 0 - 60 grind has become its own type of game within a game.

This will always be the case and cant be avoided. But i think if someone wants to play the game in that way so be it. But it think most players dont have the time and will to speedrun. Because u have to sink tons of hours into it to become somewhat relevant. Take WoW for example not every player raids with the most efficient method most players i played with just want to have a good time with friends. We helped each other to get cool mounts and did some questlines for it as a group.

&#x200B;

>MMOs tend to push players towards the most efficient path, and players will share their tips on how to create the best deck to level up towards the most optimal cards. If they best way to unlock cards is to play the best deck, then this problem gets even worse as everyone will move to netdecking or be left behind.

mhhh, that a problem for sure. That cant be avoided completly, if someone wants to powerplay the game. I think the best approche would be to have consequences for each step u take. So for example u want card x but ur deck sucks und u cant beat the questline than u have different strategies to beat it. But if u choose one way maybe u have it more difficult on the next boss. Say u start with random Cards. Not everyone has the same cards and can lean towards different synergies. But now u have to choose will i take the direct approche and strengthen my decks synergies or will i go down the path and create a complete new one. Also what role i like to play in raids? The more options and concequences the better i think.

I dont think of MMOs like mobile games more like e.g. Path of Exile. And i think most players dont power play the game.  Not ever player plays Meta champs in League of Legends. A professional YuGiOh Player said, for him as a professional player it is the best enviroment if their is only one best deck (tier 0 meta). Because so he knows whats the best deck and knows what to expect. A Meta with deckvariaty is difficult for him because he has to much options and cant prepare properly. It doesnt fit perfectly but lets say there are different approches to heal and all are somewhat equal in power then there is also no best way to collect cards. The next step is if you want to play Healer Strategy 3 then your way to getting there is different. Because you need differnt Quests and have other card then other people.

You start with a different card pool -->  which strategy u want to play to beat questlines or early raids --> refine ur cardpool until u can do better raids where u need a more clear strategy and a more refined deck.

I would think: If you take Path of Exile for example but without trading items. Then each strong item you have is valuable and has meaning. You have tons of different builds but u must adapt on the way because you dont have the best items yet or you may find other strong ones and play other builds because ur equip is better for this dungeon or boss. Path of Exile with Cards and Raids/ Bosses. But u dont farm mobs you battle enemies with your deck. At the end you will get drops and refine your cardpool and or strengthen your cards. I think something like this would work. There can also be hard coded questlines for strategy defining cards. Or Dungeons where specific cards drop more often. You can do this allone or with friend / strangers and get bonuses for playing in groups. Combine this with some ideas from before i think that could work.

Gloomhaven fighting system for example could work here as a inspiration. It is an dungeon crawler with cards (but u dont get card with a level up like in Gloomhaven) u have to drop them or craft them.

Maybe an anecdote: I was the main traider for all kinds of currency (i toke over the whole market) in Path of Exile for atleast 2-3 weaks on my server because with this i got tons of currency. The fun fact was i didnt play the game anymore and it was boring as hell but the optimal way to get items i wanted.

Maybe MMO ist the right profesional name for it and TCG would be wrong more CCG.

And even the smallest act of insurrection pushes our lines forward. And then remember this. The Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks, it leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the siege. Remember this. Try.",1680307366.0

"OnePiecePowerScaling","t5_34km3c","He didn‚Äôt go ‚Äútoe to toe‚Äù with shit. He stepped on WB‚Äôs bisento after an attack meant for fodder and promptly got flung off like an insect. He then proceeded to get destroyed and tossed under an island by a sick old corpse with almost no haki and having heart attacks 

Ace is fodder, even fighting him is not a feat. And Akainu didn‚Äôt even fight him, Ace took a hit to save Luffy, that‚Äôs not a fight. He didn‚Äôt take on ‚Äúall the WB pirates‚Äù he took on the remaining commanders for a few minutes and didn‚Äôt accomplish shit other than giving an injury to one of the weakest ones

Him going extreme diff with another admiral is not a feat, it‚Äôs expected. And if you‚Äôre trying to point out the length of the fight Ace fought Jinbe for 5 days, it‚Äôs not impressive. Kizaru didn‚Äôt have Rayleigh ‚Äúsweating‚Äù, old Rayleigh was rusty, out of shape, and distracted. Meanwhile Kizaru got completely blocked by an old shipbuilder decades rusty and out of shape that was also distracted 

Fujitora doesn‚Äôt have any serious feats whatsoever so comparing feats is asinine, absolutely nothing in the series even implies much less says the newer admirals are weaker than the original admirals",1680307366.0

"specialed","t5_2vum5","SLP here. I understand your frustration because I encounter the same problem‚Ä¶but I just want to point out that communication is more than requesting. ABA seems to only focus on that‚Ä¶and at home they probably have other ways of requesting that are effective (body language, gestures, etc). 

I personally (as the SLP) would focus on Aided Language Stimulation and model different communicative functions without expectations. I would focus on core vocabulary across activities, contexts, and settings. I‚Äôd then show the parents how to focus on one core vocabulary word per day or week to ease them into it.

Since you are a para supporting the students at school, you should be collaborating with the SLP and following his/her lead and whatever model they are using (regardless of your ABA training).",1680307366.0
"lastimages","t5_2wjmx","I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss :(

This really hits deep because of how strong of a relationship I have with my momma.

I‚Äôm doing much better now and try to just make up for it all by being the best son I can be.

My momma loves to write cards/letters and chat with pen pals. If that‚Äôs something you‚Äôd be interested in, DM me and we can set something up, but no hard feelings if you don‚Äôt want to.

I‚Äôm suspicious that any additional data they have on you could be used to deny coverage or increase premiums.

‚ÄúOh says here you swerved a little bit 30 minutes before the accident, must have been impaired or drowsy or something! CLAIM DENIED‚Äù or ‚Äú2 mph over in a school zone last month, rates are going up!‚Äù That kind of thing.

"fansofcriticalrole","t5_4wydu2","Thanks for your comment, and the effort rewriting. I do want to hear from people that are enjoying it - if the lore transports you, that is totally legit, and  your view of what might change going forward carries weight.

So I hope you're right. I don't object to lore. I'm hoping it was just ""dumping"" because Matt was in a rush to squeeze stuff in before the Solstice, and the lore-delivery takes a different shape going forward.",1680307368.0
"pokemongo","t5_34jka","I‚Äôve joined about 650 lifetime raids through pokegenie, and probably another 150 or so just from random friends inviting me. Remotes are great because I can send them when the legendary is good, and when I have time - which is usually after in person raids have finished in my area. 

I live in a major metro area so in person could work for me - but I‚Äôm not interested in spending hours of my life playing scheduling simulator in some discord to try to get groups together, spending either a ton of time walking and waiting or a ton of gas driving to raids, and then hoping that the people I organized show up - and I have better things to do when I‚Äôm casually out and about than play a mobile game anyways. This change isn‚Äôt gonna get people like me to raid more in person, we‚Äôll just leave and do something else. I‚Äôve already uninstalled, no point in playing if I have to do it during specific hours in specific areas. There are tons of things that compete for my free time, including other games that don‚Äôt require this, and even other Pok√©mon games that can be played whenever, wherever, and have a MUCH more engaging gameplay loop than Pokemon Go does. 

Terrible change. Hope everyone who doesn‚Äôt raid still enjoys the game, but I can‚Äôt really see the player base staying too healthy after this. Most local communities were dead or dying before remote raids were even introduced, and their introduction almost certainly allowed the game to stay alive past when it would have died. Without raiding being accessible, there isn‚Äôt really much to do in Pokemon Go.",1680307368.0

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","Parenting in a society bleeds out of the family unit. We need to help each other. We don't know enough about the date's background or his parents or whether he has a sister, which would massively help, but perhaps neither he nor his parents are fully prepared for all of this. We're all on a learning curve daily and the poor lad's 17. 

You could have taken this as an opportunity to help him and, by proxy, your daughter. A little bit of empathy, a little bit of parenting, a little bit of education. He was probably really proud and excited for his date and you've shown him nothing about how to treat a woman. From your description, he seemed willing to correct an understandable bit of immaturity, showing an ironic maturity by was trying to get out of the car.

Are you happy you're 6'1""and you've stood over a 5' boy doing his best? This is his first go at this, he'll get it wrong a lot. You did too. Difference is, he's learning and you appear to have failed to learn. If the boot was on the other foot and you were the short one, you'd have addressed this by negotiation or you'd have shown your true colours as the coward you are and not said a word. I'm 6'4"". Am I writing here that I'd put you on your arse for this? No.

What is the outcome here? You were trying to teach manners? Your method is appalling and you could have achieved that and the date was receptive. But that wasn't the goal was it? Your goal was to swing your dick around, bully a small boy and assert dominance on a daughter. Incidentally, you've just eroded your relationship with her, you know that, yes?

Think the next date will be better? She'll probably meet him around the corner and you'll be oblivious. 

What a massive prick. What a missed opportunity to actually be a man and a father.

The community, including a lot of the players who don't like it, have decided that getting good at Buildmart is just flat out impossible and there's no point in even trying. Grian's manager strategy is good for him because he's a *very good manager*, but it's treated as the one and only correct way to play. 

5up's two build strategy has a lot of potential if he has more chances to develop it or if more people try it. Dream's one build strategy was going really really well until it got tripped up by a single weird build that hasn't returned since. Techno's legendary strat can't be replicated in full, but there are definitely parts of it that people could use. 

If people were willing to try new strategies that worked with their own skill sets instead of just throwing up their hands and going ""oh it's Buildmart why bother?"" we could see an incredibly dynamic and unpredictable game.

How major that distinction is depends greatly on what you believe Putin's planned endgame was.

I'm fairly sure the goal was regime change, creation of client states like Belarus via installing puppet governments and gaining de facto control of strategic resources and locations rather than official control through outright annexation.

Which is pretty much exactly what we and the US tried to do in Iraq.

The more major difference is that Russia is trying to overthrow a legitimately elected government while we were overthrowing a dictator. I still don't think either war was justified or legal, but if there is a moral difference between the two wars I think it lies there.",1680307370.0

"preppers","t5_2riow","Definitely see what you have for spares at home. Can easily make a nice BOB or get home bag out of items in your junk drawer. They won't be tier 1 items, but redundant items in the house may be more useful in a 2nd location like your vechicle. 

Check into heirloom seeds, even if you have the seeds on hand you'll be ahead by a margin. Simple Dixie cups will make nice seed starting pots that can be bought at the dollar store. Depending on your location inside seed starting has already begun. 

If stock piling food, watch sodium content and count calories. You'd be suprised by how little calories are in some food items. Rotate your pantry to consume shelf stable items on a regular basis. 

Agreed with the other comment, health and finances. Don't get sucked into the prepper porn (I did). Of doom and gloom and AR-15's. Part of it is bullets and body armor but you need to feed yourself and others if they are around.

I don't really want him dead, but I got annoyed with him when he powered up in Crimson Death and used it to manuver himself into going to Ireland which he treated like it was a vacation. Then I found him really offputting when he basically overheard Anita in her mind thinking ""maybe she MIGHT want a kid"" and turning it into a done deal. He's been asking for kids since Affliction (""If I had it my way we'd already be pregnant""). Then in Serpentine when Anita and Micah had to spend time away dealing with crime or coalition stuff he was angry and then complains that he needs sex twice a day. I can understand if he has a high sex drive, he needed to be more understanding about what was going on outside of his own world at the time. 

Pros - he does take care of Anita and everyone else. He does stand up for himself. He is able to be more independant and self sufficiant, and yes he does center Anita.

Micah has been left wanting as well in the writing. He just never really gets any screentime. I would think that he has more to him that we just aren't seeing. Plus, you have to admit in Narcissus in Chains when he is first introduced it was a very hot scene when he seduced Anita in the shower.",1680307371.0

I started drinking it and when I finished he propositioned me (should we get out of here and have sex); I told him to wait there, went to get my friends and told them all we have to leave right now.

We went to another club and 10 mins later I was collapsing and couldn‚Äôt even stand up (he must have drugged me). I remember my friends putting me in a taxi and getting me back to the hotel where I woke up on the bathroom floor.

Hello /u/nartianhn,

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1284o0c/what_can_i_f27_a_non_earning_partner_do_in_a/) was removed for the following reason(s):

**Your title did not include at least two ages/genders or was not formatted correctly**

Posts must: 

1. include details about the involved parties including ages, genders, and length of relationship, and

2. request advice in real situations involving two or more people

The ages and genders can go anywhere in your title, but have to be in one of the following formats:

`44M` `35 F` `23-NB` or `M44` `F 35` `NB-23`

The automod rule can process the genders M, F, T, A, NB, FTM, and MTF but more can be added.

Please resubmit with a corrected title.

That's not what it's doing at all. If you're being paid $400 on every two week paycheck, it annualizes that and see you're going to make only $10,400/year and then taxes you according to that amount - which is zero. It's doing the same thing whether you're making $400 every two weeks or $4000 every two weeks - calculating how much you'd make in the year ($10,400 or $104,000) and tax you accordingly.

* Don't disagree with the mainstream belief. Marciano is the best dining hall and saying otherwise will lead you to alot of trouble. There is currently a blacklist of all non-Marciano enjoyers and they are actively being bullied by seniors and juniors as well as grad students
* Whenever you go to class be sure to go up to a new person you never talked to before and look them straight in the eyes and say  ""I can't wait to learn \[Insert Class Subject\] today I'm so existed, only in BU you can BU."" Look at them for 3 more seconds in the eyes then walk away. If you don't comply with these rules rumors will spread and you will being socially exiled
* Before you start classes go to central campus and spend at least 2 hours stepping on and off the BU seal like it game of hop scotch. While doing so you should scream ""BU SCREAMS BC IS BETTER"" at anyone who you see with BU merch. This is to make sure you can graduate in time.

There is explicit subsidisation by the governments, because they want to establish themselves as travel and tourist hubs, consequently helping them boost their non-oil revenues. 
For example, as an airline, based on their own numbers, Etihad is a very inefficient airline - much better run and more cost efficient airlines around the world have gone into bankruptcy. However, Etihad survives (and offers low fares) simply because it keeps getting capital infusion from the govt of Abu Dhabi every year. Even all of Etihad‚Äôs subsidiaries/ investments failed, from Alitalia to Jet Airways

However, that mantra isn‚Äôt always the same one with each session. The mantra is simply a reminder that what is important is the now: sitting here and embracing the act of doing nothing; carving this time for yourself. A time that is a small percentage compared to your whole day. Telling your mind, ‚Äútime to stop overthinking, let‚Äôs be at rest for these 10 minutes.‚Äù Its more of a mantra of ‚Äúlet it go,‚Äù than forcing yourself to let it go. Feeling yourself breathe in and out helps immensely.

Battery isn't great compared to even the Galaxy watch and Apple watch, but it does charge up pretty quickly. Sleep tracking has been way more consistent than my Galaxy watch and my apple watch (it's important for me to note that on my Apple watch, I use third party apps as it wasn't a stock feature back then). I do really like the Google home integration, but it's assistant not really being linked to your phone's assistant is pretty annoying. I also like the quick connect to my Android optimized earphones when I'm just going in with the watch at the gym.

Nine sets of plans per week (I am allowed to combine handwriting with my grammar plans).  Nine.  I have to make daily hand written notes on every kid I see for intervention and small groups and turn them in.

I get the same pay as interventionists who pull groups of 3 kids 5x a day.  I get the same pay as the PE teacher who does zero lesson plans and plays music while they run around as they scroll facebook.  Neither one of them has to do report cards, or parent conferences or field trips or any of the million things we get stuck doing.

Aggressive assholes/criminals look for easy targets. They can sense it with a glance. If you keep moving while not giving a single shit that's usually enough for them to ignore you. Someone mentioned looking through people which is pretty spot on. There's a sort of indifference for natives of big cities. After seeing how it is for awhile people aren't easily startled. Until you get that feel for it you need to play the part. 

Being Asian, you also have to know that there have been attacks specifically targeting Asians in the bay area for some time. Especially SF and Oakland. Outside of being aware of your surroundings if it ever comes to the point where you feel you're in danger and can't get away then you need to be ready to stand your ground. Don't engage if you can help it, but don't be afraid to push back either if there's a need for it. This includes telling people to fuck off or even fight if necessary.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","If I prod ChatGPT with knowledge of the specific disagreement in mind, we can access the nuance that is present within its knowledge space. The result actually extracted a more nuanced understanding (and true, which is important when dealing with Language Models) that what I had before I read it. 

Prompt: Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett disagreement on free will goes beyond their definitions, it's really about the usefulness of a definition that is not what most people think it means. Can you explain why is this disagreement?

> The disagreement between Sam Harris and Daniel Dennett on free will revolves around the question of whether or not the traditional concept of free will, as commonly understood by most people, is a useful or coherent concept. Dennett argues that the traditional concept of free will is incoherent and that we should adopt a more nuanced and scientifically informed view of agency and decision-making. He argues that our common-sense idea of free will is based on an outdated dualistic view of mind and body, and that a more accurate understanding of the brain and its processes shows that our decisions are the result of a complex interplay between our environment, our biology, and our mental states.

> Harris, on the other hand, argues that our subjective experience of making choices and the sense of agency that accompanies it are real, and that we should not dismiss them as illusory or mere epiphenomena. He acknowledges that our decisions are influenced by a wide variety of factors, including genetics, upbringing, and environmental factors, but he maintains that our subjective experience of having a choice is an important aspect of human life that should not be dismissed.

> In short, the disagreement between Harris and Dennett is not just about the definition of free will, but about the usefulness of the traditional concept of free will and the extent to which our subjective experience of agency is a real and valuable aspect of human life.",1680307379

"bangladesh","t5_2qixf","Lmao your understanding of inflation is simply incorrect. 
Inflation doesn't indicate growth, nor does it indicate rising demand. Inflation means the economy can no longer support it's population which causes prices to rise.
This means businesses are failing or uncertain which is a falling economy. When production goes down GDP goes down. It's corruption that can also hide the true GDP of the economy. Money is not being circulated efficiently due to the rich committing fraud to get richer off the poor. Bangladesh no doubt is corrupt. If you are associated with a garments factory you should already be aware of how corrupt that is. 
When you're in denial of just how much of the population is extremely poor you're just a selfish asshole. Inflation hurts a lot more for a third world country with such a high gap between the rich and the poor and where the poor make up such a large majority. Basically ignored the fact that Bangladesh is a third world country inflation affects more people extremely negatively.",1680307381.0

A self-taught designer with 10+ years of experience knows a lot about what they're doing, and running your own agency means you have client-facing skills, project management skills, and art direction / creative direction skills that they don't teach in school. As for career, if you're not positioning yourself as an art director already, you probably should be.

Not sure if you're looking to get a job somewhere and quit freelancing? As for getting a job, I don't have a design degree and it's never come up as an issue over the past 20 years (although I do have a business degree). What really matters to most hiring managers is the quality of your work (portfolio), your connections, your personality, and your attitude. If you don't have a college degree at all you're probably going to get automatically filtered out for most jobs, so it's important to have connections.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Yeah you‚Äôre right it has become hard to date because of my inability to fully move on from my ex. The guys I‚Äôve dated don‚Äôt have an issue with my daughter since they‚Äôre older and I have a career it‚Äôs not like I need a man to take care of me or my daughter. Most want to meet her and are curious to know who she is. The problem ends up being me and my emotional unavailability. I just try to do what society deems is right and move on through dating. Unfortunately I‚Äôm not a man and this I can‚Äôt just fall in love with the first breathing, living being that gives me attention my life would be way easier. So I‚Äôm stuck feeling regret over my ex‚Äôs absence in my daughter‚Äôs life and my dating life being the struggle that it is. The only solace I have is that I can be there for my daughter to guide her and tell her right from wrong based on my experiences. 

She‚Äôll likely have the same issues as me I also had a dad that was there physically but not emotionally. That has caused me to seek comfort in men who are emotionally constipated. I have tried therapy but it has yet to work in the long term. And why do you make being a single mom so taboo? Even a married woman can become a single mom no one is safe. Some women are married and slave after their husbands probably suffering unknow horrors and abuse bits let‚Äôs congratulate them for getting married first that must mean it‚Äôs healthy. So everyone‚Äôs situation is different despite doing the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù and ‚Äúright‚Äù thing. I could be married to my ex and still feeling the same way. My mom married my dad and he divorced her when o turned 18 because he never wanted to be married to her and she trapped him. But let‚Äôs pretend marriage is a saving grace and that if you‚Äôre married everything is ok and fixed. I‚Äôd appreciate for you to keep your own biased opinion about single moms out of your post no single mom is looking to date you so you‚Äôre safe.",1680307381.0

We're going skiing! Eriol is showing off his multitude of skills; he's good on the slopes and also good at playing off of Takashi when he's lying. I want a Takashi/Eriol manzai.

Bro, this school has their logo on the SKI OUTFITS, too? Hope they're paying the person who sews the logos on very well.

While the class is relaxing in the ski resort lounge, THE FUCKING PEDO TEACHER IS WITH RIKA. CAN YOU TWO NOT?

LMAO Sakura is crossing herself while hoping that Eriol doesn't tell any scary stories. I know she doesn't know that Eriol is Clow, but I have a feeling she has a hunch. Or I'm just hoping that our protagonist isn't THAT unaware.

God damn, has Sakura been storing up all these ""hoeeee""s for this episode? She's like a Pokemon or something.

Sussy Eriol Moment of the Day: ""Eriol, is there anything that you just can't stand?"" ""Yes"" ""What is it?"" ""A secret"" *stares at the mountain sussily*

Syaoran, staring at Sakura: ""God, I'm so fucking straight""

Syaoran's about to confess? Time for an interruption! By...Sakura!? Would've been funny if Takashi and Eriol jumped out of those bears and continued their bit from earlier in the day.

Pedo teacher solidifies himself as worst teacher by telling the two kids who JUST learned how to not fall on their ass to go to the intermediate slopes.

Oh god oh fuck Eriol is creating the setting for the scary story he told. And now he's gonna kill everyone in the ski resort with an avalanche! Thankfully, we know that he'll just stop the avalanche is anyone's ACTUALLY gonna get hurt, but Sakura doesn't know that. 

The card joining the Sakura Card club today is...Time? Damn, took em a while. But that was a poor decision, as all it does is make her collapse right in the path of the avalanche. Cue Eriol saving the day by destrying the thing that he created to ruin the day.

Eriol ends the episode by teasing...something",1680307382.0

Not to mention the fact that your saying that f2p players can compete, because the litterally number one f2p managed to hold a leadership role. I very well understand this isn't a 1v1 game. What I mean by compete is make any significant impact. Even if you can ""compete"" (which you can't), wouldn't it be unfair that those who pay money have a very significant advantage? Even if we view competing as leadership and diplomacy, they would have an advantage there too.

It's worse than that. All you need to do record an ""album"" stream is to get 30 seconds of one song streamed 1,500 times, although they may have increased that 30 seconds recently. It's really nothing about the album itself. 1,500 streams of anything from the album is recorded as an album stream. As I stated elsewhere, Post Malone reached number one on the album chart from a 3:38 second loop of the chorus from one song from an album.

"Transmedical","t5_uh8xj","Have had nothing but terrible experiences from all regardless of the doctor's gender. Trans-specific providers are not discrete enough for my preference, and are usually in ""TRANS & NB GENDER ZONE"" clinics. I also just find it... weird when people who aren't themselves trans get into trans healthcare. Am I crazy for thinking a lot of them have transformation fetishes or ulterior motives?

And just regular normie general practitioners are clueless at best, and humiliating at worst. The degrading treatment and questions and complete lack of knowledge can be traumatizing. I still struggle to find a PCP I am comfortable with.

"4chan","t5_2qh4w",">The government of Ireland is captured by multi-billion dollar international corporations that select politicians to support based on their willingness to follow orders and they rig the system in their favor using their overwhelming wealth and power.

There's a degree of that in most countries but last time I checked, you still have to be an Irish citizen or permanent resident to vote.

The City of London half bank rolls the rest of the country (until recently) so no one is complaining. I lived in London just prior to the recession and the amount of money average people were making and the amount of jobs available was insane, coming from New Zealand which had a lot less of that.

Sovereignty is important above all else, but no one would allow immigration if it didn't help them. We (NZ) currently have a big shortage of builders and nurses especially, where do you think the easiest place to get them is?

"AsOneAfterInfidelity","t5_fxuis","r/Asoneafterinfidelity is an online Peer Support Group and safe space for individuals (betrayed or wayward) who are actively attempting to reconcile after infidelity. Reconciliation peer support is emotional and practical support between people who share the common experience of reconciling after infidelity. (Observers are strictly limited to messages of support only.) Kindly read the rules before participating. For transparency and conflict mediation purposes, kindly follow reddit community guidelines by directing any questions, issues, feedback, or appeals about the sub or individual moderator decisions directly to Mod Mail. No response will be given to DMs and chat requests to individual moderators about moderating issues. We are very happy to receive and respond to your concerns through the official channels!   


Please assign yourself a user flair.For app users, flairs can be added at the top of the main page. Select the three vertical dots and the menu should appear. Instructions (desktop version) [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/flair_instructions)).

For a list of abbreviations commonly used in this subreddit, see the [Acronym Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/acronym_guide).

Also check out our list of free resources and recommended books for post-infidelity recovery, found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AsOneAfterInfidelity/wiki/resources).        

RULES

**1. All posts and comments must fit the spirit of Peer Support.**

- Keep comments encouraging, constructive, sensitive, validating, and non-judgmental.

- Speak only from your own experience. Use ‚ÄúI‚Äù-statements.

- Asking clarifying questions or offering suggestions is acceptable‚Äìif backed up by personal experience about what has helped you in your recovery and reconciliation.

- Do not give advice unless specifically requested by OP.

- Any differences of opinion expressed must be communicated respectfully.

- ‚ÄúTough love‚Äù does not qualify as peer support.

**2. The peer group includes: Reconciling BS, Reconciling WS, Recovered & Reconciled, and Considering R.**

- Observer, Unsuccessful R, and other user flairs are not included in the peer group. Non-peers are not allowed to post without prior moderator approval. Non-peer comments are STRICTLY LIMITED TO MESSAGES OF VALIDATION AND ENCOURAGEMENT ONLY. Non-peers are not permitted to offer opinions, reference their experiences, or give advice.

*All posts and comments are subject to removal without warning. Any users who violate the rules are subject to temporary or permanent ban without further warning.*

**3. No personal attacks, victim-blaming, or LABELLING of any kind.**

- e.g. cheater, narcissist, abuser, doormat, slut, asshole, idiot, etc.

- No Cluster-B or other armchair diagnoses.

- No victim-blaming when the sexual assault of a wayward partner by an AP is discussed.

**4. No misogyny, misandry, toxic masculinity, bigotry, racism or other hate speech.**

- Posts or comments dehumanizing and/or slut-shaming wayward partners or APs will be removed. (Posts and comments related to navigating feelings or practical matters about APs are allowed.)

**5. No anti-reconciliation language.**

- Do not tell someone to just leave the relationship. Attempting to reconcile is a valid choice.

- Unless abuse is present, do not suggest marital status, age of relationship, children or lack thereof as a reason for someone to leave the relationship.

**6. Posts and comments must be directly related to RECONCILIATION**

- The scope of this subreddit is narrow: by and for reconcilers on the subject of reconciliation only. There are several other subreddits that offer support for others who have experienced infidelity. This is not a general infidelity discussion or advice forum, nor is it a place to read for entertainment and pass judgment.

"wow","t5_2qio8","As someone who mained a tank/dps for most of SL and a healer since, I've had to learn more as a healer than I ever had to learn as a tank. I need to learn dps mechs to know who/when to focus heal, and I need to learn TBs to know the tank's knowledge level as early as possible so I can figure out how much babysitting I need to do. This is all alongside learning kick/ring of piece/stun prios and my own class shit for maximising dps like everyone else, and the odd healer mech (although there isn't many). 

While I was a tank, I never felt the need to pay attention to a lot of that, including tank busters sometimes. I'm still convinced that a lot of tanks don't know how deadly the final boss of SBG is if you're anywhere near those beams.",1680307385.0

For example you could ask for a extended deadline on projects or when you take exams ask if you can sit at the back of the class to concentrate better. You would be surprised to see how many people are understanding of it. Use ADHD as an explaintion instead of an excuse. Taking medicine does also help alot. Aleast for me it has but we are all different and some people prefer to stay off them. On YouTube you can find many videos of people sharing tips on how they mange their ADHD and stay motivated.

"ambbabies","t5_7if3sh","I don‚Äôt think Amber lies about her weight. Maybe sometimes she underestimates, but when she does a weigh-in or talks specific numbers I don‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs lying. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs smart enough to lie consistently like that.

I don‚Äôt think Amber is that bad of a person. If 99th percentile is Mister Rogers and 1st is Hitler, she might be at the 20-25th mark. I think she‚Äôs dumb and she‚Äôs pretty public with her negative opinions, which is unfortunate. I think we underestimate the genuine discomfort and pain she‚Äôs going through just being her size. That is bound to make a person seem worse than they are.

I don‚Äôt like when people just make fun of Amber‚Äôs appearance. Some people are just mean, I know, but it‚Äôs not productive and it‚Äôs just plain bullying. Her size isn‚Äôt hurting anyone but herself. 

The majority of Amber‚Äôs audience is overweight/obese and use Amber to: 1) feel better about their own situation (look at any comments section and there are people talking about how they‚Äôre 250lbs but they‚Äôve lost 5lbs and at least they‚Äôre not as bad as Amber!1!), 2) watch her to stop themselves from eating & 3) project their insecurities on her",1680307385

You do understand that we see through you, right? When you write off my gender as ""how you want to be addressed,"" you're making it plain that you think I'm a man dressing like a woman. You can tell yourself that you're not anti-trans all you want, I hope it helps you sleep at night to think that you're ""one of the good ones,"" but I see you for what you are: a coward. You're no different from the other anti-trans bigots, but you don't even have the nerve to say it openly.

Let me turn that around on you: why should I respect the fact that you want to be called a man? I'm not anti-cis or anyone else, I'm just indifferent to your weird need to identify yourself by the genitals you were born with. Keep that at home, it's nobody else's business.

Doesn't sound very nice, does it? And by the way, my SNAP card doesn't have a rainbow flag on it either, but that doesn't stop me from taking your money. We're so alike! üíï",1680307386.0

"goodlifefitness","t5_3euwle","I presume that your training session will be 30 minutes, and the other 30 will be spent in the room building you up to get you to sign up for PT. You actually will benefit very little from the consultation. 

If I was you I'd go straight into asking questions. A level II or III trainer will offer little value. A trainer with no formal education in a related health and fitness field will also likely be of little value. The worst-case scenario is a level II or III without any formal education. You shouldn't give the slightest time to them. If you have a level IV or higher WITH education AND several client reviews, photos and testimonials then that's someone I'd pay attention to. Unfortunately, these coaches are rare. So, ask the trainer about their college/university studies, type of personal training certification, the year they were certified, other workshops/courses after certification, and client reviews... added to that, look for a well-spoken, detail-oriented, organized, and transparent individual. 

If it's just form and technique that you need help with, watch YouTube videos and record yourself.",1680307386.0

Thank you for your post! Make sure it follows the following rules. Failure to comply to one rule once will get your post removed. Twice (or two rules) will get you a permaban.

* Rule 1: Your post should contain a photo or video of a comparison. No, your hand or leg does not count.

* Rule 2: Do not share pics of others without their approval

* Rule 3: Do not beg for upvotes or ask for them in any way. This is a rule across reddit actually.

* Rule 4: If you only want to ask people to compare to you, there is a daily stickied post for this on the subreddit. So just go to the [home page of the subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cockcompare/), and find it and post there.


Now that all of this is done, consider going to [my Pornhub page where I (woman and cuckqueen) share all of my videos for free](https://www.pornhub.com/users/homemadehornygirl)

OP has offered the following explanation for why they think they might be the asshole:

 > I did makeup that made my Asian features more visible which made it appear like I‚Äôm Asian fishing causing a lot of conflict in my general social circle and especially between me and my close friends (I did not think this part was very relevant so I didn‚Äôt mention it in the original post but looking back I‚Äôll change that). They‚Äôve almost completely cut contact with me because of this. 

The problem is that I don‚Äôt know if only actual Asian fishing is bad or if it‚Äôs also offensive if it just seems like I am like my friends said. It at least appears plausible to me as I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm actually doing harm here. Is it my fault that they had to cut contact with me? They‚Äôre very left leaning politically and say that I ‚Äûbetrayed‚Äú them with my actions.

"WeightLossAdvice","t5_31a4o","Compression clothing is probably what you need. But you also have to look at your training so you start losing that saggy fat and not end up looking like melted icecream

Stop doing cardio and start lifting, in theory your fat shouldn't be an issue since you are isolating a mechanical movement in certain directon while keeping your body in place. I don't see how you would have your gut lets say disturb a shoulder raise, maybe the depth of a squat but that's another issue.

It will also be less aggresive on your joints, running is one of the worst excercises you can do while fat, imagine hitting your knees and hips with a jackhammer on every step. That's what you are doing if you are fat to the point you say you are.

Lifting of course burns more calories while resting since your body has to build up the muscle tissue, and with the adequate diet it will turbo boost fat loss (which is what you want, to lose fat and lose as little muscle as possible or even increase it). Now, as you lose fat and if possible trigger other processes like the autophagy bost a 36-48 hour fast gives, your skin will get tighter, your muscles bigger and everything will sag less.",1680307389.0

Together with the right ODT, SteamVR, Nvidia CP, and win11 settings, Link at 500mbps bitrate and Air Link at 200mbps Dynamic bitrate looks an performs fantastic, especially now with v51 PTC and Local Dimming.

With fairly complex games like HLA, LE1/2, Hubris and flight sims like msfs, I don‚Äôt see any so-called compression artifacts.  Nor do I see any significant differences in image quality like you‚Äôve shown on your linked images.  

Depending on the game, Link can sometimes result in distant objects popping in a little earlier so the clarity can appear to look a little better but for me, this isn‚Äôt a significant improvement.  Certainly not enough to lose the freedom of being wireless.

As for Biden lying: yes, he lies. Politicians lie by misrepresentation, omission, and straight up falsehoods. One thing his record shows, though is that he‚Äôs not divisive. At least, not by nature, I can‚Äôt account for the fragmentation of American politics. Trump and the current incarnation of the Republicans have become autocratic with a twisted view of freedom: it can only conform to their views. This is further bolstered by SCOTUS and their lock on the court and use of the most convenient and advantageous methods of interpretation of the law and Constitution. 

While the Left‚Äôs not perfect they tend to rely on data and facts whereas the Right has run full speed into the land of disinformation and propaganda. The concept of ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù and the acceptance of the concept means that no argument is valid and we can just say what we want, do what we want, and expect no consequences.",1680307389.0

The boy, Jimmy, and the girl, Mikaela, were white as ghosts, more terrified of the bus driver than hurt by whatever beef they had against each other. Eventually Kevin left the bus and walked down the road about 50 yards. In complete silence, we watched him collapse on the gravel road and cry like a baby.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","I may be nuts, but from where I'm sitting the NBA rules actually feel much harder to understand than MLS rules. Like, maybe I'm nuts cuz people seem to understand them, but they just make my head spin. MLS I basically understand, unless you get reaaalll far into the details. But it feels like every time I see my team (Clippers) do something, I find myself totally baffled and needing to ask other fans for help understanding what levers were pulled to make that possible.

But as you say, the books are open for the NBA. The answers are out there, if you're enough of a sicko to figure them out. I'm sitting here with LAFC like...I guess they got Bogusz with TAM? How much did they spend? How much is left? Can we re-structure Vela's contract to buy him down with TAM? If we sell Cifu, do we have enough allocation money to turn Palacios into a TAM player instead of a U22? There's just no way of knowing (I guess for that last one, if we sell Cifu we get some extra GAM, but you get the idea).",1680307392.0

"LeopardsAteMyFace","t5_3jp3p","Are you grouped together though? 

Because I know a lot of first generation black people from Nigeria and Ethiopia and they absolutely do not share the political proclivities of the African-American population. 

Like sure, if you lump everyone of the same complexion together into a monolith, the differing votes of specific subpopulation therein become background noise drowned out by the majority. But as soon as you actually recognize the national and cultural differences of the distinct subpopulations within that frankly useless (and imo very racist) broad generalization, distinct differences in voting patterns and beliefs become clearly apparent.

My guess is that you are a people-pleaser? As am I, and I hope I‚Äôm not being harsh, but I think you need to adjust your expectations. I like what u/pootmacklin had to say: don‚Äôt explain, just do. Keep your head up, and with a positive attitude, just do as you wish them to follow. 

The holding is hard. Maybe try to follow baby‚Äôs lead. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not comfortable yet. She‚Äôll let us know when she‚Äôs ready to come to you.‚Äù (If you want her to have a relationship with them, you might have to figure out when to be ok with them holding her.)

Photos: I would not share any online or on your phone. Just avoid that thicket. 

When they assume they will babysit: ‚Äúthat doesn‚Äôt work for us.‚Äù Don‚Äôt justify or explain. Just pivot to new topic or baby as a distraction. 

I had to step back and not take the smugness personally. If it is harmless, you might just try and reframe it as the way your in-laws show their pride in being grandparents to your little one. Once your figure out your boundaries and how to maintain them, I think you might find that you can do some positive reframing. I felt like in those early months (and your baby is only four months old!) those protective New Mama hormones were still active and I found it hard to establish boundaries and not take those things personally. If your in-laws are the classic take-an-inch people that you can manage by holding your ground, see if you can flex those mental muscles and just let their assumptions sail past you! Play ignorant. Just because they assume doesn‚Äôt mean you have to go with it! This will take practice, but I think you can do it.

"warcraftlore","t5_2s5rg",">Hell even the way the powers manifest in its followers proves the point. Literally the only time we've seen a direct being of the Light try to compel someone's control was Xe'ra. We heard about it happening in that one Legion short story yes, but that's not really a good stand in for decades of the Light being a tool for good.

This is my biggest issue, it's all about ""Subverting"" everything we know and saying it's always been like that. 

&#x200B;

>Light wielders are more often than not just, righteous, kind people, using the Light to mend wounds, bring peace to people, save lives. Paladins are considered paragons of truth and justice and in the vast majority of cases they uphold this ideal.

Only the Scarlet Crusade has shown the ""Zealousness"" of the Light and that can even be explained as being corrupted by  Balnazzar. 

&#x200B;

>All void users basically wake up and flip a coin on if they're going to sprout tentacles and try to kill their loved ones today.

Pretty much, until Alleria and Locus Walker there has been no good Void User and Warcraft could've introduced a few during Cataclysm had they actually planned it.

 

>I'd get where they were going with this if the Light and Void were just primordial energies that people tap into, making the Void no more evil than something radioactive is evil for killing you for being near it, but that's not what they're doing with the story at all, and it's just bizarre, they're trying to personify Light and Void beings as being morally grey and it's not working at all.

The Primordial Energy thing, seemed to be what it was before Warcraft Chronicles and they decided to make the Void and Light sentient and that's when things seem to go downhill.  Then Warcraft Chronicles got retconned into being from the ""Titans POV"" and all Lore went out the Window.",1680307393.0

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","I think it could just be something about my physiology, but I have experiences like the first bit of what you described regularly (often as either a ‚Äúfloating‚Äù feeling, or one very similar to what you described as feeling small within yourself - almost as if I feel like I‚Äôm in this massive cavern). I‚Äôve also had the experience of feeling like I‚Äôm starting to slip deeper, and this definitely can be scary. Usually, when this happens, I will react too much too it (unfortunately) and the experience will stop. I‚Äôve heard of a lot of other people having similar experiences, so I wouldn‚Äôt be concerned if I were you.

What I think might be happening is that when we get into a deep meditation, some of the attention that we normally devote to raw sensory input is released. Our brains actually have a model of the world, and we are often interacting with this model of the world held in our brains than with ‚Äúreality‚Äù itself. This model our brains hold is continually updated, in daily life, to ‚Äúfit‚Äù with the sensory data coming into the system (our brains). I think that, in deep stages of meditation, a slight ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù can form between our brain‚Äôs mental model of our body and the sensory information - almost like our real senses are going to sleep. However, the brain still maintains this mental model, and will continue to hallucinate/fill in the gaps where the raw sensory data is no longer coming in. This can result in very ‚Äúlifelike‚Äù experiences such as sensations of floating, I believe.",1680307393.0

Anytime you see him confronted about it he spits the same excuses as to why he does in attempt to get people off his back. At that moment he weighs if his habit or his friends/family are more important. When he chooses family/friends he goes to rehab. When he doesn't he leans in the excuses why he can't.

My understanding is that agender falls under the non-binary umbrella. Binary simply means there are two sides, ""masculine"" and ""feminine"". Non-binary means they don't fall towards one of those sides explicitly, maybe they're like 60/40 masc/fem, or 50/50, or whatever. Agender, to my knowledge, is no connection with any point anywhere in the spectrum between ""masculine"" and ""feminine"". So if there was a continuum of masculine to feminine gender identity, they wouldn't even be in the continuum, they'd be in the footnote as an ""other"" category.

There's an exception when matters of ethics are involved (like if Tomori got fired for shady reasons, then yes, time to get pissed), but otherwise, if you're a real fan of something, part of that is accepting the direction that thing is taking even when it's not your preference. When fans try to get franchises to do things *their* way, because they think they know better, that's called toxic fandom. That just means they're more a fan of their own idea than of the thing itself, and if it bothers the fan so much that they can't let go of it, they should stop considering themselves a fan.

The way I think of it - there's no point in not accepting change. It's not your creation, it's the creation of the people who made it, and it's not fans' right to demand it to be different. So resisting change will just make you angry and miserable. Especially when the change is literally out of anyone's control (like a health issue) and not a creative decision.

"Persecutionfetish","t5_2h9x5r","You're so stupid you're just repeating your original point. 

No one says that guns can't live harmoniously with a populace. You're arguing against fake talking points. The whole reason you argued yourself down this hole is because apparently countries like Finland and Holy Switzerland are comparable countries to America when it comes to  a 'gun forward culture' (lol)

Switzerland has a rate of gun ownership at 28 guns per 100 citizens. (less than Finland at 32/100)

America has a gun ownership rate of 120 guns per 100 citizens. That is not comparable just because you say it is. 

America does not have a similar culture or legislation regarding guns. In fact, you highlighting the exact differences between American and Swiss gun culture such as training requirements and registration shows that Switzerland is impossible to compare to America when it comes to guns.

I do not mask, nor do I ask others to do so. If someone else wants to, that is up to them. I won't take the vax due to potential side effect risks. If others want to, that is up to them.

I do have issues with others pushing their concerns or anxieties onto me, however. If someone else is worried about their health, then take precautions (boost your immunity, wear a mask if you think it will help, avoid crowds, etc.). But you shouldn't expect everyone else to kowtow to accommodate you.

And I take this attitude even after having LC for over 3+ years. Other people's freedoms are not dependent upon my health.

I also have faith in Christ, along with enough experience to know that death comes for us all eventually, so I am not afraid of death. So my outlook on living and dying may not be the norm. While I am not looking for the end, I am not afraid of it. Death is part of life just like birth is. Acceptance of that allows us to live more fully and peacefully.
