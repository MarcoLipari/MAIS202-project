He understands why I have those issues which helps. But I want him to be able to acknowledge that what he believes isn't perfect and that liberal Christianity isn't just ""easy, lazy Christians"" but people who have well-thought arguments for why they think that way.  I just want to introduce the idea of doubt into his mind. This his perfect church may not have everything perfect.

I'm currently talking to my sister-in-law about homosexuality. Introducing the idea that maybe, mabye it really might not be sin, especially in committed, married relationships. She is opening up to the idea and I'm so impressed that I haven't received an angry, how dare you think this way response. She thoughtfully responded by saying that I gave her a lot to think about as well as some documents to research and pray about, and that it would take some time, but she was letting me know that the lengthy response time wasn't because she was angry, just a lot of food for thought. :) I was so happy. 

I'm doing this whole process as slowly and thoughtfully as I can. My next big topic with her will be about hell. She is definitely the most open to listening in the family. But I'm hoping I can open my dad's heart, ever so slowly as well. If they could only not be so narrow-minded, judgmental and bigotted, it would mean so much to me.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","The true, upper limit is about 3.4 pounds per day, but that also involves burning muscle, and being an elite, trained athlete.  Normal people of about your size could expect to drop 3-8 pounds of water in the first week, as well as up to 2/3 of a pound of fat per day, assuming you consume proper nutrition, exercise on a schedule, and have no physiological impediments.

I recommend a tracking system for weight, food, and exercise so you can trend your progress long-term and verify your chosen plan and goals are working.  Make a cheat sheet of nutrition basics, such as your daily protein needs, what foods provide high amounts of the vitamins, minerals, and fiber you need without blowing your calorie goals, etc.

Different people respond differently to nutrition and exercise plans, so try different things and see what you feel best with week to week.  Keep notes on how you feel with different foods and exercises.  Unless you load up on caffeine and try to kill yourself running up hills, most unwanted trends will be gradual.  Anything that doesn't improve after 2 sleeps should be investigated for nutrition (missing salts?  Below minimum calories?) or schedule deficiencies (not enough rest after hard exercise?).

If you have any physiological issues (palpitations, weakness, weird urine), or any concerns, see your doctor.

If you bottom out, and aren't yet to your goal, then take a rest.  Skip a couple of exercise days, or eat a little extra for a day or two.  Relax.  Then, go at it again with renewed vigor.  Maybe fast for a day and do the hardest sprints you can, etc.  Whatever, just to shake things up for a couple of days, then go back to what was working before.

If you bottom out and ARE at your goal, you're not done.  Find out what level of exercise you enjoy, and make that permanent.  Then adjust your diet so that you maintain weight week to week, which may mean eating more, or less, or differently.  But you can never ""stop"".

We're missing the external and physiological signals that say ""You are full"" and ""you need to exercise"".  Because of that, we have to be mindful, conscious, and willful about our health all the time.  The trick is to find something that's easy enough that we can make it a decade-long habit.

Whatever it takes, good luck on staying motivated to reach your health goals.","1391212802"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; A skilled swordsman or spearman would run circles around him inflicting wounds before he could even turn or swing at air.

1.  I think you *massively* underestimate how difficult it was to penetrate a well crafted suit of armor*   
2.  He could literally just use a broad horizontal swipe that would be extremely difficult to dodge (you would either have to jump back 10', or dive to the ground), and good luck blocking it  
3.  He would have a far longer range (thanks to a larger weapon and *much* longer reach), so he could just wait for his opponent to come to him.   There is no way you are going to be able to close in 15', attack and penetrate his armor, and retreat before he smashes you into paste  
4.  You seem to have ignored that given the OP's premise, he would have been trained for war from a young age, so he would be quite experienced in fighting smaller faster people (aka everybody)  



[Plate Armor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_armour)*

&gt;Plate armour was virtually invulnerable to sword slashes. It also protects the wearer well against spear or pike thrusts and provides decent defense against blunt trauma.

That is just with plate that normal (small actually, if you look at historical examples) people can support.  Andre was big and strong enough that he could probably support significantly thicker armor that would be even more difficult to penetrate, or he could just use standard thickness armor and be virtually unencumbered.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","My first reaction to this casting choice was, ""WTF?"" After a few minutes of reflection, I think I can give a fairer assessment:
This all depends on which direction the writers are trying to take the relationship between Superman and Luthor. What I liked about Smallville was how the producers developed the connection between the two foes as deep and complicated. This is something that was completely overlooked in ""Superman Returns"", where the director just kind of forced an assumed antipathy between Kevin Spacey and Brandon Routh.
Cavill did a decent job as the man of steel, although I still think Jon Hamm would have been the better choice. However, this would have screwed up the ""younger"" appearance of the DC universe they're trying to portray. What they did by casting Cavill was create a young-looking Superman. If Lex and Clark are to be contemporaries, then it wouldn't make sense to have had Cavill as Superman and, say, Bryan Cranston play his arch nemesis.
Enter Eisenberg. I think most people's initial reaction is that this kid is way too young to play one of the greatest villains of all time. If the director can portray Eisenberg as a scrawny, physically helpless, and insecure little earthling, then his villainy may be created through a sense of absolute jealousy and near homoerotic humiliation between Cavill's Superman and himself. This, coupled with his supreme technological intellect and King Joffrey-esqe sadistic brutality may convince audiences that he truly may be the only one who could defeat the man of steel. However, audiences have seen this kind of villain development before--with Syndrome, the villain in Pixar's ""The Incredibles."" Plus, Eisenberg is going to have to come up with a completely novel way of appearing technologically savvy, because otherwise audiences are just going to see a bald Mark Zuckerberg holding some shiny green rocks.
Basically, I would have had Jon Hamm as Superman, enabling Bryan Cranston to play the role we all wanted him to play (Lex Luthor). Oh well, I'm hoping to be surprised, as I think back to my initial ""WTF?"" when I heard Heath Ledger was going to play the Joker.","1391212813"

I do highly recommend making sure the top cap has and adjustable pin so it will work with any mod.  Aside from that there are differences in build quality.  Some of the really cheap clones lack in performance and feel, so it's worth looking for well known manufacturers if you're looking at a clone (hcigar, ehpro, tobeco).

Additionally, 3 or 4 episodes are okay, but in Yu Yu Hakusho 2 things need to be kept in mind.

1) You can't just stop watching after 3 episodes.

2) The long drawn out fights or the tournament team battles will go by faster and can be the topic of discussion if we watch more episodes into them.

You can even change the number of required episodes each week if you want.  I just think that 3-4 is too small a number.  Each to their own, though.

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","The problem with Rye bread is that Rye flour in itself doesn't have the strength of the gluten that you find in wheat flour, so it can't trap the air that you want to make a very risen loaf. So, you supplement wheat flour for rye in the hopes that you can get significant lift out of the bread and prevent a heavy, mealy loaf. The problem then, is that you get a loaf that looks like rye, but doesn't taste like it. It is extremely difficult to get a rye loaf to come up with the big holes and open structure of a no-knead loaf. Here's what I'd try:

Make a rye sourdough starter. Take some of an established wheat starter, and feed it rye flour instead. The first time, it'll be mostly wheat and a little rye, but once you feed it for a week or so, you'll find it takes on a nice sour, rye smell and taste and will be predominantly rye. Use this as your starter, if your recipe uses one. 

Another thing you can try is to use pumpernickel rye meal. (Bob's red mill makes it, but it is hard to source sometimes- I find it at health food stores)  I add this to most of my breads. It's a coarsely ground dark rye flour and it really adds a lot of texture and taste. 

One more thing- if you can find it, try using high-gluten flour instead of bread flour in the mix. The more gluten you can get in there without having to add in tons of wheat flour, the better lift you're going to get. 

I love using dark rye flour. Hodgson mill makes a stoneground rye flour that you can find in supermarkets and I really like it. Some white or light rye has really no flavor at all- good for making things like Jewish Rye that have caraway or other flavors in it, but I am more a fan of the crusty dark ryes.

"BALLET","t5_2rpdx","My advice is to stick with it!  My mom took a ballet class with me and she kept saying, ""This is hard!  But you make it look so *easy*!""  Don't get discouraged if you struggle.  Those dancers who make it look easy have been honing their skills for years.  I know I don't make it through a class without sweating my butt off, fighting against every muscle in my body and silently cursing my subpar extensions while wearing that placid ballerina face.

I encourage everyone to try ballet because your body will LOVE you for it.  You will get amazing flexibility, your legs will look incredible, people will compliment your posture, you'll be more poised and confident when you walk, and despite how tired and worn you may feel at the studio, you will start to feel great all over.  I haven't been able to dance for three months from an ankle injury (not dance related) and my body feels like poo.

On a deeper level, ballet will become a part of you.  I'm an extremely anxious person and I have issues with depression, but once I'm at the barre, all that stress and terribleness melts away.  Ballet requires great focus and drive, and it has a way of getting you out of your own head.  It's the best kind of therapy, in my opinion.

So yeah, TL:DR, it will be hard at first and you may feel like you're not learning anything or you won't ever get better, but I promise you that if you stick with ballet, it will be one of the best decisions you ever make! :-)","1391212820"

"italianlearning","t5_2tuxf","I'd say it is definitely evident that Italian is not your first language, but everything you mean to say is conveyed all the same. It's pretty clear because you make errors in feminine vs masculine concordances, for example when the adjective is feminine but you put a masculine article. That is very telling because it's something which can be pretty tricky for a non native speaker, but it comes very natural to all Italians.


As a translator then, and having studied linguistics, I can notice a few sentences which tell me that you translated from English in your mind. For instance, the way you inverted verb and subject in the interrogative sentence ""*Riconosce... qualcuno*?"", Italian very rarely inverts like that. ""*Anche...*"" is probably taken from the English ""Also,.."" but in Italian you can't use it at the beginning of sentences, try ""**inoltre**"". And ""non posso trovare"" is a direct translation of ""I can't find"", but a native Italian speaker would always use ""non *riesco* a trovare"". These are all things that give the text a slightly odd tone, making it clear you're not a native speaker. Italians would simply use different phrasings.

Now, don't get me wrong, your Italian is really impressive, it's a tricky language and few achieve your level of proficiency. You just need to keep polishing it some more to make it sound more natural. 

To fix the concordances, just go slow when writing, go very slow and consider carefully whether you're applying the right gender to each of the gendered words. So if you have to write ""your daughter is so mature!"", remember that it's feminine and that you have to write ""tu**a** figli**a** è proprio matur**a**!""

The other thing is much more difficult to improve... You have to spend a lot of time using the language, immersion immersion immersion. You'll eventually reach a point when you speak or write Italian thinking mostly in Italian instead of translating from English. But you must first ""live"" Italian a lot in order to build a vast database of sentences ""said as the Italians say"". But remember that you can get very close to native levels in a foreign language, but never quite reach it. In my Master's there were English professors that had been teaching in Italy for 40 years, and their Italian still wasn't perfect. So don't worry too much about it, just do your best ;)

"ultrahardcore","t5_2tswi","&gt;Because there was literally NO evidence. Someone saying they saw me hacking, and me saying I was hacking? If that's solid evidence then half of the community would be on the UBL. For example, Player A kills Player B. Player B calls Player A a hacker. Player A says ""Oh yeah totally I'm hacking"". Player A gets banned.

Lots of people are on the UBL for this already. Take NoFear's case, there's no proof he hacked is there? People called him a hacker, but you have no real proof of it.

&gt;Not anymore. Are you paying attention to the reddit posts? Because this cannot get me banned, which is the only reason I would ever consider it, and I'm not doing it to harm anyone else. There is no video evidence against me either, unless you're commenting about SergeantGnome's video, which was obviously not hacks. Also, send not needed reports to the courtroom? Wat are you even talking about here?

You can't get UBL'd yes I understand. However hosts can still ban you if they believe that they can. I wanted to raise awareness of this as it is not your first time hacking on a UHC related server. And those hacks were very clear and we know you probably still have them on one of your minecraft profiles which you will probably use soon.","1391212823"

"Ford","t5_2qutc","People wanted bigger ""bro"" trucks so ford stopped making the ranger in 2010. Since then retarded fuel consumption regulations based on wheel base have come in and mini trucks have to meet the same standards family sedans get. Now every truck has to have a huge cab to make up for wheel base, as seen with the new Tacoma's. Biggest problem with this is that they often come with a bed so small I started calling them an SUV with the cap missing instead of a truck. Because of this a new North American ranger would do nothing but compete with a more expensive F150, and it would sell more. I've herd that with this big 2015 lineup ford has, the Ranger will be returning. This can only happen with an ecoboost engine or an extending cab with a rear bench seat, so no more mini truck.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","[*A Thousand and One Nights*](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/a-thousand-and-one-nights-a-game-of-enticing-stories#description) does this very well, in my opinion. Players are courtiers, servants, princesses, huntmasters, viziers and so on in a Sultan's court, and the general feel is based on the stories of Shahrazad. They pass the time by telling tales to amuse one another and the Sultan himself. These can simply be tales meant to entertain, or they might have themes meant to curry favor, or the events and characters could be commentary/allegory on the others around them. (Create a treacherous vizier in a tale, for example, and have the ""real life"" vizier responsible for playing that role.) Each PC has goals they are angling for, and other PCs &amp; NPCs they want to interfere with or help if they can, but because of the Sultan's influence, the telling of tales is where they are most free to do so.

At any time in a tale, another ""tale within the tale"" can sprout up, as the characters in the story the PCs are telling start spinning a yarn themselves. This is as ""deep"" as it goes, as far as Inception-style layers, but it's definitely in line with what you're looking for, I think! You start the game as characters playing characters (the storytelling), and can take it to the point where your characters' characters are, themselves, playing characters! It's a bit disorienting at first, but *great* fun once you get into the swing of getting your ""real-world"" jabs in on the sly.","1391212825"

MEXICO - The ex middleweight champion and current WBC number one contender at super middleweight, Julio Cesar Chavez Jr., states that he will not have problems making weight for his next fight against Brian Vera, and added that he might be joining the camp of the Mexican trainer Robert Garcia.

Despite the fact that the last few weeks it seemed that the relationship between Chavez and Garcia has not had a happy ending, Chavez Jr. told ESPN Nation that he was closing a deal with Robert to add him to his team in Culiacan, not in Oxnard, as had been planned initially. 

""Well, I'm only 12 pounds over the limit, it shouldn't be a problem, this is what I had weighed the night before the fight against Vera,"" said Chavez Jr. ""I have taken this fight very seriously, like never before in my career, with a lot of hunger, to demonstrate the discipline that I have, the work I've done these last few months, I have the opportunity to show the people the other side of what they've been seeing, I've been training for a long time, the people will see a different me,"" he added. (Run on sentence was in original article.)

Chavez was in front of the cameras with Frida and his little Julia, who, he assures, has been a great motivation in this new stage of his career, and that has done him very well in every sense, as he has begun to discuss a world championship.

""Logically I'd like to be champion, there has never been a Mexican super middleweight champion, we will see what happens, I would like to see how the fight with Brian Vera turns out, in this weight class there are great fights and great fighters who I can face,"" shared the Mexican pugilist, who will turn 28 on February 16.

With regard to the routine and the possible arrival of Robert Garcia, he expressed: ""I am working two or three times a day, I run in the mornings, train in the evenings, and I have prepared myself for four months, I have to work hard on my diet, and at the gym. I will finish my work in Culiacan, with Vladimir Baldenebro, my trainer, and it looks like this week I could incorporate Robert Garcia into the team, who will help me out for this fight.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I think if you're going to use magic at all, there should be rules. Give the people who possess these special abilities limitations. Oh, your character can manipulate fire? Great, but he isn't necessarily fireproof so he can't shoot fireballs out of his hands without severely burning his hands and forearms, or something. Basically, don't make them all-powerful beings that can destroy the world in an instant.

An excellent example of rules to magic is Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy. There were clearly defined limitations to people who could use magic, and he even incorporated a pretty creative system to give characters a ""mana pool"" so to speak, so they couldn't use their abilities indefinitely. This particular limitation itself came into play multiple times, and greatly affected the characters during combat and other aspects that Sanderson's magic system provided advantages in.

Be very, very careful about your selection of professors.  The thing people don't tell you is that while many of the professors are extremely intelligent and highly experienced, many of them are also terrible, terrible educators.  Grading policies can be nightmares, classroom policies can be ridiculous, etc.  Go to [rate my professors](http://www.ratemyprofessors.com) and search the available profs when you're registering for classes and read reviews.  Take them to heart.  


If you can take summer classes at a local community college where you're from when you're home, do it.  Saves you tons of money.  

If you have questions about specific issues with your account or registration or anything like that, there's a helpline you can call.  Go to the ERAU website and click on help and look around for resources.  Saves you the Riddle Runaround most of the time.  

Study.  Do your homework.  Pay close attention in class.  The professors expect a lot out of you, and when you move on to the next class they'll expect you to remember everything from your previous course.  Take it seriously, or you'll fail out like everybody else. (Also, knowing your shit helps to combat the occasional crappy professors)  

Go to freshman mixers and stuff, meet people, make friends, join clubs.  There isn't shit to do in Daytona, so your social well-being will depend entirely on the people you can interact with.  Also, it helps to be able to study with people and do homework together.  

Own an umbrella and a raincoat.  Don't pack much winter wear, it's only below 60 for a few weeks a year, and only ever below that for a few random days.  Lots of t shits and shorts and sandals.  


If you have more specific questions, feel free to ask.  This sub is kinda dead, which is disappointing, because I think plenty of people on campus use reddit and just don't think to find it.  If you have any questions you wanna PM me, feel free, I'm available 24/7!

 [**Dnsmasq**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnsmasq): 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Dnsmasq** is a lightweight server designed to provide [DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System), [DHCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol) and [TFTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol) services to a small-scale [network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports static and dynamic DHCP leases and [BOOTP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_Protocol) for network booting of diskless machines.

&gt;The developers of Dnsmasq targeted home networks using [NAT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) and connected to the Internet via a [modem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem), cable-modem or [ADSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_Digital_Subscriber_Line) connection, but the system would function well in any small network where low resource-use and ease of configuration are important.

&gt;Supported platforms include [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) (with [glibc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_C_Library) or [uClibc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UClibc)), [BSD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution) and Mac OS X.

Both the button and tilt controls worked very well.

It has also been ""appified"" with in-app transactions, so the full game as it is on console, isn't immediately accessible. There may also be some sort of energy meter type thing that restricts the number of races you can have per day or something, but I'm not sure about that.

Amaterasu is formed after the creation of the islands in a different story, from water used to wash Izanagi's eye. The Imperial Family is mythologically descended from Amaterasu, so Japanese are chosen in that sense, but not by the creation gods themselves.","1391212838"

Make sure to make your resume appealing to a tradesman. Nobody cares about unrelated jobs. Focus on things that are related to construction/maintenance. If you don't have that kind of experience, get some(labour, technical, anything). It's very competitive in Ontario and if you can't make the grade you might miss your shot.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Its about time that we accept that the role of religion is not very much different from that of fairy tales and fantasy tales for kids, i.e, TO INSPIRE THE PRINCIPLES OF MORALS into the growing mind of a CHILD. 

I'd like to put forward myself as an example here. Even though as a kid i was very much religious, i now support more of an existentialistic philosophical view because i find it more practical and logical. I still am very proud of my religious heritage and very romantic towards the morals set by it, but i feel that an individual has the power to elevate these morals towards a more ideal form by logically thinking over them. In days when i feel emotionally vulnurable, rather nihilistic, i turn towards religion and feel inspired to see that a group of people gain confidence by defining morals to achieve for themselves and by doing so given positive meaning to their existence. But one needs to realize that once they've reached those morals which usually should happen when one grows out of childhood, they should then use those achieved morals as platform and aim for improving them further. Finally, the assumption in my opinion is that the premises of the child are ideal for him to believe in the fairy tale(which here is religion)

"DealsReddit","t5_2sgx0","I've streamed HBO GO in crystal clear HD from my phone to it. And when I say crystal clear, it's as if I've got the Blu-Ray disc in. When we have cleaning day, we cast Pandora to the Chromecast and route the music through the surround sound. Netflix is flawless. And if you have a laptop, you can get the [Chromecast](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?hl=en) extension and send literally whatever is on your Chrome browser tab to your TV. Hulu Plus and YouTube also send over to the Chromecast exceptionally well.

If you've got an Android device, and you have synced your music on Google Play Music, which uses the cloud anyways, you can send your personal library to the device instead of Pandora and having ads. (Still waiting for Spotify mobile to be able to cast). I don't have Plex but it's a platform to keep all of your entertainment like movies and songs and what not all organized. 

There are a few smaller apps you can cast with (there's a podcast one, and an app called Revision3 which is like a technology news and review app/service for free on the Play Store).

Overall, the amount of entertainment I've gotten from this little thing is incredible. From my computer I can send my Facebook feed to it, I could cast Reddit, or if I lived alone and felt like it I could cast porn straight to it. This thing is fucking awesome and probably one of my top 5 purchases of 2013.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","This type of thinking assumes that accounts were placed correctly to begin with. I find it healthy that I receive higher skilled matches while I grind accounts up the ladder... 

In response to OP, plat matches are far easier to carry than gold matches. Higher mmr begets far more predictable behavior and easier/more dominant snowballing. The best thing a player can do is ignore the division rating and be thankful for the tier of matches you're receiving, especially if it's above your current skill level. Climbing the ladder is something that requires a significant skill difference from your current mmr. Players that either play inconsistently or hover at a 50% win rate shouldn't be climbing. The system compensates by trying to find the upper and lower limits of a players skill. This can be easily represented by a wave type curve..... Troughs and peaks, my friend.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;I believe that yes, we should each interpret it on our own

I thought you might say that. But here is the problem with that, Jesus didn't tell his disciples ""Go therefore and write the Gospel, and let it teach people all the things I have commanded  you"". No, Jesus said to them **you** go and teach them the things I have commanded. And that is how Christianity spread, by people who went as a unified group and taught a unified message, they didn't start by writing a gospel and then handing it out to people saying ""just figure it out on your own"". The Gospels and other Christian writings came later, they were sent to congregations that already existed, they were given to people who had already been taught about Jesus and had accepted him and been baptised. 

Also, when God gave the law to Moses, he didn't tell Moses just to hand it out to the people and let them figure it out on their own, but rather, he established a priesthood that were to teach the law properly to the people so that the nation would worship God in a unified way and in an acceptable way in God's sight. 

For Christians, if we were just supposed to figure it out on our own, then why did the Apostles and the older men gather in Jerusalem to settle the conflict that arose concerning circumcision? Then after they settled the issue they gave letters to Paul and Barnabas to take with them to the various congregation so that they would know the decision of the Jerusalem council. It's all written there in the book of Acts, a book that was written years after these events actually too place. This seems to be very odd behaviour if we are just supposed to figure things out on our own. 

I'm not a Roman Catholic by the way, I'm Eastern Orthodox. You may not be aware, but the for first 9 or 10 centuries there was only a single type of Christian. Eventually Christianity in the West split from Christianity in the East, the West were known as Catholic, and the East were known as Orthodox, but originally they were all one group. 

The Catholics in the West then went through the Reformation and further split into Protestants in the 1400's, and then splits have continued to happen since then, until now we have 10,000 denominations of people all trying to interpret the Bible on their own. In the East however we were mostly left out of the Reformation, thank God. 

I'm over simplifying, but that's basically the story. 

But getting back to the topic of the Trinity. 

What exactly do you think it means, in your interpretation, when John begins his Gospel by calling Jesus ""the Word of God""? ","1391212867"

They also have an extra grit wax, which I believe gives the strongest hold.

And if you are out in the open like a moron trying to figure out a Riddler Trophy, Deadshot blows your head off from the top of a building.

On the other hand, you might get the drop on one and if you are good, beat them early on.  They'd also have the ability to run away if they are getting beat, so there would be more to it than surviving, you'd also have to take them down.","1391212868"

One issue I had was not knowing when the round was going to end. Also, a huge problem is not being able to tell if two of the balls are close enough for a combo until it's too late. If I've already selected a couple balls but don't want to pop them yet because I have an opportunity to gather more up, I should be able to cancel my move until I'm ready to make it.

You could easily add level progressions to the game to make it more meaningful to continue playing. Each level would have a specific goal such as ""pop 50 white balls"" or ""make 4 septuple combos"". You could also add special balls that add a couple seconds to the timer. That very same time bonus ball could add additional bonus time for each additional ball of the same color chained to it.

The UX could also use some work here and there but I won't go into specifics right now.

"superman","t5_2qrwe","I always assumed they would go younger just because that's what's happened.

The comics turned Lex from an aging fat tycoon to a younger in shape man. His age roughly equal to Superman in appearance.

Smallville puts them close with Lex being in his early 20's(though Welling's actual age offsets this). 

The comics more or less made them the same age.

So basically Superman and Lex are made out to be equals. Two men who may or may not ride along the same path, meeting at a point. 

To make Lex a much older man has two issues. Well Zod was much older then Superman. This was a fathers war concluded by the son. Lex is typically about prohumanity or whatever but to be effective, Lex can't be on his way to the retirement home. He has to be in the same generation as Superman or else he's the generation on his way out. 

Someone has to be the man of tomorrow and an older Lex is the man of yesteryear. ","1391212871"

When American Idiot came out, Green Day was a well-established band actually making a comeback when their popularity had faded (not entirely, but it had dropped from a very high place it occupied in the mid-90's).

What really got American Idiot so much acclaim and won it a Grammy was at least *partially* its perceived anti-war, anti-establishment message, which was a big thing in 2004/2005 for the kind of people who make the decision about who wins a Grammy, and pushed it up to greater heights than it would have achieved otherwise.","1391212873"

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","&gt;Sarmiento does not suggest that the existence of Bigfoot has been established, but that its existence is possible and that claims and evidence deserve careful scrutiny. 

I can agree with that statement (from Wikipedia.)

I looked at the ""evidence"" and it was laughable. 

When someone has to draw outlines around parts of the impression and label them, because without those outlines it's just a bunch of blobs, that just might be a hint that the blobs are not very good evidence of anything, and whoever drew the outlines wants to you to see something that isn't there.

""But there are no deer tracks next to these blobs therefore bigfoot!""

No bigfoot tracks either?

Must be aliens. Or a bear. Or someone in a down coat who has spent decades in the woods with nothing to show for it, sees a patch of wet mud and gets an idea. What are the protocols in the community to figure out who is lying or manufacturing evidence?

No captured specimen. No body. No bones. No clear video. With everyone carrying camera phones these days and still no video, is the bigfoot community panicking? Circling the wagons? 

Don't fall into the echo chamber circled wagons trap. It's getting way too easy these days to gorge on only information you want to hear only from sources that sound good to you, and ignore things you don't want to hear...look at the politics forums on any website to see loads of people on left and right who are deliberately misinforming themselves by only reading 1 or 2 ""news"" sites.

What motherboard are you using right now thats acting screwy? Did you try a BIOS update on it at least or a reset to factory defaults just in case? 

There is also a jumper/Switch to reset it right on the board %99 of the time. I've worked on literally thousands of PCs and sometimes its just a simple reset or update if the hardware is wonky. Try all options before deeming it bad. 

Also test your ram just in case too, bad ram can cause all kinds of weird stuff. Download UBCD (Ultimate Boot CD) and burn the iso to a disc. Boot off of that and run memtest 86, make sure no errors, run some of the CPU stress and motherboard tests if you really want to make sure.

"Shotguns","t5_2swt0","I just got a Mossberg 500 with 20"" barrel and 8+1 magazine. I don't believe that there are any other barrels that will fit on this magazine. (There are rumors of a 28"" Maverick barrel that might work, but I don't think these exist.) The standard 18.5"" barrel will not fit onto my mag tube because the screw is attached to the barrel, not the tube. The screw is 1.5"" closer to the receiver than the end of the longer tube.

If you want to use the 8+1 tube, you will need the 20"" barrel. I don't think there is a way to make the 18.5"" barrel flush with the standard 5+1 tube, due to legal length restrictions.

Mine came with the 8+1 and 20"", then I used a hair dryer to break the loctite on the tube threads, and bought a 5+1 tube and 28"" field barrel. Now I can switch between. However, I cannot use the 28"" barrel with 8+1 tube or the 20"" barrel with the 5+1 tube. The screw is just not in the right place.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Dunking my head under water, high as fuck on a bunch of 2C-P, MXE, and the tail end of a bunch of methylone, with all of my clothes on in the bathtub in a last ditch effort to try and keep my pulse down. A combination of a panic attack, tachycardia, low pulse, and the wonderful positive feedback loop that drove it had me hoping that the cold water would somehow purify me as I thought of the relatively few people I love in this world who would miss me. It was a horrible experience that I never want to repeat. 

Driving home at noon on a weekday after a 12 hour coke binge was pretty bad, too. That was a few years earlier. I was rounding a curve and picking my nose for coke boogers when all of a sudden I felt a warm liquid. My nose was gushing blood. As I pulled up to my apartment complex from my friend's house, I saw the police hanging out in front of a neighbor's building. Somebody in the building had been evicted, and there was a bonanza of free shit hanging out on the front lawn. All I had to stuff my nose was some notebook paper. I rolled some of it up, stuffed it in my nose, and avoided the police as I picked through anything that looked useful. I took a shaving kit and a stereo and walked into my apartment, only to find that I had spent half a week's pay on coke the night before and would be late on rent. 

If you have a good life that's on track, please watch your drug use after you're old enough to really be a responsible adult. I didn't, and I'm playing catchup later in life. All the best to you all.

It's 2014, and in my state gay people are forbidden by amendment to the state constitution to marry, refuses to recognize the marriages of gay people performed in other states - and the legal protections that come of those marriages, forbids second parent adoptions, makes no protection against workplace discrimination for LGBTQ people, makes no legal protection against discrimination against school children on the basis of their sexual or gender identity, and the majority of the state legislature is run by people professing some kind of conservative religious agenda.

In YOUR state, after the state Supreme Court ruled for same sex marriage, the fringe religious right and Tea Partisans launched legal attacks on the judges in question leading to all three being booted from the bench. In 2014, those same right wing dickbags tried again to remove a judge for holding the same position. This time they failed.

Its one of the reasons I didn't really like that arc as much, the talons were way too strong, and were practically on par with Batman, until he hopped in that weird tank thing. The idea of rich people just making armies of Batmen seemed kind of ridiculous, you can't just make batmen, he's pretty unique. The League trains their people pretty hard, but even their foot soldiers were nothing compared to what the court created. The court just seemed way to powerful (or Batman too weak).","1391212879"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I volunteered at the Antique Gas and Steam Engine Museum in Vista, California (before I moved to Arizona about two weeks ago), working exclusively on the steam equipment (stationary steam engines, and steam traction engines). The museum has two shows a year - 3rd and 4th weekends of June and October - during which all the equipment gets fired up and demonstrated, and people from all over the country bring their antique equipment to show off. While the gas tractors can be turned on by any old idiot with a key (or screwdriver of the right size) during the off-season for $20 in gasoline or diesel, the steam equipment can only be run by certified boiler operators, and costs about $300 a day in fuel, and so only comes to life these eight days a year.

So, at the most recent threshing show, I was paired with an engineer named Dean, and his 1922 60HP Minneapolis engine. It was coal-fired, and I didn't know how to fire coal, so he had me drive. We made a few loops, and I discovered that because one of the springs was missing, the linkage would tend to fall into reverse every few minutes unless you constantly adjusted it. This becomes important later.

We decided to make a little parade. So, all the steam traction engines met up at the steam barn, and when everybody was there, Dean and I lead the way.

As we passed the lower field, where people had parked their RVs and camped out for the show, Dean suggested we head up the parade route. ""I think it's clear,"" he said (they had slow races and other events there throughout the day).

As we came around the corner, we realized that Dean was wrong. They were still doing slow races. But by the time we realized this, of was already too late - the other engines had blocked us in. We couldn't back out, and we couldn't go up the parade route.

""I think she'll fit through there,"" I heard Dean say. I looker to see where he was pointing.

There was a roped-off walkway, between Gas Engine Row (where the stationary gas engines sat on concrete foundations under a corrugated metal roof) and the field (where the Civil War reenactors camped in canvas tents during their time at the museum every year, and where now a bunch of Cub tractors and portable hit-and-miss engines sat). The path was maybe 7'-6"" wide.

So, Dean checked the water level, checked the fire, checked the pressure, and then got off the engine, leaving me there alone, on a machine I had never run before.

Now, before you panic, let me say a few things:

    I had tended the boilers before, and was familiar with their design and operation. I knew tp keep an eye on the water level, keep it up, and if I get in a fix, bank the fire, turn on the injector, close the dampers, and call for an engineer

    Each engine has a shovel on the back of the platform to bank the fire. The whole museum is unpaved, so dirt is not hard to come by

    There were multiple certified engineers within shouting distance, watching (with delightfully condescending grins) everything I did

&lt;/disclaimer&gt;

Dean walked up to the path, eyeballed it and the engine, motioned for me to come through, then disappeared. I was left now by myself on the engine, with some fifty people (not counting the engineers behind me) watching in eager anticipation.

But there was a problem. The engine was past the turn, lined up with the parade route - I needed to back up, turn sharply enough to avoid the nice 30s coup parked behind me, and get lined up. Easy, right?

For those unfamiliar, &gt;100-HP steam traction engines did not have power steering. They used a worm drive, so that the engineer usually had to turn the wheel some 15-20 times to turn left or right. Even with the gear reduction, aligning the wheels on a 14-ton machine is almost impossible while not in motion (think of how much more difficult it is to turn the wheels in your car while stopped, e.g. in a 3-point turn). In order to do what I needed to do, I needed to have one hand on the throttle (which must be jimmied and is difficult to control precisely), and one hand on the steering wheel (which I had already turned as sharply as I could while parked, but which still was only about halfway turned). Checks out, right?

Remember the tricky reversing linkage from earlier, which fell down (into reverse) unless held in place? This wasn't a problem as I backed up, but when it was time to pull forward (again, one hand on the throttle, one on the steering wheel), it became a juggling act.

Fortunately, the butterfly valve gods had mercy on me, and after backing the engine off dead center about seven times in front of a steadily-growing crowd (how often do you see an 18-year-old in coveralls with a massive blond fro, attempting to manoeuvre a 100-year-old steam traction engine in a crowded area?), I got the engine turning over at a nice, slow pace - on the first try. I made a note to sacrifice my strongest bull when - if - I got through this, and continued on, steering into the path.

The bath from before. The one with maybe 0'-2"" clearance on either side of the 14-ton machine I was piloting. With not a single person spotting me (imagine driving your car through a tunnel with that short a clearance - for 75 yards - where the walls curved slightly). I saw a lot of wide-open mouths (and even more open camera phones) amongst the public spectators, and, remembering who I was and what I was representing, tried to appear completely in control of the situation (which, at the end of the day, I was). About ten feet down the bath, the rear platform of the machine having cleared the first set of poles holding up the roof over Gas Engine Row, I realized I was going to make it so long as I kept a straight line. The feeling of elation I experienced is one I wish I could convey accurately with words. About halfway through, I joked with the crowd ""Never again will I complain about parallel parking in a tight spot"". The joke was stupid, but who cares? I had it made.

After about half an hour (~2 minutes) I made it out the other end; the pressure was still at 90PSIG, and the water level at ~5/8-3/4 glass. Dean appeared from behind the last engine at Gas Engine Row (where he had been watching my progress through the gears of the compressor they use to start the big diesels there), Hopper aboard, and said, smiling, ""What the hell took you so long? You're holding up the line behind you!"" (Travis, on his 1912 20/60HP Case, had just started down the path)

Epilogue: I thanked Dean for the opportunity as we approached the barn. Many jokes were made that night about how we, the steam team, seem to get into some kind of trouble at every show.


TL;DR: Steering a 100-year-old steam traction engine, owner navigates is into a dead end, only way out is alley with 2"" clearance, owner disappears, leaving me to do it.","1391212880"

I eventually ended up on the 56th page. There was a hentai photo of some female elf wizard I don't know what the fuck creature featuring tentacles being inserted into her vagina. I was confused, but thought it was silly. I thought it would be a good idea to tell my father what I found. I eventually begged him to come see what I found on the web. He wasn't very proud, but he wasn't disappointed. He just told me I need to be careful on the internet and that I shouldn't be looking at things like that.

Second story, gonna' cut it short. I was 10 and my father and I downloaded a giant .ZIP full of SNES roms, which is how I found Chrono Trigger and started developing my taste for retro vidya. Basically we're going through some weird Japanese titles, loading them and what not until we eventually stumbled upon some strange game full of nudity. Not very exciting, probably doesn't count as hentai but still a very weird moment for a young child and his father to share.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","It clearly has some distinguishing characteristics from other depression, but it also has a lot of similarities with what people would describe as severe depression. Depression is such a huge umbrella term that it's really hard to nail down what everyone is discussing when they talk about it. But I still disagree with you generally. I mean, I think that depression has a huge stress component, but there is also some strong evidence that genetic factors play a role - at least in some ""forms"" of depression.

EDIT: I would also say I know someone who suffered from postpartum depression and this person is the most mentally strong person I know. The last person anyone would suspect.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I believe depression is a chemical or genetic disorder.   I was adopted as an infant into a family where there was no depression, I suffered from it greatly, and when I met my biological mother, I learned that depression and other mental disorders (as well as traits like collecting/hoarding) run rampant through her family.   I was utterly unlike my adoptive family growing up and am very much like my biological mother in all kinds of ways.  Likewise, I have seen the same sorts of issues in my children.   

A family history of medical issues, whether it be heart disease, cancer, or mental health issues is fairly well accepted as valid.  You don't just get depression because you had a shitty childhood.  I know many people who had completely shitty childhoods who haven't been affected by depression at all.

Anti-depressants I was given never really seemed to do a damned thing for me.   I'm not big on therapists, either, having run into more good than bad, though I have seen some good ones.  I've worked a lot of stuff out on my own over the past 30 years since I first had a major depressive episode, and I think that some of the psychedelics that I have done have helped.   

Modafinil and other such drugs have made me feel more well-adjusted and motivated to not stay in bed all day than any SSRI I have ever been given, and I've had a lot of them.   Moderate use of weed lessens the day to day drudgery and grind, moving to a physical location where I felt more at home (mountains &amp; oceans, small town in Alaska away from crowds) also has had a huge positive impact.  

Mostly accepting who I am and recognizing depressive episodes when they begin and making sure I am getting good exercise, spending time doing things that relax and center me, and eating a good whole foods type of diet can help, but sometimes even all of that isn't enough.

I think people may arrive at depression for different reasons and through different pathways.    Hell, just having to go to a shitty job where you don't feel appreciated or well-compensated and living a life where you're doing good to live paycheck to paycheck can be enough to trigger me sometimes.  Because people arrive via different routes, different routes to feeling better also makes sense.  I have tried cognitive behavioral therapy and really grew frustrated with it.  It wasn't a route to feeling better.   Walking for hours and hours in the mountains, staying out all night taking photographs of night landscapes, adjusting my food, quitting a job that wasn't worth the strife, and yes, self-medicating with legal and illegal substances has worked for me.  I don't recommend it for everyone, but it's what has worked for me.","1391212884"

I live in Victoria, just across the water from Vancouver, and I would consider going to the game if the tickets weren't more expensive than a regular game. They're asking us to pay more to sit farther away from the action, in a building that doesn't have a great atmosphere for hockey. Throw on top of that the fact that I would have to pay for a ferry ride there and back, and a hotel to stay in Vancouver for the game, food, drinks...

&gt; Such a special place needed now to be kept apart from other regions, free from the indiscriminate traveler as well as the soldier of fortune. To guarantee such sanctity the very surface of the earth was rent. In response to God’s decree, the great continents separated and the ocean rushed in to surround them. The promised place was set apart. Without habitation it waited for the fulfillment of God’s special purposes. With care and selectivity, the Lord began almost at once to repeople the promised land. The Jaredites came first...

Apparently, Mr. Holland believes that Pangaea, which began to split apart 200 million years ago, was done by the Lord in order to preserve the Americas for Jaredites, Nephites, and Lamanites. And in Mr. Holland's mind, the time difference between 200 million years and a few thousand years (Jaredite arrival) can be described as ""almost at once"".","1391212887"

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Any particular reason for going against what your statement was about not gating content? why is content being paygated behind the collectors edition?

You seem to be well aware that you had to come up with something for the digital collectors in order to get them to buy, else you wouldn't of put anything in there. So this raises the questions as to why it's there in the first place? this screams a cash grab and changing the game to fit marketing needs. Why was this decision taken?

Is this a sign of things to come? will you not stand by your statement and will we now see more things appear in the cash shop like this or other content?

It seems to me like the statement of why you went sub based doesn't match up with your actions.

If the digital collectors edition wouldn't sell unless you put something like this in, then perhaps it would of been wise to leave the collectors edition as a physical box as is pretty standard and not alter the game in order to fit a cash grab situation.

Also would like to know why there hasn't been any activity from Zenimax here? the two posts you've made is the first i've seen on here. Where is the communication? the likes of SOE / Wildstar interact with their customer base, but you guys seem to completely dismiss it. Is this what it's going to be like during launch?

Are these types of actions the base of what we should expect in the coming months / years with ESO? because that plays into whether or not buying the game is worthwhile investment of time / money or not.

Confidence in this game has just taken one knock after another and these types of actions over the past few months (just as things were starting to turn around) makes it more and more difficult to put any faith in you to be perfectly honest. You've shown that you go back on your word, your statements of what your vision is. The mature rating situation was a good thing, made me think that you wouldn't actually change the game to meet a rating, but you instead change the game to meet a collectors sale.

This not only secures them against malware such as cryptolocker, but also keeps them secure should you lose your data to a natural disaster or hardware failure.

"science","t5_mouw","But you are assuming a sort of happy random square dance of interbreeding. To begin with, we have no evidence that either the Vikings or the (speculated) Asians left any living descendants behind. Second, some people are pretty insular and don't really accept outsiders.

If we hadn't genotyped a bunch of these folks, I'd say it was kind of up in the air, but as it is the evidence we have strongly suggests that some people still have 100% native American ancestry.

1. It would take you ~388 days to mine a block when mining solo at the current difficulty. Obviously, this isn't going to be a good plan if you want dogecoins quickly. Your best bet is to join a pool where you get smaller, more consistent payouts.

2. You won't really need to worry about this since your chances of getting a block solo are pretty much zero. Join a pool, they're much better.

3. You can set the intensity and change how hard your card works.


Check the two mentioned subreddits for more information, they've got a few tutorials for mining with Nvidia cards and joining pools.

As a matter of fact, it's a subject I know a great deal about, I don't ignore reality or research - I am intimately and academically familiar with the realities if bdsm. That's utter bullshit. Bar the opening sentence, my opinions aren't emotional, or incorrect for that matter.

You can hardly whinge about other people responding to your comments on a public thread. That's ridiculous. His comment that you responded to was not aimed at you either!

You haven't addressed a single point I made, furthermore I don't recall you citing or linking to any academic articles or research in any of your comments. By all means, if you have specific (and varied, I.e. More than one author or source) to back all the comments you have made, I would legitimately be interested.  Biological links to personality, unless studies directly relating to bdsm and kink, doesn't have much relevance.

With regards to Kink.com employees knowing more than me and being more involved than I am? Why, because it's their job? 

I'm not threatened by someone with a degree in psychology. I find it a fascinating subject and respect it a great deal. However, a mere degree in a subject so broad does not mean that you have a speciality in this area, or indeed that you have studied it particularly in great detail. 

Other than holding a degree in psychology you made no reference to being any kind of expert - the only comment I can recall you making is that you have some sort of knowledge about the psychology/physiology behind the interpretation of pain as pleasurable.

When you hit ""watch Replay"" and are taken into the replay itself, wait for everyone to choose a hero and then look up in the top right. There's a little eye sign, click it and you should get a couple of menus to pop-up just below it. One of the buttons on the menu is called ""Takeover"" right underneath copy to clipboard.

Scroll to the moment of your choice, and press Takeover. Dota then launches a lobby so you can invite people to the game and you get to select which hero you want to be in the lobby (each slot has a heroes's icon).

Then just hit play and you're golden. It'll launch the game at the right time and will be paused on entry. Word of advice, any heroes without players won't be spawned in, bots arent added either. This means that if you try to do what I did (launched a takeover lobby, to recreate an awesome teamfight where I wrecked face, by myself) then you're going to be left standing on an empty field as you'll be the only hero to spawn in.

Also I think Rune Spawning differs from the original but I'm not sure.

Luckily Triumph stopped making the bra she liked best, plus she lost some weight too. I also landed several job interviews at high-end boutiques selling bras around the time.

Depending on if states could take sides, it would be a pretty interesting conflict.

Texas advantages : Militia strength, more guns per capita, oil

California : Great geographical location (mountain ranges/deserts block borders, large amount of ports), largest economy in the US by far, greater food output, larger population

Again, depending on how other states took sides, results would vary. In the end, however, I think CA's greater population, coupled with it's geographic situation would prove to be the winner. ","1391212896"

in the crash that rate was lowered to 0-0.25%, lower than it had ever been. this was approximately dec 2008. the market still fell. the fed invented a new market activity which behaved, effectively, like a negative rate; something commonly referred to as quantitative easing. so, on top of buying and selling treasury bond operations to maintain the fed rate at 0-25bps, they also buy MBSs in specified quantities. the 2nd part is QE. (the semi-recent announcements of cutting back on QE is analogous to raising the fed funds rate.)

i briefly skimmed this report, but it seems that a pair of economists have quantified and translated qe into a number that is more closely related to the historical fed funds rate. not exactly earth shattering news. anyone who understood fed ops has known that the fed operations has been akin to a neg rate; perhaps the novelty is a new phrase, ""shadow rate"", which makes it sound more spooky.","1391212899"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","She reflects somewhat, but it's mostly her scorning those that she feels have abandoned her; Gendry, Hot Pie, Yoren, Harwin, which plays into her determination not to want to desire belonging somewhere.

Arya is my favourite character so I'd like to think that that realisation is coming as well. She wants to abandon who she was because she thinks it will make her stronger as the pain of Arya is a weakness to her and you can't take from someone who has nothing. But the fact she can't discard Needle and that to her the candle in the House of B&amp;W smells like Winterfell shows that deep down she really doesn't want to give up who she was. 

If she abandons Arya, she abandons her memories of her father and mother, her siblings, her home. That's when she was happy and I despite what she says, or would like to do, I don't think she's prepared to give that up.

Dany keeps saying ""If I look back I am lost"" but I think in Arya's case she needs to look back in order to truly find herself. Once she fully accepts her past and realises her desire to belong isn't a weakness but something she can draw strength from, she'll become even stronger than she already is.","1391212902"

My vision isn't great and I probably had the featured episode on the brain from doing it so many times.  But some questions remain: what the hell is a loot critter and why would I want to talk to it during an STF?

---

I'm seeing ""Talk to the Doctor"" and possibly other popup prompts (center of screen) relating to A Step Between Stars in space STFs (ISE, KSE, CSE, CCE) after completing the featured episode, about 5-7 times per STF.  Not sure whether it's related to completing the episode.  Prompts appear and disappear rapidly, too fast to read without seeing them several times, *possibly* when loot drops for other players are in range.

Edit: Err, well maybe it said ""Talk to Doctor Eric Cooper"" or some variation on that or maybe I'm losing my mind.  And scratch that part about other players' loot drops.  I finished a CSE and there was a lone drop for me left on the map.  Upon picking it up, a ""Talk to..."" message popped up.  I've also seen it when not picking up loot.  I'm pretty sure the message was short at one time (""Talk to the Doctor"") and is now longer and ends in ""Cooper,"" but it's hard to be sure.

Grrrr: I swear it says ""Talk to Loot Doctor"" or some shiz.  Starting to drive me crazy.","1391212902"

&gt; How safe do you feel now when cycling around your town or city? Has this feeling improved from the past?

My time is Split between Uni and Home. Uni being one of the largest cities in the UK, home being rural.

At Uni I wouldn't go as far as saying I feel unsafe, but there are definitely more incidents - which is to be expected seeing as there are more people about. Obviously there are a few idiots out there who just want to cause hassle. But the majority of the problems I've had that weren't my fault were just people taking bad decisions, it happens to the best of us!
There are plenty of cyclist on the roads, so drivers are generally aware. As long as you don't ride like a prick you shouldn't get much trouble. 
When I was riding a lot the vast majority of trouble I had was caused by other cyclists, unfortunately. I got sick and tired of people almost running into my because they were jumping red lights or giving me hassle because I didn't want to filter up the inside of a lorry turning left. 

I've had one nasty incident while riding at uni, where a woman who was on her phone overtook and decided to turn into a side road half way through. Some how she managed to rip off my chain and sent me on a leisurely flight into the road. I get the feeling she wasn't expecting my speed, this area of road is fairly easy to match traffic speed and as a result I was riding within the lane (at the speed of the bus in front) so I could overtake slower cyclists who were closer to the curb. So I think she misjudged it and thought she could make it.

Again, poor judgement but fair enough. What really got me is that the nasty cow didn't even bother putting the phone down, she just opened the window to call me an idiot and drove off. 

That is the only time I've had any sort of real trouble. Most of the problems I've had seem to come from people thinking I'm going slower than I was, which is fair enough.

Strangest thing to happen was some lads in a van overtook about 6 of us when we were going down hill at 30mph-ish calling us benders and then pulled back in and dropped back to the speed limit. We found that highly amusing so we decided to pick up the pace  and ride along side them (the road by this point was 2 lanes each side and slightly downhill), which the lads in the van found hilarious. Had a quick chat with them at the lights and it was all good fun. 
The point of my story is that some cyclists would have caused an uproar about that, but at the end of the day it was just a bunch of lads taking the piss out of another bunch of lads who were wearing lycra... Can't blame them!


I'd say the facilities for commuting cyclists have actually got worse around here, due to poor maintenance. 

=
At home, in the rural area, there isn't any sort of cycling facilities. I do most of my riding on single track roads up in the mountains.
I generally feel safer than at uni, but the worry of meeting someone around a blind corner at speed is a bit frightening.
Generally around the area I live people are relaxed, I do my best to be friendly and helpful to drivers where I can - Moving in, waving them past when I can see it's safe, giving them a friendly wave and such. People seem to respond well to that in the rural area, I often get people giving me the thumbs up or giving a friendly beep for it. At the end of the day it's just common courtesy to be polite to someone who's patiently waited behind you until it was safe for them to overtake/me move over... Isn't it?

Only problem I've ever had at home is a bus coming out of a side road and a bit to far into my lane. It was all a bit last minute, but I just moved out of the way and he waved sorry. No harm done.


&gt;What kind of cyclist would you regard yourself as - a regular commuter during weekday mornings and evenings, or someone who rides as a serious hobby in your spare time? Perhaps a non-committal hobby cyclist every now and again?

I was a keen hobby cyclist, riding with many who cycled at a competitive level. We used to ride out of the city into the sticks. People in the city didn't like the fact we had a 5/6 rider chain going on, but it was rare that we didn't match traffic speeds within the city. 

Now I'm not really anything, but I hope to become a competitive rider soon.

I get the feel commuters get a lot more trouble. Everyone seems to be in a bad mood on their commute, regardless of their chosen vehicle. It'll help that I do most of my riding in hilly areas and they tend to be pretty rural. 

=

If I could make the roads a better place for both drivers and cyclists, my main change would be getting everyone to relax! Forget segregated cycle lanes, forget ASLs, forget the lot of it.
Everyone's attitude seems to change when they are on the road, and I'm not sure why! British roads feel hostile. People make mistakes, minor mistakes aren't something to shout and scream about. Near misses that could end up killing you, fair enough - I'd get upset. But why do some people feel the need to block commuters riding past them in traffic jams? If some bloke things he can pull out in time, but changes his mind, then why shout and swear?! Being angry isn't going to change how long it takes you to get from A to B. Just relax, be a decent person and I genuinely feel like the majority of the issues we have on UK roads would end.","1391212904"

You're obviously much smarter than i am. I don't even understand the words that I am using.  So, please explain this to me.  You think that morality = respect for property rights.  Some cultures do not recognize or even understand the concept of ""property"".   If you do not recognize the meaning of term ""property"" how can you respect one's property rights?  are you saying that societies that do not recognize property are immoral?

"dogemarket","t5_2zdvv","I'm 1000% sure that you're one of the kind of people that will never be satisfied. However, I'm going to try and convince you anyway. 

With this sort of thing, the goal as a mod is not to match everyone's own personal view on reality, but to match the majority's. Luckily, in the world of design, there are a few objective standards we can base this sort of thing off of.

A few things for instance:

* Coloring: The old design ([here](http://web.archive.org/web/20140119070859/http://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket)) contained a significant amount of puke-green coloring that not only looked horrible, but was physically hard on the eyes. The old layout was a rainbow of unnecessary color. The only place where juxtaposing colors should be used are in the post titles, for separation and clarity, and we've retained that feature. Color is important because you don't want people to focus on the colors themselves, but the function they provide.

* Bloated bars and banners: The old layout had an array of rounded, squared, and drop-shadowed bars that, while flashy, did not help draw attention to important things. They actually drew the majority of the attention to the titles themselves and not the information underneath. Through the use of simple lines, bold titles, bullets and numbering, we've blended the sidebar into the site itself. The information is what is important. The old sidebar's background was white and the new one is a light tan. Not much of a difference there, but it's true to dogecoin.

* The heading banner: The old one *conceptually* was good. It just looked horrible. The scales and seal were a good representation of what we are, but it was too large, and again, that puke-green. We figure allowing the community to design a banner, alien, and ""DogeMarket"" logo would help find the best way for that to look. It'll be thinner and nicer-looking. The banner shouldn't dominate part of the screen.

Anyway, I'm not bashing the work and functionality of the old design. The mods who started this subreddit deserve a lot of credit for the amount of work they put in and they know what the old design represented. It served its purpose. Everything worked and did what it needed to do, but the look and layout was considerably lack-luster compared to other subreddits. We'll probably be hitting 10,000 subscribers in the next month or so. I want to keep dogecoin fun and friendly, but it's time to start maintaining a professionalism. Real money is traded here. This isn't a toy box or a game. We can have fun and still understand the implications of investment, economics, etc.

I mean, shit, we did keep Comic Sans... what more could you want?

**EDIT: I would like to add that the current layout isn't set in stone. It was something we designed and implemented relatively quickly, during the implementation of a few *much more important* aspects of this site, like all of SuchModBot's functionality.**","1391212907"

Anyways, we head back to my place — it's been probably an hour at this point, and decide to ingeniously start engulfing upon fig newtons. Within fifteen minutes, we look down at the container and realize none are left. It's at this moment I start to question just how high I am. ""Did we really just eat that entire container?"" The idea seemed ridiculous, and hilarious to boot. Things began to slow down to a standstill, and I felt an intense rush of anxiety creep upon my entire presence. I awkwardly excused myself to the bathroom, where I immediately turned on the light and stared at myself in the mirror. Bad idea. I decided to turn off the light and crawl up into the corner of the bathroom, where I felt a sudden sensation of nausea. I began vomiting, thinking this was the end to my dismay. Sadly, this merely exacerbated my feeling of an existential crisis. Sound, space, and time no longer were computing in my mind and it felt like I was on a never ending roller coaster through the cosmos. It was a borderline hallucinogenic experience. 

Long story short, I stayed in the bathroom for the remainder of the night where I probably threw up a half dozen times. By morning, I was still high and I relayed the information to my friend. Turns out he was in the other bathroom across the hall throwing up as well that night. We still laugh at this entire experience, but I'd be negligent to act like it didn't freak me out quite a bit at the time. Haven't consumed fig newtons since. ","1391212908"

But personally I'd rather plead a migraine or something and head home to my Safe Zone than run the risk of blowing up, ""freaking out"", etc. If they are true friends, they will understand. Try to remember that everything feels and seems different than what it really is when that Dark Shit comes over us. Everything feels Pointless and Finite and Permanent, when it's not. Like looking at a negative version of a photograph; we aren't seeing the shit for what it really is. There's this urge to Sever, as I think of it. To Damage and Sever ties with people, jobs, hobbies, whatever. 
The burden lies on the part of the REAL us that is still in there, still trapped inside, to be Damage Control, to remember ""Man this isn't real, this is just The Darkness."" When I feel it coming, I get the hell away.
There is no reason to be ashamed of the disorder we share, only of the actions we take because of it.
You can try to explain to your friends what's really going on, but it's a risk. Not that they will run screaming from you or anything, but in my experience they will either understand or try to talk you out of it for some reason, to brush it off, think they can Fix It by telling you to cheer up or they will tell you there's nothing wrong with you, just man up or whatever. This can be extremely frustrating and lead to arguments, because honestly they cannot truly understand the disorder if they don't have it, and their suggested solutions will be common sense things for ""normal"" people, but might not help people like us. 
Good luck.

Remember the video of that kid who reinvented sand bags for storms that was on Ellen a couple weeks ago? He was little, but apparently knows a shitload of chemistry, enough to make a significant change to SANDBAGS, even though he couldn't even pronounce ""water"" correctly. Everyone loved him. Reddit however, was smart. The comments were filled with people calling him out as being helped by his two chemist parents. It was so unbelievably obvious the kid didn't do that himself and that his parents basically did everything for him. That is today, where we have a lot of educated scientific people in our society.

Flash back to Mozart's time. Mozart's father brings his son in to the Emperor and says ""hey, my son composed this!"" The Emperor says ""wow! he's a genius!""

History is made.

I have no doubt that Mozart's father really educated him a lot from very early on in his life, but I don't see how people buy that any child at that age could fully understand music at that level. It isn't about how the brain functions or absorbs the information. Some things just take time, regardless of how smart you are.

I would bet a lot that his father basically held his hand the entire time, just like that sandbag kid, until he could compose things himself. There is literally no evidence to prove that Mozart himself composed the works when he was that young.","1391212909"

If, for instance, X output can be produced using 2 units of labor, but 2X output can be produced by using a combination of 1 unit of labor and 1 unit of capital (at 1.5X total cost), does that count as economies of scale, even though one input has decreased?

Also, are time and land counted as factors of production in this definition? Unfortunately, though I have several Micro textbooks at my disposal, none of them differentiate between the two very well (I'm also slightly worried that I encouraged this question in the first place...).","1391212910"

"space","t5_2qh87","Astronomers have observed cratering on rubble pile asteroids that must have come from another celestial object with enough energy to pulverize a monolithic asteroid of same size as the rubble pile asteroid. And yet the rubble pile still exists. The spacing between the smaller bodies that make up the rubble pile are very good at damping all that energy.

Edit: Copy and past this comment that I made elsewhere here

Let's take 25143 Itokawa, a [pretty small one](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/dawn/20110718/pia14316-43.jpg), with a volume of about 30 million cubic meters, a density of about 2000 kg/m^3 moving at around 25,000 m/sec. That's about 2x10^19 Joules, or 4780 megatons. Apparently the US uses the W88 nuclear warhead right now, which is .475 megatons. The largest nuclear device made is 58 megatons. [All nuclear testing to the mid 90s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLCF7vPanrY) has been 510 megatons spread across 2000 nukes. Granted, many other NEAs are much smaller than Itokawa, but its mass is lower than many asteroids only a few kilometers across.","1391212911"

You don't actually lose too much utility by putting Siren in there because her skill has pretty good synergy with Angelion and Valk. Once you really get your healer team up and going, you'll likely find yourself in descended dungeons where there's one big final boss. In these situations, you'll probably need to stall in earlier floors for which Siren's heartmaker skill is quite useful. Siren is also useful against the final boss. Yes, you lose Echidna's damage, but you gain additional damage from Angelion, Valk x2 and Shynee. So I think it's a net damage increase. Basically, you're using Angelion+Siren+Valk to make all heart/dark/fire orbs turn to light. Then use Shynee's 3x skill to have one big damage round of 27x damage multiplier and comboing as many of those light orbs as possible. It's a pretty effective way of clearing the boss.

There are better options out there, but Siren is pretty standard because anyone can obtain her and she's a decent sub to have.","1391212913"

"Metallica","t5_2qwwr","Hey and thanks for commenting. I checked moderus III out (via [this link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7AE1QwJE60), though the torrent for the ""moderus III.2"" sounds quite different) and to be honest it sounds very nice. The drums are more ""clicky"" and defined in the high-end, which I generally always strive for.
A problem for me with all Death Magnetic stems I've found so far is that the drums are inconsistent, it sounds almost like they vary a low-pass filter on the drums, particularly the snare, so some parts are very snappy and with lots of sharp and clear attack, but then the snare sound for riff sections suddenly lacks all that definition. In some tracks you can also pretty much hear the filter vary between open and more closed in broad steps.

I could have EQd the snare to be more snappy, but then I'd have to put a HUGE limiting factor on the high frequencies to tame the fill and break sections where that area fills in, and that would cause some pretty unnatural sound (I tried it but didn't like the result, it immediately sounds compressed and you loose the relaxed, open quality I was prioritizing).

A better solution might be to simply use triggered samples of the snappy attack phase of the drums of each song and fill that in on the more muted snare sections, but that's alot of work, and I took the muted snare as an excuse to take a different approach to the mix, going for a more mid-focused, slightly smeared tape sound, hopefully still very airy and not fatiguing.

As for the drums, I thought I didn't like the bangy body of them, but once I found this source and noticed how clean it was, I really like the snare body for most tracks. It doesn't distort the entire track like the retail version did, I tried mixing it loud, but not overly so. Since the sound is warm to begin with, bass-heavy or warm headphones are maybe going to be at risk of being a bit boomy. Hopefully that's not too much of a problem.

If you listen to it all once you get it all down, feel free to give me any further thoughts, and thanks again!","1391212914"

You've made some errors.

First, Seralini did do improper stats. To begin with, he didn't test whether there was an effect as the Monsanto study did. 

Doing the basic statistics that Seralini neglected to do shows NO significant difference. 

Second on statistics, the Monsanto study: reported all data while Seralini: cherry picked only the subset of data that supported his conclusion. 

Third, on methedology.... you say the rat group size was small. Well, the monsanto had twice as many rats. That isn't the ""same indiscretion"", that is twice as many rats. 

Fourth, also on methedology, the use of rats predisposed to tumors wasn't a problem for Monsanto because they were studying them over a far smaller period of time - before tumors show - and they weren't looking for tumors.

In short, none of the things that you pointed out as ""bullshit"" stand up to honest scrutiny. The claim that it ""has the same indescrtions"" is a lie. ","1391212916"

"IAmAFiction","t5_2su77","Conflict appears to be the only constant in life. We are no strangers to war, and from what we can see from here, neither are humans. 

We had come to the conclusion that if there was another alien species, they would've contacted us with superior technology by now. Thus, we were not looking for life, and stopped doing so once we realized the scope of such a task.

In truth, we were testing a defensive scanner. Our technology is still evolving. Recently, pirates have developed methodologies to cloak themselves from our ships senses. A valid counter to this strategy has not yet been found (the defensive scanner didn't work).

In order to test our scanner,we needed no interference , so we warped to a far away sector of space. We released the device. It didn't accomplish what we desired, so we turned on our old scanners to retrieve the device.

It detected two devices. We traced the trajectory and radio transmissions of the alien device, leading us in this direction. We retrieved the device from afar with our tractor probes. We studied the device. The technology followed no familiar pattern. We had no explanation. We desired not to be foolish, but the device proved to be a vector of an idea we couldn't contain. We weren't alone. 

We waited for this moment, but we had never thought to prepare. We never assumed we would be the visitors.The inverse startled us.We train for pirates, we train for disasters, we train for mistakes, but we had never trained for being the first visitors.We had no idea what to do.

We decided to simply approach and observe in hopes that our next decision would be more clear.We found a lack of any colonies on any planets except for one, so we know that whatever species this was lacked space combat capabilities.After about one week of watching the only populated planet, we found an array of what looked like symmetrical, white discs. It looked like primitive radio antenna from our days of old. We decided to launch a probe and use it to send radio waves towards the antenna. We did so from the probe instead of ourselves, as we didn't know if there would be a violent reaction with technology we would have never seen before.Instead, the discs turned to the probe, following it. There was no violent reaction.

Then we made contact.

&gt; Hora, also known as horo and oro, is a type of circle dance originating in the Balkans but also found in other countries.

&gt; The name (spelled differently in different countries) is cognate to the Greek χορός: 'dance' which is cognate with the ancient Greek art form of χορεία; see Chorea. The original meaning of the Greek word χορός may have been 'circle'. Also the word is present in Slavic languages and ""hora"" and ""oro"" are found in many Slavic languages and have the meaning of round (dance) and the verb 'oriti' means to speak, sound, sing which previously meant to celebrate.

&gt; The Greek χορός is cognate with Bulgarian хоро 'horo', Romanian 'horă', Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian/Montenegrin/Slovenian 'kolo', Macedonian/Montenegrin 'oro', the Turkish form 'hora', 'valle' in Albania, and in Hebrew הורה (Hora). Name of the Khorumi dance from Black Sea coast of Georgia also might be connected to Greek, as well as the name of the Horon dance in neighbouring Turkish regions.

In Greek, you'd often use the word with a modifier: κυκλωτικός χορός (kiklotikós horós) - circle dance. ","1391212920"

**paul beard:**   Maybe one day, we'll understand that economics is a tool for observing and understanding behavior, not a set of natural laws like Newton's. In other words, it works for us, not the other way around. ﻿

**Edward Morbius:**  I'd say it's on par with ecology.  It's a study of complex systems, and it _must_ account for energy and real inputs, not simply monetary flows.  It's been getting there but very, very, very haltingly.  I've also been some reading on Herman Daly (former World Bank economist, I just learned), who, the more I read of him, the more I like.﻿

**paul beard:**  And like ecology, it seems obvious and you find yourself wondering why so many of us have to work it out for ourselves instead of growing up with it. ﻿

**Edward Morbius:** Something I'm digging into.  What I'm finding is that a lot of economics is more an apologia and justification for things which benefit certain classes (particularly bankers and speculators), going back to David Ricardo's time (himself a speculator).  I was glancing at J.K. Galbraith's The _Great Crash 1929_ earlier today and noting a few of his observations -- he really had a turn for short, cutting statements.  I'd noted a few but really need to go through the book again (it's brief, just under 200 pages excluding the index) and pull some of them out.

One that I did note, however:

&gt; By affirming solemnly that prosperity will continue, it is believed one can help insure that prosperity will in fact continue.  Especially among businessmen the faith in the efficiency of such incantation is very great.

And that's a lot of it:  economics preaches eternal growth because eternal growth solves a great many problems.  Whether or not it's possible.

Hint:  it's not.﻿

Also, I'm tired as fuck and I don't really trust my ability to do basic addition right now, let alone hold fractions in my head. It wouldn't surprise me if I'm missing something incredibly obvious.

And actually, looking at it, this makes sense. 3.75 / (75/20) is equal to 1, making the zoom_sensitivity_ratio values suddenly not arbitrary. And it also means that your math makes perfect sense.

For one thing, you should look up Lamarckism: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism  

Chimpanzees' children would not have their testicle size just because they have sex a lot. Traits are only passed on because they make it more likely for a animal to survive and reproduce.

Please post a source saying that humans are ""naturally monogamous"". For most of our history (Before the agricultural revolution, in other words, FOR ALMOST 200,000 YEARS), we lived in small tribes of 50 people and would have sex with anyone. Often the mother would not even know who the father was.

Only recently with agriculture did we become monogamous (and just look at the divorce rate to see how that's working for us, that's because it's a effect of SOCIETY). So by your logic we should be the same as chimpanzees.","1391212922"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","That is wrong! Look at Sims as example even though hackers showed it can work offline also but with less stuff going on. When console would be switched offline game would become dumber and not as alive. Cloud doesn't need to controll 100% of AI but just a good chunk of it leaving resources for other things but when offline just tone it all down. So perhaps you should study the cloud as MS is not the only ones EA, MS, Nvidia.

The statistic was for xbox 360 due to having to have ethernet cable plugged in or buy a wireless adapter and now everyone needs to connect in order to do the update and if they did it wirelessly they stay thatway connected.

Well xbox doesn't need the cloud in order to run a game but on a level that titanfall is neither console is powerful enough alone. And I can see that in your mind PS4 is just this allmight powerful machine when as a matter of fact it's barely more powerful than xbox one lass difference than x360 v. ps3. And both consoles are weak compared to pc's now as to how x360 ps3 were to PC back then.


Here you go read the article says ""we approached Sony and Microsoft with problem""
http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/titanfall-developers-spell-out-benefits-of-xbox-one-cloud/

They never said that game was coming to PS4 gamers only assumed that because Respawn sounded upset that exclusivity was struck without their knowledge.

Cloud could be done by anyone but guess what? Sony is broke and only one of the buildings for the cloud cost MS $800 million plus all the equipment and servers inside. Only other service in the world that has as many servers as MS is Google but their servers are not Azure. Sony doesn't have the money to compete with that. Sony curently had about 20 thousand servers including gaikai where xbox 360 had 15K by itself. So instead of calling me a liar do a simple search.

Yeah they are saying it's a good UI compared to before but no one is saying that it's better UI than xbox UI. Xbox is receiving an update by march that will take care of that but to my knowledge ps4 will still be stuck with same ui as past showed it. Now can you go into your messages and back into the game without having to reload the game? 

Xbox has way more features and more and more will be added and everyone knows that.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","A good DAC can perfectly reconstruct a waveform from its samples.  The DAC does not actually produce ""staircase"" shaped waves, it interpolates between the points.  Regardless of interpolation design, any analog signal is continuous, but I can't imagine any modern DAC ever being designed without nonlinear signal interpolation in mind.  

Vinyl sounds different because the device is an analog electro-mechanical instrument.  It's a century+ old design and in general it can add a bit of color that happens to be pleasant because of design know-how.  Just like the wood in an electric guitar *adds* to the sound, despite actually *distorting* the sound.  It is possible to make a guitar whose wood makes the sound worse, but no one does that.

Also, the whole ritual of setting up the record usually means people are listening to music without doing anything else.  If your record player and preamp and whatnot are nice, you probably listen for a difference in clarity or warmth or whatever, and whether or not you hear it, you're listening more closely.  Listening closely enhances any listening experience unless you're hearing something wrong with your system or headphones.

When you're dealing with these kind of loan deals, they're usually of benefit to both clubs. One is either offloading some wage money, or giving a youngster some invaluable experience, while the other is getting cheap reinforcements to their squad.

If that's not an option for whatever reason, then here are the parts you need:

1. A PEP -- performance enhancing proxy
2. A multiplexing mechanism
3. A switch that can do 802.1q VLANs and a router that understands tagged frames.  If you can configure different addresses on each satellite modem then just put them all on the same VLAN with one of the router's interfaces.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","It seems like this is an issue important to you and I will not make any assumptions about your background or experience, but I can tell you in my years of working and managing actual pay rate has one of the lowest affects on employee happiness.

When it comes to wages, employees want to know they are being paid more then the minimum; have reasonable and frequent opportunities for pay raises; and be paid equally compared to their coworkers who do similar work and competitively in the marketplace.

One of the biggest issues I dealt with was when our entire district got a standard of living pay adjustment. The new starting wage was the equivalent of the previous wage plus three years of raises. Employees were furious. Long term employees were upset that their pay adjustment was less then short-term employees. Short term employees were mad that they were making the minimum despite their full training and experience. Everyone was making more then they were before, but the wage versus tenure ratio was changed causing resentment.

Furthermore, along with this pay adjustment there was a reduction in raise percentages which further upset employees when their annual raise came around. This also closed the pay gap between supervisors and the rest of the staff. Getting a promotion was much less of pay bump, but still the same amount of work causing less employees to see advancement as an opportunity.

Consistently, between the stores and companies I've worked for the least happy employees have worked in the same position for a number of years, are topped on at their pay scale, and unwilling to take more responsibility or a promotion. They often squander their benefits (abuse time-off privileges, frequently take pay loans, show up late) and then complain the company isn't doing enough or being unfair. Meanwhile, the happiest have been employees who are genuinely interested in the work, have a goal and are enthusiastic about advancement regardless of their payrate.

That being said, wages are the most limited way of showing employees you care about them and their work. People are generally not good with money and don't live within their means so an incremental pay raise often has little affect on their quality of life. On the other hand, company benefits such as paid time off show the company cares about your personal time; medical benefits show the company cares about your health and well being; 401K shows the company is willing to invest in your future.

Finally the little things like adequate staffing and managerial support add a lot to employee satisfaction. Like OP said, very seldom will a company be overstaffed. In this case, an overworked department with a staff of 20 can be given a 5% raise and you have a marginal and short term affect on happiness, whereas hiring another employee to reduce everyone's workload 5% could make everyone happier and more productive at the same cost.

To be fair, no employee would rationally be happy with a pay cut, but they are often irrationally unhappy with pay raises. I believe a raise in minimum wage will prevent companies from being able to provide as many jobs and as many opportunities for growth and in the end hurt employee happiness and employer relationships.","1391212929"

Now when a min maxer wants the best, he or she will pick a race with the best passives, but depending on how they create soft caps and buffs, it might not be worth it. If the buff makes your major stat overcharge, along with the passive, it will cripple the passive.

I don't want to diminish your experience, but everything you seem frustrated with is utterly meaningless. Just lame aesthetic stuff, honestly, and a very small, insignificant part of what makes you valuable as a human being.

I wish women would value their bodies for what they can *do*, rather than what they look like. The conventional standard for beauty (pert breasts, flawless skin, unrealistic youthfulness) is bogus and it breaks my heart that you posted a nude of yourself online thinking that would help you feel better about yourself. Nothing that comes from the outside will ever genuinely make you feel better about you. 

Reading your post, it seems like you've reduced your body to individual, flawed parts. No wonder you're discouraged. Instead of focusing on trying to improve the way your body *looks*, why not pick a goal like a race or a team sport that you can work towards instead? I guarantee you'll feel better progressing towards a goal like that rather than some impossible aesthetic ideal.

Looking good is nice, but it's nothing compared to accomplishing athletic goals. I think most would agree.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Okay I have experimented with this many many times so I have some knowledge here. I am prescribed benzos and I have also been taking them for years, including all throughout my tripping years. 


I'm no professional so I'm going to speak in layman's terms here. 


Xanax before a trip is fine, it will not affect the trip or it's potency, and in fact I prefer taking xanax before a trip because it relieves any anxiety I may have pre-dosing. In fact, I took 2mg x 2 of xanax before a .6g Molly (not my best idea, safety wise) and 300ug AL-LAD candyflip @ Armin van Buuren, Festival Pier, Philadelphia, May 10th of last year. Best night of my life by far. No anxiety. 


Xanax during a trip will kill the trip, almost entirely. Some visuals will reside depending on the dose taken, but benzodiazepines are a great way to 'cancel' a trip for someone having a bad time. They will return you to a clear state of mind, calm you down, and enable you to sleep. Most of the visuals should disappear within 30 minutes. I ALWAYS keep them around when tripping. Benzos will work on most tryptamines as well as some phenethylamines. I know this works because I used 3mg of xanax to get myself out of a bad NBOMe trip (I hate NBOMe, took 2mg and it was nothing like LSD or shrooms or AL-LAD which are controllable and I have experience with, NBOMe just shows you visuals and there is little subjectivity to the trip). I was 100% sober and sleeping within 40 minutes. 


This happens because GABAa receptors (agonized by benzos) regulate stimuli in the brain, and act as sort of a 'filter' for these specific stimuli. That's why they work so well for anxiety - they regulate the stimuli that causes anxiety, hyperactiveness, nervous thoughts, etc. This mechanism of action completely filters out most of all the stimuli that is produced by psychedelics (makes sense when you think about how psychedelics increase paranoia) which is why they will 'cancel' a trip. But if taken before a trip, it will not filter out the newly introduced stimuli (LSD). Why this happens I cannot explain. Like I said, I am no neuroscientist. But I have read a lot about this and this is the understanding I have come to on a basic level.


If I am wrong in any sense please inform me.","1391212938"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","This unfortunately is where Australia is going to sink deeper and deeper as the privately owned credit companies do deals with service providers to hand over not only your negative credit rating things (defaults, non payments etc) - but all the positive stuff as well.. And then decide what they want to set as the barrier for ""good credit"". 

Things like ""oh, this person doesn't take out loans or have a credit card - therefore we're going to say that means they are not a good enough debt-financing person"". 

Or it might be ""oh, we see that you don't consume much - therefore you aren't a model consumer"". 

As for being in the red - if you didn't make any sort of payment at all - that might have done it.. But the idea that they can't tell you about why is pretty bullshit - you could have had identity theft while you were away and some big bills somewhere - or else they've matched you with someone else's dodgy credit history.

They had this BS in the UK and to get around it you needed to provide evidence of income to the phone company - NOT the credit company.. 

I'm not sure if there's a way to get your info out of the credit check company - they aren't a government department so have no real obligation other than if they made some sort of credit history report available (note: they usually charge for this in the UK).","1391212939"

But this is ridiculous. 

I need to know if a beer I'm going to drink is 5% or 7% because it really makes a difference to me (I'm a lightweight). If I have several beers, the difference is even more important. 

Thankfully, the waiter was kind enough to let us know what the alcohol percentage was (he had to go ask someone, which probably felt like a waste of time to him). But we as customers shouldn't have to feel like we're requesting a special favor to get this information, and wait staff shouldn't have to be called upon to memorize, or constantly look up, this information either.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","I play a lot of Bristleback and he has a few weaknesses: 

* **Long Range Damage** - heroes like sniper, skywrath and death prophet can deal damage from outside quill spray range and thus are problematic in particular when laning against them. 
* **Silence/Banish Abilities** - Bristleback is all about stacking quill sprays, warpath and nasal goo so disabling his spellcasting will severely stunt his offense.  
* **Lackluster Lategame** - If he gets levels and farm, Bristleback can dominate the mid game, particularly if backed by armor reduction from heroes like Alchemist or Dazzle however he is not a hard carry and his efficiency will drop off dramatically as the game goes late.  

Of all the heroes I have played against Death Prophet has the best skillset to counter Bristleback - she has very long range damage via crypt swarm and exorcism, and of course silence. It is super difficult for Bristleback to stack quill sprays against heroes like this and the silence means that he can't even do much to defend towers in the mid game. In theory mana drain should also be quite good vs bristle, as he is dependent on his spells and tends not to buy any mana items (aside from maybe a wand).

**Stuff Bristleback is very good against:** 

* **Glasscannon/BKB-dependent carries** - Quill Spray will go through magic immunity, so heroes like Gyro, Lifestealer and Luna whom will usually rely on magic immunity to negate damage are in for a rude awakening.
* **Invisible heroes** - Quill Spray hits invisible heroes and often if I have landed enough of them during a fight, I can guess where an invis hero went and then finish them of with the escalating damage.
* **Outnumbered engagements** - Running down even an outnumbered Bristleback can be dangerous. Because of the Quill Sprays triggered from  his namesake ability and its damage reduction, it is not unusual for him to manage to trade or even win 3 v 1 situations, simply by feigning running away and spamming Quill Spray. Because the damage from the first few stacks is comparably low, inexperienced players often swoop in to finish the kill only to die from the Quill Spray triggers adding to the stacks they already have on them.
* **Baiting** - Bristleback is a superb baiter since he can just feign being caught out, turn around and absorb whatever is thrown at him to his back, thus soaking up precious stuns and nukes very efficiently and maybe getting a few quill spray stacks right at the start of the fight. If the enemy gets over eager, they could find themselves in a 5v5 with a lot of their stuns an nukes on cooldown.
* **Roshan/Ancient Farming** - Nasal Goo is a godsend vs Roshan, as its cooldown is so low it can easily be spammed through his linken's effect and provide the much needed armor reduction. Quill spray is not magic damage so ancients magic immunity does not stop it - Bristleback can farm ancient just by turning his back to them and spamming Quill Spray. 

Hope this helps! ","1391212941"

Although i havent really brought him out much in ranked yet this season I will say if he doesnt face a lane with either lulu or vayne he should do quite well. I don't know why the previous person told you to not pick alistar to support an adc he works so well with vayne. Atm vayne doesnt do really well in bot lane but thats not too bad because vayne works very well due to the abundance of shyvana and mundo. Leona being popular and blitz not being permabanned are both very healthy for alistar's strength as a support both of these supports give lulu a hard time resulting in less lulu being picked resulting into a much happier yordle free cow.

Am i saying his is top tier not really but he is a good pick against arguably the most popular support atm and blitzcranku while not being too bad against annie or thresh really.","1391212947"

 [**Lamarckism**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism): 

---

&gt;**Lamarckism** (or **Lamarckian inheritance**) is the [idea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idea) that an [organism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organism) can pass on characteristics that it acquired during its lifetime to its [offspring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offspring) (also known as [heritability of acquired characteristics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_of_acquired_characteristics) or [soft inheritance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_inheritance)). It is named after the French biologist [Jean-Baptiste Lamarck](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Baptiste_Lamarck) (1744–1829), who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories as a supplement to his concept of an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity, in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction. Lamarck did not originate the idea of soft inheritance, which proposes that individual efforts during the lifetime of the organisms were the main mechanism driving species to [adaptation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation), as they supposedly would acquire adaptive changes and pass them on to offspring.

[
In most cases the burden of proof rests on those who claim something exists (such as Bigfoot, psychic powers, universals, and sense data).
](http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/burden-of-proof.html)


Example of a burden of proof logical fallacy:

 [Bertrand declares that a teapot is, at this very moment, in orbit around the Sun between the Earth and Mars, and that because no one can prove him wrong, his claim is therefore a valid one.]
(https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof)




___________

[Theists would like to maintain that the existence of a god, or even many gods, is somehow controversial in terms of the burden of proof. It is clear that gods are objects/persons/entities that have been proposed to exist, therefore the burden of proof is on those who claim one exists.
Believers, however, are so sure of the existence of their gods (or, perhaps, fairies) that they claim that those who do not believe in their gods must somehow ""prove"" their god's non-existence - even in the absence of any evidence for them.](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof)","1391212949"

Doesn't have much else to do except farm mutations/bionics, get better stuff, and improve your skills.  Exploration is limited because there are less than 6 types of dungeons which vary mostly due to randomized drops.

Massive amounts of redundancy and obsolescence.  Out of all the items in the game, maybe 4 dozen are worth having.

No lateral specialization.

No main quests.  NPCs are buggy so no sidequests.

Forced encounters are all the same, depending on your build.  If you're fast, you'll fight off zombie dogs, brutes, hulks, wolves, and swamp-dwellers.  If you're not fast, then you have to fight off everything.  Being prepared means having molotovs, which limits your exploration to what you can carry or put in a vehicle (which means grinding your mechanics stat before you can actually start raiding or otherwise playing the game).

Blush is another important product for a ""put together"" face. NYX has some really nice, but cheap blushes. If you have dry skin, definitely check out their cream blushes, they are great!

There are lots of other great products at the drug store as well. Check out the drug store master list in the side bar.

Columbus is played for laughs while Zuckerberg is the picture of an emerging adult with no understanding of other people's feelings and how to connect with another human being.

He's an asshole, but he has the skill and brains to back it up. Watch the interrogation scene. Not only is he unfazed by the situation, he's even slightly amused by all of it.

Still there is no reason to say that montage makers or even the montages are ruining COD. I've seen this process earlier, on cod4. It was a trend to use a thing called silent aim. Essentially an aimbot which made every single noscope hit and it looked legit. Either way, the community got set up by it, and eventually people got ""busted for using hacks"" and weren't allowed in the community anymore. 

The noobs don't like snipers because they find them hard to beat. They don't like dropshotters or ""jumpers"" for the same reason.

You can also tell the bot to withdraw and provide it with your own address, it which case it will send you Doge from your tipping account and it will show up in your wallet. I prefer to leave all the tips I get with dogetipbot and simply add funds when I'm running low (or think I'm running low) by sending more DOGE to the address that it assigned to me.

I completely understand how you're feeling.. ""god, again?!"".. 

Let me tell how you I feel from the other side.. where I decided to go back to work full-time after being a stay at home mother for 5 years. 

I'm probably MORE tired and exhausted, but I am also more appreciative of becoming a mother. BTW- after being a SAHM for so long with a husband expecting to play his mother too, they still don't change their mentality for another year most likely two.. which only adds to your exhaustion. 

Sure, I may have been able to choose something to work from home too, but I wanted to be surrounded by other adults, I wanted to figure out what life was like for someone my own age, and not that of my small, developing children. You know what, the social interactment, the impact I am making in the business world, the friends and social networks I am joining into and learning to trust, far outweighs the fatigue and mental strain of juggling 40+hr working weeks with 5 children and a husband who works 50+hrs a week. 

(re:cursing, I've discovered the years held up at home I have learned to become quite filthy)

Look, what I am saying is, no matter what you choose to do, you are still a mother. You will never stop being one. You will never stop feeling that portion of loneliness. Instead of going I'm pregnant again?, you should be asking, What can I do to not be HER again. ","1391212955"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; I agree, but is this not usually rather insignificant knowledge (e.g. ""relations of ideas""). That is, the empiricist seems to think that whilst we can learn about the content of our concepts a priori, that's more or less it. We can't learn anything significant about the world except via the senses.

Certainly there is something like this going on, but I don't think I'd characterize things like mathematics and logic as insignificant, so that I think you've overstated the point.

(For that matter, I think we have to be careful when construing empiricist epistemology as founded entirely on the twin pillars of the synthetic a posteriori and the analytic a priori: although they count as impressions in his sense, Hume's defense of intuitions in the case of causal inferences and moral/aesthetic judgments goes beyond what people would often regard as empirical--in the sense of sensible data or something like this.  But it's here that it I think we find Hume to be a reliabilist, and this is a significant point.

He received  a letter from DEO investigator, asking him why he was under reporting his income. He told them the truth, that he fallen on hard time and was doing it to support his family. After 4 months he didn't hear anything, then 2 days before Christmas, cops came to his house and arrested him. His attorney tried to bargain for him, paying the amount he took with interest, showing he has never been arrested, a good family man, etc. The DEO just wasn't interested in getting their money back because the crime was already committed, they charged him with felony. At his trial they easily showed that he's been doing for awhile. He's still in prison. 


My advice to you is, get  a really good attorney with experience in unemployment fraud, as soon as possible. Don't  admit anything and don't answer anything until you get an attorney. Good luck. 

Edit: Sorry for the grammar, I'm on my phone. 

Edit: he collected $2300. ","1391212956"

Feminism doesnt allow the thought of anyone other than women as victims.
Why do you think so many people scoff at even the thoughts of a MRM? Because they have been trained to believe that men cant be victims. And if they cant be victims, they cant be helped. Which is why while feminism may not be the main source of all of the mens problems (although certainly a good number of them are), its still hugely detrimental to the MRM.

Yes, I am well aware of the competition. Which is encouraging, because it means there is a market for what I'm trying to do. 

I believe JobTorch can do a much better job than what oilcareers.com or rigzone.com does. The goal is to have something that is complete, fast and easy to use. Something that is focused on job postings and is not cluttered.

and none of them right now can boast 13,000+ jobs. 

The innovation behind the site is not in its idea but in its execution.

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","This is my list of what I've tried so far:

**Action:**

Usage: Main recorder I use

Price: Personal use: 30$ (they have accepted this for youtube videos if you're not making larger amount of money) Cormercial use: 50$

Video Quality: Original screen size or up to 1080p in AVI and max 720p in MP4 both at maxium 60 FPS, and output looks in AVI exactly like the recorded game so barely any quality loss, MP4 does have a slightly quality loss.

Video Option: Quality Settings (High, Medium, Low), Record Mouse, visual mouse click, multicore recording, input range (0-255 or 16- 235), Optional webcam recording in 4:3 or 16:9, Overlay Graphics, Auto video split/Duration, target fps recording.

Audio Quality: Same as system setup but up to 512 bitate in WAV or MP4 sound format with multi channel from both system and microphone at the same time.

Audio Option: Microphone/System audio balance, Multi audio stream recording (2 seperate tracks) target bitrate selection,

HUD/Overlay: Time, FPS, Recording On/Off, changeable position,

Hotkeys: Yes, all customizable, enable/disable, start pause stop recording as well as mute mic and many more.

Ease of use: Somewhat easy to use but getting the right settings for your gameplay may take a few tries, but in general to have everything you can dream about

Other: Possibility for Live streaming at 720p.

Overall rating: 10/10

Comment: the rating is given for being very user friendly, and easy to setup. The UI is easy to get familiar with and it does not take a complete genius to setup or use. It does have all the (what I think is) necessary options and even more to play around with. The price is okay, but 50$ for the commercial license my be a little to much for some.



**DXTory:**

Usage: A few times at CO-OP games

Price: 35$

Video Quality: Original screen size or userdefined in AVI

Video Option: Target fps recording, Codec selection, Logo settings

Audio Quality: System Defined and up to 320 bitate in chosen codec.

Audio Option: Codec selection, multiple sound mixing track (up to 9 tracks) target bitrate selection,

HUD/Overlay: FPS, Recording On/Off, changeable position,

Hotkeys: Yes, all customizable, enable/disable, start pause stop,

Ease of use: kinda hard to use and get settings correct at first but if you're doing some trial and error or research You'll get it eventually.

Other: None I know of?

Overall rating: 9/10

Comment: Rating is dragged down due to the very complicated gui but the possibilities for fine tuning you audio and video recording is endless and this makes the program quite powerful for both CO-OP commentary, recording through skype, vent, TS or similar or single commentary LPs.

**Hanabi** - Went to a small meet-up and tried this one out. Not sure if it's really my cup o' tea. I'd say the only way I'd want to play this again is if drinking were involved and fisticuffs ensued. We played twice and won the second game, but I can't say I really enjoyed it. 

**Bonus**: Probably a bunch I can't name off the top of my head. Is there a list of games that may be released this year? GMT is a recent favorite of mine, so I'd say of their P500 releases that are likely this year I'm most interested in **Fire in the Lake** and **Cactus Air Force**.","1391212968"

2- you have a lot of loot available because you either play a lot or are saving for a big upgrade. 

3-if people are taking all of your loot you should consider redesigning. Because that means they are getting your storages. 

What th are you?  What trophy range are you?  What armies are you using? 


These are the questions you have to ask yourself when you have loot problems.  I am th 8 and use barch(newly upgraded so level 4 troops still)  around silver one.  There are a lot of bases that are crap loot but with barching you can take out a th6 pretty easily and get 50k minimum and be ready to raid again because of queueing. 

Also the new king ability is amazing at going deep inside bases raiding storages. 


Look at this wiki http://clashofclans.wikia.com/wiki/Raids 

Find the loot section and ""storage amount to reach cap""  anything above this amount is protected as it can't be looted.  


What people don't understand is they aren't the only one playing this game.  You aren't raiding npc bases,  your raiding real people's bases.  They are upgrading walls,  defenses,  troops,  etc which is why it SHOULD be hard to find loot.  No one is going to sit around with capped loot not upgrading.

Second, if by ""taken the Hitler threat out"" you mean ""take action against Germany in the mid-30s when Hitler started to violate conditions of the Treaty of Versailles"", then there's not much way to back the action up militarily. The 1920s had been a time of disarmament, and the 30s was the depression. The Germans had new ships and weapons as much about demonstrating contempt for the treaty as much as it was preparing for war, while the Brits and Americans were equipped with stuff that was at best 15 years old.

Called the Williams WASP X-Jet. This personal hovercraft looks to be more functional than anything I've seen of it's ilk before or since. Apparently built in the mid 1970's the device tantalizes as to its potential. Apparently the military couldn't find use for it and it's promise was left unfulfilled.

I have to wonder though, why haven't we seen more of this technology in the past 40 years or so. Was there more to the propulsion and guidance systems than we are told? Did TPTB bury this craft and its technology for security reasons?

If anybody knows more about this amazing flying machine, it's creators or why it has gone by the way side, please share.

If you think watching anime or playing games will make you proficient, you are dead wrong. You really need to study hard if you want to do well. Being naturally good with languages will not help you either, believe me. I coasted along in high school French because I knew Spanish and also relied on cognates between English and French to understand words. These things won't help you much in Japanese.

You really need to study because vocabulary is especially tough. It sounds fucked up, but for a while words sounded a lot like random syllables to me because I couldn't use cognates to figure out what meant what. Kanji is another story—the ideograms make sense (kinda like how sight is literally written as the characters for ""eye power"") but stroke order can be a massive pain.

As for classes, Sato-sensei's teaching style is pretty relaxed and she is much more approachable as a professor IMO, but you won't feel as though things you learn really stick as much. Nagase-sensei on the other hand will really push you, but you will feel more like you learned something. She seems intimidating at first glance (and she sorta is until around the middle of the semester) but she's actually really nice. Make friends with the TAs—they are usually pretty cool (if a little shy) and are very open to meeting up with you to practice.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","If people want to murder someone they will, be it with a gun or a rock.  Murdering people is actually just a small fraction of a percent of what guns are used for.  They are mostly used for sport, competition, etc.

Someone could just as easily mass murder people in a school or movie theater with a bomb as they could with a gun.

You had it right when you said ""people are killed by fucktards with guns.""  People are killed by fucktards period, regardless of the weapon used.

But it really doesn't matter which side of the issue you fall on and here's why:  Even if guns were outlawed, then you're left with all the law-abiding citizens (you know, the ones mostly responsible with their guns) unarmed, and you'd only have the criminals (who would violate the gun laws) with guns and the situation would be even worse.

And that is pretty much the end all of this timeless argument, because it doesn't matter which way you believe, the result is the same.","1391212975"
"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt; Higher output because the workers worked harder is not increased productivity, it is increased output due to increased input.

&gt; But even where workers increase their productivity, isn't it more likely that the commodity's price will fall so that MVP and wages stay the same?

Higher productivity in this context just means a higher marginal product of the input, in this case labor...there's no reason to think 'more effort' couldn't raise marginal productivity. Ceteris paribus (i.e. price of the product and discount rate remaining equal), this would manifest as an outward shift in the demand curve for labor, meaning higher wages and more employment. 

As for the price falling, it is true that as more workers are hired and more product is produced, the price of the good can fall, so DMVP won't *exactly* equal price. On this, see [this section of Man, Economy, and State](http://mises.org/rothbard/mes/chap7c.asp#7ApxA._Marginal_Physical) (tl;dr, it doesn't meaningfully change the analysis).

&gt;In that case, the consumer is the direct beneficiary of increased productivity, (with the workers in question only seeing a very indirect and gradual increase in their real wages as similar changes occur in other firms). This clearly biases the system towards increased consumption rather than less work, which may not be the preference of the workers.

In short, *all* of the gains from productivity can only end up going to the original factors (land and labor) in the long run. Opportunities for returns over the natural rate of interest are eliminated as competing firms bid up the prices of inputs (increased demand) and competition and increased output lowers the price of outputs (increased supply).

&gt;Plus, profits are far from equal across all industries, even in the long run. Some businesses certainly do accrue improvements in productivity or output as profits for themselves despite the workers being the source of these improvements, which would not be possible if investment were nothing more than an ""intertemporal exchange"".

Well, 'capitalists' as laborers can see (permanent) gains in wages as well. The point is a 'capitalist' *as an entrepreneur* can only see temporary gains, not permanent gains. Thanks to non-technical language, these functions can often be confused, but it's important to remember a business owner can be acting in more than one aspect (i.e. he isn't acting only as an entrepreneur).

&gt;Time preference is an alternative explanation for exploitation, not a counterargument - it explains it in terms of the psychological effects of wealth. Time preference is not merely a matter of preference, but also of social relations, which are neither natural nor subjective.

This is an odd characterization of time preference. In actuality, time preference is entirely based on subjective values, just like any other exchange. 'Social norms' don't change the analysis, as subjective value theory completely accounts for them. If I trade $100 now for $110 in the future, it's still the case that, *in present terms*, I value the $110 more than the $100, while the reverse is true for the individual I'm making the exchange with.

&gt;Risk is not relevant. People invest because the expected value of investment is positive. Exploitative profit is what investors receive after risk has been accounted for.

Uncertainty and risk are not the same thing in this framework (and if I said risk anywhere else, I shouldn't have, because it leads to confusion). There is always uncertainty with regards to any action, because *all* action is concerned with changing the state of affairs to our betterment in the future (even the immediate future), and the future is always uncertain (if it wasn't, and we knew future outcomes with certainty, we couldn't change anything, not even our own actions). People exchange present goods for future goods on the time-market, or as you say invest, for the same reason they participate in any other exchange: they think they'll be better off.

&gt;TL;DR, what B-B is really saying is that exploitation should not be referred to negatively as ""exploitation"", not that what socialists call exploitation does not exist.

Obviously he's not saying there is no 'gap' between what the capitalists receive and what they pay the factors of production. He's saying it's not exploitative because, *when you account for time*, there will be a tendency for the factors of production *to be paid exactly in line with their productivity*.","1391212975"

Not to mention AnCaps don't believe in intellectual property and it could be very easily argued that if the gov't hadn't created it when they did, someone else would have shortly. Since we don't have a lens to peer into the alternate universe where there wasn't government coercion at that moment, you cannot make the claim that the government's intervention made things any ""better.""

If it's my land and my road, why would your self-determination trump mine? Why not take another road? Why put yourself in a situation where you need to use the road of someone who hates you for your livelihood? Can you not go around my property? Are you cornered on all other sides by desert wasteland? Do you not have any friends who can help supply you with the things you cannot get from the other side of my road? Family? If roads are so important to you, why not get together with some friends and build a separate road that's not controlled by such a shitty person as one who would ban people from travel for the simple reason of ""hating their face?""

Capitalism is not an authoritarian mode of production. The workers have no say today because they are FORCED into the market by the government that says if you don't come up with a lump sum of cash every year, the tax man will be knocking on your door to take you to jail. If there was no coercion to force people into the market who do not wish to be in it, communes would be free to crop up wherever they wished. Especially since 1/3 of the landmass in the US is directly owned by the US gov't and most of the other 2/3 was given out long ago to whoever was best at sucking politician's dicks. All you guys need to stop using that ""you can leave the country argument"" already for christ's sake. Move to another spot where other psychopathic organizations also claim they own ALL the land based on ""I saw it first"" and claim freedom to kill whoever they want? Nothing about Anarcho Capitalism could possibly be seen as FORCING communists or socialists into a market they don't wish to be in. You are the ones who draw lines on maps or even point at the entire globe and say ""everyone within this border is required to participate in my economic system/system of governance.""

Scientists/inventors/philosophers do not ""create"" ideas. They discover ways in which components or ideas fit together into something more complex. The thesis paper or the physical product that comes out of it certainly belongs to them but to claim that the mechanics of putting 2 and 2 together in order to make 4 is something that a person can ""own"" is simply ludicrous. And again, even IF intellectual property was a thing that should exist, STEALING someone's money and using some of it to do something somewhat helpful does not make it legitimate whatsoever.","1391212976"

"syriancivilwar","t5_2x5s1","The broad overview, not the literal translation as requested:

This is a pro-ISIS anti-Islamic front post. It focuses on bashing two of the Islamic front  leaders: Zahran Aloush, and Ahmad Isa Al-Shikh. It starts by talking about their Islamic schools and their saudi-Arabia- scholars affiliations, and that they never said they want islamic caliph so their American support doesn't stop and their plans to fight the mujahedin for their masters ""condalisa rice"" and ""john kerry"". and the article lists evidence for this as follows: 


The first Image in the link is a Reuters Article titled ""Saudi Arabia supporting al qaeda salafe  competetors in Syria""

The second image is two tweets by Zahran Aloush, the first labeled ""Before the dollars"" the tweet is about an order to arrest someone for instigating hate between them and ISIS. The second tweet labeled ""After the dollars"" which is basically an anti ISIS tweet calling their state as fake and based on media lies.

Then the article talks about Aloush having enough ammunition to liberate whole cities and yet he stores it and withdraw from battles allowing for massacres by the regime  to happen because of their cowardliness. (two links as sources)

Then on the same note a tweet by Abd Al-aziz Al-akedy saying that the people broke into warehouses belonging to Aloush and found huge amounts of stored food hidden from the people dying from starvation.

then a link supposedly exposing the truth about Aloush.

then a link about ISIS accomplishments in comparison.

a pic of a list of more accomplishments

Then the aritcale moves on to the second person ""Ahmad Isa Al-Shikh""

The first pic is about how mush Al-Shikh is following them on twitter ""47%""  and adnan al arour 100%

similar talk as before about his islamic affiliations and then his american affiliations. 

first link of the American ambassador Robert ford admitting communications with Al-shikh's front. and then a link about his affiliation with a former Baath person named ""Saleem Idrees"" who is a traitor with US affiliations.

Then a tweet saying that the military council in kosair (Homs) demands the (IF) to return ammunition that they have stolen from the fighters in Homs and demand a trial against Al-Shikh.

a link of Al-Shikh talking against Aljolani.

then the article talks about him not submitting to a trial in the case mentioned above and him asking ISIS to submit to a trial that doesn't have anyone from ISIS among the judges so he can buy the verdict as he wishes. 

Then the article talks about ISIS accepting trials previously as long as they have one judge from their side and another from the opposing battalion and a third judge to break any hypothetical tie. and provides a bunch of tweets and documents about this point. 

That is pretty much the general idea of the article.. it is too long for me to translate sorry but if there is a certain point you are interested in and would like me to go in details about please let me know.

"Barca","t5_2s561","We shouldn't really compare it to his last seasons and instead compare to the other players. There's more rotation overall which means Xavi plays less too. Plus there's S.Roberto and Cesc playing many minutes. 

Most minutes played 13/14:

Pique, Fàbregas, Busquets, **Xavi**, Alexis, Valdés, Iniesta, Iniesta, Mascherano, Adriano, Alves

Most minutes played 12/13:

Messi, Valdés, Alba, Alves, **Xavi**, Piqué, Iniesta, Busquets, Pedro, Mascherano, Fàbregas

I think Xavi will play less (compared to his team mates) now in february and march. He played every single CL game so far (playing 75min/game) and in the league he was out of the squad four times but played the other 17 matches with an average of 79min/game. I actually thought he would've had played less by now. He'll probably play the first round of the copa semi final, each CL game and probably sit out every third league game from now on. Overall I'm very confident with Tata how his managed the rotations so far, specially given the injuries. ","1391212979"

What the guy did is reasonably low risk, a demonstration I have seen given to high school age kids dozens of times (albiet, inside a fume hood). Chromium is a *suspected* carcinogen - not a confirmed one. Until last year, highschool age students were permitted to use it as an oxidizing agent for the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes and carboxylic acids in chemistry classes.

Cr2O3 is still available readily in pottery shops as a pigment of some kind for glaze with no warnings, and pottery products tend to be in contact with food.

Dull reaction diagrams and mathematical formulae, contrary to popular belief, do not get young folks interested in chemistry. Nor do colour changes or the likes hold their interest for long. Most get interested by spectacles, such as the dichromate volcano, or the Goldschmidt (thermite) reaction. Hydrogen balloons and the likes. That captures their interest, and later on, our beloved formulae and diagrams and the likes become interesting to them.

So, /u/MrBurd, why would you suggest this (seemingly young) person simply quit their journey early on? The world needs more chemists and scientists, less bloody paper pushers and beancounters. Taking some risks is nothing to be afraid or ashamed of, for without risk, we cannot make decent bloody progress. You, sir, should be ashamed for putting a dampener on /u/arthur990807's interest in this fascinating field, and should refrain from future statements of that ilk.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","Finding a set of ultimate ""blue pill"" movies isn't that productive, because the list will get polluted by selection bias.

It might be more productive to define the class of ""blue pill movies"", and what they have in common, and perhaps analyze why things had turned out this way:

- weak male protagonist
- doesn't have to change significantly (maybe his attitude a bit, by learning a moral lesson near the end)
- angst, shy, unable to simply tell his feelings to his love interest
- ""true love""
- happy ending (which is generally necessary to reward blue pill pro tags)

Could be any combination of the above.

The reasons why some of the above are so common should be obvious. Narrative bias, lazy thinking, and Western tendency of siding with the underdog (whether that be freedom fighters vs tyrants, weak guy vs bully, whatever). It's lazy because writers can't find better ways to extend the story aside from making the male character angsty and shy, to avoid the scenario where he just woos the girl in the first half our of the movie or first few episodes of a series. Happy ending is common, but listed by necessity because it's needed to reward the protagonist for being true to himself. 

Going further, OP, i think if you're trying to prove a point, then we should really include family &amp; kids' movies/shows because they are influential to kids.

Take your average kid show with any romantic subplot. Like ""Doug"". Doug Funny is weak and gets bullied by Roger. Doug takes ages to confess to his love interest Patty… actually I don't even know if he ever confessed. I haven't bothered to watch many saturday cartoons since middle school or high school, I think. Doug also doesn't really change throughout the series except learning little moral lessons here and there. Boom, there you go. Toss that into the list.

If you want something more adult, then romcoms are the obvious go to. A lot of Ben Stiller movies could qualify, like ""There's Something About Mary"" or ""Meet the Parents"". It shouldn't have to be blatantly obvious like, ""Enchanted"", but that would be a BP example. If you want something less subtle, it would have to be a romantic *subplot*. Emphasis on subplot.

Honestly, it doesn't have to be romance at all. The general message that needs to be delivered is just *""It's ok to be yourself.""* It's that Mr Rogers mentality that Fox News complained about. ^(Fuck myself in the ass for parroting a Fox News message, or any mainstream news/propaganda for that matter.)

Girls can play with Legos, or any of the other toys that are almost exclusively marketing to boys (except lego friends, ugh), but they are constantly told that it's not for them, and therefore doing so is essentially an act of defiance and rebellion. This may not be true in your household, but it is true in society and in marketing. A young girl can be happily brought up playing with Legos, but when she goes to school there will still be boys telling excluding her and telling her that it's not for girls. 

I say this as a women who was an extreme tomboy as a kid. I was usually mistaken as a boy by strangers and I fiercely opposed anything that came from the pink aisle, and yet I still had to constantly prove myself and deal with exclusion for being a girl. Meanwhile other girls think you're weird and aren't really interested in playing with you.  

Unlike Legos or other great toys that girls can play *despite* society, this product focuses on engineering skills and is sending the message that it's *for girls*. That is an message that is completely lacking elsewhere. Even Lego Friends marketing draws the focus from building and changes the mini figs from their classic form to a weird, elongated 'skinnier' version. 

I think what we all hate the idea of is that girls should be given this *instead* of Legos, which would be terrible. However, I think the point is, if your kids are interested in Legos. Great, they don't really need this product. However, of your kid is only interested in what's in the pink aisle, this is a way to get them playing with something beside hair and outfits, and hopefully it will give them the interest and confidence to graduate to what else is out there, like Legos.","1391212985"

 [**Kuru (disease)**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuru%20%28disease%29): 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Kuru** is an incurable degenerative [neurological disorder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurological_disorder) endemic to tribal regions of [Papua New Guinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea). It is a type of [transmissible spongiform encephalopathy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmissible_spongiform_encephalopathy), caused by a [prion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion) found in humans.

&gt;The term ""kuru"" derives from the [Fore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fore_people) word ""kuria/guria"" (""to shake""), a reference to the body tremors that are a classic symptom of the disease; it is also known among the Fore as the laughing sickness due to the [pathologic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomical_pathology) bursts of laughter people would display when afflicted with the disease. It is now widely accepted that Kuru was transmitted among members of the [Fore tribe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fore_people) of [Papua New Guinea](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea) via [cannibalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannibalism).

"budgetfood","t5_2si9h","I usually try and see what they have on sale in the meat department. I.e. meat that's no longer fresh within the next day or two. And either freeze it or cook it right away.  

When ground beef/pork is on sale I always make meat balls. Super easy, all you need is some bread. crumbs (even once I used actual bread, in desperation), some onion, garlic. Makes a whole batch and I eat them with some salad or whatever else. 

Also soup. I buy little flavoured packages of Knorr dried soup mix, then make soup with sweet potatoes, carrots, celery, onion, broccoli, kidney beans. Then I blend it and add some chicken. 

Edit: I'm in the same scenario where I try to eat little rice/grain products. You can substitute any recipe with flour or bread crumbs with almond meal, which is what I use. :) good luck!","1391212986"

"booksuggestions","t5_2ryqe","1491 by Charles Mann is a good and insightful look at the Americas before Christopher Columbus landed but also discusses American Indian encounters with early settlers.

A Fierce Discontent by Michael McGerr is the best book about the progressive era that I've read.

A People's History of Sports in the United States by Dave Zirin is really great.  Sports are rarely, if ever, discussed in American history but Zirin links sports to women's movements, 1850s urban growth, civil rights movements, etc.  I almost think this is a must for a high school class, as it can get high school sports players interested in aspects of history.

As an example, when Dogecoin brought in a change to transaction pricing, the community could have stayed on the 1.3 client, and that change would have simply been rejected and left abandoned. Instead we all saw value in it (or didn't care), and moved to 1.4, and the blockchain continued down the majority path.

A similar shitty pop sci news article was posted before on this subreddit, and I wrote a comment explaining why it's a really, really bad headline. While the paper itself is somewhat interesting, it's a pure methodology/techniques paper that makes absolutely no claim about observing memory formation.

http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/1wbzky/for_the_first_time_researchers_have_been_able_to/cf0rqyp

Edit: actually I didn't realize there were back to back Science papers on the topic and had only read the methods paper, so I'll have to read the second one more carefully. They do use cultured hippocampal neurons though, which you really cannot say you are even inducing LTP, let alone memories (which require an intact organism for behavior studies). After reading the second paper there's still no causal data relating their b-actin RNA experiments/results to any sort of plasticity event. There are only co-localization experiments done but no real functional studies. It's a more basic cell biology question that they're looking at, with a heavy emphasis on methods.","1391212987"

Most have been swapped out and changed over through the years, with the most noticeable change coming from the switch from single port to dual port.

You need to check for the actual read/write speeds of a card to understand what you are buying.

I have 3 of [these](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-Class-Memory-SDSDX-032G-AFFP/dp/B007M54E1M) just because they read and write crazy fast, but don't cost too much. At speeds of 45 MB/s, you can get up to 1.2x on the bitrate, 1.3x if you have a static shot

I used to use [these](http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-Class-Memory-SDSDU-064G-AFFP/dp/B007M51IZM/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1391212364&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=sandisk+64+gb) but the write speeds are actually 15 MB/s, which is not fast enough for even an increase of 1.1x on ML (at least based on my 60D).

"urbanexploration","t5_2qkvl","Yep, the education system is pretty crappy in the US in the poorer neighborhoods that don't have much tax income and don't get much from the state and federal govt.  I dated a high school teacher in a poor neighborhood for many years.  It got worse when the ""No Child Left Behind Act"" was implemented because they were also an ""underperforming"" school along with the elementary and middle schools in the neighborhood.  So all of their meager resources basically got thrown at passing the standardized tests so they wouldn't lose what little funding they did get.  And they had an incentive to just get kids through regardless of what they actually knew.  They basically just drilled into them exactly what was going to be on the tests and taught them strategies for passing multiple choice tests.  If they didn't, they would loose everything.  Teachers would all be fired and administration ""reorganized"" if not enough kids passed the test regardless of how much progress the kids made or how well the teachers performed.  So basically if a school underperforms, they take away the money they would need to help kids, and remove all of the experienced teachers and replace them with ones who have no experience, especially with those types of kids.

She saw the worst of it because one of the classes she taught was remedial reading.  These are kids that never learned to read through elementary and middle school, but were still passed on, so not only had the school system failed them, but their parents didn't take much interest in their education either willfully or through the fact that they couldn't afford not to work two or three jobs and thus had no time to spend with their kids.  She had to buy all of the school supplies for her students because neither the parents nor the school could afford them.  Everything from pens, pencils, paper, books, etc.  The only thing the school provided was the standard required reading textbooks for high school which was way, way above their reading level and thus totally useless.  She repeatedly asked the school not to buy them, but the district made them mandatory.  And they weren't cheap.  The only reason they had them was because someone high up had a friend at the publishing company and was getting kickbacks.  They could have built a school or two for the amount they spent on those books across the district.  When she got them and was told she had to use them, she tried to comply, but ended up having to give up and throwing them right in closet and never touching them again.  Fortunately, there's still an exception to copyright law for a teacher to copy books.  Unfortunately, the copy machines at the school had locks on them and teachers had to enter a code to use them and were limited to a ridiculous 1000 copies per semester or something like that (for the 150-200 kids she taught throughout the 5 or 6 periods she taught in the day).  So she spent hundreds on copying stuff outside of school including test papers, books, parts of dictionaries, encyclopedias and useful textbooks she found in used book shops or online, etc.  And I remember carrying cases of paper and notebooks out of Target every semester.  All this on a salary just about right at or slightly above the minimum *livable* wage.  Granted she got 3 months off in the summer to work extra jobs to make up for it, but considering she worked 12-16 hours a day during the school year as well as a fair amount of time on weekends and holidays, it was way less than she deserved.

She also taught a journalism class and was in charge of the yearbook, so she had a bunch of old computers in her classroom.  However, there was only one, grossly underpaid IT guy that was barely qualified.  I went in quite a bit to help her set up the classroom network and then troubleshoot issues when needed.  Otherwise they never would have been able to use them.

I could go on and on about the lack of resources and the focus on standardized tests above all else, but this post is getting excessively long, especially considering the sub-reddit we're in.  :)","1391212992"

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","I personally did not feel that we needed a winger, but obviously the manager did which is what matters. Since the end of the summer window when we missed out on our two main targets of Willian and Mkhitaryan we have not learnt from these mistakes. 

This had to be our most important windows, if we qualify for the champions league we reap the financial rewards and if we don’t then Saurez leaves and we have to move forward with the fee we receive for him. Let’s be honest Man Utd. Will come on stronger as the season progresses especially with the signing of Mata and the return to fitness of their strikers, City are a cut above everybody else and Chelsea have an outstanding squad full of quality (except for a clinical striker). 

If we do not make the CL this year all of these teams will strengthen further and we will fail behind them and continue to drag our feet in the transfer market. I really hope that we have not missed our opportunity to push forward and enhance our chances of making the champions league. As you say it is great that we signed the players that you mention, but we need to be pushing forward and look to make a statement, which we haven’t. If we fail to make the top 4 will our top scorer be here next season and who would join us that could replace him? 

It feels like a major opportunity missed yet again in a similar way to we never backed Rafa to push on when we finished second in the league in 2009. And as the last 4 years have proven teams move forward when opportunities are not taken with both hands!

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","I feel the same way. Every time Knox is interviewed, it's inevitable that the Kerchers are brought up and the interviewer asks Knox what she would like to say to them, as if she somehow owes them an explanation or apology. Then she pleads her condolences to them in a very groveling manner almost as if she is trying to gain their forgiveness. The way I see it, she doesn't owe them anything. She's fighting her own battle, is a victim herself (of the police, the court, the media), and she knew Meredith for only 6 weeks...it's not as if they were longtime close friends, just roommates/acquaintances, yet she's almost being expected to grieve like they were close. If an acquaintance I knew for six weeks was found murdered, I'd be pretty shaken up and shocked, and I'd feel terrible for their family, but it wouldn't emotionally or personally devastate me like if it were a family member or close friend. 

Regardless, Knox has shown nothing but sympathy and respect toward the Kerchers and the memory of Meredith, yet they refuse to read any letters from her, speak with her, etc., as if they're certain she was involved in their daughter's murder. If I were the Kerchers I would want to hear what she has to say, if anything to gauge her character in person, but it's like they are avoiding having to face her completely and instead go with the media and police depiction of her. I understand they're grieving and pissed, but they seem to come off as...petty? Willfully stubborn? And yes, if I were them, I'd be using all my energy crusading against Guede and only Guede since he is the only one definitively linked to the murder via ubiquitous dna evidence.","1391213001"

Edit: Look at the past few years, Canon has now re-released basically the same camera *four freaking times* and still has the majority of the market with their rebels.  This, in spite of arguably much more interesting and potentially better performing cameras from Fuji, Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, Pentax, and Nikon (not all mirrorless of course).

If they can't make a few small changes to the Superman story without people complaining, why would they ever do anything truly original?","1391213005"

&gt;David Stern failed to help basketball grow to its full potential

Later:
&gt;I'm not calling Stern a failure

Whitlock critizising Stern for not utilizing his stars properly..

&gt;In the past 30 years, the league has been home to the most transcendent, recognizable and interesting athletes since Muhammad Ali -- Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan and LeBron James. Tiger Woods and Mike Tyson are the only athletes who can compete with the quartet Stern was handed.

And then criticizes him for utilizing them too much...
&gt; Stern focused too much of the league's relevance on individual superstars at the expense of promoting teams, rivalries and championships.    

That approach helped the game grow to where it is.

&gt; Basketball is America's sport. Every man, woman and child plays basketball at some point. People in wheelchairs play basketball.    

Sold.    

This is an extremely narrow perspective that doesn't take the NBA's international popularity into consideration. It also fails to recognize the numerous leagues that have been created over Stern's tenure that were the direct effect of the games growth in popularity.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; In fact, here's how clear the signal is: Table 6 from this Levitt paper shows that in Chicago from 1975-1995, the highest income blacks suffered homicide rates greater than the lowest income whites.

When neighborhoods are in practice quite segregated, higher income blacks aren't *necessarily* living far away out in the sticks (and their brethren driving all the way out for a drive-by). If you think about the very staggered numbers in that table for blacks, only a portion of each econ group need to be living in proximity of those a rung below them to get those effects.

&gt;Burying your head in PC sand is not a good way to help people who are suffering in a very non-PC real world. 

Again, there are literally still people alive today who lived under forced legal segregation. This wasn't some 5-10 stint in prison (hard enough to get over as is) but hundreds of years of not only treatment but portrayal as lesser humans.

I think there's very powerful motivation to justify why its not ""our"" problem anymore but ""theirs""; a literary white-washing over a long history of faults.


&gt; In fact, *affirmative action* is only logical on the premise that by race some groups have very different outcomes than others. I'm pointing out the differences in those outcomes, which is necessary before we can do something to fix it.

It's again important to note where the term comes from. The outlook was that the effects of racism in this country ran so deep that it would take *affirmative action* to correct in any reasonable amount of time; otherwise the alternative is a seemingly permanent *economic* underclass despite *legal* equality as we see today. It's like you wrongfully imprison someone for most of their existence, and try to attribute their subsequent failures in life as not your problem because they're free now and had bad culture or whatever in the first place.","1391213008"

Flora being the name of the singer's girlfriend. You can even see vestiges of this in the English translation (the original 16th-century German was even sappier):

&gt;Jesus, priceless Treasure,
&gt;Source of purest pleasure,
&gt;Truest friend to me.
&gt;Ah, how long in anguish
&gt;Shall my spirit languish,
&gt;Yearning, Lord, for Thee?
&gt;Thou art mine, O Lamb divine!
&gt;I will suffer naught to hide Thee,
&gt;Naught I ask beside Thee.

It's pretty evident that all the writer did was swap out ""Flora"" for ""Jesus"" and ""Love"" for ""Lord"" (etc.). Yet it would certainly be included in any ""traditional hymnal"" the author wants us to return to. There really is nothing new under etc.","1391213008"

You mentioned that you do not intend on overclocking. Changed the CPU/Mobo to one that is not overclockable. Removed CLC as the stock fan will suffice for stock clock speeds. Dropped the 780 to the 770. If this is for one 1080p monitor, it is really not needed currently or in the near future for much more than this. Grab the 780/780ti if you want, I just don't see the need. My 7970 Ghz edition rips thru BF4 at 1200p just fine, and it is comparable to the 770. Dropped the PSU down a bit. Spending that much is needless. Also, you more than likely do not need more than the standard version of 8.1.

This was a quick mock up for an example.","1391213016"

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","You might like to post this question on /r/vajrayana - Tibetan Buddhism uses words, sounds, and chanting phrases as meditation tools (Om Mani Padme Hum, the most famous).  Also, there are Zen Koans, but I don't personally know if that qualifies as 'sound healers'.  The shaman that led my Ayahuasca ceremony would certainly be considered a 'sound healer'.  And, the Nyingma and Gelug monks that I visited in Nepal with their chanting pray for all living creatures, and gods.

I've been using the AOM, chanted 3 times, after my daily meditation for many years.  Very powerful, and I visualize the vibrations going into the Earth to heal everything.  

Lastly, everything in the universe is vibrating sound, if Quantum String Theory is correct.  Coincidentally, the article shows the Hindu God NadaBrahma, says something to the effect that ALL sounds are the universe speaking.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; I actually suggested that one chunk leave CAR and join Chad, not to create a new country.

Which might help Chad, but does little to alleviate the problems the CAR will have.

&gt; Your citation of the Austro-Hungarian carve up is poor, indeed. Lots of people were poor during the interwar years, including the Germans, and they were not carved up.

Which just shows that you did not bother looking into this at all. The Germans had economic problems because of reparations and a loss of industry. Former A-H had different problems for different reasons. And other nations in the world had other problems for other reasons at the same time. Nations don't always go through the same economic difficulties for the same reasons. 

&gt; I disagree that it is a good way to ensure future conflict. The border towns should be polled about which side they want to be on, for example, and so, naturally, if a town chooses country AAA, they will resent heavily if country BBB tries to invade. Now, the opposite situation exists, because the town, stuck in country BBB, might welcome the invasion of country AAA.

Once again, you need to look at history - this has happened numerous times in the past and almost never goes as smoothly as you seem to think it will. What happens in towns with a significant minority that suddenly find themselves in a new country? Or what about territories on one group, that would like to join country A, but are completely surrounded by territory that elects to stay with country B?

No. It never is. The fact that you would even say that only shows that you are.

&gt; I don't know where you get the idea this is being done lightly. Thousands of people are dying under the system you are defending.

No. The vast majority of borders in the world are peaceful (or at least, peaceful enough that people don't die because of them). The solution is to build up countries like the CAR so that these issues can be solved in a non-violent way. Not run in with a scalpel and sticky tape and think you can fix all the problems with a border change. ","1391213017"

If you're on a decent computer streaming at 720p you're going to want at least 3 Mbps upload speed, 480p you could get away with 2 or slightly lower, probably.

I've got almost six Mbps upload, but due to my ancient computer I stream at lower resolution, so I've turned down my bitrate as well. I'm still fine tuning settings, but I currently stream at 480p with 1600 kbps bitrate, which is actually a bit on the high side, I think. I could turn it down even lower.

I believe the rule of thumb is you want your bitrate to be at most 80% of your upload, so you don't get spikes, but I'd say a bigger difference is better to avoid issues.

Kickstarter and things like it is not a model that works for most or even many products.  Some examples of where crowdfunding models fail to reach parity with traditional business models: 

-B2B products and services: businesses don't find solutions or products the way consumers do.  B2B companies often find very specific, but large needs and create a business around a handful of clients that require extensive sales cycles.  You can't realistically crowdfund something when your addressable market is 8 or 9 companies and the price tag is $800,000 per year. 

-Large scale, long-term development: Although it's got its problems, crowdfunding the Boeing Dreamliner would have been even worse.  Something requiring that much funding and development time doesn't make sense for any type of crowdfunded model.  Add into that that their market is not consumers, but airlines... another example of the failure in B2B markets.  

-Boring products: Crowdfunding a cheaper way to make quality paper towels would be insanely difficult.  Because the consumer doesn't perceive anything interesting about it - nor should they.  You may have a great business idea for consumer products (I can make $0.05 more per paper towel roll than the incumbents) but you may not be able to get consumers to care.  If they don't care, your campaign goes nowhere. 

Now, as far as equity crowdfunding goes: it will remain a small subset of total investment in business, IMO probably indefinitely.  Why? 

-Consumers tend to invest in things that appeal to consumers.  This is why you see the IPOs of companies like Facebook get so hot immediately - it's because they're recognizable to everyone including average people with money to invest. The same types of things that do well on kickstarter will do well in crowd-equity situations, the things that don't, won't.  See above for why crowd-based models don't work well for B2B models. 

-Consumers are unsophisticated: The average person with $1000 to invest doesn't have a clear idea of why they should invest it, and what they should invest it in.   This will not only lead to fraud, scams, and semi-scams (think The Producers), but will also lead to a higher failure rate among funded companies, since there will be less oversight, vetting, and advising of companies by sophisticated, knowledgeable investors. 

So, my point is this.  Neither one is ""the future"", they have very good uses for specific business models, but aren't applicable to the bulk of commerce or investment. ","1391213022"

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","Unsurprisingly, you've only proved my point by your google search:

&gt;But it seems to only be a drop in the ocean: The infiltration to Israel, mostly through places in which the border fence was not completed, reminds that in many areas, the Palestinians join Arab-Israelis and add on to the complex situation and the tension surrounding the lives on both sides of the Green Line.

Source: http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4454023,00.html

So basically, the border wall stops it from happening in most places. When completed, it will form a solid wall that stops a vast majority of entries. However, let's look at whether or not any are coming from Gaza thanks to the *completed* border fence on that side:

&gt;The perimeter fence around the Gaza Strip is guarded by military forces, which open fire whenever they identify someone trying to cross through the fence into Israel . As a result, very few Palestinians now enter Israel from Gaza without a permit. 

Source: http://www.btselem.org/workers

Looks to me like illegal immigration from places the border wall is *complete* is pretty low. You're applying present illegal immigration to future circumstances.

Now let's look at your other bullshit claim:

&gt;what stopped the terrorists from west bank was mostly ""defensive shield"" op, not the wall.

Really? I'm not surprised you haven't sourced this; it's completely false. Let's take a look at when Operation Defensive Shield was:

&gt;Date	29 March–3 May 2002

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield

Unsurprisingly in 2003, there were [23 suicide bombings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks#2003_.2823_bombings.29). Far less than before Defensive Shield, but that doesn't mean much:

&gt;While 2003 had a total of 25 executed suicide bombings in comparison to 56 in 2002, **the main difference was the number of attacks which did not come to realization (184) either due to Israeli interception or problems in the execution.**

http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_19279_2.pdf

Scroll to Page 5. There were **70 more foiled attempts than in 2002, and only 24 more actual suicide bombings in 2002 than 2003.** What does that mean? That means despite Operation Defensive Shield, there were attempts to have at least 50 more suicide bombings in 2003 than 2002, which is when Operation Defensive Shield took place. Let's take a look at that number when related to the *Gaza border fence*.

&gt;Since 1996, virtually all suicide bombers trying to leave Gaza have detonated their charges at the barrier's crossing points or were stopped while trying to cross the barrier elsewhere. From 1994 until 2004 only one suicide bomber originating from within the Gaza Strip successfully carried out an attack in Israel (the March 14, 2004, attack in Ashdod).

Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_barrier

That means for **10 years**, with the wall having been completed in 1996 and started in 1994 (so 10 years from 1994-2004), only **one** suicide bomber managed to get through the wall to detonate their charges. One, compared to the &gt;40 suicide bombings that took place in 2002 and **only** 2002.

Are you *really* telling me the border wall had nothing to do with stopping suicide bombings? The wall, which was torn down between September 2000 and rebuilt around the start of 2001, has been standing solid from 1996 'til now with only minor incursions to the contrary, and suicide bombers have *stopped at the wall* virtually every time they try to attack Israel.

But you're saying it's ""Defensive Shield""? Really?

Assuming you're doing the bootable iso version of memtest, go ahead and remove the disc from the drive as soon as it starts running. That way, if the system crashes during the test it will be readily apparent that it did. If you leave the disc in the drive, it will just go right back into memtest and you might not notice.

It's hard for me to face the idea that our kid might be baptized in a faith I do not think has enough merit for her to subject herself to. I have read that a lot of kids eventually decide to analyze it themselves more frequently in mixed marriages, so I guess that leaves me feeling optimistic for her. She's a bright, sweet, sensitive kid. The first time I taught her ""the discussions"" at my husband's request she said she didn't believe me. I was quietly a bit proud.

I never beg or threaten, I was sure that wouldn't lead to anything, and it's not really my style. I don't always come up with an immediate response to a point he's made, I simmer on it and ponder and analyze it, and then I later explain the issues I see with it.

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","No, he has never apologized to me. Since going LC with him the last few years I have noticed that he is much better at being patient with people, and keeping his temper in check. I could give a few examples but I don't want to write a wall of text. I do worry that some of his control is only because of my new stepmother.

One that thing has always bothered me is I know next to nothing about his sobriety, or really that much about his addictions. I know he has a gambling problem and he used amphetamines, but I do not know any details beyond that. I'm not sure if I want to know every little detail. He did have a ceremony a few months ago for being 10 years clean. He mentioned offhand that he was preparing a speech for it and my stepmother was in attendance, but he has never asked any of us to attend functions like this or even celebrate them with him. It was kind of hard for my brothers and I to hear that he was sharing that with strangers but has never let us into that part of his life.

I know I cannot make him apologize, but would it be a good idea to ask for an apology? Or say something like, ""I am really struggling with this, and for me to move on I really need to hear a sincere apology from you."" I'm worried that it might trigger something and start a big fight.","1391213028"

I don't think my physician quite took me seriously until I had a month of recorded episodes of exposure to light-confusion-absence-headache-fatigue. You may not even realize the common denominator until you see the trends. Read more about different types of seizures and see if any of them seem familiar. 

Take this to your primary care physician and ask what they suspect could be the root of your problems. They will likely have a differential diagnosis based on your history and may want to rule out other things too. But seizures are fairly ubiquitous. If they do an EEG to read brain activity and it is negative, remember- this is just a snapshot. I am a nurse and it took some months of advocating for myself to finally have this diagnosis. In the end my physician and I decided to try anticonvulsant medication to see if it worked. And it did, marvelously. Diagnostics by trial and error. Good luck!

I think too many people look at ypc and think it doesn't have the same problems defining a player other stats can have.

A broader look at what Carey's done is have a (relatively) low ypc while getting a lot of touches in a high-scoring offense.

This is important for offenses: a guy who gets 4 yards every time is great, a guy who gets 1 yard half the time and 7 yards the other half will lead to a lot of punts.","1391213031"

I'm just saying that aside from very, very rare exceptions, cover bands, and to a great extent, cover band players, have a limited shelf life. Most people give it up long before they hit 30, with either money problems, or alcohol/drugs being the reason. (It's hard to be in a bar every night and not get caught up in the party) 
Yes there are exceptions, like chuckeye notes - Steel Panther. They might be raking it in now, but with no royalties to supplement income, they will be forced to play constantly to survive, always looking for venues where they haven't worn out their welcome, and that's a hard life for anyone. And how long will they be able to keep it going? Will people pay to see middle-aged Steel Panther? I doubt it. I also doubt that they will have enough saved to retire on.

"iran","t5_2qhzq","The sanctions they place on Iran blacklist the country; that means anyone who does business with them cannot do business with the US. So countries are essentially forced between trading with the US and trading with Iran. Most countries in the world are going to choose the US; it's a no brainer, it's economy is orders of magnitude larger than Iran. Even though Iran has good trading relationships with countries like Germany and Italy, those countries still do more business with the US. Even if they don't like the sanctions, no one is going to take that much of a financial hit to defend Iran. And since Iran's biggest export was petroleum, the US also leaned on the Saudis to step up production of oil to keep the price stable after Iranian oil is effectively barred from the market. 

As for something like SWIFT (which handles a vast majority of the international banking transactions), the US says we will blacklist the organization if you continue to do business with Iran. Since SWIFT cannot afford to lose the US from the international banking network, they caved to US pressure and shut off Iran. That was probably the most extreme measure the US took...countries like Iraq and Afghanistan weren't cut off from SWIFT, even during wars.","1391213036"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I'm so glad you're interested in a further exploration of my commentary!  Allow me to delve into the subject in a bit more detail.  Don Hertzfeldt does some amazing animations based on his twisted sense of humor, and his penchant for animating crudely shaped human figures.  As we see in ""Ah, L'amour"", witty jokes based on internal pain and frustrations are at the core of his sense of artistic embellishment.  This is reflected in the bouncing penises of the animation, which quite joyously bounce free from oppression.  As we progress through the shame and censorship (ie the covering of the genitals), we see the protagonist doesn't fit the mold.  His ample genitalia protrude beyond the attempt to censor.  His conformity with the shame and reluctance to remain free are only underscored by his junk's exploding from behind the circle of fear.  When the third wall is broken, that is to say when the characters in the animation break the boundaries of the film to acquire the DOT from the title of the film, we are astonished to realize that the characters themselves are aware that they are in an animated film.  Thus, they break out of their world which subtly indicates that they are not only aware of modern censorship, but are intentionally complicit with the thrust.  Fortunately for us, and our giggles, the protagonist's primary member bounces free of such ridiculous notions.

* The Bomber can deploy flare countermeasures (X by default on PC).
* After 15 kills with the Bomber you unlock the Cruise Missile secondary which can be guided much like a TOW missile. A single hit from the Cruise Missile will significantly damage and immobilize all armored vehicles. While the vehicle is immobile follow up with two JDAMs to finish it off.
* Launching all four JDAMs at probable enemy locations as soon as you can after entering the Bomber view often allows you to reload just before you fly over the center of the map where you can more easily spot and hit targets.
* It is possible to launch up to three full salvos of JDAMs with a single pass by dropping each salvo soon after it is reloaded.
* Hold off dropping JDAMs until you are over the target to minimize their flight time (useful for when a target is likely to move).","1391213041"

Also, we all were quite wasted (not drunk kind of wasted - wanting to hug a bed kind of wasted). The fact that he lost 30 precious minutes of sleeptime just for me is just astounding.

Is it practical? No.

You'd have to pull in around 30 million ISK a day to afford a PLEX.  To do that, you would need to play a horrible amount of time each day, grinding missions over and over, leaving only time to sleep a little bit each day.

If you can do that for 21 days straight, good for you. :)

It's much simpler to just fork over some real $ for game time, and then save your ISK for whatever you want to buy.  600 million ISK for a character that's a month old can get you a lot of nice stuff.","1391213044"

What is best for the welfare of people should be of paramount importance, not ""I think this because of my beliefs,"" or my my anger, or my secret conviction that I am smarter than anyone else. I never said one should vote SOLEY on the directives of the heart, but that that should be a crucial component.

So, even though it seems I play at a Silver 1 level, I get stuck at Silver 4 over time because I can not play enough games to climb. I'm not saying I should be Gold. But if my MMR has consistently been Silver 1, how come I can't get out of Silver 4 after 3 months? Something isn't adding up properly.

Everyone has a birthright.  For example, say it is 3/4 of a person.

You and your significant other can combine birthrights, and have a baby - which consumes one whole birthright, leaving you both with 1/2 of a birthright left over.

You can then sell or buy birthright on the open market.  A middle class family could save up to purchase another 1/2 birthright and have two children.  A wealthy family could have as many children as they could afford.

Something NOT mentioned in the book, the government could adjust the birthright up or down, to meet population requirements - like overcrowding, or expansion.","1391213049"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm so tired of people failing to put thought into this argument. There is a massive loophole in this line of reasoning. You're acting as if you should be carrying games if you have a higher MMR than your current ranking and then saying you shouldn't be expected to since you're playing against those higher ELO players (of your same skill). The thing your missing is point gains and point losses. If your MMR is seriously over a league above you, the points you gain per win will be close to 30 and the points you lose will be around 15. So, even with a 50% win ratio, you will eventually get to that MMR (your MMR won't change if you're winning 50/50).

It's so stupidly simple so please quit bitching. Sure there may be problems with the ranked system, but your point is null and void.","1391213052"

"piano","t5_2qnw8","There is certainly a school of technique that is all about efficient movements. Movement goes from your core, through relaxed shoulders and upper arms, through a heavy forearm and through a hand and wrist structure that is springy. Florid hand and wrist movements are to be avoided because, while they may look like they're doing something, they're not actually doing anything to help with the production of good sound and tone.

I've been recently working on what has been the most difficult piece I've ever tried. (It's by no means a piece of virtuosic repertoire, but requires lots of intricate movements.)

And I'm finding that, for this piece, I -am- doing certain things:

* Sort of elliptical hand movements to help with transitions from finger to finger and for large hand movements--I seem to be placing my hands and arms more accurately somehow

* Sort of a gentle rolling forward on to the fingers to play certain chords where I'm needing to slot my fingers for chords between black notes and play relatively quietly.

So, while I'm pretty on board with the idea of avoiding extraneous movement for movement's sake, for this most recent piece, my wrists have been very active. I'm not 100% sure why, but it doesn't seem to be hurting yet and might be helping with some tricky stuff. 100% possible, though, that things should just be shifting because they're shifting.","1391213054"

Submission to Allah is a good way to put it. Allah is the one, you have to be in submission to it, you are below it.

If we are going to play with christianity a bit the way jesus put it is relevant. The father is through me, I am the father, yet the father is not me. The One/Allah is through me, I am the One/Allah, yet the One/Allah is not me. You are fully part of the One, but the One is not fully part of you.

In buddhism the whole point is to recognize that there is only ""is"". Not present or future as you never experience those, only ""is"". Existence. Enjoy this moment right now, as that's all there is.

Yahweh is the totality. I am the beginning and end, the alpha and omega. I was, I am, I will be. When ask what Yahweh is, the answer is "" I AM "", he who causes to become, cause and effect. The bit about beginning and end, alpha and omega is strange foreshadowing unto the nature of this world. No matter which direction or perspective you look or which hierarchy you travel down, it never ends. Nothing ends.

Events have been set in motion. Forces are traveling. You can either ride these forces, these currents, or you can fight against them fruitlessly. This is taoism. If an opponent applies force to attack you, move out the way expending little force and give him some force to send him on his merry way. If someone applies large amounts of force on a business, ride that force and get fruits from it.","1391213054"

i really really encourage you to try it because it has a set structure (helps take lots of the thinking out) and enforce good habits. it emphasizes proper form over ""fuk yea bro more sets"" type of stuff and there's space to work within yourself. p90x is meant to be done at home but the gym will give you the advantage of a full set of free weights and all that.

Early game, if you're favoring gold buildings so much that you have a meaningful reserve to do something like you say, then you've probably given up a heck of a lot of growth/infrastructure/production for it.

Late game it's not an issue, because if you planned your game, you have the walls you need and the millitary that is required to hold your lines. If you regularly need a reserve to rush buy walls and a few units, then you're probably better off reevaluating your game plan and be better prepared next game. I get that having a buffer is useful, but that is also doable with my sparse income.

I can maybe see the argument in having gold to get factories early to get an early ideology, but you don't particularly need to go out of your way to be able to afford one of those.","1391213062"

Now that the ""edgy"" factor has blurred, you get people coming out of the woodwork getting stupid things, because society is more accepting of tattoos. which will get scoffed at by people with ""real"" tattoos, and the untattooed alike. 

""In the beginning of a change the patriot is a scarce man, and brave, and hated and scorned. When his cause succeeds, the timid join him, for then it costs nothing to be a patriot.""

This quote about patriotism is the perfect analogy. People on the fringe of society (criminals , bikers, and war veterans) paved the way of what it meant to have a tattoo. Now, people are so quick to hop on the bandwagon, and as a result, they have to defend their choices. ","1391213065"

Which white people is that exactly, Australians? Irish people? There is no one ""white"" culture so to lump all ""white"" people together is pretty ignorant. Whereas Jews are a specific ethnoreligious group.

&gt;/r/conspiracy[1] is constantly being brigaded, just yesterday there was about 100 posts about snow not melting. How can you be so sure that it isn't conspiratards upvoting antisemitic stuff to make /r/conspiracy[2] look bad. 

Because all the commenters who post anti-semitic thing are regulars on /r/conspriacy? Because the MODS post and support people posting antisemitic material? Because /u/godblessadolfhitler gets upvoted when he talks about Zionism? 

You wanna see some vote brgading? How bout the admins actually saying that /r/conspiracy is vote brigading, and not saying the same about conspiratard? http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiratard/comments/1wgixf/reddit_admins_make_a_lame_post_about_a_dinosaur/cf2eo8k

There's no reason to think others might not do the same in the future if they find themselves in similar situations. The fact that players like Pete Carroll just adds a little extra to the attractiveness of Seattle as a destination for short-term free agents.

I wouldn't expect people to take a discount on long-term contracts though. It really doesn't make sense for them to do so. But the team can still benefit hugely from deals like the Bennett deal for as long as Pete Carroll is here and the team is competitive.","1391213070"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I have had a similar problem, and my solution was to quit giving so much of a shit about what is expected of me because of my gender.

I realize you might be under some social pressure about how you express yourself as a guy, and ridicule for things that seem 'gay'. These pressures seem to be especially strong in sports teams and other traditionally male-dominated social groups, probably as an overcompensation for the tight-knit male relationships that form.

So. You can try socializing in different groups which have less unrealistic expectations of people, which might mean distancing yourself from your current friends, or you can try teaching your friends to quit being so uptight, or you can try and change your personality to suit them. I really hope you don't choose the third option, because there are a *lot* of people who choose that option, to the detriment of their happiness and of themselves as people. And when people choose that, it means the people placing those pressures on them don't have their worldviews challenged, and aren't forced to consider the possibility that they might be acting like douches.

You might not even be the only person in your group with this problem. What if, among the dudes teasing you for whatever-gay-looking-gesture, there's someone who's actually truly gay, and doesn't trust the group enough to tell them?

If there's an invisible gay person on your team (and statistically, there's *probably more than one*) then how encouraging might it be for him to see one of his straight friends stand up tall and say ""fuck you, I can limp-wrist if I want""

I realize the solution I'm suggesting isn't the easiest one, but it's the solution that's made me happiest in the long run.","1391213074"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;In theory, police and military are not terrorists. I don't think police fit the definition because they don't have ""political goals"". They have specific guidelines on the use of force,and its for enforcing laws that they themselves didn't write. Police force is not for preaching a philosophy, distributing a message, or challenging a government.

Policing by it's very nature is political. So are the laws that the police enforce for that matter. To think that the law is some kind of neutral and objective truth is folly. The police enforce the laws made by other people who are in power and have their own agendas. Whatever those agendas may be doesn't matter. Police forces are used to preach a philosophy, the philosophy is ""obey the law"". They do deliver a message, that message is ""obey the law"". Their role isn't to challenge government, it's to defend government, and to defend it using force and fear. It's foolish to think that governments, even Western democratic ones, don't have ideologies, agendas and political philosophies. It's even more foolish to think that they don't or won't enforce them. 

Consider, for example, how the Soviet Union would [discredit political prisoners by sending them to insane asylums](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psikhushka). Officially, they weren't punishing dissent, they were helping the mentally ill. Look at how the police put down the Occupy movement. We live in a society where the freedom of assembly and association is held as one of our most cherished rights, and yet the police silenced these protesters by citing concerns over the park's unsanitary conditions. As if a dirty park is more important than the right to protest. 

Is a police officer enforcing Jim Crow Laws, or The Nuremburg Laws or the Fugitive Slave Act, an inherently non-political entity? 

&gt;To distinguish military from terrorists, it's useful to think of state and non-state actors. The primary goal of military action is not to incite fear but to use the military branch of one government (one state) to overpower the military branch of another government. Terrorists, on the other hand, are non-governmental operatives attacking non-government targets with the express goal of inciting fear in order to spur political change.

So essentially, the difference is that terrorists are non-state actors? That may be a better definition, but I still think there are some holes in it. Does that make armies more moral then? Is it okay to commit violence in the name of a state, but not on your own, or against one? What makes you think nominally terrorist organizations don't attack government targets? Are they not terrorists if they do? 

Furthermore, where does state-terror or state-sponsored terrorism fit, then? The [very word terrorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism#Origin_of_term) comes from the French Revolution, and it referred to the [state guillotining people](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reign_of_terror), not suicide bombers. Using terrorism to refer to non state actors is a relatively recent phenomenon. Hitler bombed England with the purpose of demoralizing the population and getting the British to end the war, would that count as an act of terrorism? If it is, what separates ""terror"" bombing from strategic bombing? For a more contemporary example, [consider Pakistan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state_sponsored_terrorism), here is a country that has sponsored Islamic fundamentalist terrorism in Afghanistan and India since about 1989. For Pakistan, sponsoring terrorism is an integral part of their national defence strategy, like aircraft carriers are for the US. 

The idea that governments only use militaries to fight other governments is, I think, specious. look at the last decade, how many wars were fought against states and how many against non-state actors? Look at the Iraq War, before it turned into the mess that it later became, when Saddam Hussein was in charge. The President of the United States [issued an ultimatum](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2859269.stm) to another world leader, demanding that the country radically change it's political system, or the US military would invade. Would this qualify as an act of terror? There was a very real threat of force against not only Saddam and the ruling Baath Party, but against the entire nation of Iraq. A threat that was made good on, resulted in millions of civilian casualties and delivered an entire country into US hegemony, no terrorist group in history can claim that kind of success. 

&gt;The Columbine shooters weren't terrorists (no political goal), the Oklahoma City bombers were. Westboro Baptists aren't terrorists (just assholes), but the KKK are.

I can agree with this, a terrorist is someone with a political goal and agenda, not someone who commits violence for the sake of violence. 

&gt;I'm satisfied with the definitions, but I have trouble with their applications. Individuals wear many hats, and just because someone is a terrorist today doesn't mean he wasn't a cop, a husband, or a chef at other times. We don't have a bad definition of the word ""chef"" either, but people will disagree among themselves about who really is and isn't a ""chef"".

You're not exactly alone, there is [plenty of debate on the actual definition of terrorism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_terrorism). ","1391213074"

I'd bet the enemy he was facing had better shields. He was also using his laser, which against a well shielded enemy won't do much. My guess is, seeing as the enemies weapons were off, he didn't realize his o2 was off, his weapons were too shitty to finish off his enemy and he didn't realize he was out of air until he was dead.

"keto","t5_2rske","I used to go backpacking a lot, and want to start again, so I have given this some thought myself.  Keto is great for this, as fat is more calorically dense.  The advantage of carbs is that you reduce their backpacking weight by removing the water.  How long is your trek going to be?  Any kind of dried sausage is a great start.  Sorry to say, you will likely be meat heavy, look for things like pepperoni, Hard Salami, summer sausage, and vacuum packed sausage bites. You could do tuna in a foil package.  Maybe powdered eggs.  You could bring hard boiled eggs, they have an amazing shelf life (think easter).  For veggies, they sell sauerkraut by the bag near where I live.  You could do coconut, just try to find it no sugar added or shave it yourself.  

You could look into getting a dehydrator and vacuum packer so that you can make your own dried foods like dried ham and such.  

 For your first meal, you could probably take along something like frozen steak, insulate it a bit first, and carry that along.  It shouldn't spoil before you cook it.  Peanut butter might be a good idea, but you can't have too much at once.  

Also, for an emergency, I would bring packets of red beans and rice, just remove the box.  Always bring extra emergency food when back packing.  In an emergency, you are not going to worry about staying on keto, you will want to live.  These packets are small, light, and nutritionally dense.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","http://www.svd.se/opinion/ledarsidan/invandringen-bor-inte-innebara-sju-svara-ar_3855107.svd

&gt; 7 år. Så lång tid tar det från det att en invandrare får uppehållstillstånd tills dess att densamme har ett arbete, om man tar mediantiden som riktmärke.

&gt; Hälften av männen har jobb efter fem år. För kvinnorna är bilden ännu dystrare. Efter fem år i Sverige står nästan två av tre invandrarkvinnor fortfarande utan arbete. Och för en stor del tycks arbetslivet aldrig komma närmare hur lång tid som än går. Omkring var fjärde invandrare har efter nio år i Sverige fortfarande inte hittat sitt första jobb. -(SvD 27/11 2009)

Det går *framåt* inom vissa områden vad gäller att få ut folk i arbete, se t.ex [""Rekordmånga utlandsfödda får jobb""](http://www.svd.se/nyheter/inrikes/fler-jobb-gar-till-utrikes-fodda_7884918.svd) - SvD 4/2 2013), men läget är  fortfarande långt ifrån bra och det finns problem.

&gt; Sju av tio jobb går till utrikes födda, visar färsk statistik från SCB. Starkast är utvecklingen inom vården och restaurangsektorn. Samtidigt ökar klyftorna och facken får allt svårare att hävda kollektivavtal. 

&gt; /.../

&gt; Också LO ser positivt på att allt fler utlandsfödda etablerar sig på den svenska arbetsmarknaden. Men Thord Ingesson, organisationens migrationspolitiske expert, poängterar att integrationen är långt ifrån problemfri:

&gt; – Vi vet att fattigdomen i Sverige har en etnisk dimension, där en majoritet av dem som betraktas som fattiga och har försörjningsstöd en längre tid är personer som är födda utomlands.

&gt; Dessutom ökar klyftorna, även i gruppen invandrare, menar han:

&gt; – Mörka och icke kristna personer har svårare att få jobb. Om du kommer från Afrika och Mellanöstern löper du stor risk att bli diskriminerad.

---

Från din länk:

&gt; – ""Alla utrikes födda som kommer till Sverige lever på bidrag""

&gt; Det stämmer inte. Majoriteten av dem som fick uppehållstillstånd under 2012 lever inte på bidrag. De är t.ex. arbetskraftsinvandrare, studenter, EES/EU-medborgare och deras anhöriga som oftast har en försörjning när de kommer till Sverige. Under 2012 var över 700 000 utrikes födda personer sysselsatta. Men det tar fortfarande alltför lång tid för nyanlända flyktingar att komma in på arbetsmarknaden.

Klart som fan att det inte är sant att ""alla"" är arbetslösa, det finns det väl ingen frisk människa som påstår; men det är också lite fusk att ta med regelrätta arbetskraftsinvandrare, utbytesstudenter, samt o.s.v i beräkningen för att försköna siffrorna. Om man granskar påståendet här så påstås att 700.000 utlandsfödda var sysselsatta 2012. Det *låter* ju bra, men då bör man också nämna att vi har över 1.400.000 utlandsfödda i landet, vilket innebär att varannan är utan sysselsättning, och det är INKLUSIVE regelrätta arbetskraftsinvandrare, utbytesstudenter, och även danskar, norrmänn, finnar som helt enkelt bosatt sig på andra sidan gränsen, o.s.v.

""Sysselsättning"" behöver heller inte ens betyda arbete. Även om alliansregeringen själva försökt göra statistiken mer transparent efter att ha anklagat den tidigare regeringen för att fuska med arbetslöshetsstatistik genom att gömma folk i arbetsmarknadspolitiska åtgärder o.s.v så tycker jag personligen inte att sidan du länkar till är helt ärlig.

Bupa is a leading healthcare provider (behind the NHS) in the UK.

""Carbohydrates seem to have been given a bad reputation in recent years. Say the word ‘carbs’ and for many people, stodgy food and weight gain spring to mind. But in reality, your body wouldn’t be able to function without carbohydrates.""


http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/loseweight/Pages/the-truth-about-carbs.aspx

The NHS. The leading healthcare provider in the UK.

""The ""carbs are bad"" mantra from Dr Atkins and co has left many people confused about carbohydrates and their importance for your health, including maintaining a healthy weight.
Dietitian Sian Porter says: ""Carbohydrates are such a broad category and people need to know that not all carbs are bad.
""While we should reduce the amount of sugar in our diet there is strong evidence that starch and fibre are good for our health.”""

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Actually it does. I pay them because I'll be thrown in a cage if I don't. I don't pay them voluntarily.

Nope.  You are paying for things you have and are currently using.  Or did you build all those roads you drive on or pay for any of the other things you have used your entire life.  No you didn't.  Collecting payment for services rendered is not theft.

&gt;So am I allowed to stop paying them? No. That is the definition of involuntary - ""done against someone's will"".

Yes, you are.  You have to stop using the services they provide, ie move out of the country.  Just living here you are benefiting from those services.  Your inability to see, understand and accept this is moot.

&gt;That's just it. When it comes to taxes we don't get to say, ""oh it depends..blah blah blah."" We have to. So thanks for proving my point.

Yea, but you already benefit more than you pay.  Your continued residence here is a tacit agreement.  Once again, your inability to see and understand these things does not make them any less true.

&gt;No. Thinking that just because someone or something does something right now that it would never get done if they stop doing it, is a fallacy. That is exactly what slave owners said when they were told they had to get rid of their slaves. But guess what? The cotton got picked in the end didn't it? Before government established a public education system I guess no one ever went to school, right? Wrong. Children were in school long before this was provided by the government. So do you see? Just because they provide it now does not mean it would not get done. So no it's not a fact.

I am not arguing it wouldn't get done in the future, but that we wouldn't have been here to begin with.  Roads didn't exist until civilization reached a sufficient level to support the needs and means to build them.  Civilization didn't exist until government reached sufficient means to allow it.  You seem to be caught up that I am arguing for our current very specific government, I am not.  Every one of your arguments is starting from a point that has only ever been reached by humans through the use of government.  Government was what allowed the first two cavemen families live together, hell, it's what allowed the individual families to live by themselves.

""A government is the system by which a state or community is governed""

That's it.  That is the definition from which I am arguing.

&gt;My god the idiocy. Yes you're absolutely right people would just be wandering around aimlessly like morons because we're not intelligent enough to develop a road. 

Yes, the idiocy indeed.  That is in fact precisely what we have done for the majority of our existence.  Until someone or grouped discovered a way of governing themselves to allow more, hence the birth of government.  And while those smart cavemen sat around figuring out how they were going to live together without killing each other, others in the group found food and shared it with them, hence the first tax.

&gt;Just as an example let's say John Road was the inventor of roads. John Road works for the government and invented them for government so we say government invented roads.

No the government provided the stability and funds that allowed civilization and the economic situation to reach a point where roads were even needed.  Hunter/gatherers don't use roads and you can hardly feed yourself if you spend all your time building roads. 

&gt;Now step back and imagine there is no government. 

Ok, we are back to pre-civilization.  You can't use the advances brought forth by civilization and government to start your no government analogy.

&gt;John Road would work for a private company, why would he not be able to invent roads?

Because he doesn't work for a company nor does he have the need for roads.  You are once again starting your argument by standing on the advances created by government.

He is still wondering around hunting and gathering and he either runs from or kills any other human he sees.  Eventually he may have a family, which he will govern (the first government), and that family will eventually provide enough security for him to approach another similar sized family to trade.  So you see, it starts with government.

&gt;So do you see, they still would have been developed either way. 

No, they did develop one way, and you have a fantasy they could of another but even your fantasy requires government.

&gt;If I lock you in my basement but still feed you, just because you eat the food, doesn't mean you're having a great fucking time down there. Just because we use, or have to use government services, doesn't mean we're having a great fucking time.

Hardly relevant, but welcome to the human condition.

&gt;Ok. Fact is something that's proven. How do you know? Point to verifiable proof that civilization would not exist without government. I won't accept anything less because you've said it is a fact.

""A government is the system by which a state or community is governed""

Civilization (or civilisation) is an advanced stage of human social development and organization

Organization requires some form of governance; a set of rules, an order and a defined method by which to organize.

&gt;That's not true. I can think of a few ways committing crime would be hindered, without a government. 

No you can't.  You believe you can because you are ignorant and really don't understand what I am talking about.  I will ignore the rest of your childish rant on this one.

&gt;Pretend we live in a world where murder isn't illegal but everything else is the same as it is now. Would you go around murdering people? The truth is people don't really want to murder other people, right? The reason I don't murder is because I don't want to, not because it's illegal.

Great another example build firmly on the foundations provided by government and civilization.  I wouldn't murder either, based on who I am now, but I wouldn't be who I am now without the society I grew up in, which was afforded by thousands of years of civilization and government.  Extend your analogy.  Have someone who grew up completely outside of society.  Would they murder?  Yes.

&gt;I'm not throwing regulation and, I guess it wouldn't be called legal system, but dispute system out the window just because we get rid of government. People can self regulate. The market self regulates. How do you know which seller to purchase things from on ebay? Other consumer feedback. Problem solved. People can solve disputes without a government. You're sounding like a slave owner again.

Once again, you are confusing the definition of government.  Regulate is a synonym of govern.  Self regulation is self government.  Also, all those things you mention are not done is a vacuum of no government.  They have all evolved to be the way they are within a system of government.  It is dishonest to suggest they would be the same had they not.

&gt;No I've already told you there have been systems developed to solving disputes without a government. Perhaps you should try reading something new rather than that which reinforces your preconceived notions.

Still requires government.  Hell the whole thing is a system to govern.  You are once again conflating the definitions of government.

&gt;Yes investors. And I've just shown you where there would be a system of contract law (although I admit it probably wouldn't be called contract law). Would it be the exact same? I don't know. Most likely not but would have the same underlying concept.

No, you have shown an alternative system of governing, which is actually still dependent on their being a larger more overreaching government should it fail.

&gt;If you can't out-reason or out-think and convince a 6 year-old to eat healthy or brush their teeth, then I'm sorry but you're a fucking moron and you shouldn't have procreated. It doesn't take a lot of mental capacity to out-think your child enough to get him to brush his teeth. My god man.

Didn't say I couldn't, but either way, they aren't doing those things voluntarily, which according to you requires me to force them to, which according to you makes it a bad idea.

&gt;The easiest way to tell that it's not a good idea is when you have to force people to do something, right?

&gt;That is the definition of involuntary - ""done against someone's will"".

&gt;If they didn't rely on violence then I would fully agree with you that it isn't theft and is voluntary. But the minute that there is a threat, well then that's theft.

Sorry you logic isn't even good in your own head, perhaps you should straighten it out before trying to sell it to others.

&gt;Ok when doesn't it?

Just went over it.

&gt;That is what's great about the free market and voluntary actions/association is the humility. I don't know the best way to alleviate poverty and I don't know the best way to educate your children. I have ideas but someone might have a better idea but we'll never know because the government doesn't allow it.

Yes, but this assumes everyone agrees to alleviate poverty and educate kids, ie do those things that are a good idea, the problem is not everyone does.  And those that don't still get all the benefits of the society that does.","1391213086"

Not necessarily. Again, it's a cost benefit. When you increase the cost of something, it may not be worth it anymore.

From the abstract: ""Mean flaccid length was 8.8 cm, stretched length 12.4 cm, and erect length 12.9 cm."" [5.1""]

**update**  please disregard below, it is incorrect - see /u/hungfun's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigdickproblems/comments/1wo998/the_penis_size_chart_used_on_this_forum_is/cf4jhpj)

So the average described in the image is therefore too high, by 2.84cm, or 1.1 inches. 

The correct average for all three studies is therefore 13.66 cm (5.38""), ~1cm (0.4"") less than what is listed. 

Notably the erect length variation between studies was 2.14cm, and is now 1.54cm. A 30% reduction. I was surprised by the variation between the studies before, 1.54cm makes more sense.

"cancer","t5_2qixx","First off, I'm really sorry you are going through this.  There is never a good time to be diagnosed with cancer.

Part of the reason for your intense fear is that you don't what you are facing.  You are hearing all these side comments and are (rightfully) worried about the worst case scenario.  I was there myself when I was first diagnosed, looking at 5 year survival rates online (depressing), not knowing what my official staging was, and wondering if I was already terminal.

The only advice I can give is that you need to try to put the worst case scenario fear out of your mind until you hear back from the biopsy.  It sounds like you will most likely hear it is cancer, which unfortunately won't be a surprise.  The next things they will do are a PET or CT scan (along with bloodwork), to see if it has metastasized.  The PET/CT will show if it has spread anywhere else.

What I would do is call the doctors office every day.  Let them know you want the results back as soon as possible, and don't let them delay.  I would start looking up and reviewing oncology centers near you, so that you have an idea of where you want to go after this.  If your doctor hasnt seen many women at this age with breast cancer, its a good sign this isnt the Dr you want giving you prognosis and data in the future.  

Breast cancer at this age is not the most common demographic, but it is also not rare and reason to declare it ""very aggressive.""  The Dr may have been saying that to cover up the fact that they made a very big mistake in assuring you that it *wasn't* cancer.

As a final point, I was diagnosed at 27, and 3 years later I'm still here (mostly).  My best friends sister was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 29 and she is still here.  There is a lot of reason to be scared, and there is a lot of reason to worry, but there is also a lot of reason to have hope.  The path forward won't be easy, nor is it guaranteed, but there is always reason to think it won't end.

I hope this helped.","1391213094"

That Economist article is an interesting read, thanks for that, though I find the title a little misleading. The research they discussed showed that it ""may do no harm,"" which is different than ""can do more good than harm,"" except for that last bit about the British minimum wage increase decreasing income inequality.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","We run public platoons and give anyone an invite that asks for one. From this, we get about 20% of these members joining us on TS/Forums. The rest tend to fade off and we remove them from the outfit eventually. There are some exceptions of people that play well, actively, but do not participate in forums or TS.

The main problem is that our forum fall-through is lower than that of TS. I only count the people on TS as our ""Active"" players, our effective force if you will. Due to all of our operations and events being posted on the forums, this means that a number of our active players are unaware of what is going on. The truly dedicated guys that are on every day register, but those who pop online maybe once a week are less inclined to do so.

This is a problem with the F2P model. The majority of people don't feel any obligation to the game the way they would in a subscription based game. There is no ""DKP"" or ""Raiding"", whilst working as a team will help you towards victory, your own personal growth as a character is entirely dependant on yourself, you dont require the help of an outfit to do it.

It is not so simple as ""not recruiting randoms"". If we were to have a pre-requisite for joining, such as signing up on the forums before an invite is given, we would get next to no members. That sort of approach doesn't work in this game, especially on the Woodman server.","1391213097"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","I think because I can make it fairly cheaply I'm going to make a gameday deck with Phenax.

Gonna try and make it blue/black control with walls. I'll just run 4 Hero's Downfall and 4 Bile Blight and probably have 4 Doom Blade in the side.

Probably go with 2 Cyclonic Rift just in case. Gonna run a Jace, Memory Adept.

Then I'm going to run 4x Nighthowler and I dunno how many Whip of Erebos.

But I figure I can against most teams. Kill all their stuff, cast big Nighthowlers. Attack with Nighthowlers and maybe heal off Whip's lifelink. Once Phenax is out I can have the option to Mill with walls and Nighthowler.

Can pay to whip in giant Nighthowlers for health, hits, or big mills before they get exiled... one idea I had was to try and run some kind of black sacrifice mechanic like Bubbling Cauldron so I can mill with Nighthowler, then sacrifice it to gain 4 health before it gets Exiled so i can do it again the next turn.

Going to run one Trauamatize because milling half the opponent's deck has the added value of feeding the Nighthowler's power.

I haven't exactly decided how I want to beat Control decks. Jace or nothing I guess. Probably side out some black kills for blue counterspells.

That's my plan. Will something similar win a GP? Probably not, who knows. That's what I'm gonna do though.","1391213102"

Also, the ending scene, where the sachem of the Huron rules against Magua, and Hawkeye makes his speech about how Magua's ""heart is twisted"", put a little more nuance into the character, set him apart from other, non-villainous native characters and serve to isolate his villainy (to some extent) from his native-ness.

This is important because there are many people like that.  The thought of doing something with a ""hook-up"" isn't as appealing as doing it with someone they trust - so therefore the desire just isn't there.  

If you just don't like receiving oral, then I'd just tell him outright.  For a guy like me who LOVES giving a woman oral sex, and knowing I would certainly want to do it, I would need to know that going in so I know not to attempt to do it.  I wouldn't want to try doing something you don't want to do.  

The flip of that coin is if you like giving oral sex then DO IT!  Enjoy it!  Just explain to him that he doesn't have to reciprocate in that regard and get to sucking.  I'm sure he'll lay back and love it.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Basically that there's no evidence for the existence of God. We reject astrology and Santa Claus because there is no evidence for them, so we should reject theism for the same reason.

The idea of God runs counter to our experience in a number of ways. For example, the claim that there could be a mind without a brain is not supported by anything in neuroscience. This makes it essentially impossible to provide evidence that God exists, because even if the stars in the night sky spelled out Genesis 1:1, rationality would require us to look for an explanation that didn't require us to posit a mind without a brain. This last point is academic, though, because events like that never happen in real life.

In a way it's a mistake to treat theism as distinct from Christianity, because the only real reason to believe that God exists is that you uncritically accept everything the Bible says as true. But a literal interpretation of the Bible has been proven wrong over and over. The Bible, like many other oral traditions from primitive cultures, was written by people who cared less about literal truth and logical coherence than justifying the existing social order and having explanations for some strange aspects of the natural world.","1391213104"

If I didn't.. some people prefer the Mac OS for various applications and reasons.  Some applications are only available for the Mac.  The Mac can run both Mac and Windows OS.  

If gaming is your main requirement then there is no question that Mac is not the way to go. Then again, the $800 Windows laptop probably wouldn't be the best choice either.  Desktop or $1-4000 gaming laptop.  

There are plenty of valid reasons for wanting a Mac otherwise though.

Which features are we talking about?  Optical drives are present but being phased out on some models which is true even in the PC market, kensington lock is there, output to various display types via thunderbolt port, ethernet and wifi both accounted for, trackpad which is infinitely more feature rich than 90% of the PC trackpads out there, can upgrade ram with a tiny bit of tedious unscrewing of screws instead of one or two on a PC..though some PC laptops require removal of the keyboard for such an operation, backlit keyboard. USB ports..... I just don't know what other features we might be discussing.

However, in certain situations, the close button apparently will work. I can't say with absolute certainty, but it's my understanding that in an emergency situation, i.e. when firefighters need quick access to the elevators, they can use a key to take full control of the elevator, and that ""close doors"" button will work immediately.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I'll show you what I mean:

1.  Why do you say events happening for no reason?  That doesn't make any sense.  They were on a rescue op.  In real life rescue ops are really small teams of well trained personnel. 

2.  This is the Commander's discretion.  Why waste ammo?

3.  The Empire was making a statement.  When they attacked Alderaan, it took them just as much time as Yavin, they just didn't show it, but it happened.

4.  If they went any closer then the Empire would risk exposure while at their weakest, i.e. in transit.  They are much stronger when they are all assembled and in proper formation.

5.  

6.  Luke took a chance and it very nearly cost him his life.  He got lucky, plain and simple.

7.   The last Skywalker turned out to be Vader so you can see why Yoda hesitated and needed to think about it.

8.  We already agreed on this one.  They were running for their lives and quite literally had less than a second to cope things out. 

9.  Earlier events?  You mean the *Death Star's* tractor beam that's on the magnitude of thousands of times more powerful than a small Destroyer?  There's all sorts of reasons why the Destroyer couldn't get a lock.  Examples: asteroid interference, low-powered tractor beam, interference from the millennium falcon's anti-ship defenses, millennium falcon's maneuverability, and etc...  If you're talking about Episode 4 then we don't know the exact conditions that ship was in to get tractored.

10.  The Emperor leaked the plans himself.  He literally said it in the movie and said it was all trap. Remember the line, ""It's a trap!""?

11.  Space is VERY vast and remember Endor is a moon, so the parent's gravity shields it from a lot of abuse.

12.  Leia was a princess and a Senator that opposed the Empire.  Luke bought an R2 unit that brought Old Ben into the picture and then Ben trained Luke as a Jedi.  Jedi's are against the Empire.  The rest is history.  

13.  Didn't you see the Stromtrooper who hit his head?  They are obviously new or ill-trained.  The droids from the new SW were far, far worse.

14.  We already agreed on this.  ""Vader is obviously conflicted and that's all he would have picked up. The Emperor was so engulfed into what he was doing, killing Luke, that he didn't notice Vader's sudden change of heart.""

15.  Vader's wingman knocked him into safety and Vader obviously legged it out of there.

I wish we could come to some sort of agreement here.  Yes, the originals had some problems, but they were nothing compared to the new episode's problems.  ","1391213111"

Murdering a 12 year old kid and a shop owner though, that's another level even for these low lives and they know it. Most of the robbers would only threaten people not kill in cold blood. What the kid did was very very brave but at that point anything could have happened because robber could have panicked and reacted violently.

It sounds like I'm doing what I should, I'll dye with the exact process you mentioned except condition when I rinse out the due in the shower. I'm already in the habit of only shampooing my roots, and I'll use cornstarch sparingly as dry shampoo (I haven't found any traditional stuff that I like and I'm too cheap to experiment, the cornstarch worked well with the blonde but doesn't blend as well with the red, usually it's up in a bun the second day anyway cos my hair is fine and therefore flat the next day!) between washes. My only vice is hot showers! I wake up at 6am and I loooove my hot showers- usually I'll turn more cold on when I'm rinsing my hair but it's not actually cold-cold.

For the Meridia quest be certain to loot all the bodies before you get the thing you were sent to get.

In the High Gate Ruins, don't accidentally kill the lady who looks like a bandit as you walk in.

If you're doing the thieves guild quests always, always take your time to loot everything.  I know the game makes it sound like time is of the essence, but getting loot is more important.  There is also some very unique loot in all the places - one chance only type of stuff.

Same for the Dark Brotherhood - look around, see what you can get.  There's lots of unique stuff be found during missions.

When you're doing the ""Blood on the Ice"" quest in Windhelm, know that that mission is completely screwed up and buggy.  Save before you get into it.  You might make all the wrong choices may want a do-over.  

When you go into the secret room at that one inn, be sure and get the katana mounted on the wall.

When you go into Skyhaven temple, be sure to get the special armor and sword in the room off to the left.

They don't give a shit whether it's a retrotransposon or a viral vector or homologous recombination.   They don't give a shit whether it's polyploidy or vitamin A expression or salinity tolerance or a c3-c4 shift.  They can't talk about the results of each, and it makes zero scientific sense to group them together under the GMO label, because they have nothing to do with each other.

No, the luddites just ""know"" that GMO = bad and think massive irradiation = good -- that there's this new scary thing that they don't understand called GMO and it needs to be stopped before the attack of the killer tomatoes or something.  It's like opposing the existence of goddamn internet because somebody might join Al Qaeda forums.

"ThisIsOurMusic","t5_2rqpa","Eh. I was kind of bored listening to it.  I like the sub bass.  Nice and creamy, like it should be.  But overall, the mix needs work.  I know you said it's a headphones mix, but learn your headphones.  Learn what they have too much of, and what they have too little of.  Listening in my headphones (and looking at the soundcloud waveform) I can tell the sub bass will drown everything else out on a multi speaker stereo system, or in a club.  You'll get a nice sizzling sound (not really nice) as the highs try to break through the bass.  You need to compress your output, and put a limiter on it to get a nice, even volume across the whole track.  The highs need to be more crisp, the lows need to be taken down in volume. Make your track as flatly balanced in the EQ department as you can.  Let the end user/listener adjust their EQ to the spot where they like it.  That's how mixing and mastering works.  It's designed so that if a listener is listening to one genre, say Trap, that they can set up their music device to an EQ that they like for Trap and not have to change the Eq for each Trap song that comes on.  Do a compare and contrast between your song, and a similar style trap song that you like.  Use the popular trap song oyu like as a mixing reference point.  Once you learn what it should sound like, commit that to memory so you don't have to keep referencing a song every time you do a mix.  As someone who worked at a studio as an intern, and has been producing and engineering music for a very long time, I can come up with an EQ profile for just about any genre or style from memory, and mix and master a track to emulate other songs in that genre to make it a nice transition from one song to another for the listener, without them changing their EQ settings to compensate for my production and engineering styles.","1391213134"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I switched from atheist to deist when the following train of thought occurred to me, in the form of an internal dialogue. 

*why do people exist?*

Well, we evolved from simpler life forms, all the way back to the first cell. 

*well, what about that first self-replicating thing?How did that form?*

It formed by a chance combination of organic matter. 

*well, how did all this matter get here?*

Heavier elements were formed from lighter ones in stars and supernovae.

*all right, what about the hydrogen? How did it get there?*

All the matter in the universe was formed in the big bang 

*so, why was there a big bang? What caused that?*

The big bang is a simple consequence of the laws of physics that control the universe (whatever they are)

*all right, why do those laws work, as opposed to some other possible set of physical laws that would not cause a big bang? Why is there a universe at all?

Umm....

So, that's when I decided to stop believing there was no God, and believe instead that there was a God who chose and set up an interesting set of physical laws and started them running. I didn't know it at the time, but thus is called Deism. 

My conversion from Deism to Chrustian Theism is another story.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","...I never equated football to godlike strength. Generally, when you play football, you're physically conditioned to be on the field. You wouldn't be conditioned to not be able to run/take a tackle since that's what happens in football. It's a very physical sport. Even in high school, football is extremely physical compared to daily life and most other sports. You have to be able to run, take a hit, and be able to tackle which requires a lot of weight &amp; momentum to take someone down who is heavier than you. 

Again, you can't put yourself into Travyon's shoes. You are not Trayvon. It does not matter if you were a scrawny stoner who couldn't bench his own weight. Your life experience is different than his. Were you a running back? The sources I'm finding about this state that Martin played multiple positions. He obviously had to be in good physical condition to play multiple positions.

I don't think you understand how the ""long game"" works, if you think slow, methodical policy maneuvers just stop happening.

&gt; Conservatives were already calling him ""Kommandant"" while waiting for the SOTU, he's got to stop being such a wimp. On marijuana legislation, I think the issue is actually pretty good from a polling standpoint.

All the more reason to let Democrats enshrine it in their 2014 election platforms.  He's got a full 8 months to ride a cresting wave of legalization-momentum, before announcing his intent to pull pot off Schedule I on November 5th.

We played this same game with the repeal of DADT.  Obama played coy.  The Dem Senate took the lead.  Joe Lieberman got one last chance for America to remember him as not-an-asshole.  The whole thing was drawn out over months.  But by the end there was a widespread popular consensus in support of the move, plus a cornucopia of bigoted GOP anti-gay soundbites to play in the run up to the 2012 election.  He did the same thing with DOMA, two years later.  By the end of it all, we had a headline a week talking about John Boehner's clown-car of a legal team pleading in front of the SCOTUS to uphold bigotry because gays were icky.

Obama is going to sit back and let every idiot conservative willing to jam foot into mouth get him or herself on record stating how much they hate marijuana.  He's going to milk this for all its worth.  Just wait and see.","1391213138"

And despite avoiding a lot of JRPG annoyances they still wedged in a plot point where [the main character dies but gets revived because friends](/spoiler). Also, the Monado was an overused rescue device that worked exactly like the ""Shark repellent spray"" from 1960s Batman with Adam West.

"ArtisanVideos","t5_2sbd9","Ooh, several questions come to mind!

1) They only used one ""whatsit"" tool to space the clapboard, and seemed to judge the board angle by jamming it up against the board on the other side.  How do they prevent the board from being slightly tilted with only one spacer?  Don't small errors add up when you move across the whole side of a building?  (What if the side of the previous board is not exactly vertical, for example?)

2) Where could I find some pictures of 18th century houses with clapboards changing size as they move up, as mentioned in the video?

3) ""It's only a little sawdust.""  Maybe in 1743, but what kind of precautions do you have to take for more recent older houses that have asbestos, lead paint, arsenic green, etc. in them?  And are there any such hazards in 1743 houses originally?  (Not counting remodels.)","1391213140"

I wouldn't be so sure about it. From everything I have read and heard  Colorado doesn't want there to be to many places that can sell to the general public. I wouldn't be surprised if they limit the weed license (for lack of a better term) in the same way liquor licenses are limited. 

&gt; Also, I think the taxes are insanely high, so in the future you'll probably see what people do now with tobacco: Buy them in Virginia and smuggle them into New York City, making millions of dollars on the tax difference per truckload.

I'm sure that is a very real possibility, but I don't think it would stop legalization. And once it is legal, the authorities can address that problem with the same energy they are using towards the weed portion of the drug war. 

Finally, the I think that the amount of money most state and municipal  governments are short right now will cause some outside of the box thinking, leading to legalization becoming a more realistic outcome.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","This is the whole point of the post, If they are of the same skill level, why are they not in the same tier? League tier is supposed to be representative of your MMR, especially when rewards are being handed out because of it. If my tier is Silver 5, yet my MMR is matching me against Gold 3/4 players, I shouldn't have to play so many games at 50% win rate to slowly get into Gold. 

Lets assume you get 30 LP for a win, and 15 for a loss. @ 50% win rate, this means you must play (500/15)*2 ~= 75 games to get the amount of LP required to get promoted from Silver 5 to Gold 5. Keep in mind, you still have to win your promo series. Lets assume you win them all, and go 2-1 and 3-2 in every promo series (close to 50% as possible). This means you have to play 92 games, to get promoted from Silver 5 to Gold 5. To make things easier, let's assume you need 100 games to do so.

Just to put this in perspective, if someone has time for 2 ranked games per night, every night, it would take them almost 2 months to achieve this. 2 months of playing at the same skill level. That's ridiculous, and after a week or two of proving that I can consistently play as a higher rank, I'd get quite frustrated that I'm still being branded as a lesser player.","1391213141"

Have you considered that your view of the 'failed' socialist states is one with the benefit of hindsight and that you're living through/inside a capitalist system so lack that same outside vision. 

In 50 years time perhaps capitalism will have fallen over and another system altogether will be emerging, the capitalism of today is very different to what was first discribed as capitalism, it's evolved and will continue to evolve. 

Also the controls placed on a capitalist system by governmemt tend to be in place to protect the population, this action is inherently socialist (although maybe not in a classic dictionary sense), so the capitalist system you describe as not perfect is very very far from a full capitism and much more socialist than you maybe realise.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","First, there is a fundamental difference between enforcing discrimination on your own population and enforcing it abroad.  You dismiss this without any real argument.  However, domestic governmental affairs are imbued with the implicit responsibility to care for all citizens.  There is a difference between treating your own citizens badly and treating those of foreign nations (something which may not be morally right, but is not nearly as uncommon in modern human history).  Governments have duty to confer and protect the rights of their citizens, they have no such duty to foreigners.  The South African government not only violated moral imperatives, it violated the fundamental purpose of government itself when it failed its own black citizens.  Israel might rightly be accused of maltreatment of foreigners, but it is not doing so to its own citizens.  

Second, the current state of affairs and ""apartheid"" is largely attributed to the blockade, the wall, etc..  These actions have a plausible ""self-defense"" justification, of which Apartheid never had.  Whether that ""self-defense"" argument is correct or not, is not something I'm certain of myself, but I am certain Hamas. Hezbollah and the Intifadas have not helped.

Third, I do not believe the position of many Palestinians groups is sustainable in that they often profess their goal is a Palestinian territory free of Jews.  Many with either the stated, or implicit goal that this Palestinian state comprise the entirety of Israel.  So it is difficult for me to sympathize with a group of people who have stated goal to do something just as bad, or worse, to their ""opponents.""

Lastly, that definition of ""apartheid"" is overly broad and can be applied in so many situations.  Is the official repression of women in the Muslim world ""apartheid""?  Ainu in Japan?  Tibetans?  Chinese Muslims?  Chinese Indonesians?  ","1391213146"

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","I think that a lot of the things you say are true and if you are *just* going after 18 year olds etc when you're 26 then that's weird. But in my experience a lot the way people meet each other for relationships comes from who they are around/the social setting and whether they're compatible, I'm not sure that age comes into it that often. Also in a lot of the hooking up/pulling situations people aren't all that serious and are just thinking 'am I attracted/will I have a good time with this person + do they want to hook up/pull'. I'm not so sure that age is a definite marker between personalities and interests and that if somebody pulls/goes out with younger/older people it means that they can't get people of their own age or that they are a looser, obviously yours has been different. I used to hate all my girl friends going out and getting off with older guys the whole time (one of the most common reasons they said was that older guys are better at sex), but I guess I was kind of jealous and liked it when it happened to me. 

I know people who had relationships that are far outside the half+7 range that seem happy and fulfilling, one girl at college (US highschool age) started going out with a 27 year old when she was 17, they are still together and seem really happy.","1391213146"

You can't. Stop trying to do that. It's impossible. What you do is very simple. You just return to the breathing whenever you notice you have become distracted. The point is NOT to stop being distracted. The point is to return from the distractions, over and over. 

If you try to stop yourself from becoming distracted, you will go insane. Because trying to do something that is impossible, will make you go crazy. Stop trying to do the impossible, then meditation will become very easy. :)

**Trading Items.** Your title must appear like this: [H] Item or items you have [W] Item or items wanted

The full details of the trade are not required to be in the title, but if not they must be in the description. However, you must say what you are willing to accept as an offer in your title. For example, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers"" is inappropriate. However, ""[H] Sandman [W] Offers in Metal/Keys/Promos"" is acceptable as long as a specific price is listed in the trade description.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

**Other types of appropriate titles.** You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts.

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of great community importance.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited).
5. [Contest] - If you are holding a contest to give away free things.
6. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

**Tag Formatting.** The tag used must start the post title, and some text after the tag is required. Extraneous text within tag brackets will cause the post to be removed. For trade posts, [H] must start the title (come before [W]).

I got in early.  First it was local, then it was MP with a friend, then it was a VPS server we purchased.  We built and contrived and worked amazingly well together, over and over we restarted.  But I hit a wall, like you did, and I haven't played it in ages.  To give you reference, I believe the last new thing they added when last I played was the sticky piston.

I tried to play again, recently, and I had NO IDEA what the hell was going on.  There were new gem types, new monsters, crazy biomes I didn't recognize, the full nine.

So that was a much better problem to have than utter boredom, but I think if I had to do it all over again, while I would still keep away, I would keep an eye on development.  Maybe mull over new additions, and what I would do with them, while I wasn't playing.  Probably get together one huge, ridiculous idea that would take months to make, and come back with a plan.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Both times.

First girl, she was wonderful. Sexy, super intelligent, caring, and an absolutely amazing lay. But, she was my first, and I was young. I figured I was being naive getting so interested in my first girlfriend at such a young age, that I was missing out on sleeping around, playing the field, all that jazz. At this point in time I had a habit of not trusting my emotions so despite being in love and immediately regretting my decision, I ended it and forced myself to stick to my decision. We spent some time with little contact but we're actually very close friends nowadays.

Second girl, she was also great. Intelligent, an absolutely sweetheart, and this really sexy ethnic mix (half Pakistani and half Indian). I ended it because one night when I was drunk as hell and she was sober while we were fucking, she kept quietly saying she loves me, in a way that I could tell was obviously trying to get me to say it back. In the morning I felt terrible - I had no romantic feelings for her (I was emotionally unavailable), and she was falling head over heels for me. Felt like shit, but I had to end it before she became even more attached. We remained friends though.

In both cases the women were absolutely wonderful girlfriends and if I were an emotionally mature adult we probably would have still been together today. But alas, I am still young and have some growing up to and it is for that reason that I have remained single for the past three years.","1391213156"

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","There are lots of things you can do to make and distribute a feature for 15K and you’ll notice from the comments already posted that the majority of them refer to pre-production.  There is no limit to what can be said for a long and thorough pre-pro. Rushing into filming is what I have found to be the downfall of most low/no budget filmmakers.  

Many people, who love making films, don’t love pre-pro.  It’s boring or tedious or whatever.  It’s dealing with meetings and location scouting and casting and depending if you have a producer (and if they are any good) contracts and logistics and scheduling.  They want to get to the filming (which is why we do this really).

Since you’re still in the writing phase you can help yourself out by examining your re-writes with an eye on cost versus contribution to the story.  In the end the story has to be king, but every location, vehicle, story driven prop or piece of clothing has to be acquired in some fashion (even if you are planning on begging/ borrowing the majority of the movie) chances are that someone will need reimbursement.  If you can’t tell the story without it, it’s in the budget, if not then you know where you can make a cut if needed. 

While I’m on the subject of art department, this is one of the areas that filmmakers first staring out make HUGE mistakes that they only realize in post.  Hire a Production Designer!  I see so many young/ student films shot in rooms with blank walls or just a hodgepodge mess.  It’s human nature to get swept up by all of the cool camera gear and latest gadgets, but in the end these don’t add as much value to your project as a space that is designed to fit your movie. Of course this is coming from someone who works primarily as a Director of Photography, I can frame a perfect shot, with gorgeous lighting and a drop-dead bokeh, but in the end there is no fix to blank walls, cheap props, and just wrong costumes.  Moral of this part of the story is: put as much of your money in front of the lens as you can get away with.  

The rest of what I can suggest is,

-Start off with some padding or unallocated funds.  It won’t last but there are always last minute surprises and money, even if it is not much, that helps fix problems.

-Plan on feeding your crew.  I’m still surprised when I come across directors who are asking people to work 12ish hours for mostly just gratitude who haven’t thought about at least providing a meal at some point during the day.  It doesn’t have to be ordering out everyday also (cause that will break budgets).  One of my favorite low budget catering experiences used crock-pots.  Buying groceries is cheaper than ordering out and we had a few people who wanted to help out with the movie who knew how to cook.  It’s really easy to just heat some food up in about a half hour before you’re about to eat. Of course it was winter and a warm stew goodness was just what we wanted, but I think you get my drift.

-Don’t offer differ pay.  You’re just starting out, have no track record of selling anything and frankly it’s just going to be a pain in your ass if it did sell.  Since I can’t pay my rent with deferment then it usually does nothing for me.  Honestly most people are going to work on your movie because this is what they want to do and the only way to get better is to make more.

-Don’t forget the story and directing.  There are so many things going on with a film set that you’d be surprised how many times I’ve heard from directors that they wished they had directed more. It’s really easy to get pulled into the minutia on the day of - props and costumes and where can we park crew cars and where’s that weird sound coming from and the space that said we could shoot here for 4 hours just told us to get out in 2 and I think the lead actress is allergic to the cats that live in this house.  When you can pass dealing with it off, go direct. It’s a good reason to have a producer, a 1st AD, and someone covering all departments. ","1391213159"

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","&gt; Edit: May I ask why you would suggest putting a future bonsai tree ""in the ground""?

This is common advice that you'll get from pretty much all bonsai experts given to all bonsai newbies. 

The reason is that you need to thicken the trunk before you can miniaturize the tree. When grown in a pot, the growth is so restricted that you may *never* reach the ideal height-to-trunk ratio. Never's a long time. 

Once the tree has grown sufficiently (while being in the ground, unrestricted), then you can start miniaturizing it in a pot.

It's not limited to Chicago.

But even then, I've more-often heard it as part of an idiomatic phrase, like ""Ya sure, you betcha!"" than as a drop-in equivalent for ""you"" or ""your.""

"arcadefire","t5_2s5d2","Half Lights with suburban war tacked on is my favorite. I listen to The Suburbs daily and I still gets me all fired up. I think Suburbs is their pinnacle achievement. Reflector is very good but Suburbs hits a note with me. I relate to every song and I swear that everyday I hear that album I glean something new from it. The highlight of the whole thing is the soft Half Light 1, the riotous Half Light II, finished with the most epic of all their songs, Suburban War, which describes my youth in the suburbs to a T. 

Neighborhoods is an almost tied, but still, second place. I had listened to the album a few times but one night I was at my in laws and we smoked a little weed. On the way home my wife was driving (I can't drive high). I put on Funeral and the opening of Tunnels hit me like a fucking jackhammer. It was like I was in heaven and the angles were sing to me. I absolutely fell in love with AF at that moment. 

Here Comes The Night Time. I love this song and set and I'll explain some of the reason why. I have a crazy new earth christian friend. The day after I got Reflector she came by and I had it playing. At that point I had no idea what any of the lyrics were or what they meant. When Here Comes The Night Time came on I told her how they were highly influenced by Haitian culture. I figured she would like it because she did missionary work in Haiti and its where she met he fiance, son of a preacher.

Maybe a month later I realized what HCTNT was actually about. I hope she listened to it and got offended but I also feel a little strange telling my friend she will enjoy an album that speaks very poorly of the things she cares about.  (For the record I agree 100% with Win).


Sprawls are awesome. I love the image of shopping malls like mountains beyond mountains. I was brought up by a mother who fights actively against sprawl in her community, so I am slightly biased.

"movies","t5_2qh3s"," (TL:DR) You just have to go back and look at David Goyer's filmography to find that any success he's had as a writer has been purely based on luck and the quality of the people working with him. 

I haven't seen any of his films before Blade so let's start there: 

Blade: Really only good because of the director, Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson, and the general gritty feeling it had.

Blade 2: I'm not a fan of this one, I thought it was too cheesy and the super-vampires were hacky, but a lot of people defend this one. 

Blade: Trinity: I can't think of many people who defend this one, and he also directed it.

Batman Begins: I will give that without David Goyer to talk Nolan into using more comic-booky elements (Scarecrow's mask for example) it wouldn't have been as good of a 'Batman' film, but there's definitely still some cheese in the dialogue. Of course, because of Nolan and Bale this is definitely largely a successful film.

Threshold: Just a shitty shitty TV show that he Executive Produced.

The Dark Knight: He only worked on the story on this one, so you could hardly attribute it's success to him.

The Unborn: A crappy horror film who's only saving grace is a hot Megan Fox look-a-like.

The Dark Knight Rises: Again, he just helped massage the story, and had even less of a role at that.

Man of Steel: This screenplay is just a mess. A movie that was visually stunning, mostly competently acted and directed was completely screwed by the shitty shitty dialogue and bizarre bizarre story.

But you know, just my opinion. ","1391213162"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","But it does have a monetary value even if you dont pay for it. I wouldn't download Justin Beiber's album even if it was free, there is no monitary cost to it I would pay. Just because something is more expencive than you would pay for it doesn't mean others who would otherwise have bought it wouldn't had paid for it had it not been easily available for download free. That was the point, if there are no consiquences then people who have an opportunity to download it free will do so and thus a sale is lost. If you share a song (even if you hate it and wouldn't pay a penny for it) there is still now opportunity for some one else to not purchase it. Its short sided to say sharing files wouldn't cost a sale. It's not a one to one equation but certainly cost a few album sales.

""I dislike Toyotas, I create copied keys and leave them outside the dealership. I wouldn't ever buy a toyoda so its not actually hurting the car dealership"" the argument is thin and I can see your point, I was a file sharing teen when the Napster shit went down.

I didn't want to see the same guy, on the same team, win again and again and again. **No one likes the Yankees.** Then after that, it just seemed like Kobe teamed up with Phil and Shaq and did the same damn thing. I didn't want to see Kobe win again, and again, and again. I was the definition of a casual fan, so I just didn't care. ""MJ gonna win. Kobe gonna win."" But what, aside from salary cap, can you really do to stop to a dominant player or two from shitting on the league time and again? And does that make the overall product of the league worse?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;How so? Sub-saharan Africa is connected to Europe and Asia and their involvement in trade had a relatively minor impact throughout written history.

The Transatlantic Slave trade (Triangular Trade) doesn't ring a bell?  What would the world be today had Africa and large areas of the middle east were not there or known about for exploitation?

&gt;Yeah walking for 15.000+ KM with a paltry amount of goods sounds feasible.... There is a reason the silk road was phased out with the advent of Europe opening up sea routes around Africa.

I'll agree with you sailing would be much more effecient in a sense.  But this also negates the fact the world is a Pangeaic continent and for all intents and purposes sailing around the continent would take a lot lot longer rather the people of this hypothetical land creating an innovated land based supplement to transit outside of sailing.

&gt;There are more massively distinct languages/cultures/ethnicities in Africa/Europe and Asia even though they are connected by land then in north/south america.

I think the closer proximity would equate to more of a tribalism and local identity.  That being I agree that it doesn't necessarily follow that a landlocked world would equate to less variation of culture, language, and human differences.

&gt;We would have shittier naval knowledge.

I think this is more than just ""possibly"".  The oceans and water ways on the world when human development expanded proposed a barrier we had to overcome.  Without it, there is no reason to invest in the knowledge.

&gt;Faster trains, more stations. Fewer airports.

Because developing the train infrastructure would have a longer lasting effect on a land locked continent versus ones that are separated by massive oceans.

&gt;Also there really isn't all that much cultural hegemony between Asia, Africa and Europe even if they are connected by land

I'd argue that those countries and the people of those countries probably know more about one another tahn say, America and Asia or Africa and America.","1391213167"

This FR was really rough around the edges. Here's some things to think about:

1) Bringing up other guy she's dating. By bringing him up it shows you consider them a threat. In this situation (you are targeting her, other possible men in play and you're not close to any of them) it's on her to bring it up.

2) Improper Kino and escalation - look up Vin DiCarlos Escalation Ladder. You covered shoulders, waist, and etc. There's other parts of her body that you can kino to gauge if she's ready for a kiss. Hips, Legs, small of the back, holding hands even. Play with it, don't linger in any one spot too long. Read her reactions and body language to know where you stand.

3) Being roundabout in telling her your intentions - I'm not a real fan of putting emotions out there verbally - Just too big set up for a LJBF. Escalating kino should make it natural to her on what's going on.

That said, it's good to be bold, and it's good that you kept it light and fun after. If she brings it up, laugh at the incident and use the opportunity to be flirty. ""Sorry sweetie, train left the station."" Sell it in a way so that you weren't overly hurt by her rejection, and now she has to chase you to get that second chance.","1391213175"

 [**Reserve army of labour**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve%20army%20of%20labour): 

---

&gt;**Reserve army of labour** is a concept in [Karl Marx](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Marx)'s critique of [political economy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_economy). It refers to the [unemployed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployed) and [under-employed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under-employed) in capitalist society. It is synonymous with ""industrial reserve army"" or ""relative surplus population"", except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work. The use of the word ""army"" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a [hierarchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchy), under the command or authority of the owners of [capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_(economics\)).

Waiting for test results can be one of the hardest parts. Time slows down. It's okay to think a little about various scenarios and what you might do, because then you feel more prepared. But an important lesson I learned is that worrying excessively can't help anything. Instead, you can use this situation as a reminder to enjoy life as much as possible.

I agree with previous poster. Get a copy of the judgment. The judgment should be recorded with the County Clerk's Office. Sounds like the New York County Clerk is where it's recorded. Go to their website or call them and find out how to get a copy of the judgment. Then call up whoever is listed on there and see if you work out a way to settle it.

The majority people torrent games because they don't have the money or because they want to..or both. In other words, unless DRM suddenly became 100% effective at preventing pirating, the proportion of gamers who torrent instead of pay would remain unchanged, whether or not a title was drm free.  

Concerning DRM: While there have been some seriously questionable implementations of DRM, like the always on internet scheme, DRM is a completely understandable measure. It's not simply there to prevent piracy and copying. It's there to enforce conditions that you agree to when you purchase the license to use the product...because in the end you're not just buying a disk and manual, but a license as well. DRM is there to prevent shit like you (a lawful paying customer) lending your copy to all of your friends so they can play the game and not have to pay for it...which btw is an infringement of most license agreements.

He's a propagandist who falls into the trap of blindly believing all macro-numbers without any real analysis of data quality or more intangible indexes of standard of life which many would argue have been decreasing a lot. When I first watched this talk, I was similarly fairly impressed. Then I started reading a lot of the criticizes on it. Bill Bishop's news letter had some really active discussion about it. If you've spent a lot of time in China and know how the average person is doing, you'd know about half of this is bullshit.

Overall what I took away is: a direct western style democracy is not the only solution and a golden ticket to developmental paradise.

"technology","t5_2qh16","It's not ridiculous in most ways. I know Reddit loves unions (I like them too!), but there are a lot of fair criticisms to heap upon them. The chief of which is that the union leadership of today is nothing like the union leadership that built strong unions in the past. Most of them are very far removed from their union base, inherently conservative, and actively sought to prevent reform while preserving conditions favorable to the workers already in the union.

Auto collecting union dues is considered a reason why this occurred. No more being out there and making a case for it. The biggest reason these right to work states are not unionized is because the unions, by and large, gave no fucks about these areas for ~70 years. Just like they were resistant to women, resistant to leftist ideology, resistant to various immigrant groups, elitist in skilled vs unskilled labor, and so on.

In one of the most famous anti-union efforts, Ronald Reagan replaced the skilled work force of air traffic controllers. The union, along with other skilled unions, had actually supported Reagan! When they went after the CIO for ""communism"" the skilled unions were more than happy to enjoy the downfall of primarily working class unions like miners. The AFL was famous for partnering with management, getting cozy, and seeing themselves as better and above the working class.

Its no wonder people eventually turned on unions. The unions themselves participated. Right to work isn't the issue as much as people make it seem. Ineptness, corruption, complacency, and divisiveness caused most of the problems and made all of labor much weaker as management, with the aid of government, slowly chipped away at their power.","1391213191"

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","I just found out a month ago that I have hypothyroidism as well. I'm on Cytomel (at only 25ug) because it tends to have more of an anti-depressant effect than Synthroid. I started on three medications at the same time so it's hard to know what's what, but I do feel more energetic (I can get up in the morning and not feel hungover!) and much less sensitive to cold (today's 30F weather actually felt good to me, and I've always been one to be really cold all the time). I hadn't had weight gain probably because I wasn't eating much, but now I'm losing weight even while sometimes eating more than I did before. Again, I'm on a small dose and also on meds for anxiety and depression so I can't tell what's from the Cytomel, but I'm really happy with how I've been feeling. Anxiety hasn't changed at all yet, though.

Do keep in mind that a lot of side effects will go away pretty quickly. I had a bunch of side effects at first from all my meds, but I have almost none now. Obviously I can't tell you what you'll get or how bad it will be--that's what doctors are for--but I can't imagine you'll experience anything too bad.

No seafood, no spicy food :(

It's been interesting having my parents in law to stay. They have settled in to st Kilda reasonably well. They've become regulars down in monarch cakes and iddy biddy. They go to the beach every day, they sure like routine and the familiar.

I have made some observations of them over the past weeks, moreover, I have made observations about the elderly in general. 

Old people are fussy eaters. It's difficult keeping them entertained. They get cranky when they're tired. They have tantrums if they don't get what they want. They need to keep to a tight routine or they get upset. They are always too hot or too cold. They go to the toilet a lot. Holy shit, my parents in law are toddlers!!

it must be so hard to be in front of people all day and not be able to just go into another room or go to the bathroom. my IBS actually has shaped a lot of my life choices for this reason. i missed out on international trips because of fears of being trapped in close quarters with people, or having horrible symptoms in a strange environment. i'm in heaven when i'm in a place that's noisy... so of course i work in a dead silent office! i can only manage it because i barely eat at work and i'm so over it i can't even feel that mortified anymore when my stomach starts complaining.

the only thing that sort of makes me feel better re: this is that no out there escapes shitty medical issues. and not to minimize what we go through but i don't feel as bad when i am reminded of people who have cancer or who are starving, blah blah, but it still fucking sucks completely. i see people eating what they want, having no GI distress, as if it's totally normal... it stupefies me. that is my idea of heaven and they have NO idea how lucky they are.

i want to tell you about this tea in case you haven't tried it before - http://www.gaiaherbs.com/products/detail/711/Gas-Bloating-Tea it contains fennel - maybe w/ the additional ingredients it would still help your symptoms. i have those charcoal tabs too, i just get annoyed you have to take two with every meal... but if it works i suppose i should start that again.

what about your diet? ever tried fodmaps? everything i've read on gas points the finger at carbs. i've gotten so fed up at times i've really thought of cutting out all carbs or getting as close to it as possible, but i know that is not healthy. so then i get fed up that i'm so limited with food and have this stupid disease and then i go all out and eat things bad for me, etc.

thank you SO MUCH for your reply. it means a lot. i think you're great and wish i knew someone like you IRL. people without IBS can't possibly understand what it's like. hang in there. if you ever want to talk more you can always PM me. :)","1391213209"

"genderqueer","t5_2r1c3","Thanks for your responses. Rereading my post makes it seem like I'm confusing gender and sexuality (and perhaps I am a bit). What I mean when I talk about wanting someone who is ""physically and emotionally a woman"" is that I'm generally talking about people who in that ""other"" part of the spectrum but is more towards the cis rather than the trans end of that spectrum. I am probably a bit .in this category myself (slightly ""other"" gender wise but hetero sexuality wise). 

As to the  ""just hit on them respectfully"" point. I am  aware that this is really more of a general  shyness/socialization issue rather than a gender issue. Thank you for making me remember that.

What it really comes down to is that my ""androgynal other half"" would be someone who describes as ""mostly a woman but not quite"" as I basically self describe as ""mostly a man but not quite.""  

Or, more accurately, ""meeting the right person ain't easy"" :)

Thank you for your support and advice.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","My comment itself may have sounded like I was singing Kickstarter's praises specifically, but that's simply the most recent examples I can think of off the top of my head. That's mainly why I mentioned devs like CDPR. Another poster here talked about indie games specifically. That seems like a fine solution as well. 

I get the feeling people are looking to find games of a massive scope they've seen from the PS2 era and beyond, yet I specifically recall loving titles that are far, far shorter than those offered by the average indie title today. The idea that somehow titles today have been reduced to the return of investment for some corporate entity versus some magical time from years past where developers made them for fun is silly as well. 

Again, I'm not about holding on to some illusion that the industry was some magical place made for fun for the player and developer alike, but then again I wasn't nearly as young as some people here so I think that's part of the issue as well. I specifically remember getting massive adverts thrown at me on the regular through magazines. Enthusiast press back then as much as they felt like they loved the industry also felt like they were firmly in the pockets of the industry. Somehow I think that's lost on people who may have simply been too young to realize. 

That's not to say that things aren't more corporate of course, the industry has grown, and like any growing industry... if there's money to be made, people will root it out aggressively. ","1391213211"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Remember, matchmaking takes the average of 5 players on each team and creates singular value that's approximately the same. You should always be playing with/against people who are similar to your skill level, or duo queue players that boasts a better player and a worse player (which is probably what's happening with that gold 3 player, odds are he was duoing with a low silver/bronze player). 

*Gold 3 player can have MMR ranging from Gold 4 to Gold 2, depending on their recent performance (guesstimate).* Because the system tweaks your MMR ^carefully after each match (because it's trying to accurately predict where you truly belong), it is entirely possible for you to have a much lower MMR than your current division/tier after a big losing streak.

The point is, once again, the two teams playing each other should always been similar in skill level across the whole (determined by the system). The fundamental problem people have with the ladder system is similar to the problem of algorithmically determine the true value of something. It takes a large sample size and continuous tweaking.

I'm assuming the plan is to cut a hole in the bottom to fit in the inhaler and breathe through the bottle mouth. It is likely that you will lose some of the dose as it collides with the increasing slope of the plastic as it converges on the mouth. Additionally, you would need to have an idea of the fluid dynamics involved with the air entering the bottle from the inhaler side. You would need to cut additional holes to allow you to pull enough air so that the bottle doesn't collapse when you breath in, and these additional air streams should not violently interact, as this would result in additional loss of drug. There is more engineering than you'd expect in spacers. 

If you are unable to buy a spacer, I'd recommend working on improving your delivery technique (if this is what you are trying to improve by using a spacer). This will be much more useful in the long run than a home made spacer. ","1391213220"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Do you know anybody, even yourself, that can say that they've never been attracted to the same sex?

I can honestly say I haven't yet.  And believe me, it wasn't for lack of trying...  I actually run in a lot of gay circles, I've lived with gay guys, go to gay clubs more than straight, and a lot of my friends are gay.  I always figured I'd eventually come across someone that I was attracted to, but it just hasn't happened.  I'm certainly open to it if it does, but not yet at least.  (And I've talked to other people in the same boat, so I don't think it's quite as cut and dry as you think.)

Regardless though, I think this observation is what leads to the claim that ""everyone is actually bi"", because a lot of people understand it as two exclusive positions with a ""both"" in the middle.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","According to Moses Finley, *Economy and Society in Ancient Greece*, which is admittedly dated, the simple reason was that the social and economic structure of most of Greece did not mirror the conditions during the Roman slave revolts. The Greeks, barring the Spartans, which as quantumhovercraft mentioned are a unique circumstance, did not suffer as complete or systematic a breakdown and lack of oversight as during the Roman slave revolts. Similarly, again barring the helots, Greek slaves were largely heterogeneous, increasing the difficulty of organization. Finally, and this should be a very minor point, Greek slaves were rarely initiated in any system comparable to the Roman gladiatorial schools (again barring helots...).

Finley also notes that slave revolts are uniformly uncommon. Even in the American south, slave revolts were rare, at least of such a substantial size as to be worth noting.

I recognize that it is an unsatisfactory answer, but largely the Roman slave revolts took place within a unique set of circumstances in the Late Republic, in which slaves were likely left under-attended, and military and political attention was largely diverted elsewhere.

Note that I am not terribly versed on the subject, and am largely following Finley. I'm sure there are some ancient slavery experts with more recent scholarship around.","1391213221"

On my cards something called vrm temperature get above 110 Celcius. When that happens the cards throttle down to 60% load until the temperature goes down. All in all this leads to the average hashrate being about 1100-1200 KHs, while on full load 100% of the time it would be about 1390 KHs.

I've solved this by removing the side cover on my case and having a table fan constantly blow at the cards. It can be quite noisy, but if you're not in the same room it doesn't matter. I'm pretty much either at work or sleeping these days, so it doesn't matter to me if it's a bit noisy in my livingroom.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Right. P2P works for good games. I didn't mention WoW because everybody knows it's a big success. Ronald Reagan epitomized the resurgence of conservatism in the 1980's. World of Warcraft epitomizes the MMO genre after 2004. Kapeesh. Everybody and their mother knows someone who has at least tried World of Warcraft. 

Elder Scrolls Online doesn't look up to snuff when it comes to content or gameplay. There's not enough of content, and the gameplay mechanics are really weak. I don't think this game is going to make it as it stands. Especially since the high gate of entry will make it so that some prospective players will already have to rethink buying the game before reading reviews. And if those reviews are bad, then even less people are going to get started. For those who do get involved early or decide to pre-order, if the game doesn't blow them away, they are likely going to leave within the first 6 months. And they are going to have a 60-100 dollar paperweight on their desk. I'm not sure what Zenimax is doing. All I can say is that smart is the opposite of it.

Why? How does it not come closer than 4 tiers over 4 months? It's because I can't play as often and the system favors people that aren't necessarily more skilled, just that can spam games. 

Basically, over time MMR and Division should end up right around the same. Within a tier. Yet, for people that can't play many games, it takes months to years to accomplish this. All I'm saying is that it shouldn't take THAT long. It's fine to take time and require awhile to get there. But the fact that I can't reach Silver 3 after 3 months, even with Silver 1 MMR is an issue to me. Something isn't working properly and needs to be tweaked.

The maxed out iMac will have slightly less CPU performance, and significantly less GPU performance and connectivity than a mac pro. 

Simply put, if you want a faster system that you can connect lots of thunderbolt and usb 3.0 devices to, mac pro. If you want a slightly slower all in one system that misses out on more of the pro features, iMac. 

The Mac Pro also has ECC ram, workstation GPUs that some software will prefer (or require), and is easier for the end user to change out parts themselves. Though I personally think the new design is counter intuitive (once I hook up a decent RAID it's literally doubled in size), it does offer a professional level of power.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","&gt;i feel like there's a fundamental contradiction here. if you oppose it on a purely moral ground (ie, fetus = alive, abortion = murder, murder = wrong) it shouldn't matter in case of rape that one party didn't make the decision.

- The entire argument is about rights and in cases of rape, the person's who has been hurt/traumatized is given the right to mitigate their assault. 

- - I would ask you in response, what do you think the cut off for abortions should be? What month or trimester? Why? Do you think late term abortions should be allowed?

&gt;are you talking about monetary support? the woman would have to provide that support if the man was raising the child, this is completely symmetrical requirement that has nothing to do with gender or abortion.

- The point being that we do hold people responsible for having sex and the consequences. Both society and the law/government accept that and everyone believes it is fine. So saying people shouldn't be held responsible at all doesn't make sense. 


&gt;your responsibility is to attempt to prevent it and if it still happens deal with it responsibly. not have your life ruined over something ""you had no control over"" (read next paragraph for what i mean by 'no control')

- Whatever you may mean by no control, that isn't the case. You absolutely do have control and that is why society expects you to be responsible.


&gt;when you go outside there's a possibility you'll get robbed, assaulted, or run over by a car. you cant really tell those people it's their fault fault/responsibility and they should have never left their house. you can hedge your bets by practicing abstinence when there's an obvious health risk similarly to not walking around in bad neighborhood at night, but you can't stay home your whole life. to me sex is a basic human need, it will happen and people will have sex no matter how much someone may preach abstinence, this is why abstinence isnt an option and why getting accidentally pregnant isnt necessarily your fault

- There's a pretty big difference between something that is done entirely by somebody else to you such as being robbed or shot etc. and something you choose to actively engage in, knowing the risks of said activity.

- The fact that you choose to actively engage in it is why you assume the risks associated with the activity so your analogy makes no sense in this context.

- Your analogy would be rape in the context of sexual activity, not consensual sex.


&gt;i didnt say most, i said many. you can't argue that there are cases of self-inflicted abortions resulting in complications and/or dumpster babies. quick uncited fact ""Prior to Roe v. Wade, as many as 5,000 American women died annually as a direct result of unsafe abortions"". 

- The funny thing about people who throw a child in a dumpster or something similar is that abortion is already an option for them and these people still do it often because they are mentally impaired in some way. They carried a child to term and gave birth, so they already chose not to have an abortion. If anything that runs counter to your point because despite abortion being available, people like that choose not to use it.

- Bodily autonomy is already restricted. You can't inject yourself with hard drugs like heroin or cocaine, you can't commit suicide (you would be committed) etc. My point being just because something is illegal and people do it at greater risk, doesn't mean we make it legal.  

- I don't see abortion rights advocates advocating that people be allowed to use hard drugs because it is their body to do with as they please. I think that is a hypocritical failing on the part of abortion rights advocates. Their argument can't be expanded to cover other areas because by and large, they don't support bodily autonomy in those other circumstances. 

&gt;this shit happens and in my mind if de-stigmatized abortions reduced that even by one, it'd be a good thing.

- Abortions are legal but there is still a lot of stigma attached. 

- - I'd like to ask you another question as well here. What do you think about pregnant woman and alcohol/drug usage? Do you think it should be illegal or otherwise regulated etc? Or do you feel a woman should have full control of whatever she wants to do?","1391213236"

In our world of SC2, ""team support"" is widely considered to simply be flights and hotels to events, and maybe a salary if you're lucky. As badly as greater support is needed, the infrastructure simply isn't there, and teams that actually do have the financial resources to do so show no interest. 

Player contracts in SC2 aren't considered assets or investments as much as they are in sports. To use your example, if a pro hockey team signs a player, the team invests a TON of money, time, and resources developing that player into the best he can be, because it is in the team's best interest to do so. That doesn't exist in eSports in general.

We need a professional players union.

I don't know if there are any clear answers here but after watching last week's episode of BBC's science program Horizon which, using a month long n=2 experiment, concluded that low-carb diets were detrimental to cognition, I ate a couple of high-carb meals before I went to class yesterday to see if it would make any difference.  I noticed a bit more energy (as well as anxiety) which did seem to help a bit with my programming lab as far as working through a problem and writing code but it also seemed to be more difficult than usual dealing with frustration as well as paying attention in lecture.

This is all completely anecdotal obviously but I think I may go back to low-carb for the majority of my time but I may experiment with using glucose as fuel whenever I need to do major studying or work on large assignments as it did seem to make me feel like I was performing slightly better even if there were trade-offs.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I think it has a lot to do with the case, but generally speaking, here's my theory:  practicing engineers are usually presented with the ""solution"" before the problem, be it customer specifications or interface requirements etc.  You need to come up with something that does x,y,z.  There is a vast amount of information in the world, and you must distill all the noise down to a solution that makes sense.  You go into a court room, each side wants you to take their word on each and every point, to use their power of persuasion to change or influence your solution.  But the problem with engineers (and especially good engineers), is that they will pick out only what is relevant and discard the noise, regardless if some source tells you it's important.  So either side gets up there and tries to spin some BS, it's not gonna fly without a reason and some real solid backing, regardless of how well it's presented.  They want to convince you of something, but if you only think in terms of concepts, facts, experimental data and results, they might as well just hand you a fact sheet and leave, they, with all their power of persuasion, is useless.","1391213246"

 [**Boltzmann brain**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann%20brain): 

---

&gt;

&gt;A **Boltzmann brain** is a [hypothesized](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) [self aware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_aware) entity which arises due to random fluctuations out of a state of chaos. The idea is named for the physicist [Ludwig Boltzmann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Boltzmann) (1844–1906), who advanced an idea that the known universe arose as a random fluctuation in the process of [inflation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology\)), similar to a process through which Boltzmann brains might arise.

&gt;The Boltzmann brains concept is often stated as a [physical paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_paradox). (It has also been called the ""Boltzmann babies paradox"".) The paradox states that if one considers the probability of our current situation as self-aware entities embedded in an organized environment, versus the probability of stand-alone self-aware entities existing in a featureless thermodynamic ""soup"", then the latter should be vastly more probable than the former if both scenarios are to be created out of random fluctuations. The usual resolution of the Boltzmann brain paradox is that we and our environment are the products of a long process of [natural selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection), which can produce [complex and improbable outcomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_biological_complexity) without violating the laws of thermodynamics.

Like others here have said though, there are ways to make it easier if you do have a desire to learn it and want strategies to make that journey less frustrating.

Basic usability is not too tricky. Entering/exiting insert mode, saving, undo/redo, and cursor movement. Once you know that, vim is a usable text editor that is just more clumsy than other text editors (like nano).

The things that I found made vim *really* enjoyable to use, and gave me the drive to master it, was its powerful regex capabilities, and its [windowing capabilities](http://micropipes.com/blog/wp-content/img/vim_cli.png). Once I realized it could do that, I started using it all the time.

Also, it is *amazing* how often regular expressions are useful once you know what they can do.

Also, can you add an option to disable the gradient at the top of the screen?  I don't like it.  Others might, but it would be nice to be able to choose to have it or not.

1) They help recycle CO2 through plate subduction and volcanic releases
2) They help recycle the soil and form new landmass

Many geologists believe that our planet's moving plates were a key factor in the development of life, and continue to be key to the long-term sustainability of life. There are also some geologists who believe that, if the plates stopped moving, the vast majority of habitable land mass would erode into the oceans; causing the sea levels to rise, and essentially creating a water planet.","1391213252"

Unless those figures apply to Ultrafast, or crap-quality hardware encoding, they are simply *off*.

 [**Sport psychology**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sport%20psychology): 

---

&gt;**Sport psychology** is a [interdisciplinary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interdisciplinarity) science that draws on knowledge from the fields of [Kinesiology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinesiology) and [Psychology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology). It involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affect psychological and physical factors. In addition to instruction and training of psychological skills for performance improvement, applied sport psychology may include work with athletes, coaches, and parents regarding injury, rehabilitation, communication, team building, and career transitions.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I never said that...

Nirvana spun a tremendous web of influence. Most bands in the last 20 years were influenced by them on some level; either a direct influence (they listened to and took things from Nirvana) or an indirect influence (they were influenced by bands that were directly influenced by Nirvana). Either way, Nirvana touches everything.

Green Day was a later band in the chain, and not nearly as influential.  But Green Day still spawned a generation of copy-cat bands -- bands who modeled their sound on Green Day, not Nirvana.  Sure, Green Day wouldn't have existed if Nirvana didn't...but that can't be the sole measure of influence, because Nirvana wouldn't have existed if not for their predecessors.

Basically, my argument is this: pop-punk was a major genre in the late 90s and early 2000s, and those bands were majorly influenced by Green Day. Thus Green Day had a pretty big impact on music.  It doesn't matter whether you think Green Day was unoriginal -- it was their songs that legions of 14 year olds were playing on their guitars in the mid-to-late nineties.","1391213256"

"vita","t5_2sjmv","&gt; “There was a 163% uplift in PS Vita sales post PS4 launch,” he says. “A significant number of PS Vita purchasers in the UK indicated that Remote Play was their reason for purchase, and we are subsequently seeing lots of these new PS Vita users connecting to PS4 with this feature.”

Call me crazy, but the 163% might have something to do with Xmas, and calling a number ""significant"" doesn't seem to mean anything.  Even if that ""significant"" value breaks the 51% threshold required for ""majority"", what does that raw number mean when compared against lifetime non-Japan Vita sales?  What if that significant number in that short time period accounts for less than 5% of lifetime non-Japan sales?

&gt; From a sales point of view it should at least easily be able to maintain sales. It’s premature to say by how much it can grow, but that’s not out of the question.

Ugh.  ""It should at least"".  That sounds like a self-destructive statement.  Even ignoring the ""side-gig"" quote, that one clearly makes it sound like they believe there is little chance of a growth in sales.

Please, Mr. Gara, at least sound like you have some confidence in the product you're supposed to be promoting.  We're not asking you to lie and say the Vita was a resounding success, but you could at least not sound like you're desperately clawing for bread crumbs?","1391213257"

Unless I don't use your circular epistemological method (""Bible is true because it says it is.""), in which case such a claim sounds absolutely insane.

And what does being poor have to do with having a sex life? If I were poor and sexually active, I would take the precautions in order to assure I dont have a child that I can not afford. Living in California, you see people who can't afford to take care of themselves have multiple kids because they can then apply for benefits. You'll hear it from their own mouths too! Then you've got my single-mother friends that don't get child support from the father. But when the father does decide to help out, the mother ends up making less than what she was on government aid!

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Since you asked and since this blew up while I was out: 

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with pizza, but frozen pizza is awful. I grew up eating supermarket pizza, mainly fresh but I've had frozen. I didn't eat at Pizza Hut until I was old enough to go myself and as bad as that was, it was so much better than the stuff I'd eaten until then. I haven't been able to go back. Real pizza spoiled me.

Clearly I haven't tested every frozen pizza in the world, so perhaps there's one brand that's cracked the secret but I'm sceptical. In theory, a frozen pizza should be a miracle. A pizza that you could put in your oven and cook right there and then? Who wouldn't want that? Why would anyone order a pizza if they could just get one from the fridge at a fraction of price? Clearly pizza places are still in business all over world which suggests that people would much rather have that even though it's more expensive and less convenient.

My theory is that it's not possible to make dough like you'd find in a fresh pizza add toppings and then chill or freeze the lot, so they make a dough that can, it's just not going to be the same.","1391213260"

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Got in lots of gaming this month. Feel free to ask for more details about any of these.

- **[The Capitals](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119012/the-capitals)**: Played twice in January. This game is immense. Tough decisions each round, lots of variables to ponder, lots of factors to weigh in your mind. Brutal game that can be very punishing. I loved the game but it's definitely not for everyone.
- **[Town Center](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124545/town-center)**: Another city building game but this one is built in 3D. Another fascinating game with really hard decisions.
- **[Tokaido](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/123540/tokaido)**: Beautiful, gorgeous game that isn't all that great with 2 players.
- **[Shadows Over Camelot](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/15062/shadows-over-camelot)**: Pretty tough game when there's a traitor. Not crazy about how the cards are used as it seems a little abstract and doesn't match the theme.
- **[Karesansui](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/139572/karesansui)**: Neat abstract bidding game where the point is to *not* collect sets of rocks.
- **[Asteroyds](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65200/asteroyds)**: Interesting programmed movement game. Sort of like RoboRally but with a constantly changing board.
- **[Zong Shi](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/110286/zong-shi)**: Solid worker placement game with a nice theme. I like how 1 of your workers will be occupied during several turns and how you have to plan around that.
- **[Amerigo](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137408/amerigo)**: Finally got to try out the latest Feld. I like it a lot but I don't think you should play it with 4 players who are all new to the game. Too much AP for that many new players.
- **[EONS](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/137872/eons)**: I found this game to be pretty boring not very interesting. I think there is a much more interesting game that could have been made out of the theme. A big disappointment.
- **[Sushi Go!](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/133473/sushi-go)**: A delightful little card drafting game that actually works with 2 players.
- **[Frank's Zoo](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/340/franks-zoo)**: An interesting ladder game with a rock-paper-scissors mechanic. Neat little game.
- **[Eternal Dynasty](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/143657/eternal-dynasty)**: Very solid area control game that's on Kickstarter right now. Thematically rich with difficult choices every turn.
- **[Rampage](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/97903/rampage)**: It's fun, but I don't think this game is going to have any staying power.

As for the game I'm looking forward to coming out the most, right now it's **[La Isla](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/154246/la-isla)**, the just-announced new Feld game.","1391213261"

* Carlos Dunlap - 5 years $39 million
* Dashon Goldson - 5 years $41 million

Byrd is significantly better than Goldson, and will undoubtedly eclipse his contract. Dunlap is a very similar player to Bennett; Dunlap is younger but also was not not on the open market, so I think their deals will be very comparable. ","1391213261"

Unless you're a freak of nature, the answer to that last question is very likely ""no"", as it would be for the rest of us.  But that's completely okay, because you were just tailoring your code to suit your priorities.  A POC doesn't need to be testable, or maintainable.  That doesn't make the code ""bad"".

Likewise, the worth of any design pattern is dependent on your priorities.  If your design goal is to enforce a single instance of some class globally in your application, then you have several options.  Of these options, the singleton pattern has certain benefits - one of them being a very low barrier of entry, and quick implementation time.  In contrast, maintaining proper dependency injection throughout your entire application's object graph is another option, but is much more involved and will take you much longer to get right.  So - which is ""better""?

It depends on your priorities.

Anyway, I feel like I'm just reiterating the same points here, and you seem to have reverted to childish name-calling, so I'll leave it at this.","1391213262"

I am currently in the process of writing a book series. And since I am simply horrible at drawing, so assistance would be awesome! I will do my best to deliver a character description from which you can draw! The character I would love to have drawn today, is: The character is a she, to be specific she is an elf. Her hair will be short but straight, the hair color is blond with hints of white. Since she's an elf, her ears are pointy. Her eyes are ivy green and her face is scarred (you can draw these wherever you find it appropriate). Her nose is short and concave. And both her lips and chins are slim. A personal characteristic would be marks of frost on her cheeks (these are not frost scars, there's literally frosting on her face). Her jaw kind of pointy as well, as in a slim manner. Her skin color is quite pale. I only really need her face drawn, which is why I don’t have any descriptions of clothing etc. If you find my description lacking, you may ask questions to make it easier/more accurate!","1391213262"

If you installed custom textures, you should really get Nexus Mod Manager. It has an inbuilt way for Archive Invalidation which is NEEDED for texture mods and such. Not having it WILL break your game.

He's bestowed with the power of the executive, which includes the ability to enforce the laws that Congress enacts.  As the chief executive, there's an argument to be made that he has discretion over *how* those laws are enforced.  Prosecutorial discretion is a widely accepted practice, but is typically a case-by-case basis situation.  A blanket declaration that certain laws will simply be ignored does seem to undercut Congressional authority, although since the President is also a democratically elected leader, he has some legitimacy behind his choice.

Realistically, this is an area where separation of powers and the third branch (Judicial) of government is very important.  I think it would be appropriate for Congress to sue the President to try and obtain a court order to enforce the law.  If the Supreme Court ordered the President to enforce the laws, I believe he would be Constitutionally obligated to do so.  Until then, it remains a gray area, but the fact that there is still this out makes me think that the Constitutional separation of powers and the balance between the executive and legislature is still alive and well.","1391213265"

Maybe add it up at the beginning of the session, then track it yourself as each character acquires/drops stuff.

"OrlandoMagic","t5_2s5vq","I'm not quite sure, actually. You could argue that he's neither. He's like a hybrid and can play either positions, but he has different advantages and disadvantages at both. 

He has issues on defense either way. He seems too slow to guard 3s and too undersized to guard 4s. It doesn't matter now, but in the future he will be exploited on the defensive end by elite teams when we're trying to contend. 

I think he plays better at the 4 overall because he seems to be better at using quickness/athleticism to his advantage against 4s than he is at using his body/height against 3s. We've payed him mainly at the 4 these past two season though, so I'd like to give him a fair shot to consistently play the 3. When he came back from injury we had him at the 3 and he played poorly, but I give him a pass on that because it could have been rust/injury-related. Now that he has his footing and Vuc is back, we can truly see what he's got at the 3. 

While Vuc was out for most of this month he was putting up 18/10 playing PF, which is similar to what he was doing last year at the same position. Let's see what he's got when he's mosty playing 3. 

tl;dr I need to see more, ask me again at the end of the season! =)

"WTF","t5_2qh61","all i can assume is that this is somewhere in America or Western Europe based on the fact that it is written in English. what would i tell the police if i were to call them. since OP knows which gazebo it is in, he/she would know which police department to call and would have more to go on than there being a gazebo in a place that probably has a predominantly English speaking population with disturbing graffiti written on it.  now, how do you justify not involving the police when the possible outcomes are stoners writing graffiti (not serious), and children being raped (serious).  I would hope that you wouldn't need to be told which is serious and which isn't, but you seem to be either not thinking this through, or trying to piss people off (which you have in my case).

the point that you seem to be making is that i am wrong because i do not have the information that i would need to report this and expect any results. OP has that information, and as far as i have seen in this thread it hasn't been posted. if i had that information the police would have been contacted, but as it stands i do not know who OP is, where they are, or where they work meaning the only thing that i would be able to tell the police is that this took place in a gazebo somewhere that is probably in north america, or western europe, which gives them around 926 million people to go through.  if OP goes to the police however they will be dealing with a pool that is a fraction of a percent of that. for OP to go to the police it will take anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour of his time, whereas if i were to try to do it, it would take me anywhere from a week to a few months as I learned how to track people down over the internet, and figure out where they work.

secondly, i never said I was responsible. You are putting words in my mouth.  this would be like me saying that you are a pedophile who is trying to cover up for your pedophile buddies by confusing the subject. that would be wrong, and its not what I'm saying. what I am saying is that you are an asshole because you shirk the responsibility that we all have for each other if we are to continue living in a civilized society.  go back to 4chan.","1391213271"

So that is why quotes were used around the term ""assault"".

Also, it is illegal to cross state borders to purchase guns that are illegal to own in your home state but not the state of purchase. So yes, it is most definitely a ban on certain guns.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I agree, it's useful in some contexts to treat having faith and believing as different things. In other instances, it is more useful to note their sameness. In the following, I will build on distinctions, even if I will use the vocabulary of my field rather than the same words as you use them. 

It's important to make a distinction between popular religion and theology. Theologians try to act as a critical influence on ordinary believers, with about as much success as scientists have in getting politicians and other people with money to understand why they would  research this question rather than that question, or simply get them to understand what they are up to. 

Perhaps I can offer some insight into what is going on when someone says they will believe, or have faith, no matter what. 

Sometimes we say we believe something even if, on closer examination, we know it's not true. What we are really saying is that we believe it should be true.

A philosopher once said, ""man is born free, but is everywhere in chains."" A famous document, with legal force, says, ""all men are created equal."" 

It doesn't matter that the statements are demonstrably false. People are not born free, and people are created with very equal sets of gifts and predispositions. It *should* be true, that people are given at least equal opportunity; some would say, roughly equal outcomes. Regardless, these ""is"" statements point not to what is, but to what should be.  

There are other reasons people say the things they do. People like to approach life through faith of type two (fides quae), rather than faith of type one (fides qua). 

Type two faith is trust in a person. Somehow it seems less work and more satisfying to trust a person rather than have type one faith, believe particular propositions. 

In the latter case, one has to justify one's faith in a proposition with more propositions, a pain in the neck. 

In the former case, faith, even unquestioning faith, in a doctor or a pastor who is caring for you for example, seems a reasonable default position to many. 

To answer your question: No, I don't think faith is special. In both of its species (fides qua and fides quae), it is a necessary and common ingredient in virtually everything we cook up. ","1391213272"

When there is a fire somewhere on the station the result is large volumes of super heated gasses filling the room, these can be several thousand degrees C and be under pressures of several thousand kPa. When these are siphoned out they go to atmospheric's waste loop. The problem is that when gasses are heated they expand in volume and this resulting increase in volume clogs the waste loop up and it take forever to run them through the system. What I want is a system of HE pipes that I can pump these gasses through to cool them which will reduce their volume before they hit the filters and allow the system to handle them better without getting clogged up.","1391213275"

 [**Software development process**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software%20development%20process): 

---

&gt;A **software development process**, also known as a **software development life-cycle** (**SDLC**), is a structure imposed on the [development of a software product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development). Similar terms include software life cycle and software process. It is often considered a subset of [systems development life cycle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_Development_Life_Cycle). There are several [models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process#Software_development_models) for such processes, each describing approaches to a variety of [tasks or activities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_the_software_development_cycle) that take place during the process. Some people consider a life-cycle model a more general term and a software development process a more specific term. For example, there are many specific software development processes that 'fit' the spiral life-cycle model. [ISO/IEC 12207](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_12207) is an international standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software.

Is that ALL scientific research? Or just what you've handpicked? And assuming it's the latter (safe bet) is that the research as presented by actual research scientists?

&gt; What good reasons are there to think a higher power doesn't exist?

The total lack of evidence of any such being.

My local garbage dump has a thrift store; people can donate things there that are still in OK condition but they don't want them any more and they're not really good enough to sell. It might be worth looking into whether there's something like that in your area.

And if you have more to spend, consignment stores have nicer stuff in better condition but it's not cheap, just cheaper than it would be if it were new. You can bargain with them at a consignment store.

He knows the execs at these places, he knows the extent of their knowledge about games and he talks to them more often and in greater depth than any journalist or gamer does. He's not a joke he's just operating on a different level to gamers, he's not talking to use he's talking to investors who probably don't know shit about the market and just want profit.

You can track one of two ways: either enter into the recipe builder, and count more points, or enter the ingredients into the tracker directly for less points.

And yes, mining will get harder and people without decent GPU's will be left behind eventually, that's the sad reality of cryptocurrencies. 

The faucets are there because people are generous. But it also helps get new people interested in the coin, which in turn helps spread it. That's another reason people made faucets back in the day, spreading the wealth from the first few miners, who got a lot, back to everyone else. 

They're not very effective generally though. except maybe for [dogec0in](http://dogec0in.com/) which is a friendly chat that doubles as a faucet. 

I think there is software that automatically depletes faucets, but not by solving the captcha (I think). so a good faucet is fairly safe. If I ever find someone who depletes faucets for their own benefit I will be very upset with them, it's frowned upon.

Here, I'll give Stern some credit as those TV contract numbers are pretty amazing. (NFL ones are staggering - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_on_television#List_of_NFL_television_contracts)

I, however, would also argue that that big jump from 397 million to 2.2 million in 4 years also had to do a lot with the rise of the Internet.

If you care, the Xbox media features are kinda cool, and ended up meaning I leave it on most of the time.

PS4 seems to run cross platform games better, Xbox first part ATM look better. 

As always though, if looks matter, two 760's would blow the hell out either two consoles, which runs just about the cost of either two.

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Oh dear it seems you don't understand a basic fundamental part of how damage is calculated in pokemon.  You should look at you pokemon's stats.  Every pokemon has stats in HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed.

Also pokemon moves are divided into 3 major types:.  Physical attack moves (Karate Chop, Low Kick, Take Down, Flame Charge etc), Special Attack moves (Blizzard, Flamethrower, Thunder, Hydro Pump etc) and Status (moves that either raise up your own stats like Harden, Swords Dance or moves that lower the opponents stats or inflict status on them like Growl, Thunder wave, Willow Wisp).

The ""power"" of a Physical or Special attack move is determined by their ""power"" number which is found when you go into each pokemon's summary and look at the ""power"" stat.  The higher the number it is the more damage you do if it lands though some moves have very low accuracy or bad side-effects to offset their high damage so it isn't always the best idea to go for high power moves.  Good example of his is hyper beam.  It has good power and accuracy but cripples your pokemon for one turn.  

Your Attack stat is what is calculated in all of your Physical attack moves and your Special attack is what is calculated in all of your special attack moves (barring special exception moves which are written out that way).  Your Defense determines how much damage is reduced from Physical attack moves and your Special Defense determines how much damage is reduced from Special Attack moves.

Every pokemon has varied ""base"" stats.  Stats in which they are good or bad at.  Most pokemon are good at one thing and bad at another.  Taking your Blaziken for example it usually has VERY good Attack stats and moves and terrible Special attack moves.  So ideally you need to look for strong PHYSICAL attack moves.  

Also important to take into account is STAB (Same-Type-Attack-Bonus).  

Pokemon of certain types will gain a 50% increase in power to their moves if its the same type as their own base type.  So for example for your Blaziken at least one good Physical Fire type move and one Physical Fighting type move is optimal.  ","1391213298"

"queensuniversity","t5_2s4y9","3rd year compsci student here. I'll list the Pros and Cons for you.

Pros:
Compsci/Math profs almost always post all their material online and most have their own websites. This is huge once you realize that you can learn a week's worth of lectures in about and hour from your room. It's also great for studying - no need to take hand-written notes.

Many of the compsci profs have fantastic assignments that teach you all kinds of programming. They are usually worth quite a bit too (better than tests with handwritten code).

About half of the compsci courses don't have exams.

Cons:
There are an annoying amount of irrelevant courses to take. You need 10 electives not in compsci/math, a business course, a philosophy course, 3 social sciences courses, and stats in addition to the relevant compsci/math courses. This is especially frustrating when these courses overlap with your mandatory relevant courses (they usually do) since Queen's doesn't allow you to overlap courses.

There are lot's of theory courses (maybe 6 in total) that aren't very practical and don't involve programming (1 of them is only taught at Queen's and the Prof's Dad made the course).

Overall what should be a 1.5 or 2 year degree is stretched into 4 years with too much filler.","1391213300"

Currently they're a problem for pilots who are not aware of their presence, and/or don't know how to react appropriately.  Specifically, they're a huge problem for any pilot that automatically pops CMs for every lock on sound that they hear, that they know they can't dodge.  This is far and away the most frequent reaction, if I had to guess I'd say 99% of pilots react in this way and it is usually wrong.

Those who react appropriately - by either dodging with terrain, or eating the hit if there's no one-shot-kill assets in range during your mobility hit - plainly **aren't** denied airspace.  So what does a balanced stinger look like, in your mind?

They've made it very clear that they do not and will not balance by popular consensus.  I have game balance industry experience - and since you seem to like the fallacy defense, fallacy of mass appeal is a useful piece of data, but absolutely not the be-all, end-all measure of game balance :P

&gt;The idea that stingers cannot deny entire airspaces is observably wrong

If you plop a bad pilot in to a situation and they get shot down, that doesn't mean the airspace is denied.  That's kind of like saying plopping an average pub player in to a competitive TDM game, and saying *the entire map is denied*.  Put me in that same pilot's position and I'll happily fly in it, generally speaking.  The standards of skill needed to occupy that area have gone up.  It's a hot zone - as it should be.  That engineer denied themselves the opportunity to revive players, drop medpacks, shoot assault rifles, snipe, drop ammo, and RPG tanks... all so they can pressure helicopters.  That's their job, and it's not even really the best role for doing so (jets and MAA are much better).

Opportunity cost matters, a lot.  That's a subtlety that the masses don't really consider when they hear the beepbeepbeep of a stinger hitting them, and why I don't feel like the ""lots of people think so!"" argument holds much value.","1391213301"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I don't think I've said anywhere that Nintendo is the best, but this is not a discussion about whether any one company is best, it's a discussion about why people think Nintendo should go third-party. Which inevitably led to criticisms about the console lacking third-party support and advanced technology, at which point I've started arguing whether such things are actually important (in the case of technology) or true (in the case of third-party support).

I think it's kind of funny that you're accusing me of ""ignoring everything other people have said"" when I've been doing quite a good job of backing my opinions up with sales data and actual facts. Speaking of which...

I make no pretense about my preference for artistic direction over HD graphics being an *opinion,* but to suggest that having a more powerful console means being more successful or easier to develop for is hilarious. Look at recent generations - the 3DS has massively outsold the Vita, the Wii outsold the PS3/360, the DS outsold the PSP and the PS2 outsold the GameCube/XBOX. In every generation of consoles that has begun *this century*, the best-selling console has actually been the *least* powerful one. Whether that's actually the cause of console sales remains to be seen as there are a ton of other factors to consider, but such facts definitely suggest that having a more powerful console does *not* guarantee success.

I've seen that article you posted, too, at its original source on Eurogamer:

http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2014-secret-developers-wii-u-the-inside-story

There are some interesting comments on there. I'm certainly not one to deny the article, and I understand why such sources might have to stay anonymous as being such a critic of a major games company could hurt their job, but remember this is one developer, talking about developing for the Wii U on pre-launch hardware (PS3 had similar problems, for instance, but those were ironed out and it became less prevalent a problem over time). There have also been plenty of others who have said otherwise about the console's power and developing for it. I suggest you give all of the following articles a look:

http://wiiudaily.com/2014/01/dreamcast-dev-on-wii-u/

http://www.computerandvideogames.com/446638/wii-u-development-negativity-is-needless-claims-indie-dev/

http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/02/criterion_lavishes_nintendo_and_wii_u_with_praise

These, like the article you posted, are not necessarily reflective of *every* developer, but they do suggest that there may be more than one way of looking at things. I'm not suggesting, as you say, that Nintendo are better than everyone else. You, however, seem to be suggesting that they're worse - I merely think they're different. Granted, no company is perfect and 2014 really needs to be the year that Nintendo kicks their software output into overdrive (the Wii U could certainly benefit from a year of software like that the 3DS had in 2013), but at the end of the day this whole discussion has been about why people think Nintendo should go third-party. I'm yet to see a convincing, well-researched argument made that says they should be doing that.","1391213302"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll go a little deeper and maybe help open it up for you.

What makes a person a 'person'? Is it the flesh you were born with? Is it the chromosomes in your cells? Is it what other people see you as? Is it the chemicals running through your body? Is it your preferences? Is it your likes and dislikes? 

What is the core of a person? 

Is it chromosomes? All they do is differentiate which sexual organs you develop. That's literally it - they actually are inert beyond that point - the organs themselves then distribute chemicals which cause almost all of the differences between body types.

Is it what's between your legs? Well let me tell you the story of a soldier in Iraq. He had his genitals blown off in Iraq. Is he now not a man? Should he take up wearing skirts, and dresses? Talk about how he now, suddenly, wants a big strong guy to throw him on the bed? Should he take up interest in knitting? No, of course not - who he is is not his genitals, it's his mind. He's still the same guy.


So then we're at the crossroad. The brain is the center of who we are. Our preferences, our likes and dislikes. How we interact in society. How we see other people. 

So the brain is the true center of person. What you (and many others demand) is that for the less-than 1% of people who are born with body out-of-alignment with brain, we should pretend to be what our body dictates, against our very nature, against who we are as people? And for what? Because you can't wrap your brain around it ? Because you think we're gross? What on earth justifies you telling me how I must live, how my preferences must be, who I am as a person? 

You've never had to live with these things out of alignment. You can't possibly understand as we do. But you can at least empathise and try. You can realize the ignorance around you and learn of it, and how to avoid it. You can be a part of a positive forward influence for transsexual rights.

It's not even hard. All you need to do is learn and understand, then don't stand down when we're attacked - publically, politically, our rights, whatever. ","1391213303"

&gt;RAGE QUIT SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

&gt;Introducing a novel solution to rage quitters in Ranked Match: JAIL

&gt;- The first time your disconnect percentage goes above 15 percent you go to JAIL

&gt;- A 10 match minimum is required

&gt;- JAIL lasts for 24 hours. During this time you can only be matched against other JAIL members

&gt;- Each time you go to JAIL the amount of time increases by 24 hours (capped at 5 days – 120 hrs)

&gt;- While in JAIL your profile icon will be automatically changed to a custom JAIL icon to let you know you are in JAIL

&gt;- When your JAIL time is up, you go back into the public again (even if your disconnect percentage is back over 15%)

&gt;- However, when back in public, if you disconnect and you are still above 15 percentage you go directly back to JAIL

&gt;- **For any match that sends you to JAIL, player will take a loss**

I guess this way, it doesn't penalize people that accidentally disconnect with a loss. Only those that make it a habit will be penalized. ","1391213306"

For example, I'll go for a grab with MewTwo and attempt an Up-Throw.  But it'll take several flicks on the joystick before the game would register what i'm trying to do.  This is true to any throwing direction.  There are times when it fails to receive my joystick direction input that my opponent would eventually break free from the grab.  

So that similar problem also exist when using the C-Stick for a quick smash attack.  Sometimes the inputs would not register at all and it'll take several attempts to execute the smash.  ","1391213306"

Your district, which was within the division, would get split into two groups based on relative student population. The half with the larger was ""Big School"", the half with smaller was ""Small School"".

So you had District champ, Big School rep and Small School rep. Theoretically, you could have two state champions in one district, which actually happened with 2A district 1 once. One was Small school champion, the other was big school champion. The big school champion's only loss all year was to the small school champ. ","1391213307"

**Moderator**] It’s interesting that there are many people who sympathize with Jang Sung Taek. 

**Oh**] Yes. The source focused on the opinions of farmers. Even though this year is a rich year compared to previous harvests, farmers will not benefit. It may be expected that farmers would receive a greater distribution with a good harvest; however, in reality they only received a document describing a series of taxes including land tax that reduce their allotment. They received some distribution but authorities use the majority to benefit the People’s Army. Yet North Korean authorities keep attributing farmers’ small distribution to Jang Sung Taek. 

**Moderator**] The nation lays the blame of cutting the food distribution to Jang Sung Taek? 

**Oh**] Yes. However, farmers don’t seem to believe everything the authorities say. According to news delivered from North Korea, North Korean executives blame Jang Sung Taek saying that he took rice that people harvested and sold it to foreign countries to fill his pockets. However, people think that the authorities took everything and are trying to escape fault by placing blame on others. Also, people are saying that that guy is that guy. ","1391213311"

Otherwise we are basically restricted to trying to pilfer members from other parties during larger movements and people who already are left-wing.

Scare tactics- Google what unbrushed teeth look like. Google cavities and rampant caries. They are all very real and we see those cases far too often.

High visibility- Place floss(or floss picks) and toothbrushes in places you see often. I shower twice a day so I stick my brush in the shower and I brush whilst showering.

Not having Canelo on the Mayweather/Guerrero undercard was seen as a reason there was a dip compared to Floyd's previous fights of about 200-300K buys and adding Garcia/Matthysse to the Mayweather/Alvarez card really solidified it as a ""must see"" event.

 There's always a lot of risk with first round picks anyway. I think its unfair to use the 'could have had Patterson argument'. First there's no guarantee the Seahawks would have taken him and second I don't think anyone thought he would be that good.

"cpp_questions","t5_2tdbd","What you wrote has ~~two~~ problems:

* Throwing string literals isn't a good idea. Many people advocate that throwing anything that isn't derived from std::exception isn't a good idea, but I think that goes to far. However, it's better for clarity to throw objects that are clearly marked as exceptions, and this also allows you to catch ""categories"" of exceptions by making use of type hierarchies.

* your if will always throw. Imagine a user enters '+'; your if will be evaluated thusly:

    if( operation != '+' || operation != '-' ...

becomes

     if( operation != '+' )
    
this isn't true, so the next expression is evaluated:

     if( operation != '-' )

this is true, operation is not equal to '-', so this is true, the whole expression is true, and an error is thrown. Similarly, if the user types '-', the first sub-expression will be true and an error will be thrown. A logical or is true whenever either of its operands are true. What you need is `&amp;&amp;`: if operation isn't equal to '+' AND it isn't equal to '-' AND ...

* This is using excpetions to control flow. That's not a particularly idiomatic use of exceptions. In your example, you should just output an error instead of throwing, and break the loop you need (see next point) in the else.

* As for your question: Exceptions are nothing more than another code path. You will have to use a loop of some sort, yes. The code you posted should look something like this:  

-- 


    bool input_ok = false;
    char method;
    do {
        cin &gt;&gt; method;
        if( method != '+' &amp;&amp; method != '-' &amp;&amp; ... ) {
             cout &lt;&lt; ""Error: invalid operation."" &lt;&lt; endl;
        } else {
            input_ok = true;
        }
    } while( !input_ok );

Exceptions are helpful for code that can't handle its error by itself, not at every possible point where an error happens. For example, consider a function:

    Operation getOperationFromInput( char c ) {
        if( c != '+' &amp;&amp; ... ) {
            // what goes here?
        ...

that function may not know what to do when the input is invalid. You are working on very simple educational code, but in a larger program, this might not always be the case. Such a function, or a function used by such a function, might throw when it encounters an error. ","1391213320"

"socialism","t5_2qjii","I keep repeating myself.  %-)  I left this comment in a similar thread in /r/progressive:

----------------------------------------------------
I gotta confess, I look at people like the Walton heirs — and yeah, Walmart's grown since Sam died, but still, how much of that money have they earned? — and see that their net worth is something like $26 billion EACH. And I wonder ""What the ever-living FUCK is the point of having that much net worth?!""

Seriously, if I ever inherited something insane like $1 billion of stock in some company, I'd sell most of the stock and keep whatever amount would give me a comfortable annual income ($200k/yr?) in dividends, then take the cash from the sale and buy a nice house (even if I moved back to SoCal, max $2 million), buy some toys (cars/motorbikes/TVs, at most another $1 million), give some away to family, keep some more in the bank for spending cash, do a few really frivolous things (like buy one of these and make it into an end table) ... and then I might have spent, what, $100 million? Hell, I'd put at least half a billion into a charitable foundation. And give me a second billion? Fuck it, dump that into the charity, too, what the hell am I going to do with it?

[The article here](http://boingboing.net/2014/01/26/why-the-hyper-rich-turn-into-c.html) and the links nail it; it's some weird kind of psychosis these people must have. IDGI. Perhaps the best cure is, as certain people put it 225 years ago, ""a close shave""?

------------------------------------

**tl;dr** Anything over, say, a net worth of $10-20 million is absolutely, certifiably insane.  Obviously, in a truly socialist state, no one would come near that; but even in today's insanely corporatist über-capitalist world, I don't think there's any honest rational reason for any one person/family to have more wealth than that.","1391213322"

into question.

It's not a great analogy, but I'm reminded of the things people say when they get drunk. You might think their inhibitions are removed so what you're getting is honesty, but the fact is that how we choose to inhibit ourselves is what defines our personalities. 

Similarly, when the neurochemicals make me manic, I might feel so invincible that I misinterpret my needs and make regrettable decisions. In fact, thinking I would be better off without social contact or romantic relationships has certainly been among them.

Like others have been saying, it is important to find a way to encourage her to seek treatment. I know I was very reluctant to admit that I have bipolar disorder - it took an incredibly traumatic dive into horrible paranoia for me to go to a doctor, despite showing signs of cycling for years. However, while I continue to believe that my self-diagnosis is more legitimate than my psychiatrists', I have finally found the right combination of pills and I can recognize the benefits.

One last thing: if she does end up trying out medication, I know I found it very helpful to have someone take care of me completely in the first week or two while I adjusted to the new pills (think of it like a moderately debilitating flu). The support groups linked above can probably provide more information about this, but I know that a lot of times new medication can make you feel like a useless zombie and that can spawn attempts to shirk the responsibility of continuing to take the pills or try different options.","1391213322"

Until 1977 Mormons believed that Black people were literally demonic creatures without souls.  Does that mean a Mormon baker was allowed to kick them out for being black?

Answer: No, they could not.

The Inn was not performing religious ceremonies, as it was not a religious worship center.  They were engaged in a business practice.  Businesses do not have the same protections that religious worship centers have, just like religious worship center cannot use their religion to discriminate in their business practices (whether it be a bake sale or when they rent out their properties to the public/non-members).

Businesses aren't allowed to discriminate.  The Inn is a business.

"haskell","t5_2qh36","The concept of lenses doesn't really require TH. The underlying principle behind lenses is beautiful and simple. You shouldn't even have to import lens to create lenses for your things, technically. I think Kmett has said that keeping it that way is an explicit goal of the project, to make it possible for library writers to export a lens API without having to bring in a new dependency.

It's convenient to automatically create lenses with TH, but you don't need it. As long as you have a getter function (which is easy to make with pattern matching) and a setter function (which is also trivial to implement) you can create a lens with\*

    lens getter setter

For example, if you have

    data Person = Person { _name :: String, _age :: Int }

you can create a lens for the name field of a person,

    nameGetter (Person name _) = name
    nameSetter (Person _ age) newName = Person newName age
    nameLens = lens nameGetter nameSetter

and then if you have a dude

    dude = Person { _name = ""John"", _age = 57 }

he can quickly change his name

    dude &amp; nameLens .~ ""Dave""
    Person { _name = ""Dave"", _age = 57 }

No TH required!

----

\* This way of creating lenses is convenient, but it requires importing Control.Lens for the `lens` function, of course. If you want to create the name lens without any dependencies other than the Prelude, you just have to

    nameLens f (Person name age) = fmap (\newName -&gt; Person newName age) (f name)
    --adapted from the Control.Lens haddock page

There's nothing in your scenario which indicates that the prisoner is not free in the sense which is at stake in the dispute about free will.  The libertarian is not committed to the idea that someone is free when they can do anything they wish at any point.  That we imprison people is a political issue rather than a metaphysical one.

&gt; All choice is limited by possibility. It is because that choice is limited by so many factors of circumstance and consequence, in addition to the actor's own judgement, that I believe true free will doesn't exist. Choice in itself is also a limitation because the act of choosing cuts one off from other possibilities.

But none of this has to do with what is at stake in the debate about free will.  The libertarian isn't committed to the idea that there are no limitations, nor the idea that one doesn't limit one's possibilities by making a choice.","1391213335"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","In the base of the plasma globe is a high frequency transformer, similar to that found in an old CRT television but smaller.  In an old tube TV the AC output of the transformer is rectified to DC and used to power an electron gun at the back of the tube.  In a plasma globe, the AC output is not rectified.  One side of the transformer output is grounded and the other side goes to that small bulb in the middle of the globe.  

The small bulb acts as one side of a capacitor.  The other side of the capacitor is earth/ground/anything nearby.  As the electrical potential in that small inner bulb swings between 10,000 volts or so positive and 10,000 volts or so negative (with respect to ground) at high frequency, a strong electric field is generated which is changing at a very fast rate between positive and negative.  This ""jiggles"" anything that is charged nearby including the atoms in the diffuse gas in the globe.  What happens is that a plasma is created and these are the streamers you see in the globe.  

A fluorescent light bulb also contains low pressure gas.  In normal operation an electrical discharge is run through the gas which emits UV light that then hits the phosphor on the glass which then emits white light.  When you get the bulb next to globe, the low pressure gas inside is excited in the same way as the gas inside the plasma globe.  It emits UV, that hits the phosphor generating white light, etc.  Its just that the gas in the fluorescent bulb is being excited by the high frequency electric field instead of by an electrical discharge from the base of the fluorescent bulb.","1391213337"

What is the likelihood... 10%? Maybe the employee drinks a lot, lives for hops, and has a lot of friends who are the same. Or, maybe he's just selfish, impulsive, and not too bright. Unless we are that guy or the owner, we can't know for sure. Even if you think you know for sure, have you ever been wrong about something like this? Just curious what people's thoughts are.

Second, what probability would be acceptable to justify driving Savor out of business (through legal fees if something was illegal, or through word-of-mouth and lack of business if it was all legal)? If you think it's 95% clear that this was purposeful, would you advocate boycotting Savor, knowing that 1/20 such decisions would drive an innocent business into the ground? What about 80% certainty (1-in-5 false alarms)?

Just curious. I see a lot of people saying that it's obvious this is foul play and Savor deserves to be punished for it, but there's always the chance things aren't as they seem (facts are being reported wrong, the owner is telling the truth), and this story is definitely going to hurt Savor, which is probably a struggling new business that needs good publicity.

I do not have children and have no plans on ever having them, but I do have friends on all ends of the child having spectrum, and I'd say that most of them are genuinely happier with children than without, but they can't really articulate why. Some of them, certainly, are less so and would have rather not had them especially if they got started young or had them accidentally, so I agree with you about the sour grapes, but it is human nature to become a salesman for whatever it is that makes you happy.

Today's society does tend to enforce the view that if you have children then you must be in a committed monogamous relationship and you must be in a nuclear family, but I know of people who are in committed relationships who also still have casual sex with others, and it seems to work for them.

Also the incident with my friend did not happen in a lab. I guess that wasn't clear. It happened in a High School theatre where we were building sets. The point I was trying to make is, you can be as safe as you want in your biology class, but then in the next class someone is dripping blood everywhere and no one even thinks about HIV because they aren't in a lab environment. I've had carpentry classes, sewing classes, sculpture classes etc and in those classes you will inevitably end up bleeding, but no one ever gave a shit about infection unless I pointed it out. I had a teacher get confused why I would put a new needle in the sewing machine after the girl using it, stabbed herself with it. 

All I'm really saying is that of all the times I've potentially been exposed to infected blood at school under the supervision of teachers who are supposed to be looking out for my safety, my biology classes were definitely the safest. I think if we are going to start picking on the bio teachers who use blood in class, we also need to crack down on the teachers outside of the lab too.","1391213345"

&gt;

&gt;**Tathatā** ([Sanskrit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit_language), [Pali](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pali) तथता tathatā; [Chinese](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_language): 真如) is variously translated as ""thusness"" or ""suchness"". It is a central concept in [Buddhism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), and is of particular significance in [Zen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen) Buddhism. The synonym **dharmatā** is also often used.

&gt;While alive the Buddha referred to himself as [Tathagata](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathagata), which can mean either ""One who has thus come"" or ""One who has thus gone"", and interpreted correctly can be read as ""One who has arrived at suchness"". Tathatā as a central concept of Buddhism expresses appreciation of the [true nature of reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_suchnesses) in any given moment. As no moment is exactly the same, each one can be savored for what occurs at that precise time, whether it is thought of as being ""good"" or ""bad"".

&gt;In the early texts, it is described as an aspect of [nibbānā](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibbana).

In fact, you can take the entire first verse of ""Blue Jeans"" and give it to each student for them to find all the literary devices and explain why they're there. There are enough to make the activity worthwhile. Bonus points if you don't tell them it's Lana Del Rey initially and let them recognize it themselves.

[""Off to the Races""](http://rock.rapgenius.com/Lana-del-rey-off-to-the-races-lyrics) is a dominating metaphor/extended allusion of *Lolita*. You can show the parallels between the book and Lana's song. There's also a lot of concrete details that you can discuss how they contribute to the general tone.

[""National Anthem""](http://rock.rapgenius.com/Lana-del-rey-national-anthem-lyrics) uses a lot of symbolism and metaphors too. See the title.

 Lana has *a ton* of allusions and specific metaphors in her music. It would be great to just take a general overview of her work and point out all the references she makes and how it adds to each song.

Once all the truths have trickled out, the level of infidelity she's now at becomes the new baseline, and next time, additional truths will accumulate. 

Ultimately, it's not important whether she sexed him or not. Because she's putting herself in a situation where it might happen. So if didn't happen this time, it will next time. And if there is no next time with this guy, there will be with another. 

We all know how you seduce women. It's a gradual process of building both excitement and comfort, in some combination. And we all know that getting her drunk is a possible stage in that process. And that getting to not go home, but sleep here instead because she's tired, is a possible stage in that process. And we know where that process ends. 

It doesn't matter how far along that path she is. She's walking it. 

And women don't do that unless they like where the path is going. Because they know full well from step one where it's going. The graduality of the process is just about ASD. If they *genuinely wouldn't consider sex with you*, then they don't get in situations like this. Period. ","1391213359"

Anyway, the compression on the imgur link is total garbage for some reason, so I decided to host the wallpaper on Mega for anyone who wants the full quality. Also, as a bonus, in that Mega link is a second version of the wallpaper without the logo and 4 wallpapers of each of the girls individually.  
  
Hope you enjoy.

"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","I'm sorry you're having to go through all that, and that you got stuck holding the bag with being one of the two caretakers for your grandfather. 

Being a caregiver takes SO much more out of a person than someone who hasn't done it can imagine. What you have going on is [caregiver syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver_syndrome) (aka caretaker fatigue or caretaker burnout). I'm in the middle of it now (been at it 6 months intensively, and to a limited extent for 2 years). Not nearly to the extent you are, as it's my old dog (who is in almost the same shape as your grandfather), but the caretaker syndrome or fatigue is there. I had to pull back and hand off the most physically demanding daily caretaker responsibilities to my brother, as I just couldn't take it anymore. It really sucks that there's no one else there besides your grandmother to share the load with, or to shift the load to, as you're getting burned out. 

On the bright side, it's only a month or two to go. But on the dark side, look ahead a few moves; after your grandfather goes, you know your grandmother is going to fall apart, and may be in need of a caretaker herself. The sooner you plan for that eventuality, the better. 

And as for the hospice plan, I have a relative with terminal cancer going through all that now, and apparently there are two levels of hospice care; one like you have (and like my relatives have) where it's in the home and a nurse comes by for a daily check, and another where they live in a facility. Is there a way you can look into if it's possible to put him in a live-in hospice for the remainder of his time? Considering that your grandmother is in no physical shape to do any lifting, that puts it all on you, and that's too much for one person 24/7 with no days off for months on end. 

And for when it's your grandmother's time, the live-in hospice seems essential when it's time for that. 

It's so hard to talk about this stuff also. Normally, communication in a relationship of any sort is the way to go when there's a problem (as there is here)... but unless you know how your grandmother would react, I'd tread very carefully on the subject. At most, keep it very vague. She might be getting caretaker fatigue also, but old couples who have been together 50+ years have something unique going on, so maybe not. Hard to say. 

In my situation, unlike yours, putting my dog to sleep is at least an option. Although in my case, he's not as mentally far gone as your grandfather sounds (although my dog does have some form of dementia and is only sometimes responsive), and he's not in significant pain (medicated for arthritis and a pain med), and there are still moments in the day he enjoys various activities, and that's what's keeping me from making the hard decision. The point of me bringing that up is, does your grandfather still have moments in the day where his personality shines through, where he enjoys doing something, or enjoys the company of someone? If so, focusing on those moments and really taking them in when they occur, I've found that helps me cope. Maybe it would help you too. 

Something else that might help might be to look at this as an experience that's making you stronger. (And I say that as someone literally cleaning up the piss and shit in the house, leaping up out of bed at any hour of the night to help my dog up before he hurts himself trying, hobbling around with a strained groin muscle from lifting my dog up, and so on; this isn't some bland platitude here). It might not seem like it now, but if you look back on who you were before this started, and what you're capable of now, I bet you've come a *long* way. This post was written in a moment when it has you broken down (and the caregiver job breaks a person down, many times), but I would bet money I don't have that on the other side of this will be an uncommon inner strength and an ability to not get rattled by petty BS. 

Make sure to find moments for yourself (if you can carve out enough time for ""you"" time, having some self-indulgent rituals and activities helps), and make sure you stay in touch with people who aren't literally in the shit, they're the lifeline to the normal world and are of great help staying sane. 

tl;dr - What you're feeling is totally normal in the place you're stuck in. Reading about it would help understand it, and help understand the messed up feelings of resenting the person you're caring for. On the bright side, at least your grandfather doesn't have long to go. Although it would be smart to start planning for your grandmother so you're not the one cleaning up the poop next time.  And hard as it is to see at the moment, this isn't time wasted. Best of luck.

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","For a start, you might visit your local chapter of the American Association of Woodturners. Many of them have small lathes you could look at and probably try, or at least meet in places that do. The members have experience and often good advice. Someone might have a suitable lathe they no longer use and would be willing to let go at a good price. (I's not the way to bet, but it has been known to happen.)

For pens, shotglasses, etc., something like the Jet mini lathe would be perfect--more expensive than this one is likely to be, but much more versatile, durable, and rigid, all properties you need. An extension bed is available in case someday you want to work on something larger. There are several similar models by other makers.

If these are too expensive, take a look at the Apprentice mini lathe from www.woodturnerscatalog.com. I know nothing at all about it, but Craft Supplies has never been in the habit of selling junk. The cast bed alone almost guarantees better rigidity than you are likely to get from the model above.

FWIW, there are several ads on eBay for a lathe that looks like it came off the same production line for even less money. I'd sooner pay more to deal with Craft Supplies, but it has been years since I bought anything from them. The could have deteriorated since the founder died.

Finally, note that ""Ein"" is German for ""one."" Not sure what ""hell"" means in Deutsche, but it certainly seems suggestive.

Good luck with your purchase.","1391213362"

Actions can be bad, or evil, sure. But the idea that there is evil, like a person who is ""evil"" i don't believe in. I do believe there are bad actions that work against society, but that doesn't make the person themselves evil. I believe people can be retrained to see the benefits of other actions. 

To claim someone is evil, is to basically say that no matter way, they will always try to do bad in the world. I just don't think anyone is like that.","1391213368"

Not to say that you can't have fun in dayz, both games are really promising and will be 10x more successful when they're both with the right amount of features to make their respective devs satisfied and say ""this can now be considered a complete game"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I wouldn't worry about that too much, at least you didn't awkwardly try to cover it up and make matters worse like my dad does.

He was out shopping one day and when time came to pay, he got a rather sour looking, Indian chap for a cashier. My dad, being a funny little Irish chap, said to him, ""Well you look browned off today!"" Immediately after, being the funny little Irish chap he is and having grown up in the 60s in a place with very few minorities, he thought 'Oh  no! I have been racially insensitive!' and stumbled over his words trying to make sure the poor guy didn't think him a racist. Inevitably, this just ended up making him look rather more racially insensitive, and a hilariously awkward time was had by all.

It didn't end here though. A month or so later, my dad met my new Indian boyfriend for the first time while he was driving the two of us and our Chinese friend somewhere. He decided, due to his previously displayed lack of social filter, that this would be the perfect time to tell his amusing anecdote. Once he had finished there was a small silence while figured out that yet again, he'd said something that he maybe shouldn't. Cue hysterical laughter from me and akward shifting from everyone else in the car.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Manley P. Hall and Albert Pike and many other high level members of the Scottish Rite, York Rite, Knights of Malta, etc have stated publicly and in their books that Lucifer is the true God of this world.  Master masons and members who have completed the TRUE masonic degrees of the blue lodge are not taught this, as it is merely a personal interpretation by these so-called ""authority figures"".  The beauty of Free Masonry is that there are no hard rules or Gods you must worship, but there is a common perception among the adepts at the higher levels that Lucifer is the true God.

Ultimately, the Royal Secret is the ultimate purpose.  Some claim that Masonry is a part of a global socialist conspiracy, but in fact the opposite is true.  They teach and empower the individual to attain personal sovereignty, under God (whichever God they may worship).  That is the Royal Secret.  Many have exploited this to manipulate the masses who are unaware of this truth.  The 33rd degree is sinister, because you can simply pay money or help with ""the great work"" to attain this degree.  You don't have to complete the true craft or the other 32 degrees.","1391213377"

It's a shorthand way of saying, ""Don't jump the gun too soon on your opinion,"" while using a salient example that most comic fans know.

There's plenty of room for discussion about whether a casting choice is good or not. The problem is that most people jump to the extremes. Either it's a terrible choice which will sink the film, or the casting director is a genius. It's way too early for any of that, obviously.

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Tathatā***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathat%C4%81) :

&gt;

&gt;**Tathatā** (Sanskrit, Pali तथता tathatā; Chinese: 真如) is variously translated as ""thusness"" or ""suchness"". It is a central concept in Buddhism, and is of particular significance in Zen Buddhism. The synonym **dharmatā** is also often used.

&gt;While alive the Buddha referred to himself as Tathagata, which can mean either ""One who has thus come"" or ""One who has thus gone"", and interpreted correctly can be read as ""One who has arrived at suchness"". Tathatā as a central concept of Buddhism expresses appreciation of the true nature of reality in any given moment. As no moment is exactly the same, each one can be savored for what occurs at that precise time, whether it is thought of as being ""good"" or ""bad"".

&gt;In the early texts, it is described as an aspect of nibbānā.

"fantasybaseball","t5_2quxe","You can stop people from streaming pitchers using innings pitched limits or weekly and seasonal acquisition limits. Either force managers to work their pitching in based on innings or give 3 acquisitions/week and roll 3*{weeks in season} for the season limits. 

I particularly like acquisition limits because of the emphasis it puts on each move

On scoring: 

R/HR/RBI/OBP/SLG (or ops but i like them separated)/ net SB

I think AVG is pretty worthless and I like net stolen bases because my league is 16 ppl and  it helps avoid a situation where one or two managers who can run away w the category. Keeping SB within reach also helps encourages managers not to ""punt"" SB. 

I also experimented with removing RBI but I feel strongly that the sac fly is an important part of the game of baseball and helps value players more accurately. 

Pitching: QS/ERA/k per 9/ k per bb/net saves EDIT: i forgot WHIP

Wins are bullshit. Never use them. 

I like k-9 and k-bb because they measure different strengths pitchers have. Net saves is one of my favorite stats for the same reasons as net stolen bases. It makes closers important but helps balance them relative to their skill and draft position.

For example, in my league, if you drafted kimbrel, odds are you wont take another elite closer (or even a midtier one) because the rounds are so long and each team has so many needs. 

Therefore, while kimbrel might have an amazing season, keeping up with other managers' save totals can be a challenge because the other closers the kimbrel owner theoretically has in his bullpen are much less skilled and more apt to blow saves. 

You could argue that somebody could take 2 elite closers and dominate, however, i can virtually guarantee that owner wouldnt be able to make up enough ground in the other categories to win (again, due to the size of my league). 

Not all of this may apply to you based on your situation but these settings have worked for us very well over the past few seasons.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","1. By this logic, if I ever have a child I'm responsible for everything he does in his entire life. It doesn't make sense to blame God for bad things that humans do. Also, there's no objective way to define a perfect world. After all, different people would have different definitions of a perfect world, and no world could fit them all. So even if the world actually *is* perfect by God's standards, a lot of people wouldn't recognize it. Alternately, why would God want to create a perfect world? We can't exactly be sure what God was shooting for with the universe.

2. To suggest that anyone would have faith in something for absolutely no reason is just plain wrong, and not supported at all in scripture. This point represents Christians as strawmen. Even Christians who speak of faith as all-important were not born with faith in God. Clearly, they must have adopted it for some reason, good or not. Besides, if you believe enough to be afraid of hell you are not likely to think your faith will collapse at any moment. Anyway, Christians don't usually claim to have all the answers or be free of doubt. They just have enough answers that they believe they'll scrape their way into heaven.

3. This implies that we should all have coequal, normal person-person relationships with God, which is something that pretty much only a subset of American fundamentalists believe. What are the appropriate feelings to hold for the creator of the universe? The universe is both a frightening and awesome place, so it doesn't seem too far-fetched to imagine that fear and love are both ""correct"" feelings to have towards God.

Overall, it sounds like you should find a willing mainline pastor or something to discuss this stuff with. It sounds like you have a kind of shallow idea of Christianity. Many Christians have a pretty shallow brand of Christianity too, and you probably learned it from them, but that's no excuse not to seek out more types of believers.

One last point, and this is the biggest one. If you think a particular action or belief will lead you to heaven, how on Earth are you a coward or a self-interested jerk for following it? That's like saying a person who escapes a burning building is a coward. Self-preservation isn't bad, it's actually pretty normal.","1391213381"

"reiki","t5_2r0lt","Interesting. Abstract from article (emphasis mine):

This is a constructive replication of a previous trial conducted by Bowden et al. (2010), where students who had received Reiki demonstrated greater health and mood benefits than those who received no Reiki. The current study examined impact on anxiety/depression. 40 university students—half with high depression and/or anxiety and half with low depression and/or anxiety—were randomly assigned to receive Reiki or to a non-Reiki control group. Participants experienced six 30-minute sessions over a period of two to eight weeks, where they were blind to whether noncontact Reiki was administered as their attention was absorbed in a guided relaxation. The efficacy of the intervention was assessed pre-post intervention and at five-week follow-up by self-report measures of mood, illness symptoms, and sleep. **The participants with high anxiety and/or depression who received Reiki showed a progressive improvement in overall mood, which was significantly better at five-week follow-up, while no change was seen in the controls.** While the Reiki group did not demonstrate the comparatively greater reduction in symptoms of illness seen in our earlier study, the findings of both studies suggest that Reiki may benefit mood.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Now people who don't have any gluten sensitivities are avoiding gluten because it is trendy. Clearly labels are not informative to the general public, and should only be required when they are relevant in some way.

You're saying labels aren't informative because the general public makes bad decisions based on them? That makes no sense. All food should have a mobile code you can scan and instantly pull up every single thing you could want to know about it. Why not?

I don't agree with the ""gluten trend"" or the ""fat free"" one, but so what if food says it has gluten in it or not. If someone doesn't want to eat gluten, that's their call. The free market will decide if gluten free food is worthy or not to be produced, that's how free markets work. You saying gluten food shouldn't be labeled because it has no health significance to the mass populace and therefore is non-informative is making assumptions and connections you have no right to make.

&gt; That is just FUD. You could change that GMO's out for anything that is recent and say the same thing. 

Generally people don't just randomly say things are bad for you because they are new, or because they involve science. That's not really how it works. Do I say my new graphics card is bad for my health because it runs games faster? Of course not. So that argument that people in general are just ""against new things"" is totally false.

Fact is this is something huge we are doing that is potentially going directly into our bodies on a daily basis. That makes it a whole different story. Not forgetting the fact that no extended human tests have been done on the effects of GMO. If you have any sort of interest or belief in scientific testing that should worry you. We're talking about something that was introduced in extremely limited amounts barely 10 years ago and you think you have all the answers? Do you work for Monsanto or something?

&gt; Also, saying we are just fine without them isn't an argument. Humanity was just fine before the Internet, doesn't mean we shouldn't have it.

I never specifically said we were ""fine"" without GMO. I said the argument it will solve World hunger is totally bogus. We have excess amounts of normal food right now and there are people starving to death in the USA, let alone the rest of the World.

&gt; The issue is putting a stigmatizing label on something when the public doesn't understand it and it makes no known difference to the health or nutrition of the consumer. The FDA only requires relevant labels to nutrition and health be put on foods. Requiring more would go against the free market.

Who said anything about a stigmatizing label? You sure do like to twist things to make your point.

&gt; If you really want to bitch and moan, try Google and look for an independent organization that verifies GMO free food. I have the feeling you haven't because you really don't care enough to.

Fortunately I live in a country where GMO food is banned and where my government can't be bought out so easily by giant corporations.

Perhaps if you use Google a bit more too you'd find there are many legitimate (scientific based) concerns all over the place for introducing widespread GMO food.

Or perhaps you're saying in all your infinite wisdom you know better than Australia, Austria, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Poland, Russia, Switzerland and a ton of other countries that have banned it? Believe it or not there are a lot of very smart people in those countries that aren't just trying to spread ""FUD""

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","If you're new to modded MC, then you probably want to check out Feed The Beast.  It's a very popular launcher / set of modpacks with popular and great mods.  Unfortunately, the website isn't updated / doesn't have great listing of mods, http://www.feed-the-beast.com/mod-packs but it should get you started.

Once you download the launcher, you'll be shown a list of modpacks you can download via the launcher.  The complete list of mods can be found in the description of the pack, inside the launcher.

Personally, I use MultiMC5 to play.  It's a different launcher, more focused for the ""power user.""  Of course, the modpacks are compatible between both, since a modpack is just a bunch of .zip and .jar files (along with their config text files.)  Anyway, MultiMC is great for setting up your own custom packs, tweaking settings, and testing.  

Mods in Minecraft are generally awesome.  The amount of time and effort that mod developers put in to a free mod just astounds me at times.

If you're completely new to MC mods, I'd suggest these mods:

**Not Enough Items**.  (on your inventory screen, allows you to spawn in any item.  Shows stats pertaining to blocks and items such as how long cresote oil will burn for in a bio-generator and how much total power one bucket will produce.  Can also be used solely in recipe mode, so you can find out how to craft stuff, and in what other recipes they're used, but unable to cheat yourself in items.)  NEI IS A MUST.  **CodeChickenCore** is a library that is required by NEI, as is fairly common with other mods.  Not relevant to you if you're using an FTB pack, only if you're making your own.

**BuildCraft** (item transport via pipes, combustion engines, quarry, etc. etc.) 

**IndustrialCraft** (power generation, ore processing, power tools, nuclear reactors, etc. etc.)

**Applied Energistics** (store items as bits of data, data processing, item transport, sorting, auto-crafting, etc. etc.)

**Forestry** (automated farms, bee breeding, liquid production, tons of new trees, etc.)

**Railcraft** (huge number of new rails, steam boilers, locomotives, etc.)

**Biomes O Plenty** (tons of awesome new biomes.  Works great with another mod, Alternate Terrain Generation, which creates huge mountainous terrain.  Both are extremely customizable to suit your tastes in world generation.  Big Trees is another great one that doubles, triples, quadruples the size of trees.)  See a screenshot I just took of my new base location here:  http://i.imgur.com/twm175d.png  (Jade Cliffs biome, with ATG and BigTrees.)

**ComputerCraft** (computers, touchscreen monitors, and mobile computers that can use virtually any tool called Turtles.  It uses the LUA programming language, which is actually very easy to get into, and has a lot of support and examples online.  You can also save and download custom code via Pastebin.)

**Factorization** (similar to BuildCraft, a few neat toys, mostly ore processing, storage, and item transport.)

**MineChem** (a mod that's recently getting major facelifts, allows decomposition of materials and fabrication of new materials via chemistry.)

**Mystcraft** (travel to new randomly-generated ages, perhaps filled with lakes of Oil or Honey (if Buildcraft / Forestry is installed), mountains of Netherrack, and tendrils of diamond ore.  Very fun to create custom ages—single biome, checkerboard, huge, etc.)

**Steve's Carts** (while Railcraft adds rails, SC adds literally millions of cart options.  All carts are customizable to be used in tree farms, mining tunnels, transport of items, liquids, power, and players, and much more.)

**Thaumcraft** (extremely fun and rewarding magical mod.  I'm not a big fan of magic, but this mod has great visual, great balance, and some mechanics you can't find anywhere else.)

**Redstone In Motion** (allows creation of structures that can be moved with motors.  Most popularly, frame quarries, that dig up the landscape, move to a new location, and keep digging.  Very rewarding to build a frame quarry from the ground up.)

By using just these few mods I've listed, you'll be increasing the amount of stuff you can do by well over 1000%.  You can build machines (that work cross-mod) and giant systems.  

For a great list of mods, check out http://bot.notenoughmods.com/1.6.4.html

I'm hesitant to direct you to /r/feedthebeast since it's mostly kids who downvote good content, but there certainly is a lot of content over there.

Sorry I can't recommend actual modpacks, as I create my own packs, but again, just download the FTB launcher and you'll be presented with a few great packs to play with.  Just remember to get the latest builds of the 1.6.4 versions.  (The versions are listed in the pack descriptions, the builds are listed in a small dropdown box on that same screen in FTB.)","1391213389"

It eneded up being a very close vote and her efforts to swing middle of the road democrats against the bill played a large role in its failure.

Unfortunately since she likely wont face a primary challenger we will again be forced to choose between the lesser of two evils...hooray for the two party system.

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","I'm assuming you mean Dempsey, Willian, Salah, and Knoplyanka? Let's address them in that order:

* **Dempsey:** Ownership would not release the funds to get the deal done. That's not on Ayre. Also, Dempsey barely played, for Spurs and was shit for them when he did. He then played a few matches for Seattle, and was shit for them. He then went back to Fulham on loan, and has been shit for them too. We dodged a huge bullet by having ownership stand firm on a valuation.


* **Willian:** He has been solid for Chelski this far, but has be been $30+ million good? Not even close. And who sits if he had him? Not Suarez or Sturridge. Not Coutinho. Not Lucas or Gerrard. That leaves Hendo and Sterling, who have been awesome this year. So, do you think Willian has been $30 million better then either of them? Not a chance.

* **Salah:** Chelski's deal is 12 million up front with escalators that will probably see the final total on the deal reach 16+ million. Same questions apply to him as to Willian, but more focused out wide. So basically, Sterling. Is he $12 to $16 million better than Sterling? Almost certainly not.

* **Konoplyanka:** He was never intended to be signed this window, so no one from owndership down to the manager was prepared to negotiate on a short time frame. AND THAT IS OK. We tried to get a deal done for him under difficult circumstances, and it didn't happen. So what? He was not seen as a high enough priority to negotiate for ahead of Salah. He couldn't have been that important to the manager's or club's needs, otherwise *he* would have been the one we went after first. He was a fallback plucked out of future considerations.

For fuck's sake, none of these players are or were necessary! We're scoring goals at an alarmingly high rate, and we aren't giving up that many. Our goal differential is **18 better** than the 5th best team in that category!

THE FUCKING SKY IS NOT FAILING. IAN AYRE IS NOT THE ANTICHRIST. THE TEAM IS FINE. TOP 4 IS WELL WITHIN REACH. RELAX.

"serbia","t5_2ql0k","I'd just like to interject for a moment there. What you are referring to as 'Muslimani', are in fact Srbi/muslimani or as I've recently come to calling them 'Serbs+Islam'. 'Musliman' is not a nation in itself, but rather part of glorious Serb nation, consisting of Catholic Serbs variantas Croaticus et Slovenicus (s. Serbicus), Proper (True) Serbs and Asian Serbs (native to Tokyo region), and others, comprising a fully developed Serb System.

Many people of Bosnia are living as Serbs without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of Serbs most commonly found in Bosnia are called 'Muslimani', and many of them are not aware that they are basically Serbs, as made by the Great Serbia Project.

There really is a 'musliman', and these people are belonging it, but it is just a part of who they are. Musliman is a religion: a system of beliefs that makes people kill eachother over who's imaginary friend has a bigger penis. The religion is an essential part of the Serb System, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a Serb nation. Musliman is normally used in combination with the Serb System, the whole system is basically Serb with Islam added, or Serb/Islam. All the so-called ""muslimanski narodi Balkana"" are really people of Serb/Islam.","1391213396"

The Soviets had a very sophisticated tactic of using networked cruise missile submarines, and high speed bombers with high speed non-ballistic anti-ship missiles to counter carrier groups.  China has neither of them.  There only hope to counter multiple carrier groups is to use attack subs, and while they might sink a few ships or even a carrier, I don't think that will be enough to really ""win"" in the end.

The Chinese would have a difficult time conducting operations with limited electricity, limited fuel, and limited aircraft being available.  You can attack airfields with cruise missiles but without any air support you can't really do much after that.

Not so much makeup as skincare, but with the *loud* encouragement of /r/skincareaddicts, this week I gave up using St. Ives apricot scrub on my face, and I'm also trying really hard no to pick my blemishes. Sounds kind of gross, and it's been super difficult not physically exfoliating (UGH WHY NOT? IT CAN'T BE *THAT* BAD), *buuuut* I've also noticed that the cystic blemish on my cheek that comes and stays for months at a time (it was there for almost a year once), is actually disappearing *in the span of a week*.

You know, you don't have to just take this kind of treatment.  However, the longer you go just accepting it as part of the package, the more your sense of self-respect will be eroded.  The more you'll feel like you probably deserve a lot of it.  The more likely you'll be to just go on accepting it.  Afterall, you'll have invested even more in the relationship by that time, and anyway you love him.  Right?  But you don't deserve to be treated this way, and there are tons of decent guys out there who won't do this to you.  

At a bare minimum, you need to move out.  Like, yesterday.  You need to just *not* be in a situation where you're trapped in the vicinity of someone so unstable, with such extreme anger issues, who's willing to use you as their verbal punching bag.  You'll be miserable (you already are!), and then you'll be trapped, and then it will very likely escalate to physical abuse.  

If you don't have the money to move again, then now's the time to call in favors from people.  You don't want to be living there with that ticking time-bomb for even one more month.","1391213401"

Anyway, study is good, but for the most part, if you're in public US schools, your curriculum is arranged around prepping you for whichever tests are next--whether they're due to state or federal requirements. 

What you absolutely ***should not*** do is pull all-nighters. The more you sleep, the more you'll be able to retain what you've studied. Oh, and a healthful diet wouldn't go wrong, either. Don't get too worked up over it, if you do poorly you can retake them, and if you get stuck on a question, move on. Spending five minutes on the *chance* that you *might* figure it out is more detrimental than getting through a few easy questions that are lurking deeper in the test material. Puzzle through the tough ones after you get the easy ones done. Not sure if they use the same ratio of time per question as when I took mine, but.. ultimately our proctors got to a point where they took role of who was still doing the test within the last fifteen minutes or so, and ... nobody was...

 [**Caregiver syndrome**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver%20syndrome): 

---

&gt;**Caregiver syndrome** or **caregiver stress** is a condition of exhaustion, anger, rage, or guilt that results from unrelieved [caring](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caregiver) for a chronically ill dependent. The term is often used by health care professionals, but it is not listed in the [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders). Almost 66 million Americans are providing care to those that are ill, aged, and/or disabled for an average of 39.2 hours per week. Over 13 million caregivers are also caring for their own children as well. Caregiver syndrome is acute when caring for an individual with behavioral difficulties, such as: [fecal incontinence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fecal_incontinence), [memory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory) issues, sleep problems, [wandering (dementia)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_(dementia\)), and [aggression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression). Typical symptoms of the caregiver include: [fatigue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue_(medical\)), [insomnia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insomnia), stomach complaints, and so on with the most common symptom being [depression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood\)). Roughly 70% of caregivers suffer from depression. Due to the deterioration (both physically and mentally) of these caregivers, health professionals have given this a name, Caregiver Syndrome.

"excel","t5_2qur2","I totally agree, I hate that too.  In 2007 excel only lists the sheet name after you click on another sheet while building the formula.  There are 2 options (3 if you include named ranges) I use to fix it.

Link everything on the current sheet first in the entire formula, works fine for shorter formulas

Or do control F and replace all by sheet (in the sheet you are want to remove the name) and just leave the replace blank, just type in the exact way the sheet name shows up in one the the formulas (ie Sheet!).

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Back when I was in high school (graduated in like 2010 I think) there were choices to take ""academic"" and ""applied"" courses. 

Academic courses generally lead you to universities and applied courses generally lead you to community college.

I only took applied courses just because it was the easy thing to do, never took anything like calculus, advanced functions either because I never thought I would need it.

Then I discovered how cool programming is and how much I like doing it and that's where the idea came from that maybe I could go to community college for that.

The laws were almost entirely ignored, except for large scale bootleggers in which case the local authorities had the help of the feds.  The feds just didn't (and still don't) have enough agents to enforce such laws.

"Sasquatch","t5_2saia","What you miss in sunrise sets you will gain in sunset sets on the Columbia River. It's my happy place when I fall asleep, you won't be disappointed.

I think Sasquatch isn't really more chill than 'roo, just different. People definitely party, loudly. The shows just don't go as late, so late night parties take place at camp. There are usually pop-up shows in the campgrounds though, both DJs and bands, which are awesome. So you can walk around all fucked up and find a million dance parties. If you want to get good sleep, upgrade your camping and just party in the main grounds.

It is FAR less crowded than 'roo though, only 25,000 people v. Bonnaroo's 80,000. It's also a lot smaller, I think the furthest walk I've had from camp to venue was 25 minutes. My last year at 'roo we had a 50+ minute walk. In the desert heat, it sucked. Hard. Which is the other benefit - at least in May it won't be super hot. It probably tops out at MAYBE 90 if it's really really hot, and is about 40 overnight. So you can actually get out and see shows during the day rather than cowering in the shade.

As for the crowd, PNWers are a bit more laid back. The crowd used to be more ""mainstream"" but then they stopped selling 1 day passes so the 17 year olds stopped coming as much and it's a more diverse crowd. I haven't encountered many douchebags, mostly really awesome people who are there to have a really good time.

For referrals you need to submit the person you are referring First &amp; Last Name, Phone #, and Email. That's why I offered since you can't just find a link online. Hope this info helps.

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","I tried the whole ""I'll get used to it"" thing before, but sometimes you just can't get used to it. The only time problems occur for me are knee angle, and when the reach to the bars are in some mid-tuck postion. I'm either wanting to be full forward or almost straight up.

Those times when you can't get used to it are when you tweak your bike with little add ons and doo-dads, but they have to be small tweaks, none of that ""If I can just move the bars a good 6 inches back it would be great!"" kind of stuff. If you find yourself needing to modify your bike A LOT to get it where you want it, find another bike. 

With that said, modifications can be great if you want to lower pegs just a hair, or raise your bars an inch or so, but I don't know of any sport bikes that don't use clip-ons. You'd have to go towards heli-bars or the sort. 

If you sort your bike out right, you could pull a 600 mile day and feel like going back out for 300 more. I don't think this article was implying that you could get your bike to be as comfortable as you car, but if you can add some stuff on your bike for relatively cheap that makes your ride more enjoyable, why not?

"crochet","t5_2qm6c","I've used a few:

Knitpicks Stroll Glimmer - This is about 70% wool, 25% nylon, 5% metallic. While the yarn itself was fine, I didn't like how the metallic looked in it. It was just flecks of silver and not truly sparkly.

Cascade Sunseeker - This one I like a lot - in fact, I just bought more this week. The sparkle in this is more of a really shiny green/yellow plastic than the silver metallic in a lot of yarns. The fiber content is essentially 50% cotton, 50% acrylic, minus the little bit of sparkle in there. I recently [made a shawlette out of this yarn](http://imgur.com/a/jwm5I), and although the pictures don't show it too well, this yarn looks fantastic in person. This gets my recommendation for best sparkly yarn I've tried.

Feza Night - This one is viscose and metallic. It's pretty soft, and I've used it for a few small projects (snowflakes, poinsettia). I'm actually planning on using some in conjunction with the sunseeker in a knit shawl soon.

I know it's a tall order, trying to convince people that they need to watch 12 episodes out of a 15 episode series before judging it, but I can't stress how true enough it is. 

And it works, too. All the friends I have that have considered dropping it got to 12 and went ""oh shit, this series is actually really, really amazing"", and they've all finished the entire rest of the series that's been released so far.

In the end, you just need to try it. If it doesn't work for you, maybe set it aside for a few years, then come back to it when you've matured a little. One thing I've noticed in the people who've read it is the more experienced you are, the better it continues to get.

"SS13","t5_2s9yk","At first I had no idea what I was doing. Didn't really care for it, infact it sounded like the most boring and complicated game ever.

Then I ended up on a goonstation server at some point and started learning the UI, figuring out how stuff worked and slowly becoming competent. (This was Donut station 2.0) At that point the server was probably one of the weirdest servers in existence. I don't know if any servers still had this, but making Poo and spreading it everywhere was something a lot of people did, Janitor had a traitor weapon that killed people and left poo everywhere (Portapoo) and grief was the letter of the law. At some point the station sorta kinda mellowed out, for instance they started cracking down on sec abuse (don't carry your gun/baton around because people will disarm you, close the doors because people will run inside, etc), and while there's still a level of admin chaos that happens, it's no where near what I remember. Also they got rid of Poo because it was awful and people kept making poo smoke and flinging poo at people, in addition to feeding it to other people so they would get food poisoning and make more poo.

The station was weird at the time and I pretty much only stuck around because of the admin chaos was unlike a lot of other games.

Over time a lot of stuff is more fun, for instance they redid medbay and surgery, added a vr area, and a lot of extra zlevels, like for example dying on that lava station, or that other area, or that Ice station getting mauled by a yeti or freezing to death. When they happen telescience expeditions can be fun, and the occasional space fight with a drone can be fun too when looking for loot.","1391213418"

Consciousness too I view as something which in hindsight gives reason or justifies the urges we have. Hatred was caused and as you indeed implied, reason, like it does in science, then finds to the best of its capabilities the cause of that pain so that it may get rid of it. When it cannot it, it must invent something like God so that even though the thing which is found is false nonetheless rids peoples of their pains. If people randomly die (because of a virus), then the reason that God willed it is much better for a people than having no reason at all. 

Hatred is like a natural resource which, under the right conditions, can be extracted, pipelined and unleashed upon many things. It doesn't matter what the thing is it unleashes itself upon; like God, having a fairy tale or convention rid peoples of their pains. ","1391213418"

Shield bug (*Acanthosoma labiduroides*), stink bug(as far as I can tell, same species as shield bug), pill bug (*Armadillidium vulgare*), lady bug(*Coccinella magnifica*) are *not* scientific terms; and pill bugs are not insects because (among other reasons) they don't have wings but are called ""bugs.""

There are other examples besides ""pill bug"" that are non-insects, but colloquially a ""bug.""

You are right in that bug used to mean insects (in fact there is an order called ""true bugs"" (Hemiptera) in the insecta class), but there is no class that is officially a ""bug.""  But nowadays you get people referring to most animals of about the size of an ant or bee as ""bugs.""

-Bug is really an informal designation, so combining scientific terms with colloquial ones is a confusing issue.

With that said, lets give him the benefit of the doubt for just a second. Most of what the article discusses happened well before his MMA career started.

I then created a encrypted folder using TrueCrypt and dropped the PDF/paper wallet into here - therefore anyone wanting to view my paper wallet has to break the encrypted folder. (Basically anything placed in this folder is encrypted)

I'm not a programmer - and am new to bitcoins - but this is the simplest method of securing my bitcoins. Now if I can only figure out how to use the paper wallet - as blockchain is not letting me log in since I chose the 2 Factor Authentication - i'd be a happy chappy.

Before two wards would have to be placed at either end of those specific bushes to get vision of the whole bush. After the gardeners came through these bushes and all other bushes can gain full vision by placing ONE ward in the CENTER of the bush. Furthermore, the per summoner ward cap emphasizes this style of ward placement if trying to see an entire bush.

This tri-bush example is good because at that level of play some teams want vision on an enemy BEFORE they reach the bush. Im not sure if this was the intended play but both teams failed to properly place for full bush vision.","1391213424"

"startrek","t5_2qixm","The Chief is kinda at the heart of the two shows. TNG is about how we deal with success. The Enterprise functions well and is maintained with great care. The crew is well adjusted with themselves and others. Codes of conduct have years of empirical evidence backing up their merits. When problems arise, they are dealt with, most likely because the characters wanted to tackle them in the first place. The Chief was in charge of the transporters. They work. They only go wrong when the story calls for something randomly horrible, when they are disabled, or when it becomes necessary to show a scientific problem. Data or Geordi usually field those. 

So the Chief has little to do other than be an example of this well functioning society. He's the familiar face, happy to help and knowledgeable about his trade. He works.

DS9 however is about how we deal with failure. Everything goes wrong. The problems are ugly and difficult. Resolution is infrequent. Kira is racist, scarred, and angry. Sisko is idealistic, realistic, and unsure all rolled into one. Odo is in control of himself but is perpetually lost in a chaotic system. Quark is just stuck in it all. 

And the Chief, our dear friendly face, he tries to keep going, just like on The Enterprise, expecting things to go right. But the station does not give back. It doesn't do research. It doesn't do diplomacy. It doesn't encourage self improvement. DS9 just sits there in space. So the Chief maintains and fixes and kludges and makes do and improves where he can. Everyone does.

I changed out the motherboard because you had a Micro ATX board. Even though it will still work fine, the one I picked out would be more suited for the case and has more RAM slots if you ever needed to add more. Also changed out hard drive to a cheaper one, the black cost too much for no real performance. And last thing I changed was the power supply which is a semi-modular.","1391213429"

With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, [ 5 ]
Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top

In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
Rose out of Chaos: Or if Sion Hill [ 10 ]
Delight thee more, and Siloa's Brook that flow'd
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Lol, that video is so true. 

Pretty much sums it up. Of course some people make it work despite the disadvantages, but really the ultimate disadvantage is losing the personal communication. A lot of communication is actually done through body language and tone, and even in video calls you can lose a significant portion of this. Additionally, it's much easier to build a rapport with people in person, and honestly a lot of business relies on this. You have to know who to go to get X done, or you have to get Y to trust you to push a project you want through. 

That's not the say it's impossible to do this remotely, it's just more difficult.

Some kind of pop-up box in the middle of the draft asking if you want to use? It sounds like a nightmare having to reprogram the entire draft environment for 1 card. And we know how good WotC is at programming clients..

Side note: Note that the card says that you have to draft it face-up. You can't do that on MTGO. (Unless you want loads more pop-ups every time someone drafts it / puts it back.) I'm sure this is mainly for cheating purposes, so you don't put your 14th pick into a pack and claim it was a Cogwork Librarian. While the cheating concern is alleviated on MTGO, drafting it face up also has implications for signaling if you really pay attention to the draft. You won't know if this is a fresh cogwork librarian in your pack or if someone took 2 cards out of the pack. It won't matter in like 99% of drafts, I'm sure, but it certainly has an impact in the 1% that it does matter. ","1391213432"

Best to find someone at your company that is an A++ player who you can take these types of clients on for you that is up to your standards in terms of client care. 

I take an agents renter leads and lower value (under $375,000) leads, because they don't want to deal with renters or buyers at the lower end of the market, I'm willing to as I know that if I maintain a relationship that a good percentage of them will end up buying, like you said.

But I get what you mean by being offensive. The defense or RED team has to be offensive with it. This means making use of the Kritzkrieg's faster charge rate and popping it before the offense or BLU team can uber in to take out the sentries and capture last. Every time the RED team offensively pops it, they have to make sure they take out the medic.

TL;DR Kritzkrieg is good to use when defending but has to be used offensively to prevent the offensive team from ubering into last.","1391213440"

You seem to be assuming that the default position of any form of intelligence is peace and goodwill toward other intelligences. I'd say that, if anything, there's ample evidence to the contrary. In which case, what makes you think they *wouldn't* be abrasive? I think it makes obvious sense to assume that something vastly more intelligent than you a) wouldn't care about you, and b) would have internal workings so complex and inscrutable to you as to be unfathomable, and thus not open to persuasion.

&gt; the society that creates it

Again, you seem to have a whole lot of culture- and species-specific assumptions rolled up in there. What fundamental aspect of intelligence implies respect for one's creator? If such a thing does exist, it seems likely to be tied to the biology that an AI would be completely free of.","1391213443"

A few things that our southern hemisphere neighbors have engaged in during their drought:

* Grey-water recycling
* Incentives for homes to capture rain water
* Heightened water regulation among businesses 

Simple measures like these would lessen our dependence on snowpack, give more water to the inland farmers whose livelihoods are being destroyed (and re-vitalize their economy), and doesn't shed all the rain straight into the ocean. I can't be the only one who feels weird after every rain, and looking into the storm run off and think, ""That's.... so.... much.... water going away.""

I know there are plenty of political reasons why we are where we are. I also know that LA's infrastructure is designed to be highly efficient at keeping our streets flood-free. But we can at least enact a few simple things to plan for a long-term drought. ","1391213443"

Well seemingly [we can't even agree if it _is_ a language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scots_language):

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","A few reasons:

1) It's an unusual demographic for a murder.  It's...rare for study-abroad students to murder each other in a foreign country.  They're an affluent group, and don't often have a real motive for murder.

2) Tabloid speculation around the murder was intense, particularly in italian and british presses, adding a lot of heat but not a lot of light on the situation.  Various crazy theories were put forth (this is the source of the bogus ""Demonic ritual"" allegation).  A lot of nasty stereotypes got banded around--Italian police thugs, loose american women, etc.

3) The american, italian, and british judicial systems are very different. Mutual distrust and misunderstanding of the legal standards for evidence and conviction in each country has led to allegations that the other country has a corrupt system.

4) The case had a number of irregularities:

 --Amanda Knox's initial statements of her activities the night of the murder changed many times (maybe, not so strange when interrogated in a foreign language)

--Rudy Guede (one suspect) fled the country, while Knox and Sollecito stayed and cooperated with investigators from the outset

--There was ample evidence implicating one suspect (Rudy Guede) in terms of DNA/blood prints at the scene.  There was little implicating Sollecito or Knox, sans a clean kitchen knife that was found in the apartment that allegedly had Kercher's blood on the knife and Knox's DNA on the handle--except that this knife was not processed according to evidence standards and was dismissed at Knox's 1st appeal.

--Most importantly, prosecutors failed to outline a reasonable motive for Knox to murder Kercher.  In the case of Rudy Guede--there was evidence showing he sexually assaulted Kercher, so the motive was there.  In the case of Knox, prosecutors failed to outline a plausible motive--instead bringing up standard roommate lifestyle tensions and *theorizing* that Kercher died as part of a ""sex hazing gone wrong"".","1391213443"

"bourbon","t5_2rgos","My point (again) is that the relevant comparison is not modern GMO vs. ""natural"" plants.  It's GMO vs. other methods of artificially inducing selection that are less effective, potentially and actually far more dangerous and give us far less idea of what's going on.  ""Genetic roulette"" is the pre-GMO method -- mutagens and radiation-- to artificially induce variety.

The point isn't that this isn't done or shouldn't be done at all -- as you've said, sometimes you need to understand complex phenotypes --- the point is if you have a target or a few of them, that wildly firing around a bunch of shotgun shells in random directions (which is what you get from the randoms) is much less likely to hit the bulls eye than aiming a rifle at the targets.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt; Now your bias is kicking in. You only want put weight on the stats that  favor Montana.

Not true. Certain stats just **do** favor Montana. Favre has more yards and touchdowns (obviously). And I would agree that Favre was better than Montana at extending plays, and throwing the ball downfield. But he threw more interceptions, had a lower completion percentage, and a lower quarterback rating. Those aren't stats I found that just favor Montana, they're a pretty popular metric that a lot of people go by. 

And I know a lot of people are saying that Super Bowls don't matter, and I personally don't think they're as important as most analysts, but the dude went 4-0 in the Super Bowl. Not 1-1, and not 2-3. Like I said, I would base any claim off of only Super Bowls, but when they are factored in **with** stats, then it makes things a bit clearer.

"vegetarian","t5_2qm7x","I wouldn't call myself vegetarian but in the last few months, I've never had meat when I was eating at home (which is a lot of times) and a lot less when eating out of home.

The main reason is probably environmental, and then health reasons. As someone said in another comment, eating meat is unsustainable if the whole world does it.

One thing though, a few years ago, I was one of these people who think they can never do without meat. I still enjoy a good steak or fish from times to times, but the switch for me was probably when I traveled to India and realised afterwards that I had been eating vegetarian stuff almost the whole trip and it didn't bother me at all (It was actually delicious). Since it didn't really feel like making an effort, I decided to give it a try and I'm pretty happy about it !

"CanadianForces","t5_2skgl","Here is what WikiBot found on ""mk44 bushmaster ii"":

**Mk44 Bushmaster II**  
&gt; The Mk44 Bushmaster II is a 30 mm chain gun manufactured by Alliant Techsystems. It is a derivative of the 25 mm M242 Bushmaster, and uses some 70% of the same parts as the M242 while increasing the firepower by as much as 50% with the 20% increase in caliber size. The barrel is chromium-plated for extended life. The gun uses standard GAU-8 Avenger ammunition that is available in API (Armor-Piercing Incendiary), HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) and APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer) variants. One interesting possibility is the ability of the gun to be converted to a caliber of 40 mm, which involves changing the barrel and a few key parts, to use the so-called Super 40 cartridge. It can also be converted to use the 30x170 mm RARDEN cartridge.

We could of course ask how much input would have to increase by (proportionally) to increase output, but you are right in that it ignores that when output increases, firms may change the proportion of inputs.  

Inputs are usually discussed in terms of labor hours and rental cost of land and capital.  These are all measured as *flow* not stock so as to get costs in terms of a flow.  For example, we can't say how many computer programmers Apple employs.  We can say how many they employ (in hours) over a year/month/week.  To be consistent, land and other capital inputs are also measured this way.  So we don't say 'how many computers' does Apple use to program, but rather how many computer hours over a year/month/etc it uses.  ","1391213461"

TL;DR - Plantinga's argument relies on using the theoretical aspect of evolution while ignoring the empirical evidence it is based on. If you involve the empirical evidence, his argument becomes self-refuting.

&gt;Based on the summarized lecture from http://www.calvin.edu/academic/philosophy/virtual_library/articles/plantinga_alvin/an_evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism.pdf

&gt;Alright. Here's my take on the argument made in that lecture:

&gt;Plantinga seems to think that Darwin and Churchland would have assigned either a low probability to ""our observations are fairly accurate"" (P), or a significant ""degree of inaccuracy in observations"" (σ, which I'll interpret as the relative standard deviation, a common measure of variation). Let's say he would grant P=0.25 / σ=0.8 - the precise numbers don't matter, I'm just trying to give a sense of 'side' and scale. I don't think the quotations he has presented from Darwin and Churchland warrant such unflattering values. The Churchlands are both strong supporters of neuroscience - using their words as an argument against naturalism (and thus science) would likely be going against their intended meaning. The quote from Darwin definitely appears to have been taken out of context - Darwin was responding to a letter from a colleague who held a teleological, perhaps almost Deist view, so if anything, the quote, in context, would be more usable as an argument against Plantinga's position than against naturalism. I don't know precisely what their views were on the validity of perception under naturalism, but judging from their views on matters closer to the surface of that world view, I'd say something like P=0.8 / σ=0.1 is a more charitable assessment of Darwin and the Churchlands.

&gt;He claims that a large subset of possible beliefs could produce selectively beneficial behaviour for any given situation, which is true. However, in order to use this to argue against the accuracy of our perceptions, he has to assume that our sensory apparatuses evolved either alongside or after cognition. Since he is using an evolutionary argument, I think it is reasonable to bring in evidence showing that perception appeared long before cognition. Take the eye as an example. We have a complex light-receiving organ that connects to our nervous system, but there are much simpler systems in much simpler organisms. The simplest such organ would be a single photoreceptor molecule - when a photon hits it and gets absorbed, the photoreceptor's shape changes, and maybe the single-celled organism has some protein that will respond to the change. I highly doubt that would produce a belief in an organism, given that such an organism is not capable of having beliefs. But it certainly does qualify as perception/sensation.

&gt;And then for the intermediate stages. Plantinga's argument would require a high probability of significant delusions appearing in higher organisms, to the point where the original sensory input does nothing but decide the context of the delusion. I would argue that this would be selected against: since organisms had relatively accurate perception well before developing cognition, and introducing such dramatic obfuscation of sensory input would increase the cost of the system, this would provide a fitness disadvantage with no corresponding benefit. The probability of such delusions persisting would be low, and the probability that our faculties are fairly accurate would remain high.

&gt;It seems that Plantinga is arguing based on a purely theoretical understanding of evolution with no practical examples to support his case. This undermines his entire argument, since the theoretical side cannot stand without the practical side - the existence of his defeater relies on ignoring the basis for the scientific theory that he attempts to use to show the existence of the defeater. The only key point I agree with Plantinga on is that we can't justify P=1.0 / σ=0, but I highly doubt that there are any naturalists even remotely involved in science who would disagree.

&gt;As the evolutionary basis for his argument is, at least in our universe, non-existent, naturalism does not have a defeater in evolutionary theory. The only defeater it does have (barring a future appearance of some supernatural being) is common to all epistemological positions, and wouldn't be worth pursuing as a criticism against naturalism. (i.e. my argument on axioms where all beliefs require some degree of faith/irrationality)","1391213462"

edit: I would suggest browsing through http://magiccards.info to discover new cards. Here's what I do:  

I browse through whatever mechanic or set is on my mind, and flag whatever cards I like best. If I like a card so much that I want it for my own, then I go to the page for that card, click on the ""Buy @ TCGPlayer"" link above the card picture, and then click ""Add to cart"". Then I move onto the next card I like and do the same. Once every few months, I go through my cart, weed out any cards I don't feel like buying anymore, optimize my cart and check out. I get all sorts of cool casual cards this way. I personally wind up spending an average of $0.20 to $0.40 per card, but I never get any cards I don't like (and if you buy a box of random cards, you will get *lots* of cards you don't like).

TCNJ is a much, much smaller school, but I enjoy it because you get to know the people and the professors around you much better, which will be very beneficial in a lot of ways. 

Additionally, I'd say there are way less distractions at TCNJ than a school like Pitt would create, which I think is a benefit to balancing school work and social life. I am NOT saying that TCNJ is boring or has nothing to do however. I have tons of fun here.
Lastly, as pompous as it sounds, TCNJ is a much more competitive school to get into, and in my opinion, attendance here would put you above an equally qualified student from Pitt. Also, because of the smaller sizes of classes, TCNJ is able to provide more opportunities for research and internships than a school like Pitt could provide, that's a fact.

Never understood why LoL players thinks MORE information to gain is WORSE than what LoL offers which restricts information in all aspects of the game, from champ knowledge to runes and masteries.

Knowing all heroes gives an advantage in terms of skill, someone who has only played 5 heroes for their entire duration of play is hindering themselves and is also fooling themselves thinking they GAIN knowledge from NOT having all knowledge available like in Dota2, which is just wrong, the more info available = the faster people can gain knowledge and increase their skill level, restricting access = hinders their learning and decreases the amount of knowledge that can be gained, basically keeping them from improving their skill level.","1391213467"

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","Yeah, I'd seen that on the Insomniac website.  I understand that it was a theme piece / teaser.

My points were primarily that:
(1)  Trailers / teasers non constrained by any resources are generally better looking than the games they give way to (clearly Halo 5 isn't going to look as good as the Halo 5 teaser), and the Sunset Overdrive one didn't even look that good as in-game footage.  (Part of it may be due to the art style / color palette not working well with my color blindness).
(2)  The character design seemed pretty uninspired.  A skinny, thin-lipped dude, a apish-looking guy, a generic girl, and some super generic zombie-monster things.  Perhaps that's all been fleshed out better, but the trailer didn't set the bar very high at all.
(3)  It didn't even really give me any idea of what the game was like.  In the developer walkthrough they talked about some of the themes and ideas that it contained, but that left all kinds of questions.  Is this a FPS?  A third-person shooter sandbox-style game?  I assume the latter, but the trailer certainly didn't help me out.

My intent wasn't to trash the game or be down on it, but merely to point out that my response to the actual game looking better than the trailer was ""It'd better be!""  Aside from the color palette and character design issues, I don't have any particular concerns about the game.","1391213469"

I was actually inspired by [this guy](http://www.lawdevnull.com/2013/10/tgd-law-year-1-recap/?utm_source=&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_campaign=), who posted his complete first year financial info.  Hopefully, my experiences will be able to help someone else who's just starting out.

1. I definitely aim for a 40-50 hour work week.  Though I love being an attorney, my family comes before my job, always.  

2. I already get free access to Fastcase through the Florida bar.  My practice areas don't really require a lot of legal research, and what do need I can usually find through Fastcase, Google Scholar or firing off a quick email to another attorney who's experienced in that area.

3. I'm already there.  I got a Fujitsu Scansnap IX500, plus I have free reign of the big copier/scanner combo the firm I'm renting from owns.  It helps that Florida started requiring electronic filing last year, so everything has to be scanned anyway.  The only originals I keep are documents you need the originals of, like deeds, wills, trusts, powers of attorney, and so forth.  

4. I use fax.com.  Works well.

5. A free copy of Adobe Pro XI came with the above-mentioned scanner.  It's already saved my tail a couple of times.  I've also got the full Office 2013 suite.  

Marketing is still a work in progress.  Yeah, it's pretty much all referral based at the moment.  I've done the following so far, but I'm having trouble thinking of additional strategies that don't cost a lot of money... Let me know if you have any input:

* Attorney networking: I've sent out letters and emails to pretty much every attorney in the area, letting them know about my firm and offering to help their clients if they have any needs in my areas.  I've also taken a bunch out to lunch to pick their brains about the actual practice of law.  One of those new clients came from a PI firm that needed me to open up a probate estate so they could process a wrongful death claim.

* Professional networking: I've also met and talked with a bunch of bankers, investment advisors, realtors, home healthcare workers, nursing home administrators, and others that have a connection to people that have Medicaid or estate planning needs.  Another one of my new clients came from a local nursing home that needed me to help them get one of their residents qualified for Medicaid.  I'm in the process of printing up rack cards to send out to every nursing home in the extended area so they can be put in the admission packets that are given to families when a new resident comes in.

* Lawyer Referral Service: my local bar association has this service, and I'm on the list for my practice areas.  So far, the service has sent about five people my way, but for various reasons none of them turned into clients.

* Telling everyone: I made sure everyone from my closest friends and family members to people I have seen since the third grade knew I was doing this, and to spread the word.  I've wound up doing some work for a couple of family members and one of my wife's co-workers, but I'm still waiting for that to bear some more fruit.

I also have a website for my firm, where I've started a blog that I try to update weekly.  I've heard that's supposed to make you an ""authority"" or something over time, so why not.

Thanks for the encouragement.","1391213471"
"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Why not choose both?

When God created the universe, He created it in the best part of the life cycle for man to live on earth. So the earth was not created an infant planet, but a mature one, just like Adam was not created an infant human. God made the universe age appropriate for His creation. Why would He make a new unstable universe, when He knew exactly what He needed and the exact age that was best for His purposes? Did God create eggs or mature birds; did He create mature animals or helpless new born ones? God created a mature universe with mature life.

If modern science could have examined Adam’s body the day after he was created, they would have said he was an adult man (because he was) even though he was only a day “old.”  God created a “millions of years old earth” because a brand spanking new earth would not have suited His purposes. God created a mature earth that shows the process of ageing just like Adam did.  


God would know how old of a solar system He needed for His creation. How old the sun needed to be to become stable enough to sustain life. God create the heavens and the earth at the appropriate age for His creation, just like He created Adam at the appropriate age.

I get that it's not the most tasteful of outfits and this is the second dress I have ever made,  but she wanted a princess dress to wear on her 10th birthday so I let her pick the pattern, material, appliques and whatnot herself.  I have a pile of vintage saree I imported from india at £10-£15  a pop and this took up half of one.  Next dress for her will be that same basic style but with one layer and floaty sleeves with no notations at all [material](http://i.ebayimg.com/t/Floral-Design-Vintage-100-Chiffon-Silk-Fabric-5-Yard-Sari-Saree-Flower-/00/s/NTgwWDEwMDA=/z/TJgAAOxyVaBS02gp/$_57.JPG)  I'm also going to put ribbon laces up the back instead of a zip. 

edit: this new material is the most beautiful fabric I have ever seen, it's some sort of satin silk blend and *flows* it's quite thin but not transparent and even brighter in person. 

edit: I am wondering if there is some connection between the top post on reddit being a upcycling of a old shirt into a dress and people in the new queue thought this was bandwagoning.

"Spanish","t5_2qtt1","I took AP Spanish as a senior as well. I only went that far because I loved the language so much in the first place, finding it easy like you do. I continue to study Spanish in college- AP Credit almost guaranteed a minor for me, but I think I'm going to double major with one being Spanish. One thing that I did a few years ago was find a Spanish speaking pen-pal who was my age using [this website](http://www.mylanguageexchange.com/penpals.asp). This person wanted to learn English, so we added each other on Skype and have been teaching each other ever since, from little grammar things to slang (that most, if not all, classes won't teach you).

There are always opportunities to travel abroad for any amount of time. Many colleges have such programs with various lengths, such as a week, term, semester, or academic year. True immersion like that is one of the best ways to solidify your language learning. As SeanSnarf said,
 &gt; If you have a strong base, strengthen it. Just because you know a language doesn't mean you'll live in a country that speaks the language.

It could be like ""Get 15 assists in one game"", or ""Get below 50 health without dying"" or something simple and not too complicated, but still incentivizes (is that a word?) play.

This would encourage people to try to go for achievements rather than try to win. For example I might spam /laugh right at bot tower until I get to 50 hp, then arcane shift/flash away. I risk feeding a kill, waste a summoner, and lose time in lane as I have to recall, but I get my achievement. I might try to give up kills as adc to get my 15 assists for the day, and as a result the enemy may get away or the support will get the kill(fed adc&gt;fed support).

The issue is that if achievements manipulate players into playing a certain way, it ruins the competitive feel of the game. Winstreak achievements also can cause massive rage ie ""OMFG I was 3/4 on my streak achievement go kill yourself"".","1391213480"

I'm not going to lie to you, it is hard to accept this.  I have no idea of the concept of sex without love.  She even offered to let me experience it and I can't do it. 

I know that not everybody thinks that way.  But I also know that I am not totally alone in thinking the two actions should be connected either and I think upbringing has a lot to do with it.

That's the entire point of this thread, how is this going to work.  

No, I don't want to tell my future son or daughter that it's okay to have   a three way and that sex should be part of a relationship. 

I think it's my right to feel this way and tell my kids this as well.  But I also respect my GF and would want to know how she felt prior to making these decisions.

Just FYI my GF never had a threesome.  Believe me she was honest enough with things that if this were the case she would certainly have had no reason to ever lie about that.","1391213480"

Agreed!

I just don't think that means we need to treat the discussion on hair and covering as the only ways of doing that. Indeed, I think you'll find that I specifically talked about the appropriateness--not just culturally, but theologically--of women appearing ""feminine"" and men ""masculine"" (for whatever that happens to mean in a particular time).

But again, I think what really hurts you is that, contrary to your earlier assertion, for most of its history, there has been on consensus that your take on the passage is the best one. For most of its history, the church has held a position closer to the one I described.","1391213481"

As you probably know, in previous generations the woman either didn't work or gave all her money to the husband to take care of (my own mother did this).  But that gives total power to the husband and husband's family to threaten the woman with kicking her out if she didn't behave the way they wanted to.  Being financially independent--which thankfully more women even in India itself are becoming each day--allows the woman to say ""FU"" to the in-laws' demands.  ""Your son can leave, I don't have to go anywhere.""  Pretty f'n badass if you ask me.

Fortunately my wife is perfectly fine with *me*, and at crucial moments when my parents really got out of hand I took *her* side and not theirs.

First of all. What's the purpose of the crazy guy in the straight jacket on the right? I don't think he has any purpose

Using the controls is a bit imprecise and some what detracts from the experience. I feel that the game should focus on time management and planning. A great way to improve this aspect would be to add a slight delay to the travel time of the elevator. Having to decide which floor you stop at and not being able to stop it until it has reached it's destination floor could add a lot to this. Also, spawning multiple passengers on each floor might make it more complex and entertaining.

Passengers who wait outside of the elevator too long should get frustrated and leave.

Also, instead of using the scroll wheel or arrow keys, the game would benefit a lot if everything was controlled with the mouse click.

Knowing where people are is everything in CS, especially since it is round by round. Plus, it only takes a few bullets to kill people.

In TF2, the flow of the competitive game is entirely different. You respawn a ton, it takes more to kill people, and while location of players is helpful, there is still a lot more to TF2 than just getting kill. There's a lot of strategy / positioning and teamplay in action.

In CS, if one person hacks on a team, they can turn the tide of an entire match if they have half-decent aiming ability.

"bicycletouring","t5_2sdwm","Here is my one BIG complaint with the Safari, and if you plan to tour soon consider it. I feel there is a flaw with their choice of butterfly bars. You can only install them in lower, bending down position. If you try to flop them the brake cables hit the stem. In it's default config, the grips are *way* too low for a touring bike. Some quick googling and you can see many people complaining, and installing stem raisers, etc. I commuted on mine for over a year with it just kinda bugging me, but if I was putting in serious miles it would have been a deal breaker. Then, I had a gnarly crash and bent my bars. In replacing them, a local shop had several different brands of butterfly bars, and I found one that worked much better. They could be installed where they bowed up, raising all the hand positions (especially the grips, which sit about 3 inches higher). Now it is perfect.

I love the Safari. Sensible, durable, parts (nothing fancy). Strong, 36 hole 29er disk-ready wheels (and disk mounts). The ability to run 42c tires with fenders (got the SKS chromeplast 50mm in silver, looks great).

It is a great bike, but if you can negotiate different bars when you buy it, I'd do that.","1391213488"

When they *do* mix, it never works out for long, because the people with low principles inevitably try to take advantage of the other.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","I am assuming the Pre-Cambrian explosion is what they are trying to use. Basically that there was a huge differentiation of life at that point in time and some people argue it is impossible under the current model of evolution. Many have pointed out that evolution happens at a fairly steady pace, but it does vary. The nay sayers believe it is too much variation to explain.

Baryon Asymmetry is simply matter v. antimatter. In typical matter from nothing reactions, you get both particles and anti-particles. If the observable (assume this any time I say universe) universe formed from such a process, there should be equal (or nearly so) amounts of matter and anti-matter. There is little to no antimatter in the universe however. This has a few possibilities. One is that it simply was not that type of process that started the universe. Another is that there is an asymmetric decay mechanism that is lopsided in favor of matter. (Think nuclear decay, but for subatomic particles.) 

A believer would say that the matter-antimatter asymmetry is evidence of a higher power using the God of Gaps fallacy. 

Of course, there is the WAP that he mentions. Which is silly. We exist thus god. Always a funny one. And no, that is not absurdly simplified. It really is that absurd. ","1391213489"

Hosts shouldn't ban me, because I record every single game and will upload full matches if I am accused of using hacks.

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Not much any more. I used to think it was cool to have free soda in the kitchens, but it don't cost them much and rots your teeth. At least Microsoft also offered juice and milk.

An office matters reasonably much. If I were considering a job exactly like my current one (big office, no window outside but I can see outside windows) but with a tiny cube, I expect it would have taken north of $15k/year to convince me to work in the one with the cube. I guess that's perhaps not a ""benefit"" per se, but the OP seemed to include environment and that's part of it.

When it comes down to it, people value benefits differently&amp;mdash;value is subjective&amp;mdash;and the company's goal is to provide benefits that cost them less than people value them. I'm not saying every company offering a foosball table is a sneaky trickster; but none of us are naive enough to believe they're doing it just because they want us to have fun.

Don't let good perks mask bad fundamentals (which /u/mdf356 covered), but if the fundamentals are good, then there's nothing wrong with them. Figure out how much is worth to you (approximately) in cold hard cash when deciding about an offer or between offers when you add/subtract line items like travel time, ESPP, 401k matching, etc. so that you don't mentally overvalue them.","1391213494"

The reason it's nonsensical to assume Government intervention in Quark is simply that it is not ""more secure"". That's a myth, perpetrated by non-technical Quark holders. If Government level agencies intended to attack crypto-currencies or manipulate their prices, they would have no need to bother with Quark.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You are not taking into account a lot of things. First of all, hypothetical countries, people and cultures would be nothing like they are now. A person on pangea will probably care more about politics and world struggles than we do now, simply because being connected by land is far more involving than sea. Take a look at the US. We don't give a shit what other countries do, short of building a nuclear arsenal. Attacking by sea is by far the most inefficient and ineffective way to invade a nation. When borders are touching, tensions are higher, and consequences more drastic. Just look at Europe from 1900 to 1980s. People shat their pants when somebody in another country sneezed. 

As for the faster trains etc, it actually makes a ton of sense. Trade is important. In our world, goods are shipped by sea, as it is the most efficient way to move stuff across water. Since maritime trade is less useful on pangea, they got to move goods across land. Do you expect them to do it with the most expensive and inefficient method of travel? (air). No, they will use trains, because it is a continuously large amount of freight that can be move across the continent in a few days. ","1391213495"

But right now, in the comics, Lex is more of an Elon Musk-type in his ways, if that makes any sense - but he's still just asruthless and intelligent. And Eisenberg can really nail that role, I feel. He did great in The Social Network as a similar role. In addition, he and Henry Cavill are the same age (though in the Man of Steel canon, Superman is 33 years old, so if they have Eisenberg at the same age it will be interesting since he doesn't look it) - which makes me wonder if they will go the route where Clark and Lex knew each other in Smallville.","1391213496"

 [**Kessler syndrome**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler%20syndrome): 

---

&gt;The **Kessler syndrome** (also called the **Kessler effect**, **collisional cascading** or **ablation cascade**), proposed by the [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) scientist [Donald J. Kessler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler) in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in [low Earth orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade—each collision generating [space debris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) which increases the likelihood of further collisions. One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render [space exploration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration), and even the use of [satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite), unfeasible for many generations.

[This](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/pdf/wk/mm6135.pdf) source shows no change in the DTaP vaccination. [This](http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1209051#t=article) study shows it could be a change in human genetics that are becoming immune to the vaccination, people not getting them as often as they should, and the original DTaP doesn't cover B pertussis infection which is what they're seeing an increase in. 

Regarding the slight.. debate I had with an individual in the past, she was convinced pertussis is on the rise *because* of the people who don't vaccinate their children, which is also what this article is stating. The source linked to this article is not reliable, ~~not to mention you can't find where or how they collected the data being used in the graphic.~~ okay, the information in the graphic is user-submitted... lol. 

I'm just trying to encourage critical thinking here because while I was searching for articles, I basically saw the same saying being parroted over and over again all over the net (pertussis is on the rise because of selfish anti-vaccinators), but the real evidence shows something completely different. People in the US are in fact *not* decreasing the use of vaccines, and the strain of B pertussis that wasn't covered in the vaccine to begin with is the specific strain a rise is being observed in.

Play only acceptable after finishing housework that has been let build up, and all that. It's the leadup that determines whether it's fair or not. Unfortunately, it seems like Nparents see things normal parents do in extremis, on Pinterest or parenting forums or whatever, knee-jerk apply them out of the blue, and expect the reaction and relationship to be exactly the same.

&gt; In judging the action of whistle-blowers, three criteria apply. They must have clear and convincing evidence of abuse. Publishing the information must not pose a disproportionate threat to public safety. And the leak must be as limited in scope and scale as possible.

I don't know where these criteria come from, outside of the author's own beliefs. I (and wikipedia) judge a whistleblower as one who [""exposes misconduct, alleged dishonest or illegal activity occurring in an organization.""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistleblower)

As far as the Criteria: evidence of abuse? Yep. Their (the NSA's) actions have been found by multiple organizations to be clearly illegal and unconstitutional. No judge has ever indicated clearly or verbally that these actions are legal and constitutional; rather, they avoided the question with the inferral ""If the actions have been allowed to occur under other judges, they must be legal"", yet they were based on an only tangentially related decision that did not address the legal question that all of these programs were built upon. So, clearly illegal, clearly unconstitutional, clearly an abuse upon the American people, as well as the rights of all the other people of the world with an internet connection.

Next up: ""Publishing the information must not pose a disproportionate threat to public safety"" I love this one. I love it because the response ""But terrorism!"" gets thrown about so frequently to try to avoid discussion that it's become a corollary to Godwin's Law. There is no threat in advising the public that their communications are illegally being spied upon, unless the threat to the public safety is violent revolution if they should discover these violations of their rights. Unless the enemy is the public, there should be no problem in advising the public that they are being monitored.

""And the leak must be as limited in scope and scale as possible."" Well, in all the exposure, there has been careful redaction of certain details that could endanger people. Apart from one specific instance in which the New York Times did not know how to redact a name from the document, nothing else has been exposed that should not be. All information being released points to violations of civil rights, of constitutional issues, of illegal activity. It's not like the information being released involves James Clapper's bathroom activity or pornographic preferences...though maybe it should, when considering the fact that the NSA know all these things about all of us.

And if you're patient, you don't need any fuel storage on the surface, since you can fill your fuel-hauler while it's landed.

For mine, I just put a drill, converter and K-tank on the surface and [landed on it](http://imgur.com/a/3Wrk2).  Then I hauled the fuel up to an orbital station.

 * Argan oil to moisturise
 * Vaseline on sensitive areas (undereye, chin, sides of mouth)

The best advice I can give you is just keep at it. It will be slow and tedious but keep going. It can be really frustrating starting over gain but do not give up. Eventually when you get back to your old skill level, or even pass it, every note will feel twice as sweet.

This is also a great opportunity to learn something new. If you can't read sheet music try one of those beginner books that works you through the notes one string at a time. You have to retrain you fingers, why not learn a useful skill in the process?

Money can be made but that's principally individual  stabbed plexers or dedicated mission blitzers. 

Real FW corps are far more about the good fights than making ISK. PVP and FW is definitely more of an ISK sink than a money printer for new players doing PVP. To grow a FW corp and attract players, (particularly good pilots in addition the noobs) you need to be comfortable with the FW mechanics and tactics of small gang PVP in low sec and be able to FC small fleets. Having some successes and getting involved with and earning the trust of established FW corps and alliances will be a must but given you're starting out cold with a fresh character you also risk being labeled a spy and shut out early. Really the advice is to just join a FW corp and see A) if you even like FW, and B) get the lay of the land (both in terms of the mechanics and established groups) before striking out and establishing a new corp.

Even if it was literally leaving at 12am and arrive at 9 the next morning, I think I'd probably have a better mindset and perform better if I had some division between the two.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","While I *was* thinking of visual novels when I made that post. They're excellent uses of video games to explore the human condition, rather than violence.

However, you cannot possibly believe that visual novels are even slightly relevant to western gaming culture, which is what ANY discussion on r/games is actually about. I could make a million threads about Katawa Shoujo, and it would only ever get maybe 5 upvotes before falling off the face of the Earth.

Further more, I never said I had anything against super violent video games. You simply assumed I did. I love GTA, God of War, and plenty of other hyper-violent video games. But video games as a whole tend to either make us feel awesome for shooting a bunch of bad guys, or make us feel bad for shooting a bunch of bad guys. I see video games as an art form, and almost any video game that I would consider art still hinges around the concept of violence. Shadow of the Colossus, Spec-Ops the Line, Dark Souls, Bastion, all of these center around violence. I can only think of TWO video games I've played whose central themes don't concern violence, and one of those still uses violence as a major gameplay mechanic. Persona 4 and Katawa Shoujo.

I'm not saying that violence in video games is bad, or that there can be too much violence in video games. I'm saying that exploring nothing but the world of violence will make games take much longer to develop than if we actually experimented with things.","1391213519"

With guys like Patterson, Peterson, Jennings, Rudolph, Kalil, Sullivan, Smith, everson, Rhodes, and Walsh, who could all be top 15 players at their positions, plus some young guys with potential like mauti, Floyd, and wright, there's a lot of reason for optimism. Personally, I think we're in good shape because of rick spielman. Everytime he makes a move I'm not sure about, a week later I'm sold. All he's done as GM is get great talent, or guys who are better than where they get drafted drafted, and not let a coach who, if he lives up to the hype could be great, not slip through his fingers. He's got plenty of fire power with this draft. Look at San Fran. They turned it around with coaching (although harbaugh is childish to me), and they ha much less talent on offense.","1391213520"

Quickest Way to 80:

* Don't worry about it on your first run. Unlike other MMOs, the game doesn't ""begin"" once you hit max level.

* If you care about strict speed, the quickest way to 80 is crafting. It's expensive and prohibitively so on your first character.

* The best, natural way to lvl80 is to do your personal story missions and do dungeons' Story Mode once you become of-level. Also, do the ""Hearts of Renown"" and events that you see littered around the map. If you're enjoying the map or feel stunted, go for 100% zone map completion.

It's not really troubling at all, because new clips are coming out all the time (unfortunately, so are the hoaxed videos).

However, recent instant YouTube classics like ""I think I saw a skunk ape, please help"" and the one from just the other day from Alberta Canada which shows what looks to be a huge sasquatch making a quick retreat into the woods are good signs that the next great bigfoot video is on its way. 

The Skookum cast shows documented ape behavior (reclining on a side with the back leg dug in for support) and the exact hind foot and leg area one would expect to correspond with the 17"" tracks collected from the same expedition. Is it definitive? No, not to people who haven't already accepted it as a reality. But to those of us that realize it's been proven already it's crystal clear evidence that a bigfoot was there.

It's stainless steel, a much more solid and precise razor than others made from pot metal and chrome. Definitely a treat for a first-time shaver.

For a brush, I definitely can agree with /u/justateburrito that [Frank Shaving](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Silvertip-Badger-Hair-Shaving-Brush-Richmond-Faux-Ebony-/270721363770?pt=US_Shaving_Hair_Removal&amp;hash=item3f08402f3a) is a great choice, but I'd also like to chime in that many say the [Simpson Wee Scot](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product/simpsons-shaving-brush-wee-scot-best-badger/) is their favorite brush, and it comes at an affordable price. If that looks a little small for your boyfriend, the [Simpson Case C1](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product/simpson-case-c1-best-badger-shaving-brush/) is a very similar brush at a larger size, for only about $9 more.

**EDIT:** As /u/justateburrito points out, the Wee Scott is probably too small for a gift. To go with a Simpson's brush, the C1 is a better choice. The [S1 Special Best Badger](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product/simpson-special-s1-best-badger-shaving-brush/) is equal in price to the Wee Scott but a much more significant-looking size! (thanks /u/kcbeemo)

For soap, I really think you can't get much better than [Barrister and Mann](http://www.barristerandmann.com/shaving-soap/). Good prices, great soaps, and his Cheshire and Bay Rum scents are particularly well loved.

[Fine Accoutrements](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product-category/aftershaves/fine-accoutrements/) makes some of the most well-loved aftershaves around, so I'd definitely suggest going with one of his products. I linked to Maggard's here in case you get the shaving brush from them (to save on shipping), but if you aren't already ordering anything from Maggard's, it's best to buy his stuff from [his web site](http://www.fineaccoutrements.com/).

That brings the total to about $150, so of course if you want to buy a bowl and stand (many shavers don't use these things, especially a stand: for a beginner, many consider it money better spent on higher quality gear). There are many options for bowls, but personally my favorite so far has been a big cappuccino mug I got from Wal Mart that's about 5 inches in diameter. If you end up being able to fit it in your budget, [Blake's shaving bowls](http://www.maggardrazors.com/index.php/product-category/shaving-bowls/) have been receiving high praise lately.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","That's probably what bothered me about the Rumble more than anything. They could have done a multitude of things to get the RIGHT kind of heat in the match.

Why not have Wade Barrett take the #30 spot and mock the fans with some more bad news? That could have directed all that heat toward Barrett's new gimmick and maybe turn him into one of the most hated guys on the roster.

Why not have Triple H come out in his wrestling gear at #30 with a shit-eating grin? That would have been a TON of heat and would have guided all the ANGER everyone had toward Triple H directly. That would add a ton to the storyline, I'd think, of Bryan vs Trips, leading to a logical match at WM30 (even though I'd MUCH prefer him in the title match, obviously)

Why not have Bryan actually be #30? That pop would have been MASSIVE. Hae him tear it up for a few minutes, knock out two or three guys, then JUST as it seems he's about to win, Batista, from behind, throws him over the top rope? That heat would have been NUCLEAR and would have instantly turned Batista into the #1 heel in the business. Then Bryan would have every right to fight toward taking out Batista and earning his way into the title match at WM30.

ANY one of those ideas would have been better than leaving him out entirely and then not even referencing it at all until the next night. It earned huge boos for Rey Mysterio, who did nothing wrong, and then ruined Batista's ""big moment"" when they should have been cheering for the returning ""star,"" but instead were booing the hell out of him because Bryan got royally screwed.

I just don't get it. All three of those ideas would have led to the SAME result we got anyway. Bryan doesn't win the Rumble. Batista does. But the heat generated could have been used in a good way instead of frustrating the HELL out of everyone and having no real target for their fury except for ""WWE Creative""","1391213525"

Back then, this (along with bands like The Red Chord, Despised Icon, etc) was what was considered deathcore. It wasn't until more recently that bands like Suicide Silence, Carnifex, and Bring Me The Horizon (old material) started incorporating more death metal than hardcore influence and playing in lower tunings.

I don't want to split hairs about the genre, if this isn't deathcore enough for you, fair enough, but I know I'm not alone in having been introduced to the genre through bands like KWD.","1391213525"

With this, I decided to go with a solid CPU and a decent GPU to then possibly upgrade in the future. The 270x isn't terrible, just don't be expecting [60fps in crysis](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/radeon-r9-280x-r9-270x-r7-260x,3635-11.html) with everything maxed out. But again, for its price-point, its a really nice card. Unfortunately with having to fit in windows and a monitor, the I couldn't fit in an ssd, though again you could add it in down the line.

This guy has the A10 APU in it, which really doesn't come close to a [dedicated GPU in terms of performance](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7677/amd-kaveri-review-a8-7600-a10-7850k/12), but the build comes out to about 100 bucks less (I added an SSD with the additional budget, so rule that out if you don't care about the quick boot up times and such). To upgrade this in the future, just add an R7 card and you can then crossfire the GPUs and have a really beefy machine.

I know this one is 15 over, but I just picked the ASUS version of the GPU because I happen to like the cooler. This might be the one I would lean more towards because the [GPU in there is actually really powerful](http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-760-review-gk104,3542-10.html), you would just be sacrificing CPU power, which arguably doesn't mean a whole lot for gaming and the CPU is still relevant today, so it's not something I would dwell on.

"canada","t5_2qh68","With all of this wireless technology there has to be a way that end users can partly take control of content distribution.

In larger cities, each internet-enabled home could feature a wireless router that, in combination with many others, forms a large city-wide peer-to-peer network for distributing information, managed completely by end users. Corporate servers located in such cities would have the option of routing some of their traffic through this P2P system. It likely wouldn't be able to handle all of it, or even most of it, so the traditional ISPs would still be involved to a large extent. But a P2P system like this could presumably just be the beginning, and might bring an end to the entire ISP business model given time.

Not sure what folks in rural areas would do, though. Even the most basic cellular coverage tends to be pretty spotty in many areas outside of medium-sized cities.","1391213537"

I believe it was Cornyn that, back during the universal background checks push, put up a bill that allowed a gun purchaser to print out a sheet from the NICS website to bring to a gun transfer while the seller can call a phone number and verify the sheet (and thus NICS clearance) is legit. It went nowhere because it did not require a record of the gun's serial number to be sent to the government.

She provided key support when our first IVF cycle failed. She gave me a hug and said, ""Go home and be with your wife now, don't worry about your cases.""

1. Install Windows (Or if you already have it installed, skip to #2)
2. Boot into Windows, and use Windows to ""Shrink"" the partition by a few Gigs.  2 Gigs should be enough.
3. Boot into your live instance, and use gparted to format that empty 2 gigs with EXT4
4. Try to install.  It should now recognize your Windows partition.  You should see the ""Install alongside"" option, or be able to manually configure if you choose. 

There are a few utilities in Linux that people say can fix whatever is going on with the HD, but the problem is if you run them they'll trash your Windows install most of the time.

Ingredients

10 Medium – Large Jalapeno’s (3-4 inches)

8 oz – Philadelphia Cream Cheese

¾ cup – Grated Cheddar Cheese

1 package of bacon

1 Tbsp. – Good Shi* – Sweet n’ Salty Seasoning

1 Tbsp. – Cayenne Pepper

1 cup Pulled Pork or 20 little smokies sausages

Instructions
Begin by slicing off the stems of the jalapenos and slicing them in half. Remove all the seeds (unless you want these extra spicy).

Next, you’ll want to mix your cream cheese and cheddar cheese in a bowl together, along with the Cayenne Pepper.

Take your mixture and spread it into each sliced jalapeno, sprinkle half of the Good Shi*, leaving enough room to also add your meat on top.

Next, you’ll want to mix your cream cheese and cheddar cheese in a bowl together, along with the Cayenne Pepper.

Take your mixture and spread it into each sliced jalapeno, sprinkle half of the Good Shi*, leaving enough room to also add your meat on top.

Cut raw bacon in halves, wrap the jalepeno and secure by using a toothpick.

Grill ABT’s using the indirect heat method on the Big Green Egg, setting up the plate setter with legs down. You can position the ABT’s directly 
on top of the plate setter at around 350°F.

Allow the ABT’s to cook for 15 minutes, then flip and cook for another 15 minutes and check for doneness. You’re basically trying to ensure the bacon is thoroughly cooked before calling it done.

Remove the ABT’s, allow to cool for 5 – 10 minutes, serve and enjoy this amazing delicacy.","1391213540"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","From my experience, people who say that ""God does not create people as homosexuals"" are the ones who also say that homosexuality is a choice.

On a theological level, yes, a person can say that homosexuality is a result of the fall. This means that the potential for a person to be born gay is there. Not necessarily because you God made you that way but that is the nature of the world. 

So my previous comment is not accurate, but I do get tired of certain views out there. 

Most, if not all, people do not choose their sexuality. It is a complex process that happens on a number of different levels through one's early childhood. A person may disagree with the homosexual lifestyle, but, in my opinion, it is wrong to try and belittle them by believing that they chose that life. We should embrace them with the love that every brother and sister deserves. 

The Church should inform a person of it's view on the matter. That person then has to make the decision on if they can accept what is asked of them. They should not be condemned and rejected simply because they are homosexual. If that person can accept that then they will have to struggle to uphold what the Church asks of them (celibacy). That struggle is the same as everyone must deal with be it chastity in marriage, alcoholism, gluttony, or any other issue that the Church sees to deviate from the holy life. No amount of prayer is going to instantly turn someone from being a homosexual to being a heterosexual.

Hopefully, that doesn't sound too confusing. My opinions on the matter are at odds with the orthodox teaching so I am trying to discuss it in that matter without putting my person opinions into it.

&gt; I don't know if, in any case, comparing us to animals makes much of a solid case for or against it....

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","I was always under the impression that only one or a few events had changed when transitioning between realities. The Lutece Twins remarked that there were always constants in between realities; that there was always a Booker, an Elizabeth, a gunsmith, weapons, a rebellion, etc. The realities they entered were simply variations of the starting reality. Everything was constant up until the very first change.  This would allow for Fitzroy to still have her offer open for acquiring weapons or Booker would've joined her rebellion found the weapons to aid her and then captured the flagship, etc.

My emphasis is that everything (character personality, events, the overall history) is relatively constant with the original reality up until one point. Then, and only then, did things substantially change that reality.

---

Now, it's hard to say how either could know what were constants and what weren't. It would also be difficult to know which reality they were in at any given time or how they could knowingly transition back to their original reality; however, it seemed that the original reality wasn't what became of importance. It was the source of these realities that was most important - the constant that created Columbia - Booker's baptism.

Booker's original intent was to find the girl and get paid. By the end, his mission was to save himself, his family, and the string of realities centered around Columbia. Elizabeth(s) and Booker conclude that Columbia is a destructive reality, that its positive impacts were far too minimal to outweigh its negative impacts across multiple realities. It's unspoken but evident, to say the least.

Inevitably, it had to be erased so, the Elizabeths of each Columbian reality come to an agreement and decide to stop the constant (aka the source) that creates Columbia. They wish to restore balance to the universe by going back in time to destroy themselves. It creates a paradox but it's the only logical understanding I've deduced from the whole thing and its the only way I've made sense of their use of travel.

 [**Cultural appropriation**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural%20appropriation): 

---

&gt;**Cultural appropriation** is the adoption of some specific elements of one culture by a different cultural group. It describes [acculturation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acculturation) or [assimilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation), but can imply a negative view towards acculturation from a minority culture by a dominant culture. It can include the introduction of forms of dress or personal adornment, [music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music) and [art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art), [religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion), [language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language), or social behavior. These elements, once removed from their [indigenous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples) cultural contexts, can take on meanings that are significantly divergent from, or merely less nuanced than, those they originally held.

"gaybears","t5_2s0a3","I help run the social charity group ""Bear Albany"" in Upstate NY, but I lived in SF during the rise of the Bear Community in the 90s. Needless to say, I'm a huge fan of the Bear Community's philosophy and roots. It was founded on the ideal of accepting everyone no matter their race, creed, size, gender, or otherwise. While there had been little pockets of bears since the 70s, it didn't really explode until the mid 90's. Like a reaction to all of that negativity and elitism dished out by the twinks and muscle queens of the previous era. Suddenly everyone who didn't subscribe to that ""perfect"" gay pornstar look had a home; whether they be considered chubs, cubs, bears, or chasers. Hairy or hairless, you had a home with ""The Bears"". Nowadays there are more bear groups and bear events worldwide than any other gay subclass. We're also the largest contributors in helping gay communities through charity parties worldwide. In fact, I challenge you to find more than a fews weekends a year where nothing bear-related is happening somewhere in the world. 


Unfortunately, over the past decade we've seen a huge spike in negativity creeping its way into our once prosperous community. I think a lot of this has to do with ignorance and segregation. Years ago, I remember talking to a several guys at the bars who were told they weren't bears or cubs, but they were wolves, chubs, or otters. And I thought, what a terrible feeling to be subcategorized by the community you thought was your home. When I asked what they identified as, it was almost always a bear or a cub--and what people chose was sometimes surprising. Since then I've taken up a personal ""Keep it Simple"" policy: Bear or Cub, pick one and go have fun. And I always try to avoid using those other terms of segregation in an effort to ensure everyone at our events feels welcomed and part of our family.

Beyond that, there also seems to be three major bear subgroups who that are stirring the honeypot. The unfriendly hairy muscle bears who want everyone to workout and look perfect like ghosts of the long dead 80's muscle gays. They are the antithesis of what it means to be a bear and tend to rome in small packs like hairy Benetton Ads. My friends and I coined them as ""Spice Bears"" back in the late 90's when they first began to emerge. Next you have the negative hipster bears who are too cool to give back or participate in their community. While I personally love discussing alternative music, avant-garde film, and pop culture television; I really don't understand why you can't enjoy all that while still supporting your community. Finally, you have the ignorant MGBs ""Mean Girl Bears"" who want to make it a closed and unvaried community of just people they're attracted to. This too goes against the core ideals of the Bear Community and seems to stem from an ignorance of our struggled history. I suppose it's the inevitable cancer eating away at an overgrown community from the inside like nature culling the deer population. And it's a sad and ironic twist in the history of our culture that we've become our own bullies.

But at the end of the day I'm not too worried, because the Bear Community was forged in adversity. It's what has made us the largest and strongest subclass in the gay community today. And we'll continue to evolve over time as long as we remain open minded, open hearted, and avoid using terms of segregation. Bear Albany is a testament to that fact, and we're home to the largest, friendliest, and supportive Bear Communities here in the Northeast. Sure we have our problems, but we have an ever expanding family, and our event weekends serve as a refuge for thousands of bears and cubs in the Northeast states.

manners of behavior such as we possess.

"RadicalChristianity","t5_2ty95","&gt;There is a certain sort of ""interpassivity"" to the whole thing, as though the literature (and the food) is doing all the work for them (so they don't have to!) 

Giving away food and talking about militarism sounds like a LOT to me... I'm curious what more it's even possible to do?!  Because if there is something else, then I want to be doing it too.

Almost two years ago I basically founded an FNB group at my university.  ([I wrote about it on my blog](http://izbicki.me/blog/how-i-serve-150-free-lunches-for-less-than-20-cents-each-using-homebrew-equipment).)  We served between 50-200 free lunches every week on campus.  Making this happen took about 20 man-hours/week and cost $50-100.  In exchange, we became a (very small) forum for people of different backgrounds to talk about militarism and poverty.  I can't imagine a more efficient investment into the kingdom.

We were definitely not the ""special forces"" of radical Christianity.  There are certainly people out there having much bigger impact than us.  But I'm convinced that we were the infantry of radical Christianity.  And every successful army needs many more infantry than it needs special forces.

He sat on the polished marble floor of the downstairs library, cold seeping through the thin silk of his pant legs. Running his fingers over the sinuous whorls of brass and platinum inlaid on the watch's cover, he focused all his hurt and disappointment into the shining symbol of his father's absence.*","1391213551"

Drain whatever you can from the bottom.

While doing this, keep some of the better washer fluid in your car with the heat on full blast. Maybe put it right by a vent.

Close up the place where you drained it from, add the warmed up good stuff.

Enjoy.

-- Orl Fane is a poor, wretched creature that is driven insane by need for the Sword/Ring, aka Gollum.

-- The Skull Bearers are creatures who sacrificed their humanity to become the Warlock Lords most trusted servants.  They're black and their mere presence strikes fear into the hearts of all who see them (*cough cough* Nazgul *cough cough*). There is even a part where one of them almost kills Frodo/Shea.

-- Allanon puts the Hobbits, I mean Shea and Flick, on the quest to find the Sword of Shannara and guides them on their travels.  He of course falls in Moria/in the fires...only to come back even stronger.

-- You have the initial formation of the “fellowship” to seek the Sword following the council at Rivendell/Culhaven.  You have a dwarf, 2 elves, a few hobbits/humans, and a wizard.

-- There's a grand battle that certainly looks like it could have been a rehearsal for the “Battle of Pelennor Fields.""  At a city that has insanely high walls, and has kept the evil forces at bay for a long time, along with a battle at a river.

-- And you have Grima/Stedman poisoning the mind of a king to benefit dark forces.

A little comparison may help,Global Payments one of the largest worldwide providers of payment solutions, announced January 24th an agreement to acquire Payment Processing, Inc. (PayPros) for $420,000,000 

Pay Pros is a credit card processing company that has been in business for 20 yrs and has 58,000 merchants on their platform.

Bitpay, after 2 years has 21,000 merchants on their platform 

The initial seed funding for Bitpay in 2013 was in the millions and was paid back to investors within 6 months with a 600% return.

No need to flip at all, just smoke it with the fat cap up and the point towards the heat source.  Towards the heat source if you are using an offset smoker, other wise I suppose direction doesn't matter.  

The rub is up to you, but Salt and Pepper alone will be great. 

Let the meat sit at room temperature while you get your coals going.  I take the meat out, trim, apply rub, start my fire, and then put it on when I am at the temp I want.  I like to start around 230 F, hold there for 2 hours, then bring it up to 275 F for the remainder of the cook.

Vituperative and inaccurate.  Well done. 

I think it is dangerous for adults to force strict gender identities onto children that haven't even undergone puberty.

The science supporting intensive intervention is weak and the mental health outcomes corresponding to those interventions is poor.

The supreme court of Maine arrived at these conclusions, no doubt well-meaning, but unfortunately in such a way that forces parents to pigeonhole young children into irreversible medical interventions.

That's not something society should be doing.

My words here have no power of law, their ruling does.  Which do you think maximizes human flourishing and the proper development of children?

I'll quote part of the article:

&gt;Nicole is a biological male who identified as a girl beginning at age 2.

That's fucking nonsense.  What does that even mean?  Two year olds barely have a sense of self, let alone developed gender identities.

In the NBA, if you are a small market team and get really lucky in the draft, you will promptly lose your star player to one of the dynasty teams. 

And 90% of NBA games do not really matter. The NBA is only interesting during the playoffs. Every thing else is the preseason.

I agree with you too.

That is, total mental domination of the majority of the populace. It's as close to omnipotence as anyone will ever get to be.

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","What really matters is the definition and context. 

For a metric d(x,y)  you need to have d(x,y)&gt;=0, d(x,y)=0 iff x=y, and d(x,z)&lt;=d(x,y)+d(y,z). If you have a norm |z| that satifies |z|&gt;=0, |z|=0 iff z=0, and |z+w|&lt;=|z|+|w| then d(x,y)=|x-y| is a metric. 

Norms come in different flavors, but in an inner product space like R^(n) or C^(n) it's usually |z|=&lt;z,z&gt;^(1/2) by default, where &lt;,&gt; is your inner product. The default inner product for R^(n) is typically &lt;v,u&gt;=u^(t)v and for C^(n) it's &lt;v,u&gt;=u^(*)v.

Inner products have to satisfy their own list of properties, and from that you can prove Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and then if you set |z|=&lt;z,z&gt;^(1/2), from Cauchy-Schwarz you can prove |z+w|&lt;=|z|+|w|, and from the inner product properties |z|&gt;=0 and |z|=0 iff z=0.

All of these concepts get extended and have variations, so it depends. ","1391213567"

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","Yeah, I remember that feeling.  It's tough.  I was a drug addict for years.  I was concerned with what taking meds might lead to.  I made my doctor aware of this and there are other med options you can try first.  You don't have to start with stimulant meds.  If you want to try to it with out meds it will be difficult, but it's not completely impossible.  There a number of things that help.  The four biggest for me was:
-learn everything you can about what you are dealing with.  Read everything. 
-make a schedule.  It helps with school stuff.
-start exercising and meditating
-pay attention to your diet (I have been using a low glycemic diet, which seems to work for me)
Some of these things have been life changing.  Even though I don't think I could do school without medication, I have made plans to reduce the amount of medication I use or get off of it when I get out school.  My life is not perfect, but I don't expect it to be.  There are resources you can use on campus.  I make my instructors aware of my needs and what I'm dealing with and use accessibility resources to get longer time on my exams and have a room to myself to reduce my chance of being distracted.  Also, I do take stimulant meds and I honestly haven't had any issues.  I go to a therapist once a week and that helps too.  There are options.  Don't feel trapped by a limited vision of what having ADHD will be like.  There are many people living with this and they don't all do the same thing.  Somethings work better for other.  Be vigilant and try to be patient with yourself and those trying to help you.  I hope that helps. ","1391213567"

"technology","t5_2qh16","I disagree. Although you are right that devs optimize the best they can on a console for what they are given, and yes it is correct that there are many different setups for PCs, it doesn't conclude that this will mean it will perform poorer than a console. Especially considering the fact that you can toggle and adjust settings rather than being locked into the ones set by developer which try to maintain as much FPS as possible. Software updates for the GPUs also can allow more efficiency to get more performance out of the GPUs and into gameplay rather than consoles being locked by corporations. For example, AMD's mantle being utilized rather than direct x can allow the GPU's to render much more efficiently. With Development the developers on consoles will make adjustments to ""squeeze"" as much as possible out of consoles, but those adjustments aren't unique to consoles. They're settings such as lower anisotropic filtering, lower or no anti aliasing, disabled god rays, bloom off, etc. So assuming that the developer's are able to create a magical console setting that performs better on consoles isn't entirely correct. They just restrict certain settings that the PC platform aren't restricted to, and have the freedom to make alterations.","1391213570"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","It's simple.  Jesus was once asked why he was changing all the old laws (Matt.5:17-8) and responded ***unequivocally*** that no he wasn't changing anything at all about the law.  But, this then creates cognitive dissonance in believers.  They think Jesus is the epitome of good and moral - yet they are faced with him saying that you have to obey all the old laws - forever (including stoning women who aren't virgins on their wedding night, murdering children who sass their parents, banish menstruating women from society, murder homosexuals, etc...).  They can't fathom that their beloved Jesus would preach such utter evil.  He's so good, he can't do bad...  So, they have no choice, they have to come up with some way to make what Jesus said - the exact opposite of what he said.  To assuage their cognitive dissonance.

So, in comes the 'fulfillment of the law' and 'new covenant' crap.  

How about you post these verses which show you how you can completely disregard Jesus' own words?

Right, no one will.  Because nowhere in the Bible is this New Covenant described in anything other than extremely vague terms.  

Also, there's another problem with this.  Jesus specifically says that the law isn't going to be fulfilled while the earth still exists.  So, there can't be a new covenant or law today.  The Earth exists, then we have to follow ALL Old Testament laws.  And, that's straight from the mouth of Jesus.","1391213573"

I fully understand what its like to have a hard headed dog, and when you get pushed to that point of frustration where they are just SO aggravating and WONT listen! But, smacking him is definitely not the best way. If it was going to be an effective enough correction (as in, hard enough to discourage him from ever repeating a behaviour) it would have already worked. You said it barely seems to register, its probably just another thing that sometimes happens for him now. I doubt its even aversive. Dogs harden themselves to actions pretty quickly, which is why you see those dogs pulling on a flat collar or even check chain to the point where they're coughing and choking, yet they just keep going.

Theres a few ways to teach a leave it. You need to think about how he thinks about the actions, what you really want is for him to WANT to give up whatever hes holding, because he knows that he either wont lose it, or will be getting something even better. If you just take away whatever he has all the time, hes probably thinking something like, 

""I really like this bit of chewy stuff, and if I give it to you Im going to lose it forever. If I don't give it to you, I might get corrected which will be uncomfortable. I would rather keep it though, its worth the correction to keep this fun chewy thing""

I would start by teaching him to let go of a toy by using the game of Tug. [Heres how I teach it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcEjRQz4cm8). If hes likely to run off with the toy, you can try backtieng him to something using a strong lead and a harness also.

You also can layer in some conditioning that leaving food/objects is reinforcing in itself, [emily larham has a good video on this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNAOe1djDyc)

On top of all this, you could look into applying a physical correction with a tool such as an ecollar or prong, as a consequence for not complying with an action he knows.

Oxford:

The definition that you are quoting refers to country in the generic geograhpical sense (ie. a walk in the countryside). Not in the sense of a nation and its people and leaders, cities, towns, etc. Which is what we're discussing.

In other words, you're equivocating, and doing a very poor job of it.

Nobody said they did. You're misrepresenting and greatly exaggerating what was said. To the point bordering on outright lying.

Thank you for the advice, however I have never had a problem understanding the english language. I suggest you might want to do that though, especially legitimate. I don't think you quite have a grasp on what that means.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I think his expectations are a little weird. Like why is that the first thing you're commenting on? What is the purpose of bringing something like that up upon entering your home.

It's condescending, and it implies that his standards are better than yours, it's insulting. 

When he, hilariously, is still a child living at home, unaware of how difficult it is to keep a home clean. 

If he does it again, tell him simply that you don't invite him over to feel bad about your apartment, you invite him over to spend time with him. Point out how irrational it is to bring something like that up, while not offering any sort of reason for doing so. What is he, the fuckin pope? ""you didn't put any effort in"", excuse me? At that point I would have politely yet firmly told him if that's how he felt then the evening was over as far as I was concerned. If he can't see what you did, and only what you didn't, then he can get used to not seeing you as much. Pretty simple.

This is a person who is more concerned with their opinion and how they perceive things than the relationship itself. You are *his* girlfriend. When he comes over, he *expects* certain things, and you've tried to reason with him but it happens still. This will turn into something else eventually, something else that you're not doing that isn't good enough for him. He's not a nice guy, I suggest taking a break, letting him miss you, and maybe realizing that you can do better.","1391213576"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","I disagree with your premise that the ""rebuilding phase"" only happened in Seattle.

While in OKC, we decided to promote Scott Brooks, allow Sam Presti to make some incredible moves as GM (draft picks, getting Thabo, removing players like Robert Swift), dramatically change front office practices, and created, over the next few years, facilities that allowed us to be a championship worthy team (we didn't even have a practice facility for a basketball team).

These initial building blocks allowed for a few things to add to the marketability of the team:  After moving to Oklahoma City from Seattle, the team's operating situation improved markedly. In December 2008, Forbes Magazine estimated the team's franchise value at $300 million – a 12% increase from the previous year's $268 million when the club was located in Seattle. Forbes also noted an increase in percentage of available tickets sold, from 78% in the team's last year in Seattle to 100% in 2008–09.

I don't think it is so cut and dry as you seem to have decided yourself.  

Edit:  here is the answer to my question:  http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SEA/2008.html

If you think that was a gift, you are fooling yourself.  That shit team came with two or three cogs that allowed the rest to be shaped in a town that gave an interest to promoting the NBA","1391213581"

I probably felt half comfortable after about 45 minutes, and got completely used to it within maybe 3-4 hours? Again, it's just an estimate.

Once the adjustment was made, it wasn't a big deal that the sensitivity was different when scoped and not scoped. I'm sure it hurt me here and there, but it didn't feel ""off"" or anything.

And I have no idea what the default is.

Another thing: This is kind of a cheap trick that works for me to make my sensitivity seem lower even though it's not. I shoot a soldier bot for a while on tr_newbots at double my normal sensitivity before changing it back to where it was and playing for a bit longer like that. No idea why it works, but it does.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","sure, but this is kind of proving my point. Your friend doesn't see himself as evil. He isn't doing it because he is evil. Sure the other person sees the action as evil or bad. But that doesn't make your friend evil. Your friend is not thinking of ways to be evil to more people. That is what I am getting at. I don't believe there is just ""evil"" but merely misguided good. 

He feels he is doing good by punishing the person who left his roof open. He is acting as judge. I know, I'm like him. But that said, he won't feel evil, he will feel justified. Even if he says he does it for no reason, he does it for a reason. No one takes a risk just for risk, they hope for an outcome. It might not be obvious to the person.

If actions were done purely for no reason, why not jump out of a plane without a parachute? the fact is there are reasons for actions.

but again i'll reinforce my view. That no one sees themselves as evil, no once acts as a purely evil being. Evil is merely what we deem as ""stuff I don't like"" and society evil is ""things we all don't like"".","1391213584"

The value, as with most other things, comes from confidence rather than anything tangible. People have to want Doge for Doge to work.

People will want to buy Doge if they think there is going to be a future demand (and therefore a price increase). The price will go down if people either need to turn Doge into something they can spend elsewhere, or they believe now is the best price they are likely to get, and the market has topped out.

It's all about confidence, Shibe!","1391213585"

He would be in prison for like 2 years tops, just like Manning will be, if even that. If Snowden was truly principled he would come and face the music - making him a more sympathetic character. He's basically in a sort of prison already, of his own making, he might as well do real prison and then be able to live near his family and friends again.

Please try to understand how the justice system works before commenting on it.

On the subject of assassinations, Snowden is not a good candidate for it. He might be in China if he leaked Chinese secrets, but in the US system he's not (that's assuming you even believe that the US carries out extrajudicial assassinations on US citizens that aren't part of terrorist cells).

Hydrophobic surfaces are more like example A and hydrophilic surfaces are more like example C. The higher surface tension in example A increases the nucleation energy and makes it harder for drops to form.","1391213591"

"Wordpress","t5_2qhjq","Hi,
I tried your code, but it did not work. It seems that because multiple properties can be viewed on the same page within the site. It is created by a plugin called firestorm real estate pro. It calls all the images from a database, and it is written to the page independently. It does not add a margin to the aimages at all. It also does not show any divs anywhere that can be edited. The size of the main image is taken from a setting in a menu and run through a java module. I removed the size parameters in the menu, and added your snippets of code, but all it did was align the small images to the left of the page, and removed the main image. 
I am having a similar problem on the first page of the properties page which is a listing of all properties. It shows the address in full. Inspection of the page shows it as text in a paragraph, but it is not. It is pulled from different fields in a database. I can understand the code more or less, but I cannot find anything that shows what is being written to the pages.
Again, if you have any thoughts, it would be appreciated. I'm so frustrated, I would even be happy to give you the details to get into the back end, if necessary.

I have tried contacting the plugin guys, as I paid for it, but they won't answer mails at all, or any facebook requests, so this issue has been going on for 2 weeks now.","1391213596"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Of course no one buys it solely for the free games. 

But when your direct and basically only competitor (Sorry Nintendo) is offering the same service for cheaper (60 vs. 50 USD), having far more sales and discounts, and offering the caliber of games to download it is downright embarrassing. 

You would think that Microsoft, with the clear advantage in online services, would want to continue to improve it and keep that massive stranglehold on the market. But they're just fine sitting there and continuously taking money for what is now looking to be the second best online service. They should be fighting tooth and nail to keep up and not fall behind. 

The Games for Gold just highlights that problem they have. It's not about improving the service for the gamers, it's giving out old games to make it seem like it's some great ""value"" when you'd be better off just buying the games yourself without a subscription. It's an insult to gamers, thinking people wouldn't notice and be happy about this. 

If you take the three best/most popular free games from Microsoft and compare it to just a single month of Sony's, you'll see the massive difference in value. Halo 3, Gears of War, and Assassin's Creed 2 can be purchased for less than 20 dollars combined. This month of Playstation Plus, with just a single game (Bioshock: Infinite) can be found for 20-25 dollars. Just a single game is a much, much better value in one month. ","1391213597"

"jailbreak","t5_2r8c5","This varies from game-to-game, but I can only give Pokemon as an example as that's pretty much all that I play on nds4ios; you just open the in-game Pokemon menu (i.e., press X in Pokemon Black/White), and hit the 'Save' option, let it do its thing, and then you can exit out of the app by pressing home or by pressing that little grey arrow thing at the top of your screen to get back to the ROM selection.

Otherwise, the way you're doing it (which is to just play a game, then hit the little grey arrow at the top to exit) is just actually performing a ""Paused""-state of the ROM emulation, which isn't exactly saving anything, but does allow you to start the game faster.

As far as manually saving, like I said, it varies from game to game.","1391213598"

I have a question which I'd like your input on — why did Nasser never seek to work with the Muslim Brotherhood, and instead marginalized them from the beginning? On the surface it would seem that both movements (Nasserism and Islamism) were anti-colonial and employed unionist (whether pan-Arabist or pan-Islamic) rhetoric; wouldn't Nasser have benefited from co-opting the Muslim Brotherhood? Was it simply the clash of two competing and incompatible ideologies? Thanks.","1391213605"

"AmericanHorrorStory","t5_2spug","Thanks! The thing about having a cast this size and of this calibre is that when it comes to awards season most of them will only be eligible for supporting categories and because it comes under ""mini series"" only the Emmys have this category (I might be wrong on that.) I cant see the Emmy voters nominating Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and Frances Conroy who in my opinion are all deserving. I really hope Kathy gets a nod though that might go a little way to redeeming this shitstorm for me. I would of much preferred one amazing guest star than several who went AWOL for an episode then came back for five minutes of screen time then off again. It just created a lapse in storytelling and more frustrations on my part. I would have loved to have learnt more about the origins of the academy and the witches throughout the years who had been there. They could have had one of the girls find a journal with a significant event and show a flashback or several. How are we to become invested in characters and to root for them? by developing their story that's how. What do we know about the girls especially Nan? We know she is clairvoyant but that's about it. Oh and ""she dun killed the neighbour lady"" Yeah we learn about there fears in the finale but what do we know about them as people how they felt when they found out they were witches. What about there families? I would of loved to see alot more plot surrounding the Salem witch trials. 

Going into the season one of the main themes was the mother daughter relationship between Fiona and Cordelia. That would have made some great viewing for me. Instead we get in my opinion a watered down version of johnny and lana whichever way you want to look at it. My mommy doesn't love me!! and cordelia seeking fionas approval. We never really get to understand until the very last scene between them what their deal is and even then its still a bit sketchy for me. I would have liked to see the relationship explored more seeing how it was a major them and Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson have the most amazing onscreen chemistry instead we get a couple of nice heart warming scenes, a couple of arguments and a bitch slap? Sounds like a regular family to me? or just mine? Maybe my mothers the supreme!?

What Ryan Murphy Should have done was split the cast AND the themes. Witches this season and then when Jessica Lange leaves he could bring in Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett and done the Voodoo and slave themes and linked the two without doing it an injustice like he has done now. I would really like to see Kathy Bates take over the reins but I fear Ryan Murphy has blown his chances.

Oil and gas subsidies date back to a time when we could buy oil on the world market much cheaper than we can find it and extract it at home.  It made long term sense to allow oil producers to take an immediate write off on their exploration and development expenses to encourage development of long term supplies.

It is ridiculous to keep these subsidies in place now that fracking has reduced the cost of domestic production to the point that it is cheaper than importing oil.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; do you agree that racism and social pressure could account for that discrepancy?

Racial minorities are underrepresented in every field requiring degrees and such. 

I agree that cultural considerations (racism, sexism, social pressure) *could* account for them. But I believe the model that includes less aptitude for hard science better explains the data in case of female distributions.

The fact that women do get social science degrees, chemistry, biology, law and medical degrees at equal or greater rates says something. Presumably these fields were also at one point dominated by men. Why did these even out but not physics, math, engineering? As someone who has taken physics, math and comp sci degree courses, as well as social science, chemistry and biology courses in University, I can tell you that the physics/math/comp sci require a fundamentally different style of thinking than other science fields. Add that to the evidence of there being differences in male and female brains, men being across the board better at visiospatial reasoning tasks, males being vastly more represented in mental disorders (autism spectrum) which may be linked to certain styles of thinking, male/female achievement gap in math and science, etc, I don't believe simple gender bias is the best explanation for all the evidence.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","By logic, you should stay exactly where you are, instead of climbing higher. The system cannot tell that you're playing at the silver 1 level because it has insufficient evident to produce that conclusion. A more extreme example: If someone gave me a Diamond 1 account and I'm a bronze player. I play 1 or 2 games a day and lose them, I end up in Diamond 2 or whatever...How would a system be able to tell the difference between a diamond 1 level player having a big losing streak versus the Diamond player lost a lot of skills overnight (via selling account)? Lack of games = lack of evidence = lack of meaningful action by the system.

Another very very very big misconception: Just because someone is in Silver 1, doesn't mean their MMR is in Silver 1. In an extreme case: their MMR can be as low as silver 4, just like you (instead of you having Silver 1 MMR), if they just had a recent losing streak. The reason why they're not demoted down to Silver 4 is because the system **very carefully** tweaks your MMR after each game, it should not bring a Silver 1 down to Silver 4 just because they had a 10 game losing streak,  but the rest of the games prove that they play at the silver 1 level, right?

Bottom line: You don't know what your MMR is, especially if you judge by looking at what your opponents ""tier/division"" rank. These are very superficial attributes that are for show. You being in Silver 4 doesn't mean you have Silver 4 MMR, and you playing against Silver 1 doesn't mean you're really playing against Silver 1 MMR.","1391213607"

I don't know his salary, but he's been able to travel, buy a home and a luxury sedan by the age of 31.  His father also works for said fortune 500 company.  I don't want to sound accusatory, but nepotism certainly can play a role in success.

Now I feel I worked very hard in my undergrad years.  I majored in molecular biology.   I can also tell you I was vigilant in going to my classes, studying and meeting with professors while my roommate was often slacking off.  My grades weren't perfect, but I finished and did pretty well and am since pursuing my masters.  I have a good job. I barely pull in 35k a year (before taxes), but I live comfortably within my means.  I don't have the resources to travel, buy a home or a luxury car, but I'm happy enough.  I've performed well at work, but substantial raises haven't come my way simply because the money isn't there for the field I'm in.  My coworkers and colleagues in the field have had similar experiences.  I don't want this to come off as some sob story or that I'm bitter or anything like that, but I think to say that effort alone will yield you success (financial or otherwise) I feel is a bit of an oversimplification.","1391213608"

Just because your ticket has a specific seat number, and you boarded based on that seat number, doesn't mean you actually GET that seat number.  You must be an idiot for thinking that the seat assignment on your boarding pass means that you have been assigned to a seat. 

Oh, you say you checked in online 24 hours early specifically so you could reserve a bulkhead seat for some extra space?  So what.  Reservations don't count when they are on airplanes.

And I don't care if you paid an extra $10 for the exit row, that doesn't mean you actually get to sit in the exit row, because I want to sit there so move. 

What's this?  You say that you can't very well stand in the aisle the whole trip, and you need to be able to sit down?  Well that's a shame, my bag needs to sit on this seat, and really your ticket doesn't entitle you to a seat so you have no reason to whine.  

I can tell you're a bit upset, but don't worry, I have a hyperlink to This Is Thin Privilege...they will help you understand the error of thinking that you are entitled to real estate on an airplane flight.

"Dofus","t5_2sl1e","Hokay. I'll start with the money thing. 400-500kk is actually kind of crazy to me since you're f2p lol. Thats a lot idk how people even make money without subs. As for builds ... its going to depends. I dont advise scrolling to anyone unless they can afford to go 101. If you go like 50 now and put points into it then you are basically wasting those 50 scrolls when you find you want to get 101 later. 500kk Should be enough for some low level equips easy. As far as the exact items you should get? im not too sure. Most of my Characters are 180+, I havent been below level 100 for more than 3 hours at a time in at least 3 years, whenever frigrost came out as an island. This leads to my next point.

As you mentioned you are eventually getting a membership, you should realize the fact that getting from level 50 to 150 can sometimes be faster than getting from level 1-50 if you can get a group to leech you at frigrost. Leave yourself open to maybe pvping at higher levels. Maybe not 150, but level 100 even could be more fun/difficult as well as gives you a much better chance of finding a kolo fight. Remember that pvp outside of kolo is extremely not popular right now, because there is no reward for it besides ""cool looking wings"". And of course the higher level you are the more dungeons you leave yourself open to, because you will be able to handle more of them.

That being said dont leech too much because you will bore yourself and if you get too high of a level you could find yourself unable to afford an appropriate set.

Back to your character/build. If I were YOU, id go for cha sacrier... but i am biased because that is my main character. For pvp they arent the best, and dungeons they are situational. Anywhere from really useful to nearly useless. The added bonus to them is they can leech people at frigrost. I honestly cant say what you SHOULD do. You said you have played a few of the different classes, you need to find the one which fits you the best. Dont worry about getting it wrong the first time! I played a xelor for a year when i first started before i decided Sacrier was what i really wanted. And now you get the exp multiplier to help you get back to where you were faster! So yeah, you need to find your class i cant decide for you, same for your friend. Some classes ARE stronger in some ways than others, but overall you wont go very wrong no matter what you chose... just remember that Cras are overpowered as hell in my, and many other peoples opinions. I dont even have one, which helps prove my point on the ""it doesnt matter what you chose"" thing. Play the class you get the most enjoyment out of. Since you are playing with your friend, tell him the same. Your classes dont need to have some kind of perfect synergy in order to be strong together. All classes are strong and if you play to their strengths you will do well. ","1391213612"

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","It is more complex than that.  This article is shallow, but there is some evidence that sexuality is formed as much by aversion as attraction.  What determines target gender is which gender is a turn off.  That aversion response comes from deep down.

Of course this is no excuse for being an asshole, but it could explain why there are so many otherwise rational people who are put off by same sex relations and why those conversations tend to go into sexual mechanics and characteristics of genitals.

There is a similar problem with the related issue of religion and faith.  If it were as simple as a belief that had some reasons then the mechanics would be different.  It is beginning to appear that the nature of human consciousness assigns agency to actions and therefore naturally forms the concept of a master agent and also agency separated from physical form.  Together those yield god and the afterlife, all because of the manner in which we think about things.

I bought an air freshener and paper towels from the grocery store today and while they got my money for those things, I wasn't particularly excited to spend it.  

However, I also got some chocolate, too.  I'm an adult, yet I still am happy to buy candy.  Isn't this something that mostly kids do?  

It's human nature.  We enjoy fun things and somewhere along the way, big companies realized that lots of adults didn't become boring people who just buy out of necessity.  They like fun things, too.  Toys and comic books are geared more towards adults.  It's not 8 year olds who are buying the Lego Death Star kits that cost $250, I assure you.  

BTW, if your intention with this question was why have *comic books* changed, you'd have been better off phrasing the question that way to begin with.  This way it seems a bit antagonistic, like you're asking why some adults haven't grown up and shed their childish comic books.  

Reddit, in particular, is inhabited by lots of people who liked the movies with comic book heroes.  It can come off a bit condescending to say, ""Hey Reddit, why are you guys still acting like kids?  Shouldn't you be concerned with things other than comic books?""

It'd be better to ask something like, ""When and why did Marvel and DC start establishing an adult fan base for comic books when historically these were for kids?""

It puts the emphasis on the companies who started to market towards and older group of fans, rather than to suggest that the fans are still acting like kids when they should grow up and become adults.","1391213614"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;If you'd prefer to avoid my questions completely that's fine. You accuse me of being obtuse when you are clearly claiming that because the Queens title isn't listed as Queen of England then that England isn't real or that it has no Queen. Both of those statements are false, so what is your argument? 

I've claimed nothing of the sort, actually.  Holy gigantic human shaped figure fashioned out of straw, Batman!  If you want to decide that those are implied by what I've said, that's your business. However, I have no particular reason to swallow your bizarre non-sequitur. 

&gt;The Queen has the power to bestow upon herself any title that she sees fit (look it up).

Has she created this title? No.

&gt; Do you think that she would declare herself Queen of England? I think that she would. In fact, I'd bet a years wages on it. 

Bet whatever you want. Since the kingdom of England was merged into the UK over three centuries ago and no monarch since then has shown much desire to separate them again, I would have to say the odds are against you. I'll take that bet. 

&gt;And since she's the person that gets to make that decision i'd say that you're better off arguing this with her since you seem so intent on disputing her claim to the Throne.

Another gigantic straw man. This is kind of 
funny. 

&gt;Have you considered that perhaps Wikipedia doesn't list the monarch of England as holding the title of monarch of England because only an imbecile would dispute this fact? 

No, it doesn't list it because the crowns were merged in a deliberate attempt to foster national unity and create a single British nation. Setting aside the extent to which such a plan actually worked, the point is that the kingdom of England as a separate entity was very deliberately abolished.  This isn't exactly secret history, or the stuff of conspiracy theories.  Surely if you're going to cite the wiki entry on the monarchy you'd at least consider skimming the fucking thing?

No. Our current understanding of physics/universe is woefully inadequate, at least the ""official"" version. 

The idea is that there is an underlying ""substance"" that connects all things and from which all things derive. Tapping into this force could allow us to harness unlimited energy...or unlimited destructive power, hence the danger.

Monarchies and large factions likely would have maintained their size.  It would seem that their would be less space between nations, as well as less mountain ranges as for this to happen the plates would likely not be shifting.  So with less obstacles in the way large factions would be more likely capable of capturing new land as well as maintaining it.  Conquerors like Napoleon would like have been actually able to succeed in conquering the world.  Though holding onto that indefinitely still would be difficult.  Due to the instability and slow acting speed of a democracy, any resistance that was democratic in nature to these large factions would likely be put down more easily due to this.  Without having that large distance or extremely familiar territory advantage that America had, or other democratic Nations existing, it would be to hard to have a successful democratic rebellion in those circumstances.","1391213620"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Well, there is active research into the human moral instinct.  It's a hodgepodge of biology interacting with culture.  

Some morality seems to be universal and so is probably a product of our biology. if you visit any tribe you'll find that they believe it's wrong to rape or kill people on a whim.   

Some morality can be essentially derived using 'The Golden Rule' type arguments.  Even when it seems strange, we have learnt to tolerate others' behavior, because we want them to tolerate us.

Some morality is due to hygiene concerns and we often confuse what's immoral with what's unclean.  For instance - calling someone a 'filthy pig' or the fact that it's generally a bad idea to talk about your last bowel movement.  Also- the Nazis dehumanized the Jews by comparing them to vermin or rats.

Just learning about stocks, and the terminology. Like I said, in an earlier post, I'm a total fucking new guy (FNG) at all of this, but I'm more than willing to learn and take things one day at a time. I'm not looking for some shit hot stock tip that'll make me an instant zillionaire, just was wanting some advice on where to start. 

To the absolute best of my knowledge, my work doesn't offer a 401k, but instead offers 403b contributions. I did them for about a year, but ended up pulling out because of things going on at home with the kids. But with kids starting to move out of the house, I can get back to investing what little I can. 

I got the bug to want to invest back in the 80s when I suggested to my dad to invest in Warner Bros because Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix were on their label. Some shit hot tip, right? FFwd to 1990 and the merger between Time and Warner Bros made people a lot of money, or at least that was my understanding. Yeah, my hot tip was because I liked Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix. lol. 

Back in the late 90s after I got out of the Marines, I wanted to invest, but because of my impending divorce, I was living paycheck to paycheck and couldn't jump in on what I saw as an emerging industry with companies like Amazon, Ebay, Yahoo, Netscape, etc... Yeah some were clunkers, but I saw brick and mortar as having their days numbered back then and buying shit over the Internet as the way to go. Up until this past year my wife and I have basically gone month to month and the only investments I've been able to make were to the TSA, which is now worth a little over $7K, not much but it's what I got for now. I'll be starting it back up when we have open-enrollment this fall. Our oldest (21) moved out which so far means we just got a $200-300 a month raise, which means we have about $100 - $200 a month I wanna start putting away and using. I just opened up an account with TD Ameritrade and haven't spent a dime yet as I'm still learning. But I think I know where I want to start with trading and where I wanna stick my money for long term goals. 

What is your opinion of the marijuana industry in the US, and your opinions on it for it's investment potential? I know most of the marijuana companies traded are penny stocks and I know it's a bit of an emerging industry as it's starting to gain traction with being legalized in other states.

Superman is a demigod who can do anything while Lex Luthor clawed his way up to the top with his ""meager"" human abilities, so where's Lex's key to the city? A fireman saving someone from a burning building puts himself at great risk, whereas Superman can save a city with a flick of a finger. It's easy for Supes. So why isn't the fireman on the front page of the Daily Planet and getting parades? The fireman has done more, given up more of himself, relatively speaking. It's a view we can kinda sympathise with. In fact, it actually has shades of Occupy/1% to it: Why are we toiling away at the bottom while the guy at the top, who got everything handed to him on a platter, is being lauded??

The great thing about what you said in your second paragraph is that it would help to fix some of the problems Man of Steel had.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;Are there any good reasons to be an atheist?

Yes.

&gt;I think there are better reasons to believe in a higher power in the light of modern-day scientific research. What good reasons are there to think a higher power doesn't exist? 

I think there are no good reasons to believe in a higher power in the light of modern-day scientific research as despite impressive findings ongoing in every single field, and the still massively large gaps of unknown shrinking every day, we have yet to find the tiniest shred of a hint of any evidence at all of deities.

The only sensible and reasonable place to begin an inquiry about the world and universe is the null hypothesis. To begin with, essentially, ""I don't know."" Then, to search for evidence and use that to devise sensible conclusions.

Each and every time, in each and every field, out of the thousands upon thousands of areas of study accumulating millions upon millions of different bits of evidence we have yet to find anything remotely or vaguely suggestive of deities.

Furthermore, we are aware of a lot of data explaining human psychology and sociology leading to an understanding of the tendency for our species to want to have a belief in deities and we also have an impressive collection of data showing who, where, how, and why (usually politics or greed) the world's religions have been created.

tl;dr: There is no evidence whatsoever for deities. Therefore, it is intellectually dishonest to believe in them. Just as it is to believe in Bigfoot, unicorns, fairies, and Santa Claus.

If it wasn't part of their lore than the Dominion would have an overly unfair advantage as a player faction and Mechari would basically become Death Knights (When they were initially released).

Pretty sure carbine isn't lying to us. If they are lying to us, I'm sure they're not dumb enough to make one race on one faction be infinitely better than the other races from a lore standpoint.

Also, yes they would be forthcoming to the emperor, who they (And the entire dominion) revere as a god due to his eldan lineage.

Also, such knowledge would help the dominion drastically (Which is their goal) and there is nothing so far about them sharing this knowledge with the dominion.

So yes, if carbine is stupid and the mechari know all this stuff, AND the mechari are morons because they aren't telling their faction about these secrets which would surely help the war effort drastically (Not even mentioning that they are betraying their emperor/god), then I guess you could be right.","1391213627"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","I'm Pro gun, so it would be the loosening of some gun laws, whilst also enacting some different ones. I would only have 2 classes of firearms. Unrestricted and Prohibited. Prohibited would be automatic weapons, incendiary weapons, explosives weapons, etc... 

Everything else would be unrestricted, and you could carry those unrestricted anywhere like you can now. You would be able to take your AR or AK into the forest to hunt or plink. Armour piercing handgun ammo would be prohibited though, like it is now. 

Licensing would be similar to what it is now, but I would also include a psyche test. As well as a tri-annual eye and psyche test.

I'm even open to the possibility of carry laws, but I don't think a majority of Canadians would support that.

I used the word small because I do not think that legalizing weed would ""create the jobs we need."" It would be good for people, but it won't cure unemployment.

Totally agreed.

&gt;If you've ever listened to the prominent Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron who argues we should legalize all drugs, he tells people that the economic impact in $$ terms is minor. It is a good tool, the taxes we will earn, to use for political argument purposes, you can play up ohhh, billions of dollars will be produced for tax revenues! Yet, the real reasons are social like you say. The costs of jailing people is huge. Yet pot is just one drug. There are lots of other drugs people get popped for. Headline on drudgereport today was about Obama soliciting pardons for hard drug offenders. 

I totally agree. I just think it's doable with marijuana but not others. ","1391213632"
"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","In Australia, a couple of department stores have a pretty good range. Myer in particular. My only issue is that the bras that fit can cost up to AU$80. I haven't been fitted by someone in a long time, but the staff there are good at ensuring that a bra fits well. Thinking about it more, I used to own a lot of bra's that didn't touch the sternum because the gore was always too wide. The largest cup size I've seen the bra's there go up to is a G AU/UK (US H according the [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_measurement_methods)).

I haven't found bra-specific chain stores to be good though. Bra's and Things only carry a couple of bras that I can actually fit into, and they're fitters are okay but give up easily (based on two excursions to their store). The worst would have to be Cotton on Body not going above a D. I guess it's due to the target audience been teenages, but in highschool I went from a D to an E.

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","You make a good point at the end and it makes sense. But I think they're are two things to think about. 

1.) Pre-time skip was all about The Strawhats proving themselves as pirates and because of that, growth. I think the second half is going to be more about how far they have grown and so it's more about finding where they're current level is and it would be tough to max them out early. They're isn't much growth ahead. They're are Shichibukai, Yonko/Admirals left, and maybe something else?

2.) Oda's fights aren't always about straight-up fighting. Half the time, their fights wouldn't be so tough if Luffy and Zoro weren't so stupid (in a silly way. Luffy getting stuck or Zoro lost). It's a handicap to make the fights tougher.

I don't think the fight is gonna be easy because we know how strong Doflamingo is, but I think it would be a tougher write ahead if he makes them max out early.  I think the second half is gonna be less about fight growth and more about figuring what's going on with everything (Void Century, who are Big Mom and Kaido, Vegapunk, The Revolutinaries, etc...)

There are fruit flavors, there are bakery flavors, tobacco flavors, and coffee flavors. I've never found an outfit that does ALL of them well. They'll usually do one or two of them well. So instead of trying to sell all the flavors made by ABC company, who really just does bakery very well, focus on matching the right juices with the right company.

Selling bakery juices from Vapealicious and Nicoticket, while selling tobacco blends by Indigo, and fruit flavors from The Vapor Chef, for example. (yes, I know he does tobacco well also.)

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Have a look at this [skill calculator](http://skillcalc.massyx.de/). It's not just racials, class and weapons you have to worry about. There's also armor, Alliance abilities, Mages and Fighters guilds (with Thief and Dark Brotherhood to be added), and much, much more.

Just to fill out all class abilities, 2 armor (for mix n' match or role swapping), and 2 weapons takes **122 points**. If we assume you only get 50 skill points from levels, that leave 72 points from other sources. We know that there are other ways to get skill points apart from just sky shards, but if it was just sky shards then you would need 216 shards. That's a lot. And if every faction has an equal number of shards in their territories that means that you won't even have access to 2/3rds of the available shards until you reach level 50.

Now, most people probably will not take every single point in all class, armor, or weapon skills, but that 122 point number did not include a single racial, alliance, or guild skill point spent.

Of course, all of this is just speculation because we know so little of how the big picture works, and any of these details could change at any time, even after launch. But it's something to think about.","1391213636"

Tibia can fit in four of your points, without the skills stuff. Tibia had few skills (Magic Level, Sword Fighting, Fist Fighting, Axe Fighting, Club Fighting, Distance Fighting, Shielding and Fishing) and it has never been the main idea of the game, unlike RS that was well known for his multiple skills. The skills in Tibia only changed the PVE and PVP part of the game (except fishing), it had no effect on the market.


Instead of a runemaking skill, mages could make various runes with their mana pool (casting spells) and either sell it or use it in PVP/PVE. Paladins (which are ""Archers"" in the game) could make ammunitions, with their mana pool too. Both runes and ammunitions were extremely essential in the game and unless you were low level, you **needed** them. Spells alone weren't effective enough  for pve/pvp, so you needed both spells and runes/ammo. 


Runes and ammo had their respective price in the market (NPCs didn't sell runes and only weak ammo) and making these runes/ammo would buff the Magic Level of the character. With a greater magic level, you could inflict a greater damage with your spells (or improve your healing spells).


Chilling in town and making these runes (from recovering mana) was common back then and it was a great way to socialise. Some players were well known to sell runes and it created a great sense of community. Buying runes was great because you had to bargain and travel to other towns just to be able to start your hunt - and because you payed ""a lot"" for the runes, you had to pray that your hunt would give you a certain amount of profit. If you were unlucky (monsters gived specific items), you could make a big loss of money. Hunts were exciting because of this, and PVP was also exciting because you really didn't want to die and waste everything, especially since you could get PKed everywhere (except at the protection zones) and that you could lose a good amount of exp/skills.","1391213638"

&gt;Women can calculate their cup size by calculating the difference between their bust size and their band size. The bust size, bust line measure, or over-bust measure is the measurement around the women's torso over the fullest part of the breasts, with the crest of the breast halfway between the elbow and shoulder, usually over the nipples, ideally while standing straight with arms to the side and wearing a properly fitted bra. This practice assumes the woman's current bra fits her correctly. The measurements are made in the same units as the band size, either inches or centimetres. The cup size is calculated by subtracting the band size from the over-the-bust measurement.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","""Interpret"" doesn't have to mean ""interpretive dance"" (not that there's anything wrong with interpretive dance).  It just means finding something in the choreography that you can connect with as a dancer, whether it's character, emotion, or even just the way certain movements feel and flow, and using that to inform how you carry out those movements.  Every single style of dance involves (or should involve) some level of interpretation.

I'm sorry you think I sound pretentious.  That wasn't the intent.  People can like whatever kind of dance they choose, or no dance at all.  Just because I like weird experimental pieces and evening-length plotless ballets doesn't mean everyone has to!  I just take issue with the style promoted at these competitions that mimics actual jazz/contemporary/lyrical/etc. but without thoughtful choreography or artistic intent.","1391213641"

"playmindcrack","t5_2zb1l","I noticed something at 1:14 in the video that I've experienced a bit back on the gym. That creeper got shot with an arrow and lived because you switched to your sword. It's something I've come to understand after playing around with it for a bit that I don't think many people are aware of; How bow procing isn't always the best option and how sometimes it's better to just *shoot the damn creeper with your bow*.

I'm not certain on this as I don't know the full mechanics of it, but sometimes trying to bow proc cuts the effectiveness of your arrows and makes it impossible to gauge how much damage you do. Sometimes it did 3 hearts, sometimes it did 7...I haven't had the chance to try this with other items but I think the same rule applies if you switch too quickly after shooting to do something else like repair a wall or put a torch down.

As I've played around with this behavior I think I understand it better now. If you switch too quickly, the server won't give your arrows an attack buff since it wasn't fast enough to see you holding your bow. So after you shoot an arrow it checks to see if you are holding a bow and if so gives your arrows a buff.

Likewise procs are determined by checking to see what weapon you're holding when you kill someone and if it's a sword, shovel, or shield you get one. At least that's what I'm lead to believe after some experience with the mechanics and no insight to the actually plugins' coding.

So bow procing won't always work if you're too hasty. You can only switch to another tool or weapon after giving the server an adequate amount of time to confirm you are using a bow. However the closer you are to your target, the smaller the time frame you have to switch between the time you get the arrow buff and the arrow hitting the target.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","This is an interesting question and one that I've thought a great deal about, along with other interesting observations I've had regarding our modern day interpretation of Jesus. 

As a Christian, I believe you are correct in that Jesus was likely crucified in a manner consistent with the Roman practice of the time. Doesn't really influence my belief of what happened. I view this as more of a story that someone later added pictures to and not a story told through photos. Without truly knowing the intent of those that created the original picture, the thoughts of those that cannonized the bible, etc. I simply believe that in all content humanity has influenced, there is error. I choose to believe the error in small details does not detract from the overall message but the beauty of free will is that we have a mind capable of questioning, doubting, pressing, wondering, etc. I believe that's the intent.

It could have been drawn this way to garner greater sympathy, to create differentiation from other crucifixions, etc. I have no idea. But in general, I believe we all have a choice how to read and interpret the events of the Bible. Did Adam and Eve eat an Apple or was it some other fruit? Doesn't really influence my beliefs but there is a part of me that would like the unedited version...

Great question. We should also ponder why Jesus looks like a white guy from Wisconsin in most pictures and not as closely related to the people in that time/vicinity.  ","1391213642"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","&gt;This is only true if you do plenty of traveling and are financially very comfortable. Honestly, for most people, an airline mile is NOT worth two cents, because two cents are much more versatile, and can (e.g) help pay your unexpected car repair bill. It only works if you basically have enough money put aside for all likely needs, and have very stable employment, and so forth.

I agree, but I think it also gives those with a low/mid-range income the opportunity to really do some great traveling that they might not otherwise be able to do.  Using stopovers+open-jaws you can pretty easily get 2-3 cents/point out of United, even in economy class.  

In regards to the business cards, I also agree that they are better.  However, although the issuing companies do tend to be very lenient, it's a fact that if you don't run a business or intend to build one, you would not, in many cases, be able to get the card without submitting false financial information.  I don't feel comfortable doing so personally.

I wanted to naga siren mid (shouts to rtz) this muted bane wouldn't leave aand his friend who was playing the safelane huskar was flaming me (“noob naga leave mid fucking noob rofl”) so I had to offlane solo. Anyways I figure ill just go radiance because ill need to carry them. I was saving up gold for the relic and the huskar was like “wtf naga why you saving gold” I said “rad” and for the rest of the game the huskar flamed me and the muted bane spammed the “That just happened” button. Apparently radiance naga is worst item in the world, who knew. we ended up losing. it was probably my fault im pretty bad with naga and sort of misplayed and fucked up my rad timing.","1391213647"

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","Well it's pretty much assumed when you're in your 40's you've been married and divorced. At that time it's just a matter of how many times.  2 is about par for the course.  4 times and you mind as well pack it in. No woman will think there's not something wrong with you.  But since you're 29, why not let them ask ?  Who cares? Nothing to be ashamed of and congrats ! No 9 lb annuities ! 

You can read the thread this thread for the rest of my advice.  It's so good and truthful that they want to ban me.

* Test the laptop on a variety of different Routers (friends-houses, coffee-shops, workplace,etc).. and see if any pattern emerges. 

* Test under different OSes (such as a bootable Linux CD)

* Test using a variety of devices (Laptop, smartphones, tablets,etc)

"ForeverAlone","t5_2s3yz","I was 'normal' through high school. Lettered in two sports, decent amount of friends, etc. 

When I was 17, less than a month out of h.s. my father killed my mother and committed suicide. Since then I have had an empty void in my life, but I seem to be slowly making progress now (at age 25). My family (what little I have) have noticed a very big change in me and still touch on it from time to time, usually in the ""What happened....you used to have so many friends and be happy"" way. I recently graduated University, have a good entry level job (~80k/year in low cost of living area), and am in better shape than I was in h.s.. I have decent (albeit loner) hobbies and am 6'1 (Some complain on here about height). I have no physical deformities and have had numerous aquaintances say that I must clean up at parties/clubs/bars/etc.

Little do they know I have never stepped into or been invited to any of those places, and am still a virgin 'FA' with no friends. My lack of experience is the number one thing holding me back currently. This week several coworkers asked what I was doing for the Superbowl and even when I played it off as not being into football there were several awkward moments. My weekends consist of playing video games and gym. 

Regardless, I think I am making progress and try to avoid this sub-reddit as it can be toxic in regards to self improvement and fixing your situation. You only have one shot at life and I don't intend to sit on my laurels while the best years of my life continue to pass me by.","1391213651"

It's a shorthand way of saying, ""Don't jump the gun too soon on your opinion,"" while using a salient example that most comic fans know.

Didn't I just say I get that part? I'm just saying I don't get when people use it for everything. Go on /r/batman. People will reply to a comment that speaks negatively of a casting choice with ""Everyone said Heath Ledger would be bad, and look how he turned out. ______ will be good."" That doesn't make sense. They are saying that whatever actor/tress will be good because Ledger turned out good. Which is completely jumping the gun.

I knew many elderly people whose legs outlived their minds by a few years.  My grandmother had to be put in a home when she was 88 due to dementia.  She was still mobile then.  She didn't become chair-bound until five years later.

Conversely, my aunt had her father in law living with her.  He still had his wits about him (and had some great stories driving tanks in WW2) but his mobility was impaired.  My Uncle and her purchased a chair-lift for their staircase for him.  Not once did they ever say ""Y'know, if only that builder had thought to put a ramp in a split-level house.""  I think Medicare even reimbursed some of the cost of that lift as well.

Listen, when I get too old to walk around (and I hope to goodness my mind outlasts the rest of me) assuming we haven't developed the technology to turn us into a race of geriatric cyborgs, I will happily do what I need to do to improve my living situation in my home.  Up to and including selling my home to purchase/lease one that better suits my needs.

I'm just glad they didn't include a maximum counter-top height.  At 6' 6"" tall I can't use most typical kitchen counters without bending over or using some sort of riser.  The bending over gets old quickly and causes me severe back pain (you try stooping for a prolonged period).  Putting in Julia Child counters is on my list of things to do.","1391213652"

For tips, I offer the following:

- Have one ride your cock while the other rides your face (eat her pussy).
Have them switch so they both get a chance at getting their pussy eaten and riding your cock.

- Have them lay side by side. Eat one pussy for a while then switch to the other. Finger girl B while you eat the pussy of girl A. If either girl is near orgasm, DON'T SWTICH! Make her cum, then switch and make the other cum.

- Still on their backs side-by-side, fuck girl A while fingering girl B. Switch. Again, if either girl you're fucking is close to cumming, do NOT stop! Fuck her and make her cum.

- Bend them both over. Fuck girl A - finger girl B. Switch. Remember about making them cum.

- If on a sofa, position girl A on her back and fuck her. Have girl B sit on the back of the sofa and above girl A's head and eat her pussy.

**If they're into it...**

- Bend girl A over and fuck her. Have girl B position herself to have girl A eat her pussy. Switch
- Fuck girl A on her back while girl B rides her face (getting her pussy eaten). Suck girl B's breasts while you fuck girl A while she's eating girl B's pussy. Switch.

- While fucking girl A, have girl B get under you and lick your cock/balls while you're fucking girl A. Switch.

- On her back, eat girl A's pussy while girl B sits on her face (girl A eating girl B). Switch.

**At no point should you...**

- Fuck either of them in the ass then move to their pussy. Stick with anal if you're doing anal. Switch condoms if you're moving to pussy.

- Fuck any girl then move straight away to fucking the other unless they are okay with it. If you all are STI free then it should be fine, but fucking any girl and having her pussy juice on your cock is a health risk to the other girl if you don't know your STI status.

- Cum in any girl's pussy unless you're sure she's on birth control.

**Do...**

- Wear a condom.
- Try your best to make each girl cum at least once.
- And most of all have fun!!

*Here's the linked section [Cup measurement methods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup measurement methods) from Wikipedia article [Brassiere measurement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement)* : 

---

&gt;Women can calculate their cup size by calculating the difference between their bust size and their band size. The bust size, bust line measure, or over-bust measure is the measurement around the women's torso over the fullest part of the breasts, with the crest of the breast halfway between the elbow and shoulder, usually over the nipples, ideally while standing straight with arms to the side and wearing a properly fitted bra. This practice assumes the woman's current bra fits her correctly. The measurements are made in the same units as the band size, either inches or centimetres. The cup size is calculated by subtracting the band size from the over-the-bust measurement.

The thing is, the OP's work isn't nearly as bad as a lot of the stuff you're talking about. Yes, I too frequent this subreddit. I've been chewed out for giving constructive criticism to high schoolers who asked for criticism, yet didn't actually want it. I know about who you're trying to lump this guy in with.

Your point is also completely invalid, because as I outlined below, there is a very strong chance that he didn't shoot all of that in available light. That's right. It was likely all lit. The cameras he shot on are incapable, at the very least unlikely, of creating many of those images on their own. Many of his scenes would've had to be lit, I suspect that he's just very good at making his light look diagetic.

So this is my ultimatum. Either show us your work, or shut your self righteous asshole. I'm so sick of everyone shitting all over people, regardless of their experience, without hinting at any sort of constructive criticism, for no reason other than to stroke their ego.

For someone as new as you there are a few things you need to keep in mind. If you are going to play a game that's a bit older like Star Wars Battlefront then I'd suggest slipping in some details about the game. Mainly for those who don't happen to know what the game is and such. Since it is an older game, if you have played it before then try talking about memories, past situations, things of that nature that give a more nostalgic factor to an already nostalgic game. You have plenty of energy and with some time and practice you could make really good commentary. If you gave your commentary a little bit of direction I think it could be really good. Video quality and audio quality are pretty much spot on aside from when when you got a little loud you could hear your voice somewhat echoing of the walls, but that's not that big of deal. 

In the end, with some time and practice if you keep the energy you could be really good at making these kinds of videos.

It swerves, essentially, but I don't mean that in a bad way; it asked a question, explored the potentials of that question and what it would play out like, and then using those results to attempt to bring things back together again rather than let them play out completely straight as a raw deconstruction [(because we probably would have had a straight up ""bad"" ending instead, a complete rout of the magical girl team)](/spoiler).","1391213657"

That doesn't mean that something doesn't exist outside that domain, though. There could easily be something outside our causal domain, it just can't affect us in any way, nor can it never have affected us.

If you want to relax the definition a tiny amount, you could make it something closer to ""the universe"" in the sense of ""things inside the *presently* closed causal domain we live in"". This would leave open the possibility that at some point in the past supernatural things *were* causally connected to us, but that they no longer are. Deists that believe in a creator god that can (or choose to) no longer affect reality would fit into this category.

I don't think most people use anywhere near this strict a definition of ""nature"", though. 

I think they use it much more closely in the sense of ""things that obey the laws of nature"". Something could easily violate the laws of nature while existing ""outside of it"" the same way that criminals can be outside the law.","1391213657"

 [**Fiat money**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat%20money): 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Fiat money** has been defined variously as:

&gt;The term derives from the [Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_language) fiat (""let it become"", ""let it be done"", ""it shall be"").

&gt;While gold- or silver-backed [representative money](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_money) entails the legal requirement that the bank of issue redeem it in fixed weights of gold or silver, fiat money's value is unrelated to the value of any physical quantity. Even a coin containing valuable metal may be considered fiat currency if its [face value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_value) is defined by law as different from its market value as metal.

Expect people to drive like shit (have a 2 second delay if you're the first car through a green light because people run the lights like motherfuckers and the cops don't enforce shit).

Lots of great restaurants (look them up on yelp for reviews/directions):

1. Tarahumara's (like crack)

2. Juan del Fuego (again, crack, Mexi-diner)

3. Kendell's (Noble but it was in Norman for a bit so I'm claming it, Dee one of the owner's is awesome, get the SMALL size or prepare to overeat like crazy).

4. The Mont (food sucks but queso is awesome and drinks are VERY strong, warm day best patio except maybe...)

5. The Library (best patio in Norman, even has a smoking section for nasty ass smokers) So so food but great drinks again and tons of beers on tap (try the nachos or pizzas)

6. The Diner (traditional diner, was on diner's driveins and dives!)

7. Sandro's Pizza on Main St (by Norman High). This is the best thing I've had outside of NYC/NJ for pizza. Used to run NY Pizza on campus but now has his own place (plus one in Moore). You could try NY Pizza but Sandros is way better.

8. The Greek House. It's a dive but if you like Gyros, everyone I know that likes them says they're like crack (à la Tarahumara's &amp; Juan del Fuego).

9. Victoria's Pasta Shop (get the garlic bread with cheese and the lasagna rolls if you like shrimp, holy mackerel it's good.)

10. New spot for me but Pub W was actually pretty damn good foodwise.

11. Charleston's. Copy of Houston's (if you've ever seen one) the potato soup is amazing as is most the food. Mangers have a stick up their ass but that's all Hal Smith restaurants (they take their shit seriously).

12. Ray's BBQ, awesome in an old Pizza Hut. Get it you won't be disappointed.

13. Sooner Legends (BBQ) It's amazingly good but the portion sizes are huge so if you want a ton of food, try it.

14. Misal, Indian buffet or dinners, great food if you like Indian (not as oily as ""real"" indian or so I've been told by my indian/bangladeshi friends).

15. Tea Cafe, chinese food. Not sure if the east side location is opened again (12th and alameda) but campus is (asp ave).

16. Dickie's yeah it's a Texas chain, but it's not bad at all, worth trying if you like BBQ.


Outside Norman:


1. Kendell's (so close)

2. Golden Palace (15th and Meridian so good get the stir fry ~Mongolian BBQ)

3. Shogun (way the fuck up north, like May &amp; 122nd in an old mall, so worth it, rivals Benihana).

4. Old Germany (Choctaw BFE you'd better have a GPS) SO WORTH IT!!!

5. Pepperoni Grill (in Penn Square Mall) The bread is awesome and get the crémé brulée it's my favorite of anywhere I've ever been (including La France!).

6. Alvarado's in Moore (119th and Western I think, corner in NW strip mall) an acquired taste but good IMO (green sauce on chicken enchiladas yum!)

I guess all I do is read reddit and eat out. If you want any more advice people are helpful from what I can tell.

Also, after 12...b5 you have the nice 13.Bxf7 (you said you wanted your bishop attacking f7!). This messes up the king's position even more and wins a pawn (the idea remains available for the next couple of moves).

These types of claims tend to be the exact same argument over and over and over again to the point where the average subscriber here could have both sides of the argument without help.  The people that pop in occasionally with one of the above are not usually people who frequent the sub IMO.

Do we really need to upvote these?

&gt;how can I effectively moderate away the bad practice of downvotes meaning 'I don't like this' and upvotes meaning, 'Hahaha, I also believe this'

You cant.

&gt;The prevailing theory is that it's okay to ridicule, mock, and hate people who have been tricked by lies. That it's okay to discriminate against the weird. That it's okay to circlejerk like so often happens in this subreddit.

I'd say its more likely a symptom of frustration.  Most of the time these conversations are like talking to a brick wall.  There is no audience to be convinced like in a debate.

I always figured if Im gonna spend money on it might as well get properly messed up on it you know? Im just glad I dropped it when I did. I lost a steady connect right before new years and ran on new years eve. I didnt have any good resolutions so I figured ehh what the hell im gonna stay off boy as long as I can humanly take it.

This isn't to say everything about me, or you, is a problem. You know, I'm sure a lot of stuff about us that is ""bipolar"" is also just us. We have to figure out what is wrong with us, things that are actually problems, and work on that. This is my personal opinion anyway.

I guess my point is, there is parts of us that are a problem. We are not the problem as a a whole. There is nothing wrong with us. There is just things about us that is wrong. I hope that makes sense.

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","I'm a dom with many years of experience behind me.

First, I want to say that it seems like you've done an excellent job with this situation so far; I don't think that I could have offered any improvements had I actually been there coaching as it happened. You found a limit with her; congratulations, that's *exactly* what you should be doing and it sounds like you've responded to finding that limit well.

Here is what you and she need to know. She reacted strongly in a way that surprised her and made her feel stupid when she looked back on herself. The power of her reaction comes not from what she is feeling about you and your behaviour right now, but from the unhealed memory of how she felt about a thing that happened when she was younger. The scene you and she shared simply tapped into that long held memory and allowed her to reprocess those feelings. She needs to realize that experiencing these kinds of reaction are incredibly healing and cathartic and that **it's a good thing**; I actually feel that it's one of the prime motivators as to why a person desires to experience some kinds of stimulation. If your partner doesn't read reddit, please have a conversation with her where you discuss this. She needs reassurance that she wasn't being stupid or whiny or a crybaby, her reactions where absolutely correct and okay.

(As an aside, the two most powerful words that I know are, ""Good girl"". Praise, given at the right time, holds tremendous emotional power.)

I don't agree with others who say that this issue should be handled straight on and aggressively. While there is an ""unexplored field of landmines"" that will need to be made safe, you already are aware that a particular mode of behaviour on your part is what triggers her, and that is easy to avoid for the time being.

I believe that your girl should be allowed to process these memories and only share details of them with you when she's feeling strong/comfortable enough. In regards to finding limits, it's imperative that both partners are doing their best at communcating with each other when a limit has been found and what, in particular, it was about the scene that triggered that limit. For example, I had one girl who triggered on the scent of cinnamon during sex. I really didn't need to know anything more about *why* cinnamon was the trigger, just that it was one. As the relationship matured she was able to share with me more, but that was getting to know more of her as a person, the trigger itself was what I immediately needed to be aware of.

In short, make sure you have a conversation where you both discuss the fact that you will be finding each others triggers, and that you both will do your best to make the other aware specifically which behaviour it was that sparked the trigger. The details, the stories of ourselves, are things that you will share with each other as the relationship deepens, indeed it is **what** deepens our understanding and feelings for each other. Those stories will come and don't need to be rushed for the sake of making a scene perfectly 'safe'.","1391213673"

"gaybros","t5_2tdzg","as a former a figure skater, i guess i can contribute a bit. 

i come from a skating family.  mom taught figure skating, dad played hockey in college, oldest sister was a figure skater, older brother played hockey, other sister figure skated and played hockey and i figure skated and played hockey. it wouldnt surprise me if mom told me i was born at the rink.

my parents put me in skates when i 15 months old. no joke. mom said i used cry and yell when i was at the rink so she put me in skates and held my hands. it shut me up.  my most prized possession is a picture of dad teaching me to skate (he passed away when i was younger.

i figure skated and played hockey at the same time. when i got into 6th grade, i got teased by a guy on the team for figure skating and a bit a school, even though i was the best skater on the team. i got called gay at school as well and i didnt even know what that was at the time, but i knew that they meant it as a bad thing. it was actually one of the main reasons i quit.

sad thing is i was pretty good. found out 2 years ago that disney on ice offered me a job, but my parents turned it down cause dad didnt want me traveling across the country at such a young age. also, my main rival at competitions was just competing for a spot in the olympics. might have been something if i had stuck with it.

at no point did i ever feel gay when i was a figure skater. there are some camp guys but others are just regular guys. i wouldnt say it made me gay and i dont really identify as gay-somewhere in between on the spectrum (sexual fluidity i guess).","1391213683"

The Joker, for example, has his quotes plastered everywhere, but in the context of the story, versus Batman's character, it was necessary he be the way he was, and says what he does. 


Whereas Michael Bay has little story and mostly action and explosions, Nolan seems to focus more on the story and what it means, with good characterization and symbolism. In my opinion, TDK was about how a person may fall, but an idea of the people lives on. That's not bad, and definitely better than Transformers or something. TDKR is about remembering to live, not for any cause or idea, but for yourself. Inception is about learning to accept things and be happy with them, to let go of things you can't change. 


And all of these themes and stories are ""great"" because the viewers believe they are. If you hold movies to a ridiculous, unreachable standard then nothing will ever be great. Nolan's movies make you think and feel, which is why I believe them to be pretty awesome.

Okay, so how many people starve and for how long until we can decide if the free market has failed?

&gt;Would you say we should do it regardless of the cost? I doubt you'd say it's worth it if it were a billion dollars per life considering what else could be done with that money.

We shouldn't run governments like businesses. Remember, the goal isn't profit. I mean, yeah, your fantastical scenario is pretty bad. But that's not really worth discussing, is it?

&gt;Perhaps if we taught critical thinking earlier. It's not like it some special talent that requires a high IQ. It's little more than literacy in that the majority of people have to be taught it, and they're more recipient of it at an earlier age.

So who makes sure that everyone gets the proper education for this system to work out? And who is paying for it? It's going to take a hell of a lot more than a simple critical thinking class. I don't mind the idea of mandatory free education up to college/trade school level, but let's be honest that it's not going to work for everyone and those people are well and truly fucked.

&gt;That doesn't mean we shouldn't recognize the limitations and unintended consequences of such a thing.

Right, like I said.

&gt;Power, particularly centralized power.

You'll never create a system without that. You won't even be able to say ""lets not have a system at all!"" and not eventually have that.

&gt;I've asked if there is anything that possibly convince you otherwise.

Hey, you made your point with the free market firemen being cheaper. I mean, I'll take your word on that. But as long as they are as good as the public service that would normally be provided I have no problem with it. The government is good at some things, the free market is good at other things.

&gt;By what standard do you determine the efficacy or legitimacy of a certain policy or government in general

Well, I'm not sure what you mean by legitimacy in this case. And I suppose in a democratic society at large it would be determined by the voters. Do they feel that their money is being well spent?","1391213694"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My biological father may as well be a stranger.

He knocked my mom up in high school, then ran away. Two years later, he returned, and they were together again just long enough for her to become pregnant with my younger bother, at which point he split again.

Through the years, he ignored us. No contact whatsoever. Then my mom successfully sued him for child support, and he demanded visitation in some perverse show of bad sportsmanship.

We got bundled off to his house for a summer. His new family would sit around the dinner table and swap stories. My brother and I were relegated to the kitchen. We were served mac and cheese with spam in it for each of the two meals we received every day we were there. To this day, the sight of a can of spam makes me nauseous.

Later on, he fell off a roof and broke his spine. Found Jesus in the rehab center. Tried reaching out. My need for a father figure was long gone, and I wasn't the slightest bit interested in making nice with that prick.

My little brother was desperately enamored with learning about that side's lineage, as we never had any kind of details about those people growing up. 

But by the time my brother invited him to his wedding, The mention of his name made me sick. My mother fed me copious numbers of rum and cokes, hoping to keep me from flipping out. He managed to corner me on the patio overlooking a cliff side at the reception, and I made it clear he could shove his apologies up his ass, and that I would very much like to pitch his crippled ass over the rail. 

That was the last time we spoke.

My brother has teenage children now, so it's been a while. 

Should I know nothing about the cat and the way he abandoned his children, I'm sure we would have gotten along swimmingly. I'm told he's a funny guy, and my mother once dropped her guard in a moment of being real, and told me how much of him she saw in me, and how Goddamn infuriating that was to her. 

And to me, as well.","1391213694"

- Some bosses, like Nex, will be tweaked so that they can be killed by players in legacy mode.

- Future bosses will either be designed for Legacy mode or for EoC.

- XP rates won't be the same

- Drop tables will have to be rebalanced

- The combat formula will have to be redone

- The entire Constitution skill will have to be reworked

- Armor will have to be changed to benefit pures

- Pures will now be supported by Jagex

- Changes to strength stats will be looked at and possibly changed

- There will be core changes to help balance things out

- There might be a need for separate PvP servers

- The Wilderness Slayer Volcano will be changed so that legacy and EoC can fight each other

- They will look into bringing back 100% protection prayers if the community so desires.

- It may affect the economy, but ""hopefully"" not as much as the new EoC changes

- EoC will be overhauled in the coming months to make it equally appealing to Legacy

The conclusion is that it depends on your team comp and on the enemy morale. If you got a good sieging comp it is easier, also if the enemy think they can't win and have mostly given up it is again simpler to win.","1391213707"

With your solution, I think you'd still end up needing at least one motor per row of panels, and perhaps they'd need to be more powerful since they adjust multiple panels at once.  With the robots you only need two motors for an entire block of panels, and they only need to be powerful enough to adjust one panel at a time.  Also, if your robot has a motor fail, you can just use the backup (they assume two per block) whereas with your system you'd have to replace it immediately to avoid losing tracking capability.","1391213709"

"norge","t5_2qh94","Jeg blir trist av at du som poster og et par av kommentarene har så barnslige og generaliserende holdninger til AUF. 

For det første vil jeg avklare to ting:

Jeg er selv medlem (tidligere aktivt, nå mer passivt) i AUF Kristiansand, og jeg er for en gradvis legalitetsendring av de fleste narkotiske stoffer (merk, ikke legemiddel)

Kort sagt ser jeg for meg at dne beste løsningen på det enorme problemet vi har med narkotika i dag vil være å avkriminalisere en viss mengde brukerdoser av alle narkotiske stoffer samtidig som hjelpetilbudet i form av LAR-senter/heroinassistert behandling blir kraftig utbygd. I sammenheng med dette er det også ekstremt nødvendig å fullstendig endre undervisningen om narkotika i skolen ved å gå helt vekk i fra den tradisjonelle skremselspropagandaen vi alle har vært utsatt for og heller gi ærlig og nøyaktig informasjon om alle aspekter ved rusmiddelbruk.

Det siste, og kanskje viktigste punktet er at det må øremerkes store beløp til og omprioriteres ressurser i politiet slik at de i større grad kan fokusere på produsenter/smuglere/storselgere av narkotika framfor gatelangere og misbrukere.

Så langt tror jeg vi er enige.

Det du derimot ikke forstår, er at AUF er en organisasjon med over 13000 medlemmer og at innad i ungdomspartiet er det helt vanvittig store forskjeller i meninger.

Jeg har vært med i over fire år og vet om folk som egentlig skulle vært med i FPU eller UV men som er med i AUF og til og med har tillitsverv. Det samme gjelder personer jeg kjenner i andre ungdomspartier.

Det at AUF-lederen i Tromsø sier noe om at hun synes det er greit med razziaer i klasserom osv, er veldig langt i fra mine erfaringer blant med-AUFere.

Videre må det påpekes at den typen holdninger som kommer fram i artikkelen, samt hele skremselspropaganden fra myndighetene, ikke er gammeldags overhodet.

Da jeg gikk på videregående for et par år siden hadde vi rusforedrag hvert eneste år, obligatorisk oppmøte og foredragsholdere med ""erfaring"" fra kommunens rusmiddelbehandling og politifolk. Det var ren skremselspropaganda som særlig var rettet mot Cannabis, og det var fullstendig latterlig.

Poenget er i alle fall: logikken er gammeldags og helt på trynet, men det er den som er gjeldende i dag og er ikke ""borte"" fra unervisninga.

Edit: med ""gradvis legalitetsendring"" mener jeg at vi på sikt må jobbe mot at noen av de mindre ""farlige"" narkotiske stoffer skal legaliseres fullstendig.","1391213709"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Cassiopeia has to be able to kite decently well. Her abilities are all pretty low damage, but in combination can tear anyone apart. Her E is reliant on hitting q or w. But her W is on a 12 seconds cooldown (I believe). Her Q is on a 3 so if you don't hit your Q, then your E goes on cd and your dps goes down for the next 3 or 5 seconds. Cassiopeia's burst takes a good 3 seconds to get off, if her ulted isn't landed.

Lux has a burst in which you spam all your buttons then wait for cooldowns, then you fire them again. Lux's burst can blow a carry up from a good distance, if she hits a Q. Cassiopeia has to get at a medium distance and out maneuver the enemy for the kill. And lux's W really can't miss yourself. Skill shot for your team, but impossible to miss yourself.

There is more to a skill cap, then the amount of skill shots in one's kit.

You would force everyone to serve dill pickle chips. That's the problem. 

No one is telling you you can't eat dill pickle chips. I'm just telling you I won't serve dill pickle chips. 

You're forcing me to stock, and then serve, dill pickle chips. 

You're compelling me to act in a way which violates my ability to ""remain a happily practicing Catholic."" The radical secular crowd needs to give up the whole sham of ""You can of course remain a happily practicing Catholic"" because when it comes to actually allowing those who are practicing Catholics to earn a living, they'll be sued or intimidated for doing so.

If I'm a restaurant owner, and you want dill pickle chips, go elsewhere.

If I'm a doctor and you want contraceptives and/or abortifacients, go elsewhere. 

Is that so hard? No.

But, apparently, radical secularists *must compel* others to act in the ways radical secularists believe are just, which of course *must* be the right way because after all they're radical secularists and are perfectly, strictly rational. The fact is radical secularists believe in the supremacy of their beliefs above anyone elses, and feel it's proper and correct - and, dare I say, *good* - to compel others to act accordingly.

On top of that, you are super squishy just using your dive and spirit, with the sunray you are really just a free target.

Unless you play pheonix like a passive teamfight supporter (which, i just think is a bad idea) i highly recommend maxing dive and spirits before thinking of sunray. To be honest the best reason to get sunray at all is the fact that dive and spirits have huge cd. I guess its a hoperful nuke lategame as well, if you got farm aka a lot of hp/hp regen.","1391213713"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Sorry for the wait, I've been busy IRL, and I have to give your comment the reply it deserves.

First of all, I'd like to point out that we are currently peacefully edition warring. We are talking about games, comparing, contrasting, arguing, without vitriol, and this is how it should be. Proof that edition wars can be both peaceful and good ;)

I'll start by the end of your post.

About the use of injury systems vs hp in games. I talked too fast on that one, you're right. 

&gt; I have an hypothesis that the hp mechanic in a generalized form, like the advanced ability tests in Dragon Age, is underused. I want to try running a game where I primarily use that mechanic.

I feel why you don't do that for your current campaign. Once a campaign is started, converting everything to the new system is often not worth it, especially if what you have is adequate. 

Also, the idea of a generalized hp mechanic is quite interesting. It seems similar to the Hit Dice mechanic from Chainmail, where the Hit Dice is a general amalgam of combat ability, and a 4 HD creature attacks with 4 Dice and can take 4 dice before dying. Or, it could be a general hp pool that represents reserves of combat ability, luck, etc... like in Numenera, I suppose. 

&gt; And, for me, this is one of the best and most important features of the hobby. Having a human making rulings instead of simply following rules.

I agree that when the hobby was starting, yes, this was important. Back then, they pretty much had to make rulings, it was a necessity, for lack of coherent game design. RPG gamers were like pioneers on the Oregon Trail, though dying from deadly traps, goblins, and dragons instead of dysentery, and adventuring using makeshift wagons. Today, it still is, but after more than 40 years of rpg gaming, I'd expect high-efficiency and high-speed trains instead of a rickety old wagon that needs a ruling every fifteen minutes. I expect that because the goal is to have stories and adventure, and the system is the engine that tells the game master how to formalize characters and relevant elements of the setting and how to resolve the various challenges. Why isn't D&amp;D tight as a tiger yet? Why can't it help players do things in the game, from combat to negotiation and everything else that is useful in a game, by giving efficient, clear procedures that doesn't restrict creativity? You want to jump from the ledge and cut the rope while landing on the orc? Ok, that's how it's done, roll, ok you succeed in cutting the rope, but you don't land on the orc. 

This is, in closing, the problem I have with the idea that rulings is somehow a really good thing. A ""Rulings, not rules"" mentality is awesome fun and appropriate when using a rules-light game (I'm totally for that), but it is just a way to compensate for a bad system otherwise (I'm looking at you, AD&amp;D).

&gt;  You play it, and you see how it works. :-)

Now, my arguments are more theoretical, because I'm a huge nerd and read a few things on RPG websites. But I first saw the problems with D&amp;D 3.5, and then AD&amp;D, and then the whole of D&amp;D, by playing it. I have none of those problems with other games. I can say much about minor and major issues with D&amp;D as a whole, but my reply is already pretty long. First, I want to make clear that issues with the game doesn't mean you can't have fun with it, but likewise, it is not because you can have fun with it that you can't criticize a game. Who you're playing with and the story you're making are also important. The system has some importance, so that is what we are talking about. We are in agreement on the importance of good friends, a good GM and a good story to the enjoyment of a game, so let's stick our conversation to the game system itself.

I think we can agree that a game rule can be a problem if applying it produces inappropriate results. Let me know what you think of this example, which I think combines many problems. I call it the ''Ogre Problem''. Have your warriors (nevermind wizards) every been scared by an ogre in D&amp;D? forget 1st level characters, they should be scared of everything, I'm talking about level 3 and up. You can scale this for much larger foes as well. I find large opponents underwhelming. Remember in LOTR, the whole fellowship had to gang up on a single cave troll. I doubt a cave troll has much more than 6HD in AD&amp;D, and if that's the case, the fellowship ranges from 1st to 4th level, at most.But if that's the case, the 1HD orcs would have killed quite a few.

So this is what I'm talking about. The expectations the D&amp;D rules bring are... wonky. This wouldn't be the case, were we playing a game that uses Basic Roleplaying's engine, like Runequest 6...","1391213714"

&gt;Bywater’s deep-set eyes met the dwarf’s mismatched ones, and did not blink. “You most of all, my lord.” 

&gt;“Most of all?” The injustice was like to choke him. “It was Joffrey who told them to eat their dead, Joffrey who set his dog on them. How could they blame me?”

&gt;“His Grace is but a boy. In the streets, it is said that he has evil councillors. The queen has never been known as a friend to the commons, nor is Lord Varys called the Spider out of love . . . but it is you they blame most. Your sister and the eunuch were here when times were better under King Robert, but you were not. They say that you’ve filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages, brutes who take what they want and follow no laws but their own. They say you exiled Janos Slynt because you found him too bluff and honest for your liking. They say you threw wise and gentle Pycelle into the dungeons when he dared raise his voice against you. Some even claim that you mean to seize the Iron Throne for your own.” 

&gt;“Yes, and I am a monster besides, hideous and misshapen, never forget that.” His hand coiled into a fist. “I’ve heard enough. We both have work to attend to. Leave me.”

Truth never gets in the way of a good slandering rumour. He's a dwarf and he's freakish looking. Those are the first impressions people get of him and they instinctively look for reasons to despise and lessen him to best fit that first impression. People'd just decide he was fucking Cersei right alongside Kingslayer or any other story that would cast him in the most negative light.

And the idea of the Faith finding it in their heart to forgive his kinslaying. No, not a chance. They'd take his head and count themselves fortunate of being rid of both Tywin and Tyrion.

"politics","t5_2cneq"," She might.

 Support for legalisation stands at 55%.

I could only see her going ahead with the following  preconditions:

1. Two states enact legalisation every year between here and her being selected as the Democratic candidate to run in the presidential election. This would bring the total to  six successful state efforts to legalise.

2.  The support for legalisation in polls breaking 2/3  of  voters  in 2016.

 In such a case,  she may talk vaguely about  decriminalisation  until both of these criteria are met whereupon she may switch to legalisation to get out the youth vote and ensure her place in the White House.

 Assuming all these things happen,  we may see legalisation of weed come 2018  at the earliest.  It would also need bipartisan support and that is far from guaranteed.  We don't know if the Republicans will treat  her like Obama or not.

 Time will tell.

 The safe thing would be for more states to legalise and for public opinion to break 80+%  so  it's not a political risk at all.  Hence my comment earlier about 2020.","1391213724"

 [**Argumentum ad lapidem**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum%20ad%20lapidem): 

---

&gt;

&gt;**Argumentum ad lapidem** ([Latin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin): ""to the stone"") is a [logical fallacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) that consists in dismissing a statement as absurd without giving proof of its absurdity. The form of argument employed by such dismissals is the **argumentum ad lapidem**, or **appeal to the stone**.

&gt;Ad lapidem statements are fallacious because they fail to address the merits of the claim in dispute. Ad hominem arguments, which dispute the merits of a claim's advocate rather than the merits of the claim itself, are fallacious for the same reason. The same applies to [proof by assertion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_assertion), where an unproved or disproved claim is asserted as true on no ground other than that of its truth having been asserted.

&gt;The name of this fallacy is attributed to Dr. [Samuel Johnson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Johnson), who refuted [Bishop Berkeley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Berkeley)'s [immaterialist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immaterialism) philosophy (that there are no material objects, only minds and ideas in those minds), by kicking a large stone and asserting, ""I refute it thus."" This action, which fails to prove the existence of the stone outside of the ideas formed by perception, fails to contradict Berkeley's argument, and has been seen as merely dismissing it.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","What's funny is I can make out what may be a jizz stain near the collar, thankfully in the part that's thrown away and not turned into a dress for a little girl.

Situation reminds me of when I used to jack off in the shower as a kid I'd make sure I had to pee really bad before showering and then when I came at the last possible moment when my orgasm was about to wear off I'd relax my bladder and the jet off piss would extend my orgasm for as long as I was pissing. I also loved the pleasurepain from jerking off as hard as I could right after I came.

Another guilty pleasure is scrolling through my older brothers exes facebook. Not just for the obvious ""bikini pic"" reasons and fact that I once ""accidentally"" walked in on her getting dressed and using the toilet.

It started about 8 years ago when I was 15. When I first started producing semen with my orgasms I freaked out, and was very meticulous about cleaning it up. Oftentimes I'd squeeze my dick and just let it dribble out and do the 'ol ""cup and slurp"" and not have to bother with kleenex. From jerking off freely in the shower I realized how much better freely ejaculating felt and I vowed never to hinder my orgasms again. Once I got the internet in my room it naturally became my jerkoff center and having a large empty space of floor near my computer I'd just let my jizz fly freely.

Since I was jerking off 6-12 times a day paper towels would be a huge hassle, so I soon settled on t-shirts. I hated using my day to day clothes so a vintage ninja turtles t-shirt I'd last wore when I was 11 became my ""jizz mop."" It was a group shot of all 4 turtles inside a circle and the way Michaelangelo smiled and gave the thumbs up was kind of like he was encouraging me to ejaculate.

I'd freely jizz all over the floor (usually to ideepthroat.com clips or short preview clips I found on magicteapot.com) then get the turtles shirt out of my desk drawer, mop it up and toss it back in the drawer. After 5 days and over 40 loads it was more cum than shirt and would refuse to absorb anything. At which point I'd do a wash, and reluctantly use kleenex as a backup.

My super cool 20 year old brother had an absolutely gorgeous and kind girlfriend he met at university, who often stayed over in our house during the summer. I live on a lake in Nova Scotia, and she'd often spend hours lazing out on the dock with my brother and I'll admit to staring at her bikini cleavage through binoculars out my upstairs window and furiously whacking off.

One morning I went down to breakfast and saw her at the table wearing my turtles shirt. It took every ounce of energy not to point and shout ""my jizz mop!!!"" instead I said ""oh, my old turtles shirt!"" She laughed and said. ""oh, it was in your brothers laundry. It's got some grease stains but it's super comfortable and makes a great pajama top!""

""Haha, no problem, you can keep it. I haven't worn it in years!"" This was fabric I had ejaculated on nearly a thousand times and she was wearing it! Even though it was washed I could clearly make out several cum stains and the fact they were touching her skin drove me wild. It was almost like I was constantly ejaculating on her milky skin every second she wore that shirt. My mom said ""oh isn't this nice!"" when she saw us all eating breakfast together and took some pictures. Once they were developed I scanned them into my computer and they soon became my primary pornography. And I got instantly hard whenever I saw her at our house wearing the shirt and would have to sprint into my room to jerk off.

A few weeks later I was looking in my moms closet for my old nintendo system and games when I found a box of vintage t-shirts from the early 80's. My brothers girlfriend wasn't exactly a hipster but she LOVED vintage t-shirts. Looking through the box I realized many of the designs on the front were iron on patches. A lightbulb went off in my head and I got a glass of water, turned the shirt inside out and splashed some on the back of the patch. Sure enough when the shirt was de-insideouted no discoloration or darkness from the water was visible. I then hauled the box into my room, turned all the shirts with decals inside out, came into my handm and rubbed my semen all over the back of the patches and then hung them in my closet to dry. After a few hours I smelt them and though I didn't really notice anything I rubbed a small amount of deoderant on them just to be safe.

I then lovingly refolded them and put them back in the box and in my moms room, then yelled to my brother, ""hey look what I found!"" ""Holy shit! Sarah would love these!"" And they ended up being part of his birthday gift to her. She screamed when she opened them and ended up trying on every shirt. She actually went for a jog with my brother that night and I'm almost certain the sweat and heat would have made caused the semen to leak and be absorbed by her skin, and travel through her bloodstream. For the next month she almost always wore a shirt that had absorbed my ejaculate, and it never failed to turn me on.

After a couple of years they broke up, as young lovers do. But it was on friendly terms and I now have her as a facebook friend, and she wears the turtles and iron on shirts to this day! She's in an all girl indy/punk rockish band in Montreal now and on their facebook page you can see a few concert pics where her and her bandmates are all wearing the jizz shirts!

Whenever I have ""masturbation block"" and nothings doing it for me, all I need to do is open the folder of her pictures on my desktop, see my fossils touching her, and I'm home.

A currency gains value by simply being backed and spread around and being valuable. Sounds like a circular argument but think about this: We all have various personal items that we deem ""valuable"" but whether everyone thinks they are valuable is questionable. 

Well, we have dogecoin. We as the dogecoin community have deemed it valuable, we are slowly increasing the value of by using dogecoin and spreading its good name. This is how economies start.","1391213727"

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I think mass media and pop culture for today is fantastic. The fact that media is so broad today that it has become individualized. It so broad, Netflix had to make genres more specific. (Canadian Thrillers, Food Documentaries). Also, in music, we aren't seeing as many politics as before in the industry. We saw a band who has created a very large following with very little radio airplay finally get their day in the sun (I'm talking about Daft Punk). We also saw a musical act (Macklemore and Ryan Lewis) that rose drastically in popularity without a major label behind them.

We saw the weirdest change in gender dynamics. Today we are seeing things that women enjoy that even back in the 2000s would be considered sexist. Whether you like it or not, 50 Shades of Gray gave rise to a sexual culture of domination/submission. This became reflected in movies (Magic Mike) and music (Blurred Lines, Gorilla). 

Overall, I think today's mass media and pop culture is closer to representing the culture of the people than that of a culture taken controlled by industry.","1391213727"

"battlefield_4","t5_2uie9","I feel they should have a slightly longer reload time, and should not cause mobility hits unless choppers drop below 40 health. A large part of the issue is that if someone tries to stinger you, and you flare, and a second person shoots another stinger, you are immobile. In this time, the same person can reload and lock again. Once you are disabled once, on maps like Lancang and Golmud, you are dead. You cannot escape in most situations like this unless you are near the one and only useful building on the entire map. Once a stinger has hit you, you are its bitch, because you will be hit again less than a second after regaining mobility. This can, and does, occur even when only one person is trying to hit you, because sometimes they can spawn directly under you with a stinger, and you cannot fly outside its effective range before it locks on again - which is another reason why it sucks to fly on Golmud and Lancang.

I also believe you should be able to carry less rockets, as a piece of gear you can simply spawn with, it has too much capacity for airspace denial because it simply comes with too much ammo. I would liken this to the idea of the mortar stocking a dozen shells max instead of its current capacity - its just too much ability to do its function, particularly when it is too strong at its function in the first place.

I also understand you use the scout helicopters a lot, but the issue is mainly affecting attack choppers, because they are large (meaning ECM does not work because the helicopter is as long as a missiles turning radius), and slow (meaning they cannot escape from stingers when engis spawn in awkward places - which is oft not the pilots fault - although sometimes it is).

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","Sounds like your rules are rather different from the ones I've played. Let me know what you think of this:

For four players (though you can play with 3+). Spades are trump. Deal 11 cards to everyone, then, beginning with the player to the left of the dealer, each player bids a certain number of tricks. The dealer cannot bid a value that would make the sum of bids equal the number of tricks. That is, if there are 11 tricks and the bids were: 3,3,4, the dealer cannot bid 1. 

Each player that makes the amount they bid gets 10 points. Taking fewer tricks than bid earns 0 points. Taking more tricks than bid earns one point per trick.

Example: I bid 3. If I take 3, then I get 10 points. 2 tricks is 0 points. And 4 tricks is 4 points.

Thus, you always want to take what you bid, but if you aren't going to make it, then take as many as possible.

Subsequent rounds, deal 1 fewer card per person all the way down to 1 and then back up to 11.

Teams can be played 2v2 with teammates alternating seats. Sum the bid of each teammate and the team combined must take that many tricks. ie if I bid 3 and you bid 2, then combined we have to take 5, doesn't matter who takes them.


This is a much more elegant game than a lot of other Spades variants I've played and less about ""who has the biggest cards."" Having lots of big cards and big spades is not inherently better than having low cards. In fact, having no Spades and all low cards is a great hand as you can easily bid 0. It's the hand that include a couple high, but not super high cards, and then some middling Spades that are tricky. There's also no passing, which is great fun in other games like Hearts, but doesn't really fit with this.

I'd love to hear what you think if you try playing it. I played with a guy at work who grew up playing a version more like yours I believe. Showed him this version and he was converted.","1391213735"

It's fine to claim that, but until we actually see a tea party candidate come out and say something like ""I'm in the Tea Party and Republicans need to stop trying to shove their religion down people's throats"" then it's all just theoretical Tea Party membership.

&gt; What the Tea Party believes is that debt is the fiscal equivalent of Global Warming.

So, they believe that there is no debt?  And even if there was it wasn't caused by people?

&gt; America a going down a path that is going to be irreversible, and if we don't do something serious about it soon, then our children will suffer from our lack of will. It will be painful to reverse the trend, but it must be done.
Most of them believe that they are SAVING America from the reckless free spenders who are destroying it.

Yet they don't advocate fixing the problem in any reasonable way.  They suggest that we ignore the parts of the budget where we spend the  most money and focus on cutting the parts where we spend the least.

Our Generals are BEGGING Congress to not buy more tanks and are still getting multimillion dollar tanks shoved down their throats, meanwhile the Tea Party is looking to save 5 grand by cutting back on school lunches.

It's more than a little dishonest to claim to be for reducing debt if you aren't actually willing to touch the biggest parts of Government spending.

As far as I'm aware, people just don't like it. You can get this color scheme with any of the loyalty SOE camos for free, so it's not worth $5, or even $2.50. I mean, I like it, but I see the colors that I submitted. 

And yet Tidal was kept with its color scheme:

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Here is what WikiBot found on ""irony"":

**Irony**  
&gt; Irony (from Ancient Greek εἰρωνεία (eirōneía), meaning ""dissimulation, feigned ignorance""), in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event characterized by an incongruity, or contrast, between what the expectations of a situation are and what is really the case, with a third element, that defines that what is really the case is ironic because of the situation that led to it. The term may be further defined into several categories, among which are: verbal, dramatic, and situational.
Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.
Other forms, as identified by historian Connop Thirlwall, include dialectic and practical irony.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I would recommend getting him into some kind of therapy, preferably with someone who specializes not just in pediatric eating disorders, but boys with eating disorders if there's anyone like that near you. I would also get a medical workup done by his doctor to rule out any physical causes, like vitamin deficiency or endocrine disorders and so on. As an eating disorder veteran, the sooner he gets some kind of help, the better, as the more it escalates and the longer it goes on, the harder it is to treat and becomes more likely to become a lifelong battle. The foods he's binging on are classic binge foods, you don't hear much about people binging on chicken or lentils or other proteins. 

I started ""dieting"" around 11 and became officially bulimic by 13. I was caught and hospitalized at 16, and went in and out of remission until I was nearly 30. I've achieved a kind of uneasy peace with it since then, at least for now, but have lifelong issues with my kidneys, blood sugar, blood pressure, and metabolism. Because of my issues, we've always watched our kids carefully for signs of eating issues. Two years ago, we got word that our 12 year old was throwing away her lunch at school almost every day *and* our 9 year old (who has always been a bit preoccupied with weight) may or may not be making herself vomit on occasion. We sat down, asked their side of it, discussed my history and how it affected my life. The older one just didn't like school lunch, but the younger was in counseling for about a year. 

I was in treatment with a couple boys, and they tended to be very embarrassed about having a disorder typically associated with girls. You may have an extra hard time getting him to talk about this with you because of that. I would seek out professional help sooner rather than later. If it turns out you jumped the gun a little, he gets an extra check up and talks about healthy eating habits and dealing with stress with a professional, no harm done.

Despite how Tottenham look against lesser sides, when it comes to facing anyone else in the top 6 they're sure to drop points after that display against City.  

Alberto, Moses and Aspas will get better; Coutinho will regain his brilliance; Lucas, Sakho, Agger, Enrique and Johnson will all return to fitness and we'll have a strong 11 again.

People who are capable but not necessarily predisposed to that style of thinking are likely going to go a different route. People tend to follow the path of least resistance.

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","&gt; The whole ""dominance"", ""Pack"" theory came from when they took a bunch of wolves, from different packs and put them together in a confined space.

You're referring to Shenkel's work in the '40s studying wolves in zoos and his paper [""Expressions Studies on Wolves""](http://www.davemech.org/schenkel/index.html)

And you're right, it's not valid. Captive wolves in a zoo penned together in a small area unnaturally aren't going to act and behave as they would in the wild.

You're also right about the pack being a family heirarchy. The ""alphas"" of the pack are the mother and father, and all the rest of the pack members are offspring. When they mature, they wander off and form their own families. i.e. - they're BLOOD related.

Dogs aren't human, and they know damn well you're not a dog. The best dog trainers really aren't training dogs at all, they're training the humans. Training the people to be consistent, and behave in a manner that gets the dog to act the way they want it to act.","1391213751"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You seem to be missing my point. Furthermore, this discussion has been going on all day. This will be my last reply.

I am in no way saying PHP and C are the same thing like you seem to think. I know they are two very different languages.

What I am saying is that, as someone who programs in PHP, Java, and Obj-C on a daily basis, I would not have had such an easy time learning these languages if it was not for the similar structure across all three languages. That's my entire point. I'm not trying to argue about interpreted/compiled, etc as you seem to be thinking. I know they are all very different in this way.

My original post was to someone just looking to get into programming. Do you think they need to know OO/Procedural, paradigms, etc, at this point? No. From a purely educational aspect, these ""beyond trivial"" reasons I listed are exactly what a new programmer needs to focus on until they have a decent handle on the syntax, because more often then not, errors in a new programmers programs are caused by misplaced/misused delimiters, and other ""beyond trivial"" mistakes that newbies make.

As far as whitespace goes, once again, readability is largely a personal issue. Like I said, I don't like the idea of having a syntax error simply because I'm missing a space. I'm sure if I was much more experienced in Python, this wouldn't be an issue. But again, because so many languages are C-based, it's easy to dig straight into a language that shares the same structure.

Edit: one last point. I think you need to realize that ""C-based"" doesn't mean that the language is literally related to C. It just means that it looks like and/or has C roots.","1391213752"
"batman","t5_2qqt8","I think what really cements Joker as one of, if not the, most disturbing villains in modern fiction is the fact that almost nothing is known about him. Joker embodies chaos. Where's he from? What's his real name? What's his ultimate goal? We'll never know. Hell we're not even sure if he's truly insane. And considering he is one of the most boisterous and out there characters in modern fiction, that's saying something. This ambiguity about his past, can unfortunately, sometimes lead to lazy writing, but for the most part it allows the great writers to let their imaginations flow in some truly unique directions. When Joker shows up, all predictability goes out the window. Chaos will reign, and the most disturbing parts of the writer's psyche can come out.","1391213752"

I do have trouble even with the meds when I go a few nights in a row averaging 3 or 4 hours of sleep. I'm fortunate enough to spend most of my year in a city/at a university where I don't need a car. The few times that I do need to drive when it isn't really safe, I use extreme caution (I'll drive 10 mph or so under the speed limit, pull over to let people pass, slow down at intersections, etc.). I hope to live in this city full time in a few years, but until then, driving is a necessity during the summer. It's the cruel reality of the suburbs.

I don't want to get too off-topic and political here, but if you ever have to vote on developing/maintaining a public transportation system in your area, please keep the disabled in mind. You can't expect me to both have a job and not drive when there's no public transportation.

"cigars","t5_2r090","I think most ""starter kits"" are ripoffs, cheap humidors and cheaper cigars. Not much can be said for the lighters and cutters they have in there either.

My honest suggestion to a true newbie, start simple, you might find that you don't enjoy cigars, or don't enjoy having a humidor and just want to smoke one on occasion. Then you're out whatever you paid for everything. If you really do find this is enjoyable, you can take the time to hunt down a good deal on a real humidor or honestly just set up a coolerador. If I had it to do over again that's the route I would have taken, less stress.

The cheapest easiest solution is to get a tupperware container and make a tupperador to store the cigars, then if you don't like it you have a nice tupperware container for your leftovers. Then download the history tool for Chrome and go to www.cigarbid.com and start buying cigars, check the list in the wiki for good smokes and when in doubt use Google to check reviews. As for the cutter and lighter, any B&amp;M will have cutters for sale or you can pick one up cheap on Amazon or any of the sites from the wiki. You can invest in a lighter if you want, the Ronson from Walmart is a cheap torch lighter but don't forget the important thing is just not using the wrong fuel so honestly you can use a cheap disposable *Bic* lighter. They use butane and there isn't anything wrong with using a soft flame, a lot of people do. The final step is while you are waiting for your cigars to arrive, take the time to read the wiki and learn about cutting, lighting and smoking cigars, no sense in getting nice sticks and butchering them.

My generic advice to all new smokers, eat something before smoking, keep a sweet drink around in case the cigar is too strong for you and you get sick and finally, smoke slowly puffing every 15-30 seconds seems natural to some people but it's going to cause the cigar to heat up and taste like crap.

But try it sometime), but you've hit so many of the problems AND solutions in this region. We have a polycentric region, which was great in 1990 when we had 3 million people, but now we have 6 million.  In 2025, it looks like we're getting another million.

The question isn't what can we do to fix today's commute. That's a lost cause. The question is how do we keep 2025 from being a total disaster every day.

Atlanta is a city that loves silver bullets and there just isn't one for this.  GRTA has teeth, but is run through the governor.  Governors don't get elected by promising central control and taxes in Georgia. MARTA is getting better but has a tough history. Low-rise, medium density transit-oriented-development could build the density we need for transit, but there's too much opposition in the suburbs.  There's density and transit in the city, but the schools are a mess.

As for SCIENCE (which I do and love), we're making modeled plans at Tech, they're making modeled plans at GDOT, they're modeling plans at ARC, think tanks from Cato to APTA are running models for Atlanta.  TSPLOST was modeled AND had a sunset clause. We've got scientific plans left right and center, but we just can't SELL them.

Are you trying to do a fun let's play, where humor and player personality are a big factor? Is it a walk-through type let's play, in which case smart editing and thoroughness are most important? Is it an analytical/review let's play, where player credibility and extensive knowledge are key in establishing? Something else or a combination?

I should at least say now that gender is rarely an important factor in choosing whether or not to watch a let's player--some people might be less inclined to watch a female player because of stereotypes, in which case the way you behave shouldn't matter to them at all and you needn't bother worrying what they'll think.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","dealbreakers in general are perfectly fine to have. (i had a particular one that kept me out of the dating pool for years.  mine was so particular, that i had to resort to the internet.  which is fine, since i would have been more compatible with someone who also had to choose the internet as well.  the bar scene is just not my bag.  i knew i would feel horrible if i subconsciously ""made"" a guy go vegetarian for me, so i needed to be proactive and specifically find guys who already had decided on their own to go vegetarian.  luckily it finally worked.)

with your situation, though, you don't have the benefit of a dating website specifically for women who choose to use birth control.  i mean, i guess stay away from the religious girls?  there tends to be a pretty vast crossover there.  it's also kind of taboo to discuss it too early in a relationship, so i feel ya.

 it can, however, get manipulative really fast. so you really have to be diligent, and make it abundantly clear that it's not an ultimatum, and that you won't be angry at her if she chooses not to take over on the birth control front.  women with low self esteem might appear to be laid back and agreeable on the surface, but pay attention.  if she seems like she's faking her enthusiasm, have an honest talk with her, and assure her that she's beautiful and might be even more compatible with another guy than she is with you.  (sometimes we get tunnel vision, and will stay with someone way longer than we should.  i think part of it's because we feel like we've invested the energy, so it'd be a waste not to try to work it out.)

i do hope that you have this discussion before you have sex for the first time, because it could really damage someone if they're dumped, after having been intimate, for such a (seemingly, from the woman's perspective) petty reason.  everyone's different though, so there could be some ladies who would be fine with the short-term companionship with a pre-planned end point, but some women enter into relationships thinking about the longer term potentiality, and tend to keep the offer of sex limited to guys she feels particularly compatible with.  you need to let her know of the incompatibility as soon as you can.","1391213764"

A weird dude, a crazy chef, and a crazy older italian server lady were all hanging out at that recently closed down restaurant in the french market. they asked if i wanted to come inside and sit down. i did. they gave me red beans and rice. the weird dude wanted me to go work at creole cottage. i ended up stopping by the creole cottage place out of curiosity more than anything, and then serving there for about 2 weeks. in those two weeks...well, the weird dude ended up threatening the server lady (who i never saw again) via his bodyguard buddy, and threatening her friends, phone numbers that had been shut off, cameras, ""i just sent [his bodyguard] down the street and you know what he does."" and i couldn't tell if it was just silliness or what (like that mr. show skit where the dude is like ""you two wanna get hooked up i know where the good shit is"" and it's just a legitimate transaction each time,) lots of money family mafia-ish type talk. weird truck trips picking shit up from here to there back to somewhere else like they were going off to war, houses with no power, asking me how long that cop car had been parked across the street. goofy. it's hard to describe how odd it was and why the people involved were involved. it was endlessly insane...i didn't stay for the money but because something new and amazingly weird happened every day, hour, and the bodyguard would loom throughout and people would come in telling me they know the family, in a ""...do you understand...what i mean...when i say i know the family..."" way, as they pinpoint level their eyes at me, which, no, i didn't understand what anyone was trying to imply or what they wanted from me other than ""that's nice, they're a nice family.""

i was told i couldn't go out back because people were taking pictures of us from the balconies. it could have been true. i liked the mom and the nephew, niece, and uncle though, good and sweet-hearted, interesting people, so other things i would say about what happened there to make it clear how ridiculous it was, i'm not gonna say, but that place was something else. the mom is actually a wonderful cook so the traditional creole dishes there are super legit. 

there were no health code violations when i was there though. everything was labeled proper and as long as one lady chef was working or having anything to do with it, it was all good. kiddies from the family would hang out some days, make big paper airplanes with the table toppers and fly them in front of the store. They're just kooky and the one dude is manic and hyper paranoid. he wanted to give me a car, randomly. no thank you. they could absolutely have their own tv show. one time i had to serve the nephew a bible and tell him to pray to calm down, it was intensely weird, cute, weird. the enigmatic happenings of it though got outweighed by the possible risks involved with being at all involved with it and i never went back. 

so there ya go.  ","1391213764"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Bed - opinions vary, but I think IKEA's stuff is overpriced. Costco is actually selling beds right now and they are priced VERY well.

Kitchen Supplies - if you have the money, bone china is amazing. If you don't, it doesn't matter really what you get (IMO). Target sells stylish plates for pretty cheap. As far as utensils go, I've compared prices at the thrift store to prices at Walmart/Target, and Walmart/Target are actually cheaper. One of those odd anomalies you wouldn't really expect.

Dresser - IKEA. So cheap, great looking. The particle board stuff is the cheapest, if you want solid wood, I would recommend used.

Lounge chair - for soft seating, I actually think IKEA is overpriced. In our area (Seattle), Mor furniture is BY FAR the cheapest place around.

TV - slickdeals.net, amazon.com/gp/goldbox, and woot.com. So many great deals on TVs all the time.

All the recommendations above are for NEW stuff. If you really want to save, buying a used dresser, lounge chair, and TV aren't a bad way to go. I wouldn't recommend buying a used bed or kitchen supplies.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Lets look at what AnandTech [ACTUALLY said](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7603/mac-pro-review-late-2013/14), rather than the bullshit you're saying they said.


&gt; Next I tried a heavier workload on the CPU: a H.264 video encode. Here I just ran the x264 5.01 benchmark in parallel with the LuxMark workload. Once again, I saw no drop in CPU or GPU clocks although I believe I was approaching the limits of where that would hold true. The system was pulling an average of 410W at that point, with peak power draw at 429W.

[Then look at the picture.](http://images.anandtech.com/reviews/mac/MacPro2013/CPUGPUx264.png) See how none of the temps are over 90 degrees under a *heavier than normal* workload?

&gt; So far I wasn’t surprised by the platform’s behavior. The Mac Pro’s thermal core and fan was enough to handle a real world workload without throttling. But what about a power virus? For this I ran a combination of FurMark at 2560 x 1440 and Prime95 (in-place large FFTs) across all GPUs and CPU cores.

So his next test was designed to tax both the CPU and GPUs at 100%. Literally the absolute maximum. 

&gt; The GPUs peaked at 97C, which is pretty much as high as a 28nm Tahiti should ever go. The CPU hit a similar temperature, with most cores hovering around 95C. GPU clocks seemed ok, with both GPUs running between 650 - 850MHz (base - boost). The CPU on the other hand dropped down to 2.1GHz (I even saw a short excursion down to 2GHz). Average power while running this workload was 437W, peaking at 463W before CPU throttling kicked in. If you plot out a graph of power vs. time you can see the CPU throttling kick in during the workload.

The  GPU and a few CPU cores hit **97C** (still lower than the 98C you claimed), and then the computer throttled, exactly as it was supposed to. Finally, and most importantly, lets see what the author had to say:

&gt; I have to stress that I haven’t been able to get this to happen in any normal workload, only what’s effectively a power virus for the GPUs and something quite unrealistic for the CPUs. Either way it shows us the upper limit of what the thermal core can do.

Under *heavy use, rendering and other benchmarks* he was at or below 90C. Only after maxing out everything, using (and I'm using the author's words here) **""what's effectively a power virus for the GPUs and something quite unrealistic for the CPUs""**, did he hit those temps, and the computer safety handled them via throttling.

Second, slower paced teams haven't really made deep tourney runs of late, see Wisco, Cinci as a few who come to mind. I'm not ruling out a deep run but fast pace and high offensive officiency seems to go a long way in march.

---

&gt;

&gt;**Paprika** (パプリカ, Papurika) is a 2006 Japanese [animated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime) [film](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film) co-written and directed by [Satoshi Kon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon), based on [Yasutaka Tsutsui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasutaka_Tsutsui)'s 1993 [novel of the same name](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paprika_(novel\)), about a research psychologist who uses a device that permits therapists to help patients by entering their dreams. It is Kon's fourth and final feature film before his death in 2010.

&gt;Kon and Seishi Minakami wrote the film's script, and [Madhouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhouse_(company\)) animated and produced the film alongside [Sony Pictures Entertainment (Japan)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_Entertainment_Japan), which distributed it in Japan. The film's score was composed by [Susumu Hirasawa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susumu_Hirasawa).

&gt;The soundtrack is significant for being the first film to use a [Vocaloid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocaloid) and the ""Lola"" Vocaloid was used for various tracks.

The reasons you're using to support your opinion don't hold up when countered with reasons to support another opinion, so I'm left to wonder why you've chosen the opinion you have.

"ministry","t5_2u447","I am a children's pastor, and I received my first initial call into ministry from God. However, the call to the area of ministry happened through other people. At the time, I was set to work with high school students, but through verbal confirmation from others, I made the switch to children's ministry. 4 1/2 years later within children's ministry, I couldn't imagine doing anything else. 

Take a good look at what both church's are about. Do you currently support the vision, mission, and focus of your current church? Do you like the direction in where the church is headed? Do you agree with the leadership of the church? What is the .tv church's main focus and can you support the focus and movement of that church? Can you follow the leadership of that church? It's important to take a look at these factors for your health as a leader, as it will impact the ministry you are serving in. 

Also, a .tv church is going to have a different focus then your current church. Again, compare the philosophy of ministries between the two, and decide where you can see your gifts &amp; passion utilized the most. It boils down to doing your research. 

Hope you get clarity and a sense of direction for what's coming up next for you!

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","The first thing I noticed is that you aren't using the floating thumb technique with your right hand.  When you are plucking the E string, your thumb should be on the pickup; when you pick the A string, your thumb should be on the E string; when you pick the G and D strings, your thumb should be on the A string.  Keep in mind if you are switching strings in the middle of a riff, you don't necessarily have to switch your thumb position for each string change, but you really shouldn't be trying to pluck the G string with your thumb still anchored to the pickup.  When you start playing more intricate bass parts (nothing against Rush) it will hold you back quite a bit if you don't have your thumb anchored in the correct place.  This will take some concentrated practice to get down, but after a month or so it will be second nature.

Another thing I would change is the angle of your fingers on your left hand.  If you watch someone like Dan Briggs play http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSD9G_hzmiQ you'll notice that his fingers are parallel with the frets when he plays.  You look like you have massive hands (a blessing I wish I had received); you will get a lot more use out of them with this change because your ring and pinky fingers won't have to stretch so far from that slanted position.  Your thumb on your left hand should also be on the back of the neck, not wrapped around.  If you change that, it will make fretting easier because now you have a constant force on the back of the neck to counter the force on the fretboard when you fret a note.

The last thing is your right hand posture looks a little off.  If you play with your hand flat against the bass and your wrist is touching the top of the bass, you are going to give yourself carpal tunnel before too long.  Again, look at Dan's posture: you could fit a tennis ball between his wrist and the body of the bass.  He plays crazy technical stuff for 90 minutes straight in their concerts and he's only able to do that because of his technique and posture.

I don't want you to get the impression that I'm shitting all over you or anything.  For only having played 7 months, you've made a ton of progress.  I saw you actually use your fretting hand pinky, which is very uncommon for people still early in their guitar/bass learning.  There are a few tough riffs in this song that you play very well considering how long you've been playing.  The thing is, if you want to progress past Rush, again from a purely technical standpoint, one day (don't write this off, I picked up the bass and only ever wanted to play RCHP, but now I only play prog metal) you will need to improve your technique and posture a bit.  But keep up the good work.  =D","1391213792"

Now as to the outcome, it is very difficult to say what will happen. I have no idea on the mechanism of injury, imaging or anything of the sort. The major thing you're concerned about is that the popliteal artery sits right against the distal posterior aspect of the femur (so possible damage?),  as does the common fibular nerve/ posterior tibial nerve. The joint is beyond screwed, with loss of all major ligaments (ACL, PCP, LCL, MCL), who knows about the patella or its ligament, he/she has lost of the origin/insertion of several major muscles (gastroc, adductor magnus, ?distal portion of vastus lateralis/medus).

Yea this is a huge surgery, and it is a very very long recovery with a high chance of post-operative complications. I would be surprised if he/she was able to keep the leg. ","1391213792"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Modern governments don't make guns.  Some private sector company makes guns and sells them to the government.  (Guns == everything a military uses from bullets to tanks to battleships to uniforms).

Before WWII the United States didn't have very many companies that made most of their money selling guns to the military.  After the Civil War and up to WWI the US had a tiny military and it didn't buy a lot of new gear.  After WWI and up to WWII the US military was again a tiny force with a small budget.  

After WWII the policies of the US government changed.  The United States would become a global superpower and sustain a large standing military even in times of peace.  It would purchase new and upgraded guns regularly.  In other words, it would become a steady source of new business in perpetuity.  

Companies that had made money selling guns to the military in WWII kept those businesses open after the end of the war.  Instead of converting back to peacetime industrial output they remained on a wartime production footing.  But this was not a normal market.  The military doesn't ""go shopping"".  They make plans with a lot of lead time, asking for very specific equipment to implement those plans.  There has to be a tight coordination between the military planners and the industrial system that makes the guns they need to implement those plans.

This synergy is the ""military industrial complex"".  The benefit is that the military usually has the guns it wants and needs.  The danger is that the system has an inherent bias towards using those guns to create a demand for more guns.  There is now a large, rich, powerful industrial system that gets larger, richer and more powerful every time the United States goes to war.  That creates an inherent conflict of interest.  Usually nobody wants war - you only fight one for land, for politics, for religion, or for the personal aggrandizement of national leaders.  With a military industrial complex you have a lot of people who want to fight a war *just because*.  

President Eisenhower, who knew a thing or two about the subject of war, warned the US population about this risk in his Farewell Address.  That was the point where the term ""military industrial complex"" entered the vernacular.  (Although Eisenhower called in the ""military industrial Congressional complex"", because he recognized that a corollary risk of the unification of the military and industry was that Congress would steer money to firms in their districts, those firms would owe their continued existence to their members of Congress, would fulfill those obligations by providing funds to help them keep winning elections, etc.)

These factors have arguably transformed American politics in ways large and small, and have transformed the way America projects power around the world in ways that have affected the course of human events in the post-war era.  So it's a pretty big deal.","1391213795"

Roger Goodell is an authoritarian dictator who allowed a player lockout ***and*** an officiator lockout in consecutive years. The refs' lockout directly affected the outcome of countless games and its length was mostly Goodell's fault. Speaking of refs... the NFL picks and chooses which plays are reviewable and the basis of the decision has never been verbalized.

 [**Kessler syndrome**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler%20syndrome): 

---

&gt;The **Kessler syndrome** (also called the **Kessler effect**, **collisional cascading** or **ablation cascade**), proposed by the [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA) scientist [Donald J. Kessler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_J._Kessler) in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in [low Earth orbit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low_Earth_orbit) (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade—each collision generating [space debris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_debris) which increases the likelihood of further collisions. One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render [space exploration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration), and even the use of [satellites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite), unfeasible for many generations.

This ended up being my ‘quick and easy’ meal this week, actually, and it was perfectly suitable, although less exciting than I hoped it would be. The dominant taste for the sauce and rice was definitely coconut, although it certainly smelled like vanilla. The shrimp pretty much just tasted like shrimp cooked in olive oil, which is no bad thing.

I used regular whole milk instead of cream, because the cream I got mysteriously was bad despite being in the fridge and having a sell by date of feb 11.

I started just not going to school again, most schools have programs where kids can take community college classes for credit. My mom worked something out with that school so I could do that instead of going there. I did two semesters, at 16 I started talking to my brother that's 10 years older than me, he invited me to live with him because he thought my mom couldn't control me. I tried to go to High school in Nevada but they wouldn't let me because I was too far behind so my brother made me get my GED.

&gt; To avoid spoiling the movie this plot summary is very brief. It starts when three people living together in a four bedroom flat are looking for a house mate. The interviews they conduct are very unorthodox and very funny. Eventually the three agree on one prospective tenant. He moves in, locks his door, and is not seen again. After a couple of days the three become curious and break in to his room. What follows is an amazing piece of cinema and to say more would ruin it.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","&gt; Jag inser det, 

Vad inser du, att politikerna menat oss i Sverige när dom de senaste 50 åren snackat om ""alla""? Då hade du alltså fel?

&gt; och det är för att vår befolkning har varit extremt homogen fram tills för 20-30 år sedan.

Vad menar du här? Det är ju inget fel med en homogen befolkning. Ingen skulle väl förstå nyttan med att skicka upp afrikaner till enuiterna bara för att? Felet med Sverige är att vi tagit hit en massa onödiga människor de senaste 50 åren.

&gt; Och ja, vi skulle behöva bättre invandringspolitik, men det betyder inte att vi ska kasta ut alla och slänga upp en stor vägg runt hela Sverige, så vill inte jag att Sverige ska se ut. 

Vad menar du är en bättre invandringspolitik då, förklara gärna hur den skulle varit de senaste 50 åren? Du vill ju inte ha en vägg så då antar jag att du vill att det fortsätter som det gör nu och kanske t.o.m. ökar? Det är väl knappast en bra invandringspolitik? Lägg gärna till vad politikerna de senaste 50 åren gått till val på, och vad du tycker dom skulle gått till val på istället.

&gt; Sen vill nog de flesta jobba, det är minst lika skamfullt i andra kulturer att leva på bidrag etc. som det är för oss svenskar, att utnyttja systemet har inte någonsin i människans historia setts med blida ögon. Problemet är ju att de inte får jobb, då kan vi fan inte klaga på dem.

Ja visst vill de flesta av jordens över 7 miljarder människor göra rätt för sig, men det betyder inte att det flesta av jordens människor kan komma hit. Du sa ju själv att att vi borde ha en bättre invandringspolitik.
Exakt, invandrarna får inga jobb för det finns inga, dvs vi har tagit hit för många. Och tycker du inte att vi tagit hit för många får du gärna igen förklara vad du menar med bättre invandringspolitik? Du sa ju själv att svenskar borde ta enklare jobb (förstår inte varför du tog upp det för då blir det ju ännu färre jobb till outbildade invandrare).

Problemet är att vi väljare som älskar välfärd har röstat på partier som lovat oss välfärd, men sen när dom vunnit valen har dom tagit hit för mycket folk och fel folk som påverkar välfärden negativt. Vissa invandrare behövs, men långt ifrån alla. Det är problemet.","1391213800"

But you're right. I won't argue that misunderstandings are impossible and that context will always tell you what to expect. In some cases it definitely is not clear. If to you this means language is devolving, then I'll grant you that.

One thing I'd like to point out to you is that this is nothing new. It emerged first in the 1700s. I don't know if you know this or not, and I also don't know how much it will affect your feelings about this issue, but I just wanted to point this out. There are more than a few people who insist that this generation is ruining the English language, and in this case that is provably wrong.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Actually I have and do, best friend since elementary school, been to gay bars with him(I'm not), alot of my coworkers have been, two of my gaming group members are.  Bunch of social group in highschool were, I was dating someone in drama club.  And yes 2 of those in high school were the typical catty ""I'm gonna tell you how bad you look because I'm god damn fabulous"" but the girls in my social group ate that up so :shrug:, and yes one of them drove me nuts.  

Okay I guess this is the thing to me now that I've calmed down a bit.  The way that those gay men treat women is the same way that alot of other women treat them.  Someone who isn't kissing up to them because they don't have to.  Straight men (including me) pander to women so damn hard all the time, especially conventionally attractive women.  While gay men don't really have a reason to.  And I guess this is a problem?

But I do have to admit to something, it has been my personal that when homosexuals have the gender traits opposite of what sex they are (feminine gay men, masculine lesbians) they seem to take the worst traits of the gender they are emanating and turn it up to 11.  For example that one guy from high school was the cattiest woman i have ever met, while a lesbian I used to go clubbing with used to like to pick physical fights just because and actually broke her fist punching a metal plate because this other girl wouldn't go home with her one time.

"Diablo3Barbarians","t5_2w19t","You're gear is pretty good right now, and with all the attack speed, would work best with a HOTA/Rend/WW hybrid build. You would use Rend/WW on trash mobs, and focus down elites with HOTA.

If you want to optimize for rend, you need to max out average damage, crit chance, and crit damage on all of your rings/amulet. 

Your belt/weapons could go for a couple upgrade options. Either go for a str/crit damage/socket echo fury with IK belt, or str/LS/socket echo fury with witching hour belt. On the high end, both options can be quite expensive and end up with similar amounts of dps.

Rends will proc fear on your current setup w EF as mainhand weapon. If you can find a high dps demolisher (mace) for a main hand weapon, you will significantly reduce the fear proc by moving the EF to your off hand. Mace's have the highest possible weapon range (###-###) which is what your rends proc their damage from.

For skills/passives, change bloodthirst to brawler, and warcry impunity to overpower-killing spree. The 10% crit bonus is significant for making your rends proc more crits.","1391213805"

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","How is it hard to profit from mining? Why on earth do you think that it's impossible to find a Radeon GPU anywhere, even at an inflated price? 

I can buy an R9 270X for $215 – and actually buy one, that's in stock – and mine about 3000 Doge/day. Even at current rates, which I would argue are as low as it'll ever get, that's at least $4.50/day. You can effectively make back your investment and start turning a profit in two months. You also have the GPU, which will likely last for a couple years at least and can be re-sold. If you already have the GPU, it's even more of a no-brainer. I paid under $300 for my GPU a year and a half ago, and I've mined over $400 of dogecoin in the last month and a half.

Also, the magnitude of the planned inflation is tiny compared to the number of coins. In the current code, the number of doge will increase by 5% per year, declining (in percentage terms) as the number of doge increases. Last week, the supply of doge inflated by over 8%. In a *week!* And yet we're still sitting here, because interest in doge is growing way faster than inflation. I believe that doge's just getting started. Honestly, if we ever have less than 5% growth a year, Dogecoin's failed. Litecoin grew 1100% in value last year. We can beat that no problem.","1391213805"

First, one must remember that France definitely turned to a republic only in 1870 (with the 3rd republic): there have been 2 republics, 4 kings and 2 emperors between 1792 and 1870 (if one count only those who ruled for more than a few hours).  
As it was pointed out, the current king of Spain is a member of this house. It can be argued that he should be considered as the head of this house and pretendant to the French throne (after the Spanish succession war, a grandson of Louis XIV, Philippe V, gained the spanish throne: the current king of Spain is his descendant. To gain this throne, Philippe V renounced the french throne in the treaty of Utrecht in 1713, but the crown is not a property of the king, and Charles V may not have had the right to renounce it). This is the legitimist view.  
Now, it is argued that a foreigner prince can not reach the throne, and acknowledge the treaty of Utrecht. After the first empire and Npoleon defeat, two brothers of Louis XVI accessed to the throne. Louis Philippe I then accessed the throne; he was a cousin of Louis XVI, and the Orleans branch is descended from him. The descendants of Charles X and Louis Phillippe lived in Austria and in the UK till the 20th century. A grandson of Charles X (Henri) actually had an opportunity to access the throne in 1870.  
Now it turns hard : Louis-Phillippe father, Louis-Egalité, voted for the death of Louis XVI (he was elected in the convention... and even the hawkish revolutionaries found this vote disgusting); he could be considered as a kingslayer, thus excluding him and his descendants from the throne; the spanish branch is excluded thanks to the treaty of Utrecht;  Henri had no descendants. And the Bourbon-Anjou house should have gained the throne after Henri's death if the Utrecht treaty is valid.

There are many people descended from the last kings of France (a more or less complete list can be found here :http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_living_legitimate_male_Capetians ). And no one agrees on which of them should have the throne should France turn back to a monarchy.  
PS: the descendants of Napoleon III ""wants"" this throne too.....","1391213809"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","There would probably be differences given by atmospheric circulation and mountains on the continent, rain shadow etc but as a general look, and using [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Pangaea_continents.svg) as a reference, I would say roughly 1/2 of both N. &amp; S. America, more than 3/4 of Africa and about 1/4 of both Antarctica and Eurasia would be more or less desert. (Also, I think there would have been *more*, not fewer, mountains, though they would have been older and therefore probably shorter.) 

(From here on is conjecture...)

On a more detailed scale, we can guess (because of the previous supercontinents or Laurasia and Gondwana) that there would be fairly substantial mountain range at their border, which would be roughly where N. &amp; S. America meet, going in a rough line north east, to the north of Africa. This mountain range would have straddled the whole continent, very slightly north of the equator. Therefore, the eastern region to the south of the mountains would have been wet, probably very wet. The whole eastern portion would probably have had a monsoonal climate, and if the equator ever reached to the north of the eastern end of the mountains, there would have been some really interesting effects - probably a fairly short drought to the south, and a flooded desert to the north. The northern face of the eastern mountains would be very hot, dry and very windy all year round apart from the possible rainy season in July. The north western end of the mountains would probably be the least hospitable place on the planet, very close to the equator but at the same time starved of all moisture throughout the year - it would be like a mixture of the skeleton coast and death valley, only hotter and with less rain...On the southern side of the mountains there might have been a little more moisture, but not very much more.

The entire tropical east coast, for several hundred miles I would guess, would be fertile all year round - apart from the area north of the mountains. At the more temperate latitudes it would get much drier, with warm sandy winds from the deserts to the west, and far less rain than the tropical areas. 

In the tropics to the west there would have been a desert, maybe right up to the sea like the skeleton coast now, maybe ending a few miles short. This would continue all the way through the tropics, and then there would be fertile plains, probably like the west coast of the US, which would reach a long, long way north, maybe even all the way to the northern and southern extremities of the continent - although the trees would have changed from deciduous to conifers. It would probably have snowed an awful lot in the extremities in the winter, with limitless ocean and persistent winds driving the snow onto land. Pre-existing mountains on the border of Antarctica and Australia means that there would have been a fairly abrupt end to the snow, which would have fallen on taiga forest and would have been very deep indeed. North of these mountains would have been a desert, probably akin to Mongolia or Tibet in temperature and probably drier too. 

The ocean currents would have had a huge affect, the east coast would have been much wetter than the west, all the way to the poles, so the temperate deserts would have been much less severe. Conversely, on the west coast, the currents would probably have brought cooler water from the poles, so the west coast would have been drier and cooler overall. There would probably have been a 'C' shaped desert straddling the equator, with the eastern edges ending prematurely and the western edges extended.  ","1391213811"

Since it is a royal pain in the ass i asked my PI why there wasnt a program to do this and he said no software or program has been really made or is close to being made that can match the acuity of the human eye when it comes to checking coregistration and mind you this step is super simple. you literally just see if ventricles and other structures are aligned properly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yesterday I had nothing to share here, but after my ordeal today, I do.

We had a crate delivered that was sitting behind the building. I'm receiving, so I had to hop on the forklift and go get it. Simple enough. I get on the forklift and head out the door on the left side of our building. Since there's a fence between there and the back, I have to drive all the way around the building to get the crate, which is a bit inconvenient (especially when it's only 10 degrees out), but hey I'll manage. I get down the left side, across the front, and half way up the right side of the building and...the forklift dies. Out of propane. I have to trudge around the back of the building from there, toss the empty tank in the cage and lug a new tank back to the lift (is it worthy to mention I'm a 5'2"" woman and those things weight a freaking ton?). I finally get going, grab the crate and take it back to receiving. On my trek back to the side door I get stuck in the snow. It takes about 20 minutes, lots of kitty litter, and 2 guys pushing me to finally get me unstuck.

So a 10 minute task turns into an hour long conundrum in 10 degree winter weather. I remember at one point mumbling to myself ""I don't get paid enough for this crap.""","1391213813"

As an IT person, a firearms enthusiast, and an amateur mechanic, I tend to be a very much function-over-form sort of person.  I have no brand loyalty simply because of a name, and value $ per performance over all.  This is the lens through which I view a lot of my purchases, of course including audiophile equipment (emotiva, baby!)

I'm also not a total robot though. I do appreciate art, and when something really ""speaks"" to me, I have no problem dropping the coin to put it in my home.  Thinking of these pieces of equipment as art honestly just never occurred to me.

"mormon","t5_2qky2","&gt;Well Satan (Lucifer as he was known before)

No, you misunderstand. Before 300 BCE, *no one thought of Satan as he is thought of now*. Satan is a after 300 BCE invention. Further, Lucifer in Isaiah 14:12 refers to a king of Babylon, *not* Satan. How could it, since Satan hadn't been invented yet?

&gt;Jesus Christ was a great leader as well. People just didn't realize it.

No, he wasn't. He wasn't mentioned by *any* historian during his lifetime. He made no splash. He kept the company of harlots and thieves. The Roman government crucified him. Crucifixion was a method of execution almost solely used on people who were slaves, pirates, or enemies of the state. This was *not* the leader that the Jews were waiting for. If you believe Christ set up a church, then he couldn't even keep it around for more than one or two hundred years. Christ was a bad leader.

&gt;Mary was a young woman.

Yes, as are most people who give birth. But not a virgin! The claim of a virgin birth is simply because they had a mistranslated text. If you give up the virginity part, then you lose part of the power of the claim that God slept with Mary.

&gt;Well Jesus also happened to be the Savior.

Again, you are seeing history through your own modern mythology. *Christ never said he was the savior.*

&gt;What???

What part do you have trouble with? Jesus thought that the history of the world would come to a screeching halt, that God would intervene in the affairs of this planet, overthrow the forces of evil in a cosmic act of judgment, and establish God's utopian Kingdom here on Earth. And this was to happen within Jesus' own generation.

I highly recommend you read *Jesus, Interrupted* by Bart Erhman. You have been misled about the veracity of much of the NT, the Gospels in particular.","1391213817"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Worked as the secretary in an A/V Rental company.  Very complicated business.  We put together massive multimedia presentations, bid proper equipment for big convention shows - lots of technical know-how involved.  I was, I think, about 22 at the time and recovering from buying a small business and running it into the ground.  Kind of wanted a 'low pressure' job.

The company was small, only me, the Boss (who did a little of everything), our Computer Guy (who did all the Macromedia Shockwave presentations), our Rental Manager (who had the tech know-how to spec the shows), our accountant, and three warehouse employees.

Although I was basically the secretary and making $8/hour, I would also fill in for for the Computer Guy and the Rental Manager when they weren't available (but I really wasn't capable of doing their jobs.)

The Boss, who was actually insane, hired one of those micromanagement companies to come in, evaluate what everyone does, and tell my boss how she could do things better (think Office Space.)

After learning that, at $8/hour I would fill in for the two other positions that were getting $35 an hour, they told my boss she should fire the other two employees and have me do their jobs until she found cheaper replacements.  My hourly went up to $12 an hour.

I did this for two months.  I'm not sure if you can imagine the pressure of a 22-23 year old guy who didn't really know what he's doing suddenly being put in charge of shows that run 100-150K a show.  I never in my entire life got literally SCREAMED at by clients more than in the two months that I did this.  I was working 80-130 hour weeks.  I was on-call 24/7 and had to personally take care of my screw-ups, which were many because I had very little training.  The penny finally dropped when, on the day of my friend's wedding I found out that my boss wasn't even looking to replace me with more competant people.  I was so worked up about this, and so full of anxiety that when my cell phone rang in the middle of the reception, I ran into the bathroom and puked my guts out before I answered it (it was my mom.)  And I hadn't even had a single drink.

It shouldn't matter whether you're black, white, asian, hispanic, etc. What should matter is socio economic background.

Affirmative action is one of those cases where I think it furthers racism, in that it gives special priviliges and not equal priviliges, creating ressentment among the people not having that advantage.

Of course minorities have it much harder in terms of the systematic racism in certain sectors of society. I just wish we had legislation  adressing both issues of racism and poverty when it comes to the educational system.","1391213824"

If you want to get going in a hurry I've heard the learning curve on an SXR is pretty easy but I don't think you could find one in your price range. Also I'm pretty sure you mean a 650 superjet, as they only came from the factory with a 650 or 701.

My recommendation would be to buy the best superjet you can afford but I'm also a little biased towards SJ's, I love mine! Try to find one with some aftermarket parts on it already since its much cheaper to buy them on a ski than new or used(in some cases). Ideally you'd save up enough cash to buy a round nose(96+) or a 701 square nose (94-95) but that's not always feasible and there is nothing wrong with a 650 square nose. My buddy just put a 701 in his SN and I almost like it as much as my RN!

I can bias the front or rear wheels via my DCCD on the fly. I can even manually lock my center differential. Neither of which can be done in the EVO. The ADC works essentially like a FWD vehicle until certain parameters are met, then the center differential locks and splits the torque 50:50 at best. Whereas the Subaru can send 10 - 15% more to the rear wheels. 

The Subaru also has an electromagnet control center differential which allows for greater control over the Evo's, and they feature locking differentials in the front and rear (helicals mostly).

The gearbox is mounted midships and aft of the engine, which gives superior weight distribution. Frankly, the Subaru system is hard to beat. The car was built from the ground up to be AWD, whereas the Lancer begins it's life as FWD and get's an AWD adder.","1391213826"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","This is a great question, because it is very hard to answer. In fact, there **is** no simple way to test for randomness, or even for non-randomness.  We can identify strings of numbers that *appear* to be random or non-random, but can never say for *certain*.   
  
For example, let's consider some rolls of a  6-sided die. 
  
If we roll 1,2,5,6,5,4 then do some tests of randomness, we'd conclude that it was probably random. But to be fair, it is too short of a sequence to say anything very meaningful about randomness.    
  
But what if we continued to roll and saw 1,2,5,6,5,4,1,2,5,6,5,4,1,2,5,6,5,4,1,2,5,6,5,4?  It's the same sequence repeated four times, and there still aren't even any 3's in it!  So, probably not random.  But the fact is, even a good source of random data *could* contain such a sequence, just by chance.  It just isn't very *probable* to get that result as our first 24 rolls.   If we had to gamble, we'd put our money on ""non-random"". But it would still be gambling.   
   
Likewise, we could see some sequences that ""look"" quite random, and pass some mathematical tests of randomness. But there could be attributes or patterns that show up with careful analysis that show that there's actually a subtle pattern, or a weird distribution, that might tell us that the source probably is not truly random. (Cryptographers love to do this sort of thing, and then exploit the non-randomness.) But again, we wouldn't be certain, we'd just know how we'd bet our money.  And we can see sequences that look non-random, but when more data is collected, we see that they likely just occurred by chance. 
  
There are lots of things about random data that aren't intuitive and screw people up.  When someone asks me to randomly pick a number between 1-100, for example, I like to pick 1.  A lot of people will then complain that I didn't pick a random number.  Of course, 1 is just as random a pick as any other number, since by definition all of the numbers are equally probable. 
  
But, if they really complain, I'll pick again.  Usually 1.  It *could* happen that a random choice of numbers in the range [1-100] would get 1 both times.  And you can't prove otherwise.    ","1391213826"

Note that as the Western World becomes more open about sex our sexual variety has grown, and our birthrate has decreased. Obviously contraception has a lot to do with that, but not everything. Seems like a valid question to me. Heck, an interesting question. Surely we could look at cultures with a varied sexual climate--including ancient greece, the middle east, and indiginous cultures, all of whom have sex that allows them to avoid sex with fertile women as a release.

I too have childhood dreams about being animals and sharing their abilities and world; except every animal, in combinations. I've spent so much time studying and listing out all sorts of animal abilities; from sonar  to speed to various senses, etc. I've dreamed of things that could only be iwith science fiction level bio-engineering. But the idea of using technology to capture a little bit of that transformation, I've never really thought of before. Imagine if there was a museum with all sorts of technology for replicating animal abilities, like an interactive science museum dedicated to the experience of experiencing the world the way different animals would; special cetacean suits; infa red goggles to replicate the senses of pit vipers, etc. I wonder how far technology could go in that direction?","1391213832"

Anyone who demands that his ego be stroked doesn't deserve praise of any sort.  It makes God a hypocrite when he says that he who exalts himself will be humbled.

And even if you dismiss that, there's one thing you can't dismiss: The Bible clearly teaches against any concept of free will.  (Note: Humans saying we have it is unreliable as they didn't make reality; God giving commands is no more the same as an affirmation of free will as giving orders to a G.I. Joe action figure.)  Despite the fact that we have no control over our actions, the Biblical God claims to have a justice system in place, whereby people who perform actions that go against HIS moral code are punished for all eternity, regardless of the sin in question.

What's more, nobody gets a say in how this system works.  Meaning he's lording it over us without our consent.  Even if we said we consented, it's not really our choice, is it?

God is throwing G.I. Joes in the microwave.  And what makes it cruel is we can feel the pain, but will never be extinguished.

Just think about that.  Even if miracles are real, the God behind them is worthless.","1391213835"

There should be a Medicaid consumer hotline for each state (an 800 #) that can help you figure out the rules. Good luck!","1391213835"

I know this because I worked for a company like this at first (not that low of a pay though). I actually still work for them, but because they were small and couldn't replace me, I was able to twist their arm, start working from home, and make about $50/hr.

I believe the same can be said of Washington, D.C. Paris built the Tour Montparnasse in the late 60s and early 70s and people hated it. It's been deemed a ugly monolith staining the cityscape. Some people joke that Tour Montparnasse has the best view of Paris because it's the only one where you can't see it. I believe two years after its construction, people were so upset about it that a new ban on skyscrapers more than 7 stories high in the city centre was instituted. Thus led to the growth of the business district just outside of Paris, La Defense, which also started during the construction of Tour Montparnasse but really boomed after that ban.","1391213841"

In short for a semester the bathrooms on the entire campus only received 1 refill a week. Given the size of the rolls (large) and the campus (large) this meant that on average about 50% of the week most of the bathrooms wouldn't have any TP.

It was pretty shitty.","1391213842"

Job #1 is a big fat no. You could do this job now with no work experience. You will not learn anything configuring IP addresses on IP camera web GUI and yanking cables through asbestos buildings. 

Job #2 offers you a new skill set they will have to train you on and diversify your skillsets between route/switch, voice and customer service. Option 1 is a dead end and won't help you get that next job. 

Even if job #2 pays significantly less you should take it. In the long run it will improve your earning potential more than #1. Option 1 is a dead end job that you will eventually leave with no new marketable skills than you already have setting your career back however long you work there.

**Legend of the Galactic Heroes (29/110 - 1st watch):** WHAT. THE. FUCK.

I wasn't ready for Episode 26.  I knew it had to happen *at some point*, but I didn't expect it to be this soon.  My heart was in my throat throughout the episode, and I honestly felt deeply *hurt*, which was surprising, considering I'm not even a third of the way through the OVA, let alone the franchise.

Quite frankly, I'm at a bit of a loss to explain why I felt so emotionally riled by the events of the finale of the ""first season.""  I didn't think I was all that attached to the characters, but somehow they got under my skin.  I cannot pinpoint the moment my attachment to them started.  I wonder if it's because I knew something like this had to happen that I was so blindsided by the moment when it came.  I ended Episode 25 with a ""nonononononono,"" and Episode 26 just pulled my heart along the whole time.

And it was fucking *awesome*.

I guess I'm just an emotional masochist, but I love stories that make me feel upset, hurt, betrayed, angry, sad, or miserable because I think they represent moments of great storytelling.  When you react viscerally to something that's animated, that isn't ""real"" (especially an anime with somewhat dated animations), I think that's a sign that the story is doing something right.  Not all of LOGH's storytelling is great (I'm looking at you, stupid space battles), but some moments of it are phenomenal and Episode 25 - 26 really demonstrate that.  I dread the inevitable [LOGH predictions](/s ""death of Yang,"") because if I reacted this strongly to a character in just 26 episodes, how will I react to one who is a main character?  Only time and patience will tell.

Oh, and speaking of stupid space battles - I was wondering (around episode 21, I think) how battles this big and this *slow* could happen, when out of the blue, [EVE dropped its biggest virtual battle yet](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1wb8lf/largest_super_capital_fight_in_eve_online_history/), so thanks, EVE, for providing an interesting and relevant answer to some of my questions.

Lastly, I want to bring up a point that keeps coming to mind as I watch the show.  I've seen it said most often pertaining to the presidency for the U.S., but you could easily extend it to most other political systems.  It is the idea that ""those who want power are the least suited to have it, and those who don't want it are the best.""  Yang is a perfect example of the latter - he wants nothing more than to retire and spend the rest of his life reading about history, yet he is a great and surprisingly charismatic leader, one who arguably ""deserves"" to be in power if only because he despises it so.  On the flip side, Truniht is the obvious example of the former - he wants power though he appears to be the most blatant example of a person who absolutely shouldn't have it.  In fact, I'm a little nervous that he's going to remain the one-dimension archetypal ""bad politician"" for the rest of the story, simply to propel Yang and other ""good characters"" to action.  However, Reinhard might be the best example of the former, though the show is trying desperately to get the audience ""on his side"" (or at least feel neutral about him).  It's actually pretty subtle how they balance his drive for power with aspects that most Western and post-WWII Japanese would see as virtuous ([LOGH spoilers](/s ""he breaks up the noble hierarchy, doles out land and gold to the commoners, hires only those worthy of their positions, etc""), and that they constantly drum him up as a ""good"" force for change (while interestingly, characters like [LOGH spoilers](/s ""Greenhill"") are presented as misguided and tragic).  Again, I think it will be interesting to watch Reinhard's transformation (especially now that his voice of moral guidance is gone - how convenient).

Anyways, time to change gears entirely.

[Your 'x amount of time' reminder that this exists.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0R9k0yl8Atk)

That's right - I'm on **Lucky Star (7/24)** for god knows upteenth time.  I watch this show once every year or two for my annual dose of ultra-slice-of-life.  It's fascinating how I've moved on the scale of Kagami to Konata since I've first watched this show.  I was almost entirely Kagami in the beginning, and now I'm almost entirely Konata.  The pressures of high school and college coupled with anime and video games being a main form of entertainment will do that to a person, I guess.  However, I think I've also relaxed a lot in terms of expressing myself.  The ""tsundere"" is uptight about being perceived a particular way but simultaneously will indulge in moments of passion and excitement, whereas the Konata type (does she have an archetype?) is pretty mellow about expressing themselves at a more consistent rate.

Also, Tsukasa might be the best comedic ""genius"" of the show.  The balsamic vinegar and seashell jokes are consistently my favorite.

I also started **NANA (4/50 - 1st watch)** and am surprisingly captivated by the characters.  Romantic dramedies are not usually ""my thing,"" but after that thread this week on mature romances, I decided to give it a shot.  Nana K. is the type of female character that usually annoys me, but for some reason I find myself sympathizing with her.  I agree with pretty much everything that everyone around her says, yet I find her the more emotionally attractive character and I'm not quite sure why.  Maybe it's because I think that while she does everything ""wrong,"" her intentions are still good.  It feels like everyone around her has common sense, but lacks a sympathetic heart.

Also, Romi Paku keeps popping up in the oddest places (NANA, Kill la Kill, FMA, SNK).  It's like every time I think I can relax, her voice shows up out of nowhere.","1391213846"

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","Bas Rutten gets most of his striking from Muay Thai.  He fell in love with the liver shot because a guy at his thai boxing gym hit him with one.  That being said I suppose you can credit some of his kicking skills to karate and TKD.

GSP did McDojo Karate for a few years (He got second dan at the age of twelve) and then did MMA. 

Ryo Chonan is a japanese ultra nationalist who isn't even known for his striking.   Of course he's going to credit Karate rather than the kickboxing training he received at his MMA gym. 

Chuck Liddel is the main guy I'm referring to here.  His style is clearly more sprawl and boxing oriented.     The Pit is most certainly not a karate gym, it was an MMA gym.  If you watch Liddell fight it is very clear that he is not a karate guy. 

Keith Hackney was one of the early guys who tried to actually use Karate in the cage.  He got his ass kicked and had a 2-2 record, with his only wins coming against a fat guy and an even fatter guy. 

Guy Mezger did use Karate to help his kicks, but he was definitely more of a kick boxer/wrestler.  I suppose you can credit some of his success to karate.

"dogecoin","t5_2zcp2","so i have been thinking all day. it seems like the core issue at hand is. 

Do we want DOGE to be an asset, or, do we want DOGE to be a currency. i feel that once we can come to a consensus as a community on what we want DOGE to be, then we will be able to comeup with a viable solution. 

i have read almost all of the comments, and i see great arguments and points for both sides. but that is the problem i feel. we can either be a deflationary asset or we can try to evolve into the worlds first ever inflationary digital currency. 

we need to be honest with ourselves. there is a good amount of people here hoping that DOGE will follow the steps of BTC and make huge gains and bring riches to them. but there is also alot of people out there that want, and deserve, a de-centralized, low tx fee, high tx speed currency for the internet. 

at the moment. just about every crypto is in inflation mode. thanks to the user that pointed out that until the coins are 100% mined deflation does not and will not exist. so since all mineable currencies are still being mined, we are living in an inflation crypto world. 

now once these coins can no longer be mined, they enter into deflation mode. I really beleive in my heart of hearts that this will kill our beloved DOGEcoin. and here is why i think we need to have a mathematically defined system of inflation baked into DOGE. 

in less then a years time, ALL DOGE WILL BE MINED. if a hard cap was put in place, where does that put everyone who heard of DOGE the night before the last coin was mined? it leaves them with 2 options. A. work/trade/buy DOGEcoins or look for another crypto that they can mine and get coins with. 

in order for a currency to work, it needs to be spent. if every DOGEcoin did nothing but gain value overtime, endlessly. why would you spend your coin now when you can just use cash or your CC and save your DOGE and continue to make money. thats not a currency folks thats an investment. 

if you want a currency we need inflation, if we want an investment we need deflation. the question that we have to answer as a community is what do we want to become. ","1391213849"

*Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about* [***Missing white woman syndrome***](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing%20white%20woman%20syndrome) : 

---

&gt;**Missing white woman syndrome** is a phrase coined by social scientists to describe the extensive media coverage, especially in television, of missing person cases that involve young, white, upper-middle class women or girls. Sociologists define the phenomenon as an undue focus on young, white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of media coverage they receive being compared to cases concerning missing women of other ethnicities, socioeconomic classes, or with missing males. The PBS news anchor Gwen Ifill is said to be the originator of the phrase.

And you're wrong on having an absolute dependency on the invisibility of the approach through the rear end of the aircraft. Generally speaking the tactics described in the book assume (near) perfect SA, which would forego most of the cases that deal with loss of visibility. Instead the tactics described rely on proper positioning regardless of visibility and depend much more on aircraft abilities to get into a killing position.","1391213855"

Stimulants are unlikely to give you a ""pump"" as much as nitric boosters, though; straight potassium nitrate (include ascorbic acid for reducing agent effects) or pre-dosed nitrate products are an obvious one, citrulline or other urea-cycle aminos are another good one, agmatine is less substantiated but anecdotally supported.","1391213855"

Riot Games makes money off of bans because a player's days spent banned equate to missed IP from FWotD's and other games, and permanently banned accounts means content must be re-purchased, which potentially translates to ""more of your monies"".

Integrated graphics, but it's a laptop, backlit keyboard, and a 750gb hard drive.), it's got a pretty good warranty, if I recall. I've never had to use it.

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","**photos**

I see what the previous critiques have said and I agree, but I have one problem.. the current primary photo looks significantly older than the photo with the caption that says it is the most recent.  Then the second one which sort of looks like it's between the first and the current in age has a caption saying it is a year old.

I'm going to suggest leaving things as they are now and taking some new pictures to find a new primary photo that looks like you do now.  

I'm assuming that the picture in the big hat and sunglasses is an attempt to show what you mean by selecting curvy under body type, but I don't think it's doing you any favors.   The top you're wearing does not have any structure, it does not gather in under your bust and flow away and the picture cuts off before your hips are fully shown so it looks like you're fairly rectangular/boxy shaped.  (Yes, I *have* watched way too many episodes of what not to wear.. Clinton Kelly is funny and Stacy London is *hot* so it's been worth it)

*checks the clock, opens a Guinness*

The professional photographer friend did awesome, you should do that again.

**Self-Summary**

Lots of what I do (professionally and personally) but not a lot of Who I am.   

Self does not feel summarized.. try again?

**What I am doing with my life**

Move your career down here, and keep the rest you have here.. makes the section a little lengthy but it all really fits this category and shows a number of different dimensions of what you're doing personally and professionally.

**Really good at**

They are both cliche.. so you need to add (or better, start off with) something that's more uniquely you..  you also collect vinyl .. are you any good at finding that one obscure foreign import album in a bin at your local record store?  (even if you aren't.. that'd be a good spin on having someplace else to mention you collect vinyl)

**first thing** 

*a tattoo I have visible that says 11:11AM* There's no ink visible in any of your photos, so you might want to mention where this is, and just because I'm curious, is it a digital 11:11am, or an analog clock?

And have the hair compliments increased with the latest hair color or have you always gotten them?

(i.e. this section is a little brief and could use some fluff)

**Favorites**

I am repeating this in almost every critique I do.. FOOD it should be here, having cuisines, dishes and even favorite local restaurants give the prospective date a chance to envision themselves sharing a meal with you.. do not pass over this opportunity.  It is a great hook.

Otherwise I like your keeping it short by keeping it current.. fill in something after community or get rid of the trailing comma.

**six things** 

As pointed out by /u/Duces_Tecum, **My Details** *Drugs
    Never*, so the Herb mentioned in this list implies you're a huge fan of WKRP in Cincinnati on Hulu?

Otherwise.. good list.

**thinking about**

nada -- no real worries

*Friday night*

nada -- this one I have more of an issue with.. it's another place where you can put something a potential date an see themselves with you.. what social activities do you enjoy, even if you're not doing them every Friday?

**private things**

nada -- no worries.

**Details**

age 25 to 35, you're exclusively interested in a guy that's at least a year older than you are?

**Message me**

nada.. empty is fine, but if you start to see any trend in those who do write  that you wish would not, or a trend in those who do not write but show up in your visitors list, add something here to discourage those you would like to see less messages from and encourage those you don't see enough messages from.

It was probably a legal issue... I'm surprised that they even let you do a simulated Mt. Doom at all because [the Tolkien estate is VERY litigious](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20110419/01104713954/tolkien-estate-strikes-again-forces-summer-camp-to-change-name.shtml). At least the judges got to see the Gollum part, right?

FTA:

&gt;Christopher Tolkien and the estate of JRR Tolkien has a long history of overly aggressive attempts to stop anyone from using any sort of Tolkien-related content. The latest target: evil summer camps. Apparently the Tolkien estate has forced a Calgary summer camp to change its name, because it was called Rivendell, after the elven outpost in *The Lord of the Rings*. The camp received a cease-and-desist:
&gt;
&gt;*""While our clients do not believe that you intended to infringe their intellectual property rights, you will understand that they have an obligation to protect these valuable rights and carefully to preserve the integrity of the Tolkien works.""
Unfortunately, the article does not show the full letter, nor does it explain if the letter highlighted exactly which intellectual property rights the estate is complaining about. Does the estate have a trademark on ""rivendell"" in Canada? Does the estate use the term in commerce anywhere in order to get a trademark? Does that trademark cover summer camps? All of that seems doubtful.*
&gt;
&gt;Either way, the camp just backed down and changed its name, noting that the whole LotR thing was getting pretty tired, anyway. Nicely done, Christopher, you've just made sure that a whole bunch of kids will no longer have a positive summer camping experience associated with the name Rivendell...","1391213863"

&gt;How is it that any other time Isaiah talks about 'the servant of God' it's clearly not Mohammad, peace be upon him, but suddenly in one chapter he switches the focus, using same details from his previous chapters? Have you even read The Old Testament?

That's the way Isaiah works.  Sometimes, the servant of God is a prophet, sometimes used collectively of the nation of Israel as a whole, sometimes of the Messiah.  Context makes it clear.  There is typically some historical or prophetic figure in mind, but also there is the idea that these are the archetypal characteristics of any person or group called by God.

&gt;Have you even read The Old Testament?

Yes, many times.  Some of it directly in Hebrew, though portions of it require more knowledge of the language than I have.  Small portions of it are written in Aramaic.

&gt;The original Torah has been lost, all evidence supports it.

Sure, if you want to ignore what the Qur'an says, and you want to ignore all the manuscript evidence we have.

I had a somewhat similar (though not retail related) experience once. I was bicycling on my commute to work and took a left turn on the fast side. A bump destabilized the bike, and I could tell I was going down. I could either lay the bicycle down and slide along the asphalt... right behind the garbage truck... which was dripping... or head toward the nice patch of green grass, let the curb throw me into the grass and have a relatively soft landing. I'd chosen the grass in bicycle crashes in the past and it had always worked well. Not even a bruise on me.

So I head toward the grass and wait for the bike to be yanked out from under me. Instead, suddenly, I'm stopped. Slumped on the ground, my bike next to me. There's a gash in my forehead so bad the blood has covered my right eye - I can't see out of it. I blink a few times and my left eye feeds some information to my brain. There was a black wrought iron fence between me and the grass. I slammed, face first, into an iron bar in this fence at around 15mph. Attacked by a fence from NO WHERE!

I end up with nine stitches, but am fine. No concussion or anything, though I do have some scarring and a touch of nerve damage in my forehead. Nothing bothersome, it just feels a bit different. My coworkers still make fun of me for the day I got beat up by a fence.","1391213868"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","&gt;I can't do that with a mirror-less yet and I can't imagine that changing anytime soon.

The Sony A99, which is an SLT with EVF, having only the focus still using the mirror:

Startup delay and shutter lag together are already less than a second (700ms/127ms).  It is a grand total of 200ms slower at startup than a 5Diii (500ms/120ms).  On sensor phase detect has gone from none at all, to the T4i's 4 pixels to the 70D's full sensor system, and the NEX6 and A7's fast multi point systems in less than two years.  Your imagination seems very limited.

Now, want to crush the 5Diii?  NEX 6 startup delay: 200ms startup, 257s shutter lag.  That is faster than the 5Diii powers on.

All of these startup and power on specs are just engineering decisions and market points, you can build any one to be competitive, but no one has build a professional body yet.  The only thing left to catch up is the autofocus, and battery life, which, honestly ,probably never will (battery life being significantly harder on mirrorless, as the sensor has to run more, any better battery you make for mirrorless can just be put in an SLR for longer life).

I went to school the next day wearing a hat (like I always did back then) but there was no way I was to last until the spot grew back without anyone noticing.  I told my best friend what had happened (we were also both on the track team), and I told him I was going to just shave it all down.

Reese, Finch, and Shaw are talking at the waterfront where Finch's friend Nathan died. Reese asks Finch what he wants to do, and Finch says something about not playing God anymore, and he departs, leaving Reese with Shaw standing alone before they walk off together.

Then we see a person walking around in their house/apartment, but we don't see their face. Their landline phone rings, and they answer it. We can't hear what they hear, but we see they are scared. They drop the phone down, slowly pick up some things as if nothing is wrong, then with a sudden rush, they jump out the fire escape and run to safety and barely escape as the place explodes.

We also see that several other people are getting phone calls too, and they all get really scared and start running like the devil himself was chasing them.

Finally, sometime later, we see Harold eating lunch with Grace at a small breakfast diner, and the waiter hands him a phone, and he answers it. It's Root's voice, but she sounds robot like. She says, ""Hello, Harold.""","1391213873"

My father was a South Vietnamese Lt. in this god-forbidden war where he shed sweat and blood alongside American counterparts at the end of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, yet like many other soldiers who fought for the promise of freedom, democracy, and representation, he was left behind in grueling conditions at the mercy of the ""reeducation camp"".

It's hard to imagine trying to distinguish an enemy from your own country, but it's even harder to place a bullet in someone who speaks the same language, eats the same food, and shares in the same traditions. The chaos that occurred in the war pains him to this day still. Physically because of him shielding his fellow men from a grenade blast, but also emotional to a loss of a country.

Although I'm proud to be considered an Asian-American and understand the tough decision to end the conscription and withdraw from the war, there's still a large sense of anguish within the Vietnamese-American community regarding the identity of a home forgotten. ","1391213873"

But there are many uses for hemp, such as the exterior of a car, so it may be cheaper to produce in that respect.  My point is that you have to first look at the consumer side (demands and benefits) and if it is superior then go through the farming aspects (good questions you bring up).","1391213875"

Then it seems like dogs who have been selected to be more attuned to humans and more domesticated would have the edge in communicating with us.

My poodle is smart but stays fairly close to me and often looks to me for help or instructions, something that is typical for his breed and many others (such as herding dogs, even more so than poodles). Huskies are well known for being very independent, and someone elsewhere in this thread mentions a study that found that wolves stopped being responsive to humans at around 6 months old. Which one is more socially intelligent, and which one would people consider to have more personality?

There's also that if, say, a new beer hits the market, it can't be released by others, so a new company pops up (a new microbrewer) for people with *just* that taste.  No other company can produce anything similar for a couple years, and they cannot really be bought out because the guy likes being small-batch.  

I work with a lot of people in the medical industry, mostly in the psych and optic fields.  There's very little overlap.  If you look into the legality and monetization of medication, especially in the US, it's not really similar to the other forms...","1391213878"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It has been pretty much confirmed that people who see events do not remember them exactly as they happened. Especially in high stress situations. Your brain will always try to fill in missing information wherever possible. And it's not always right. So if you see someone commit a crime but did not see their face, it is very easy for your brain to replace the real perpetrator's face with someone else. And you will think with 100% certainty that it was them, but you are wrong.

That is why eyewitness accounts are almost never seen as credible evidence in court. No matter how sure someone is that they saw something, there is a very good chance that they are wrong even if they don't know it.

- Passive aggressive hamster. Didn't actually fuck the guy. But she stayed there to the last minute and acted silly and drunk hoping eventually the guy would take her. She was the ""last one to leave"" until leaving got ridiculous and she just went to sleep on the couch. He probably figured out she wasn't going to leave, so he gave her a blanket and a glass of water, which she kept thinking was him hitting on her.

Option 2 

- She did fuck the guy immediately and wanted to sell herself to the alpha full blown so she made a show of completely and immediately dumping her bf to stroke the guys ego and let him know he could ""have her"" because of his superiority to her bf. By morning, he turned on her and it was clear she was just a one nighter by his behavior, so she is going to pretend nothing happened to salvage the bf for now.

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","&gt; has a low libido, possibly due to the medication he is on,

Is he taking medications for depression? 

A combination of drugs that affect serotonin, and having depression, is a one-two punch. 

However sometimes when people are depressed they still have a healthy libido (and why not...... sex and intimacy definitely helps with that.)

*When people are depressed it's common for them to have a subconscious desire to isolate themselves and push friends and loved ones away.*

So yes, when your husband is critical of you and critical of your appearance, I'm tempted to say it's motivated by partly by a warped desire to actually undermine intimacy and sabotage the relationship.

I also get a sense that he's kind of ""thrown in the towel"" when it comes to sex. He probably thinks to himself why should he bother at all. ""I can't satisfy her no matter what, so why put in effort?""

At 39 his testosterone level may be dropping. That's something to talk to his doctor about. 

Reduced T. levels can aggravate depression and anxiety issues. Getting a testosterone or TSH supplement may help with whatever mental issues he's having.
