The main point the author focuses on is the superficial differences between painting and programming (one of them is manipulating electronic bits and the other is putting oil on a canvas with a stick and animal hair).  From that he concludes the two things are totally and utterly different from each other.

Clearly this guy is not a real programmer, or probably even a good programmer for that matter.  I am sure that many, or even most programmers are not artists, but that isn't who Paul Graham writes about.  He writes about the great programmers, the ones who write code that reads like poetry, or unfolds like great art.  There are also plenty of programmers who can make you cry just by looking at their code, but that's a different kind of programmer entirely.

Personally I thought this article was stupid and filled with the kind of nonsence that he accused Paul Graham of perpetrating.

Either the stories are made up or they are real. An explanation like ""cannabis"" really doesn't cut it. As a matter of fact, the only reference of annointing oils in the New Testament was when a prostitute put them on Christ's feet. Many of the instances of healing in the NT were spontaneous and mention nothing about any oils.

For example, a woman who has a menstrual problem touches Christ and is healed. Christ turns around and asks who touched him because ""I felt power go out from me"". There is no mention that Christ turned around and put oils on the woman. She was the one who touched him.

 Painting is merely a handy analogy. The fact that Graham is interested in painting(not entirely untalented as well), and knows something of its history (maybe not everything) certainly gives him enough authority to say 'hey, these things are not so different.' I have no problem believing that there is overlap between Paul Graham's painting-mode and Paul Graham's hacking-mode, and am glad for the insights he offers regarding the creative process in general.

It can be a bit annoying when people from the 'hard' sciences start talking about the Art of their practice. In my experience, this usually results from a confusion between beauty/elegance and Art at large. The last 150 years have served as a pretty strong argument that beauty != Art, and its no wonder that some people would find it difficult to consider merge-sort (or even viaweb) in the same light as Guernica.

I think this is a much more matching analogy.
Being programming a creative activity of course
some analogy exists with painters too, but there is a deep difference
as architects have to be creative under a lot of constraints, from the
gravity force to space. This is also true for programmers, but I think it's
not the same for painters unless they choose to paint in a very specific way.

Sometimes it's said that the real creative moment of an architect is
not while he is designing something, but when he builds his own
""architectural system"". To design something is then the application
of such a system: still a creative activity, but not the most important
part. It seems like that it's true for programming too. You are
creative when you try to solve a given specific problem with the
tools you have, but your best effort is when you try to build
these tools in a generic way in your head, when you find new systems
to describe problems. As this appears to be (to me at least) not as
true as it is for programming and architecture if applied to painting, this
is somewhat a (not very objective maybe) proof that painting and
programming isn't the best match for an analogy.",1136198362

If I can't tell a bright person from a not-so-bright one, that means I'm just crap at hiring. It does *not* mean universities are crap at teaching.

Moreover, in his essay, JS keeps complaining about crappy recruiters ""who use grep to evaluate rÃ©sumÃ©s"" and hire crappy programmers as a result. This one really bothers me, for two reasons:

1. If hiring crappy programmers is as simple as using grep, then why doesn't Joel just use grep *himself* to sort them out? 

2. Hiring brilliant programmers *must* be hard. Orelse everyone will be able to hire them and Joel will lose his competitive advantage.

I really think Joel is becoming a bit crotchety (as he himself admits).

I remember how back in the 90's everyone complained about how the universities treat CS as abstract *science* and do not teach you jack about actual *programming*, i.e. working for a real company in the real world.

Now, as universities start teaching people the stuff they'll most probably need to actually pay they bills, now that they start (or continue?) teaching programming languages that are actually used in the industry, now those *very same* people start telling us how much better the old days were.

C'mon, face it, the need for Scheme applications is not exactly rising.

Sure, I get your point, learning Scheme or Lisp or SML will make you a better programmer in any language, including Java. 

But that's like saying that studying physics will make you a better driver. It surely will, but most pizza-delivering companies simply don't require their drivers to hold a Ph.D. in physics, so *why waste your time* studying physics if you could get the job anyway?

And then we come to the other reality: not many people my age (30) have the sorts of jobs that let you get even that month of vacation.  At most, you might get a month of unpaid leave in August when everything shuts down.

This is the flip side of Italy's social model: it's very hard to fire people once they are entrenched with full fledged contracts, so employers do what they can to avoid hiring people that way.  The result being is that you get some sort of half-baked position that's neither here nor there, often without some of the benefits like the month of vacation.

Something else that's interesting that these stats dont' really show is that a large portion of Italy takes their vacations in the same month - August - when much of northern Italy shuts down.  I view that as being more harmful to productivity than long vacations, because even those who want to work, can't.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt; i simply refuse to allow my personal morality to be predicated on the promise of ""heaven"" or the threat of ""hell"". thats how you prode animals, not humans.

That shows a pretty major misunderstanding of Chritianity. My personal morality has nothing to do with the promise or heaven or the threat of hell. It has to do with obeying a living God which is much wiser than myself and has never let me down. I've yet to see a command of Christ that doesn't make sense. It is through my own personal experience that not following the law has only led to hardship for me. It seems to me that many of the commands of the Bible are good for living a better life.

I'm glad he had the sense to command me to ""love my neighbor  as myself"", because that in itself sums up any command you could ever make.

I also wasn't aware that animals were prodded with promises of heaven and threats of hell. I mean, when I tell my dog to do something and he won't listen, I don't say, ""If you don't do this, you are going to doggie hell!"" Infact, I don't know anyone that does that. That's kind of weird. ;)

And please be a bit more tactful with your words. I understand why some people are atheists.

Actually, the only reason I'm a Christian is because I did some serious study on Christianity. I refused to have a blind faith - Christ said to love God ""with all your mind, heart and body"". Obviously that implies more than just a blind emotional faith. That being said, I've yet to find anyone who can find a true inconstency with the Bible. Every ""inconsistentcy"" or ""contradiction"" I've ever seen brought forth against the Bible is either a) not reading the text in context or b) not understanding the audience it was written to. I'd love it if you would show me one.

&gt; If historical context cannot be trusted in determining truth, it must be that a religious belief comes from faith alone.

And the Bible has shown time and time again that it is an accurate historical record. An example: Sir William Ramsay was a respected archaelogist who lived at the end of the 19th century. He was an atheist who ascribed to the theory that the Book of Acts was a product of made up stories produced in the 3rd century. Using the Bible as source text, he set out around the Mediterranean intend on disproving it.  In the process of trying to show that the Biblical stories were made up, he found that the Bible was a remarkably accurate historical text. He suprised everyone when he returned home and wrote his book *St. Paul the Traveller and Roman Citizen* in which he stated, ""Great historians are the rarest of writers...[I regard Luke] among the historians of the first rank"".

&gt; Since we are free to believe in whatever we choose, why not believe in ourselves?

Did Hitler not believe in himself? Did Jeffrey Dahmer not believe in himself? If we have no ultimate authority on what is right or wrong, what business do you have telling the murderer that he is doing wrong? Perhaps he is only doing what he believes right (see Hitler).

I think there is a bit of misunderstanding on what exactly faith is. Faith doesn't necessarily imply one without evidence. You place faith/trust in your friends or certain people because they have shown you that they are reliable. Faith is placed on court decisions not because there is absolute proof that something has happened, but rather because the evidence is too great to ignore. The same goes for the Christian. You don't have to put blinders on to believe in God. Infact, God wants you to seek him out and look for the evidence that he is there. It is the only reason I am a Christian - I have seen historically and in my own life time and time again evidences of God.

"reddit.com","t5_6","[deleted]",1136285929
"reddit.com","t5_6","Well, to begin with, the translation they are using is the King James version, which is not very accurate. The KJV was based off of manuscripts from the 10th century AD and later, where as modern translations come from texts dating as far back as the 3rd and 4th centuries. Understanding of ancient Biblical Hebrew and Greek has also obviously increased since 1600 (when the KJV was written) as well.

For example, one of the verses they cite, Deuteronomy 4:40, in the KJV reads, ""That thou mayest prolong **thy days upon the earth**, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever."". Where as in the NIV it reads, ""Keep his decrees and commands, which I am giving you today, so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may **live long in the land** the LORD your God gives you for all time."" Now obviously these people aren't going to live forever and thus be able to live in the land forever, but it is a symbolic representation of God's covenant with Israel.

Deuteronomy 4:40 is not referring to the earth as a planet, but rather as the land the Israelites knew. This rendering also fits in the context of the verse, where Moses is speaking to the Israelites about their future in the land of Canaan.

Anyway, their first example is an excellent example of not looking at the verses in context with the rest of the Bible. Yes, the current earth will be destroyed, but verses such as Isaiah 56 speak of ""a new heavens and a new earth"" (actually, they reference this one). So while the current version of the earth will not always be around, earth itself will, and that's what the verses provided are getting at.

Another example they provide, which is ""is dancing a sin"" is a great example of taking the verses out of context. For example, they reference Exodus 32, which says, ""And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and Moses' anger waxed hot.... And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?""

They actually italicize dancing as if it is the sin of the Israelites, but in the context of the entire passage, that is obviously not the case. The act of dancing wasn't sinful, it was the act of worshipping the golden calf which was sinful. I'm actually very suprised they even tried to call this an inconsistency because its *really* stretching it to call it one. The same goes with the other verses they referenced to try and show that the Bible says dancing is sin.

I could keep going with these examples, but I think I have provided enough to show some of the major problems with these so-called ""inconsistencies"". One thing that should be known about Ecclesiastes is it by nature is a very contradictory book. Solomon (the author) praises different actions and desires and in the very next sentence will speak of how worthless they are. Basically alluding to the fact on how great things are at first but how they quickly lose their luster. That's why by the end of the book, you see him make a succinct summary, ""Now all has been heard; here is the conclusion of the matter: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.""

But again, most of these alleged contradictions would not even be pointed out if critics would take the time to read many of the passages in context instead of isolating sentences and trying to make them read what they aren't. I mean, The Bible actually says, ""there is no God""...but if you read the entire verse in context, it reads, ""The fool says there is no God"". Obviously you can see the problem with chosing one verse out of a collection of 66 books and trying to interpret the verse just by itself.",1136287483

That said, the case really is pretty wierd.

http://www.christianism.com/html/notes/8note57.html

It seems that the article really does explain about all there is to the case.  Righi says that Jesus existed, Cascioli thinks not, and sued him under something that sounds like an anti-propaganda law.  Maybe it is something 
left over from WWII?  I believe that Germany has some laws that forbid certain forms of expression as propaganda or something-perhaps that is where this law comes from?

Absurd generalizatoins -- approaching an undeclared general theory of warnings -- are pointed to for evidence that climate change warnings are baseless.  For example:

""One interesting feature is the tendency to reversals: a benefit becomes a hazard and then becomes a benefit again. Butter is good, then bad, then good again. Saccharine is good, then bad, then good.""

Why not generalize from our experiences with asbestos and lead to reach the opposite conclusion?  There is no meat to the argument.  

Where is the counter-evidence?  It sounds like it's coming ... I kept waiting for it ... but the closest we get is news that the saccharine hullabaloo came to nothing.  No new evidence, and a silly, invalid form of argument: That is what I mean by uninformed.",1136336628
"reddit.com","t5_6","Cascioli says ""that there are not other records of Christ other than the Biblical account"". Very easy proof of that being false is that Christ is mentioned in the Talmud. The fact that Christ was mentioned in other nonBiblical sources really is not debatable.

The Bible has shown time and time again to be an accurate account of history. People debated that the Hittites ever existed (they were mentioned in the Bible). Lo and behold, their civilization was discovered around the end of the 19th century. People debated if Pilate ever existed...a cornerstone that says, ""Potius Pilate, procurator of the Jews"" has been found in ancient Caeseara Phillippi. As I stated in another post, Sir William Ramsay was an atheist who set out using the Book of Acts as his guidebook at disprove it and show that it was a product of 3rd century myths. He began excavating in the Mediterranean and suprised everyone when he came back and made the comment in his book, ""I consider Luke a historian of the first rank"".

If Christ did not exist, the Jewish rabbis (they had more reason that anyone to say that he didn't exist) would not have mentioned them in the Talmud. Instead of denying that he existed, they attribute his actions to being a bastard child, being a sorceror, etc. Josephus mentions Christ (altough the lengths to which he does are albeit debatable). Tacitus, a Roman historian, mentions Christ.

By 64 AD, Nero was already blaming things on a new religious group, the Christians, which implies that the religion necessarily began earlier. John and other writers claimed to be first-hand witnesses of Christ, and then went out and preached this gospel for absolutely no gain and were stoned, crucified, and mocked for this gospel. If you know for a fact that something is a lie...how often is it that a man is willing to die for that lie?

I could mention many evidences, but the simple truth is...if Christ did not exist a tall, the Jewish rabbis (who again, would love to deny that he existed anyway), would not have bothered writing about him in the Talmud. Why would you make negative statements about a man who never existed?

So again, if Christ was indeed just a misidentified person, then not only did the Christians do the misidentifying, but the leading Jewish religious leaders did as well. And I can assure you, the Jews would not be confusing their heretics.

And John of Gamala? A quick Google on his name reveals a bunch of fiction books with him as a leader character. There are no scholarly sources that mention him. If anything, it would seem that he was the one who did not exist.

Something else I wanted to add: for the disciples to completely fabricate the story of Jesus makes absolutely no sense at all. They added detailst that would have severly restricted the popularity of the religion. For example...the Gospel accounts attribute divinity to Jesus, a man. This was completely contrary to the Jewish idea of God as an invisible all-powerful force. Infact, the Jews were so opposed to setting limits to God, that they wouldn't even write his name. For the disciples to fabricate the story of Christ as actually being God would have been pretty much a suicidal way to start their religion in the eyes of the Jews. In addition, Christ would not have been a popular God in the eyes of the Romans who did not have a positive view of the Jews and who had powerful gods such as Jupiter. This story of a Jewish god dying on the cross, embarassing himself by being naked and defecating on himself would not have been attractive to any Romans. And something that would not have been attractive to either Roman or Jew was the account by each Gospel that the first person to reach Christ's grave and to discover he was missing was a woman. This would be seen as making a woman a witness (ie, highly accountable) and was not something that happened in either society. There are many more examples of things like these, but in short, Christianity is the exact opposite of the type of religion you just make up. There are so many unnecessary and seemingly negative details in the Gospel accounts that its just laughable to suppose that the man of Jesus was a myth. It spread in spite of itself, not because of itself.

Again, you can debate the divinity of Christ all day, but to act like he didn't even exist is just ludicrous.",1136337246
"reddit.com","t5_6","I happened to find what the case is about from Cascioli's own site:

""According to article 661 of the Italian Penal Code, there is an abuse of popular credulity when someone, by means of fraud, deceives a great number of people. In this particular case, the ministers of religion of the Catholic Church, like Righi in the present case, by committing historical falsity, therefore presenting invented facts as if true and actually occurred â but useful to religious doctrine â they deceive all the people that come into contact with the teachings of such religion, by inducing them to believe in that religion, not on the basis of purely theological reasoning (totally legitimate and admissible), but on the basis of a deceptive representation of the facts.""

In other words I allow myself to procrastinate for a period of time before the whistle blows. This can be measured in days to weeks.

However, this is probably my downfall in terms of productivity, because there should be a balance. A simplistic example, 'If you eat to much, you get sick', as with drinking. As my companion allways says, 'Too much of anything is not good'. I however love to procrastinate. I do alot of creative thinking in this area.

Second, I disagree with his characterization of complex systems that can only be ""managed"", not controlled.  This is the rationale we always get for why globalism, for example, is unstoppable.  It's a ""complex system"" so we need to manage it, because we can't control it.  In other words, we can't control our own destiny, because it's too complicated.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Michael Crichton should shut his mouth and stick to writing bad books.

What really struck me about his lecture is the similarity between many of the examples he gives and what he is doing himself: playing off of uninformed hype to enrich/empower oneself.

Despite the footnotes he is either uninformed or a liar.

His whole idea of complex and linear systems is incorrect. 
Two examples he gives of linear systems (a rocket and a cannonball) are in fact non-linear. Linear systems are proportional (if the input is changed the output changes by a proportional ammount) and additive (the output in response to the sum of two inputs is exactly the sum of the outputs in response to the inputs individually). Ojects moving in a gravitational field do not meet these requirements even if you ignore friction. Dip into high-school physics, pull out the basic equations for kinetic and potential energy, and consider the relationship between initial velocity and height reached by the cannonball. If you can't see the non-linearity there perhaps you should go buy one of Crichton's books...

Enough beating a dead horse.

What he is really talking about seems to be non-deterministic systems, which aren't as unpredictable as he wants. If it weren't possible to predict to some degree of accuracy the behavior of non-deterministic systems we could achieve nothing.

He seems to demand total predictability which is a real jack-a$$ thing to do, right along the lines of the creationists (ID'ers). He contends that complex systems can only be managed. Management requires some ability to expect a result from a cetain action, which is prediction. So by his argument, since complex systems can't be predicted, and management requires prediction, management of complex systems is impossible. Does he even think this stuff through? Although to be fair, his idea of management and predictions are probably different.

He also seems to be engaging in some intellectual dishonesty by showing the headline and first few words of the Independent's ""Future of the Earth"" article and implying that the article is an example of people playing on fear. From the way it starts I wager that the article is actually along the lines of his argument, not an actual fear-mongering piece. I can't verify since the Independent wants a Pound to purchase the article...

Another thing, doctors, especially MD's are not scientists automaticaly. They are technicians who apply the findings of science. Some doctors are scientists, they do research. The rest are like mechanics, they try to figure out a problem and fix it (at a gross level), not experiment to find explanations for the problem. Oversimplifying here: there is some cross-over between general practice medicine and the practice of science, the same can be said of mechanics. However, having an MD, PhD, or an ASE certification doesn't mean you know crap about an unrelated field.

Killing someone is stopping the show. Turning her life into permanent physical and psychological intense suffering, turning her into a impotent being that causes horror to everyone, especially her beloved ones, without hope for any significant improvement ever, is letting it go only for worse. 

I know it's not PC to say that not every life ought to be lived, but would you argue that removing bad times from one's life while keeping all of the good ones isn't a good thing? In her case, that would have been simple to achieve: let her die on that day, as she'll probably never any significant good time anymore.

Moreover, death being something unavoidable in the long term, we came to be more or less used to it, and we can sort of cope with the idea. Quite fortunately, we aren't used to what happened to her, we're still fresh to this kind of horror, and we better realize its terrible nature

So yes, I think that what happened to her is far worse than death, that it is normal that it causes much more horror than the death of, say, her carmates, and that it IS a much stronger argument than someone dying.

",1136450473
"reddit.com","t5_6","From the page I linked to there is a link to the PDF of the report the list was gleaned from. It states:

1. What is the Corruption Perceptions Index?
The TI Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) ranks countries in terms of the degree to which corruption is
perceived to exist among public officials and politicians. It is a composite index, drawing on corruptionrelated
data in expert surveys carried out by a variety of reputable institutions. It reflects the views of
business people and analysts from around the world, including experts who are locals in the countries
evaluated.

On the site I linked to, they already describe in detail how difficult it is to gather information on corruption under question 5:

5. Can the costs of corruption be quantified?
The short answer is ""no"". Some experts use regression analyses and other empirical methods in order to try to put a dollar figure on the cost of corruption. It is virtually impossible, though, since payments of bribes are not publicly recorded. No one knows exactly how much money is being ""invested"" in corrupt officials annually. And bribes do not take only monetary form: favours, services, presents and so on are just as common. At most, one can research the correlation between the level of corruption and, say, democratisation, economic development or environmental degradation.The social costs of corruption are even less quantifiable. No one knows how much the loss of an energetic entrepreneur or an acclaimed scientist costs a country. Moreover, any estimated social costs in dollars would be inadequate to the task of measuring the human tragedy behind resignation, illiteracy, or inadequate medical care. A general scepticism vis-Ã -vis any attempt at quantifying the costs of corruption is thus warranted.The following example illustrates the dilemma of pressing the issue into facts and figures:
A power plant is being built somewhere in the world, at a cost of US$ 100 million. It could be argued that - were it not for corruption - the cost could have been as low as US$ 80 million. The financial damage to the public would then be US$ 20 million. In practice, quite often projects are planned simply so that those involved can make huge private profits. Assuming that the power plant was superfluous, the financial damage would have to be assessed at US$ 100 million. Yet no major construction project leaves the environment untouched. The results may be: increased pollution, a lowering of land prices, resettlement of local residents, an increased debt burden for the country, etc. This calculation - probably closest to reality - is immensely complex. On a global scale, it seems almost impossible. But even if one were able to calculate the environmental damage, the increase of the debt burden and other factors, how would one measure the erosion of public confidence and the deterioration of a government's legitimacy, which are the direct result of corruption?

In my perception, you've taken a defensive stance against this data since it triggered your bogometer. However, the site I linked to fully described the potential for bogus data and stresses the difficulty you're concerned about. Whether the actual list is useful or not, it certainly got me to read their site to see how they came up with the data and now I find myself understanding corruption a bit more. That's kinda useful to me.",1136450790

Google is also a software company with a philosophy that is tangential--if not opposite--that of Microsoft's. No, it's not ""don't be evil"". Google wants to index the world while Microsoft claims to want to allow its users to index the world (according to a recent interview). But Google is the âgreat indexerââ¦. And THEY donât use Microsoft. If nothing else, itâs an embarrassment.

OK, I'll admit that anything's possible, but a racist joke? Are we supposed to believe that a group of white supremacist (or at least incredibly tasteless and insensitive) programmers lurking within Wal-Mart's IT department deliberately skewed the recommendation system to produce this particular combination? I'd say this falls under the category of ""extraordinary claims"". And what does ""bad judgement"" have to do with it? The only ""judgement"" at work is that of an automated system working in a problem domain that was clearly beyond its abilities.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Didn't the dot com bubble last something like 4 years? (from '96 to '00)  So saying you predicted it but you were just 3 years early means you would've missed most of the boom (had you acted accordingly).

However, I do think that housing prices are due for a correction.  I can only see two beneficiaries of the current housing 'boom' : real estate agents, mortage brokers and local governments that base property taxes on a percentage of property value.  So what if my house has gone up in value by 50% in the last four years?  If I sold my house I'd still need someplace to live, so either: 1) I'd have to buy another house (which has also gone up at least by the same percentage meaning that I really can't capture the gain) or 2) I'd have to rent and because housing prices have gone up, so have rents (landlords need to cover those mortage payments). The article claims that rents haven't gone up, but certainly they have in some areas pricing low income people out of the rental market.  In areas where rents haven't gone up it might make sense to go for option 2 (sell and rent until the bubble pops) because you could perhaps capture some of the gain.

So what real benefit have I gotten as a homeowner by rising real estate prices?  I pay more in property taxes now and other people around me who rent are paying more in rent (meaning they have less money to spend on other things).  It's the Real Estate agents who have played a big role in talking up this market.  Bring on the correction, lower prices will be good for those who don't yet own homes and they won't hurt those of us who have been in our homes for several years (it's going to hurt for those who have bought in the last couple of years, though; they'll have to consider it an expensive lesson in buying high and selling low).",1136514204

I don't know her, and I'm projecting some of my personnal views on her: that's exactly the purpose of her mediatization. 

Maybe she's disgusted with life, maybe she spends her lifetime dreaming she was dead on that day, maybe she feels definitely lost for sane social interaction, for bearing and rising kids, surely her life is a permanent physical suffering, probably does she rightly bet that this suffering will only end with her death. Maybe she sees little purpose in her surviving, and has little hope to find such a purpose in the future.

Or maybe she thinks that what she endures is God's will, that it has an Inneffable meaning, that demonstrating her outstanding courage is of crucial importance, maybe she loves her medicalised life, with it's suffering, horrors, etc. just as Job did on his manure heap. 

I have as little (or as much) ground to claim the former as you have to claim the latter. I certainly wouldn't hold the same speach, had she personnaly taken part in the discussion, but here she's only a substrate, on which we grow a discussion or more general interest, so we don't have to care too much about betraying her philosophical stand, had she one. 

However, I strongly disagree with your claim that ""She has endured horrific pain and agony in order to LIVE"". I've been living with an intensive care doctor, and I've got no illusion about who fights for survival: doctors do whatever it takes to keep people technically alive, with little to no consideration for the kind of life it might be. They give no opportunity to the patient to choose between life and death.  I would add that many doctors do it as a _Wille zur Macht_ move (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nietzsche), which is awfully ungodly if you look at it from a religious standpoint, and cursed such prominent figures as Moses.

Bottom line is: if you didn't make a conscious choice, then there is no courage involved. Nothing indicates that she ever had an opportunity to make a choice, and my experience with physicians makes me strongly believe that she never had one.

A bit of philosophy/theology to finish. You write: ""She is a human being and a courageous survivor. To me, that is beautiful"". I've already written what I think of this courage. About her being a survivor, what does it mean? The end of her life is indeed slightly delayed (she's going to suffer skin cancers, immunodepressions, general bad health due to lack of physical activity, various other organic dysfunctions, and probably a lack of reasons to enjoy life, so don't expect her to live very old). I would find it beautiful if these years were put to use into something that surpasses her personnal life. Merely staying alive isn't exactly such a sublime thing, my dog would do the same. Your life's only worth what you make of it. 

I really don't buy the ""this is a beautiful proof of courage"" thing: that's mumbo-jumbo repeated by religious people to cover how difficult it is to see God's will, in a world which has always seemed unfair, and where now humanity's power grows at such insane speed that most of theological views become obsolete instantaneous (a couple of decades _is_ instantaneous, for theology). What was God's will: the crash? Her survival? The conditions of this survival? Doctors being able and willing to maintains her alive? Why would this very high-tech, artificial, survival medical effort be godly, whereas, say, articifial fecundation or contraception would be ungodly? Can I remind you that until no-so-long ago, opening corpses to improve medical knowledge and power was considered as terribly ungodly, and would grant you death by burning? The whole standpoint of ethics (including religion) about survival has been blown by the pace of medical progress. It will take decades before we adapt our ethics to these new conditions. That won't be too much of a heartbreak for secular ethics; OTOH religious views which pretend to be eternal will suffer much more from that twist...

"reddit.com","t5_6","This is very concerning indeed. What is needed is similar applications with tighter access controls set by the maker of the profile.

Its understandable that since the entire business models of these sites relies on them having as much info as possible about you for targeted advertising, these sites provide possibly the **most accurate** and **easiest to use** resource for mining information about groups of people.

Fears of some NSA/ government conspiracies aside, the potential for abuse of these systems has already been proven. Private schools have gone apeshit in in the last year doing things like registering on facebook and looking for anything, even simply thoughts or jokes that could be interpreted as violating school policy. This is a huge problem. I would be surprised if government agencies don't start using this information to screen new hires.

In the short term I would suggest that you DONT use your real name to register for sites like facebook.. since they are nice enough to not let you change it after. From experience I'll let you know that otherwise you'll have to use it knowing that everything you write, your pictures, groups, and friends can and will be monitored by your school.. and possibly others.

An example, recently some friends of mine were nearly suspended just for being in a group that mentioned drinking on campus. I can here some of you now whining that that's no big deal, but just think of how much this could cost the students. A year of tuition, hundreds of hours of community service (which is as expensive as overtime given that he is already busy), new living expenses, etc. The potential of private schools to censor and penalize students for communication that is intended to be PRIVATE amoung themselves is rapidly increasing.

Now you would expect that since fb has a number of privacy measures (mostly through limiting visibility of profiles), it would be a much more creative and relaxed environment. Well it isn't, and it's boring as heck unless your writing cute little love letters to all your friends. It's gotten much worse lately as many have realized that whatever they write, the wrong people will find out about it. This is a direct failure of the privacy mechanisms that the site setup to, i think, lessen this fear.

If you look at the other side of the spectrum, myspace, were your name is whatever you want, everyone writes all about their drunken sex parties, and even slip porn in now and then, you'll see something closer to the creative and fun place that the net could provide. Not to mention that everyone doesn't seem so scared. Too bad the site is focused on 10yo girls..

So, why am I complaining so much and what can be done about it? My idea, which I have roughly implemented, is as follows.  Basically my solution is to create a trust based authentication system. For example in a system similar to these sites, the visibility of Bob's profile could be degraded based on the amount that Bob and/or Bob's friends trusts the viewer, Alice. For the most part everything would be transparent except that Bob would now be able to rate his friends in different categories such as trustworthiness and then optionally tune these ranking thresholds to correspond to levels of visibility. Of course the challenge of this is making it totally distributed and backed by crypto to ensure that the rules are followed regardless of subpoenas.. which my implementation demonstrates. I've drafted up a few papers, and have plenty of implementation code if anyone wants to take a look.

So what does everyone else think? Anyone with better ideas? Or maybe your all happy living in a glass house.. I'm sure that anyone that has done extensive non-business communication online has been bitten when the wrong person read things you wrote that weren't intended for her.

You just don't have time to cover everything.

For me, this isn't a fundamentalist/atheist argument.  It's more a question of how to manage the multitude of diverse opinions on topics that must be taught in schools.  Unless something is an absolute fact, we should include the most commonly held views as those that should be taught, making sure to mention that there are other points of view that are different.

As such, I believe there should be at least one other option mentioned when it comes to ""how we got here.""  Obviously, whether you believe it or not (I don't), the Theory of Evolution deserves to have the lion's share of time devoted to it.  However, there should be mention that there are other points of view.  I'm surprised that, since there are so many people in this country who claim to believe in God, there wouldn't be more than a passing interest in the concept of ID.

When we talk about the separation of church and state, we usually think about it meaning that the church is not to be the state.  We definitely bend over backwards to make sure of that-- just look at all the Christmas/Channukah/""holiday"" debates we just came out of a week ago.  However, we also should look at the other side of the coin there-- the state is not to be the church.  And when you talk about the origin of the world, you are engaging in both scientific and religious terms.

Many people would love to be able to send their children to a religious school.  However, those who want to do so face a major handicap:  they must pay for their child's education while the tax money they have contributed goes to a public school.  I don't want to turn this into a voucher debate (one controversial topic at a time, please!), but this problem does make it more difficult for ""regular"" people to send their kids to a religious school than to a public one.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The article's author comments on being a wage slave with his youthful experience of 26 years, and it shows.  Let's quickly visit some ""nuggets"" of wisdom:

""Common programmers may expect to earn at least $60,000/year, but it is rare for even superstar programmers to command above $150,000, excepting very specialized markets like kernel driver development.""

The 60k to 150k range for an annual salary is characteristic of a career to which the property ""slave"" is attached?  Interesting.

""But in taking the full risk and reward of the enterprise upon himself, the programmer who is not sorely wanting in skills of business development or marketing must soon find himself enjoying the fruits of his labors, albeit many times only after years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor.""

It is astonishing to find that this is held as some sort of dreamlike gold standard.  Mr. Weekly apparently has failed to consider the depth to which ""years of difficult and uncertain unpaid labor"" might cause many individuals to be satisfied with their 60k-150k salaries.  Some of them might even have responsibilities such as student loan payments, mortgages, or families to take care of.

Oh, what the hell.  Quit your job anyway.  Duties be damned, there's a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow!

""Wages and debt go hand in hand, for creditors only make loans which can be repaid regularly. Therefore, the single most important question they ask when ascertaining credit is one's present wages.""

Mr. Weekly is quite unfamiliar with the FICO credit score, which has NO direct reference to one's income. Bankers do care about income, but they care far more about your fidelity to their debts. The theory goes: If you've reliably met your financial obligations in the past, you'll probably meet them again in the future, regardless of income.

It's a pretty good theory.

--

As far as the actual heart of the article goes, Mr. Weekly seriously devalues and brushes aside the invaluable work performed by the rest of a company to which a programmer gives his allegiance.  I think many project managers, executive officers, salesmen, and marketers would object to the fact that a mere sprinkling of their skills is all that is necessary to turn a decent piece of software into what the author implies is a near unlimited, wage-free source of wealth.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I am the author. I'm now a downright grizzly old man of 27. I'm pretty amused by how quickly some people latched onto my age and decided to brush aside anything I had to say as a result, because I clearly (in their eyes) couldn't have possibly lived long enough to be able to bring insight into the labor market without a few decades of work experience.

I realize that plenty of people are risk averse and recognize the comforts that a $60k+ / year job provide. Those people can live a reasonable lifestyle, enjoy their jobs, and find life content. The economy is largely composed of such people and absolutely requires these people.

But there are some people who have it in them to go it on their own, and they owe it to themselves (and society) to make a try at it. These people are a little less risk-averse, are interested in developing a broader skillset, etc. Some of this is luck (to not be covered in crushing debt) and some of this is chutzpah (or hubris, as you please).

As for my brushing aside of the value of the other players in the company - I think it's a reaction to the fact that executive management and salespeople already effectively operate on commission. If the company does well, they do well. But the same is not generally true of the engineering staff. And only engineers capable of acting in a founder-style role and having ownership over their ideas will be able to see the sorts of returns that executives and salespeople are regularly able to achieve.

And if enough engineers leave to start their own ventures, management at larger companies may consider giving engineers a larger ownership of the company as retention strategy. Until there is market pressure to do so, however, we're unlikely to see significant ownership on the part of the engineers and innovators who are creating a company's core property.",1136575813

Economics is not based on belief in a power we cannot understand. It is based on complex systems, something we know we *can* understand. To the naive observer, complex systems seem to be magic: the human brain is so complex it leads many people to believe an intelligence must have designed it. But the human brain isn't magic, and neither is the economy. Economists know this stuff - it's their job, after all!

Anyway, this is rather old news - other papers have covered the Starbucks short issue. Personally I think his explanation is weak. But what this guy leaves out is a crucial fact: how to get served this short size coffee. Starbucks staff are told: if someone asks for a ""small"" - serve a tall (that's a 12oz cup); if someone asks for ""medium"" serve a tall. Whatever they ask for, serve a tall. The only way you can get a short (8oz) size is to specifically ask for a ""short"" - whether cappuchino, mocha, latte, whatever. Sometimes the staff will deny there is any such size, but that's because they are stupid. Usually there is no hassle. Sometimes they will claim that they don't have the right size cups - in which case point them over to the children's milk size cups (which is the only place an 8oz appears on a standard Starbucks menu) and say: ""That one"".

In reality, [PETA is not in favor](http://www.peta.org/factsheet/files/FactsheetDisplay.asp?ID=87) of banning medical testing -- they merely suggest that try to use new non-animal technology (like computer simulations and human culture testing) whenever possible and try to ""reduce the number of animals used and to minimize pain and distress"" when it's not.

More precisely, my claims are that:
- a language is low level when it makes certain things more difficult to express than necessary;
- the casual [contrieved] recipes to circumvent this inexpressivness are called design patterns;
- therefore, omnipresence of design patterns in a language structure is a sign that this language is low level;
- as soon as you want to do I/Os, or anything vaguely stateful, in Haskell, you need beginner-unfriendly monads, which definitely are a design pattern, and a difficult to understand one;
--&gt; Haskell is too low level in contexts where you want to do something stateful. And a typical example of something stateful is: the real world.

Don't misread me, I love Haskell when used at its intended purpose: modelize highly logical/algorithmical stuff in a perfectly clean way.

"reddit.com","t5_6","&gt;the fact that Perl, Python and Ruby have become popular while Haskell has stayed a marginal language is a failure of the Haskell community

It sounds like the author is faulting the Haskell community for ""not trying hard enough"" or something.  But it seems to me that the reason Haskell is unpopular is that it just isn't the kind of language that's fated to be popular right now.  (disclosure: I'm a Lisp guy, so I'm only partly qualified for this)

But I think that at least part of the reason for Haskell and Lisp's unpopularity is that they don't go out of their way to provide stuff that the so-called ""average programmer"" takes for granted -- like easy I/O and infix notation.  Haskell's and Lisp's respective communities have their reasons, which are perfectly legitimate, but they (at least, a lot of Lispers and the author of this post) haven't come to terms with the fact that if 'unconventional' or 'revolutionary' or 'unique'  are part of what your language *is*, it's not likely to be embraced by the mainstream quickly.  Changing people's minds takes time, and ""trying harder"" to make that happen is like trying harder to strike a match on a wet cake of soap.

In order: Yes they are (by definition, because they couldn't post the article if it was already posted); Possibly, but so what?; and no, they aren't -- at least, not any more lazy than most of the people who run across an interesting article and think ""hey, this should be on reddit!""

IMO, if someone posts an article here (or to any site of this nature) that article should be judged solely on what it has to offer. That's the whole point, isn't it? If you find the article stupid, pointless, redundant, or too similar to something that was just posted, then by all means knock it down. But if you're trying to judge whether the poster's intent was pure enough, or whether he broke enough of a sweat hunting it down, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I suppose in certain really extreme cases you could use eval, but that would be... for really extreme cases.

There are various tools in Javascript for doing things that might call for macros in Lisp. AFAIK, where Lisp macros are used, they are not usually *essential*, just a way to cut down complexity and redundancy, and that's what I'm targetting here. I would have to see an example to try to create a real equivalent.

Javascript has object literals and a builtin for...in operation, which are the equivalent of a dictionary or association list elsewhere. I use a simple function for creating HTML (through the W3C DOM interface) that takes an object with (some of) the properties 'tag', 'attributes', 'children', etc. and creates  DOM nodes based on it. The resulting code is about 5% of the size and complexity of equivalent code that uses the DOM functions directly. (For this reason, I object heavily to modifying the object prototype object, since each added function will show up in a for..in operation.)

Another tool is doing wacky things with object prototypes and binding functions to objects. Setting aside the OO vs. functional debate, this is very handy at times. 

Also, in any function, the arguments are available as the array 'arguments', which can be used creatively, though not always constructively.

I *would* like to see a Lisp-like system where you can make macros by messing with the parse tree, but even that would not be nearly as useful as Lips macros. You could roll your own macro system by writing some text manipulation functions, loading Javascripts in as strings, processing them, and then loading them into the runtime with eval.",1136826203

"reddit.com","t5_6","I'm just wondering what Reddit needs to do to get noticed.

I guess it might just take time. But the comment system on Reddit is excellent - for one it has threaded discussions and does them very well, the formatting tools are very easy to use, and I love how voting a comment up or down is no different than voting a link up and down. That just makes sense, and its intuitive.

I also think that Reddit's system of just having a descriptive title instead of a title and a description is very wise. You can see many more stories. If you see a title that looks interesting, you actually look at the link. On Digg most of the time the title is worthless and all the thought it put into the description, or vice versa. Its just redundant. And then on Digg you have the problem of people only reading the description and digging it based on that.

And Reddit is just clean. I wish I had come up with the layout myself. Its just very simple and it gets things done. For that I think spez and kn0thing are genius (well, the whole site is genius), but Reddit really does have that same simplicity that made Google the bomb.

Also...its got the mascot. That's all I need to say about him. 

Right now it just seems like you got Digg and Slashdot slugging it out and Reddit is kind of the odd man out that no one really notices. But maybe that is a good thing, because right now the community is very good.

You, for example, enjahova, I've already spoken with you in several link discussions, and though we disagreed on a few things, I think it was done respectfully. With the massive amount of people who use both Digg and Slashdot, its much harder to recognize people, and you don't get the same respect while discussing.

One of the few things that irks me about Reddit is how some things are voted down just because of a mindset someone has. A link or a comment can be constructive and well-though out and can even be right, but just because people don't agree with that viewpoint they vote it down. That doesn't seem to be much of a problem right now (I have noticed it a few times), but it might become a bigger problem as the site grows.",1136829604

As far voting on comments and links goes, I think the system will take care of itself. Barring organized attempts at trolling I think that everyone can vote encourages better discussion. If you just post something on a whim, you will be more likely to be voted down in an instant. If you post with respect and merrit, you will probably get voted up. The  people quick to vote up/down on mood should balance each other out.

I guess that leaves an interesting problem that I wonder if spez and kn0thing have considered (I'm sure they have). What about automated abuses? Can 1000 accounts be registered to vote a link up or a comment up? I'm sure right now that would be noticeable, but if you had nearly a million user count like slashdot, what would stop it?

This is something that happened on Digg very recently. A single guy would register a few new accounts each day and use those accounts to promote/demote stories.

He then took it a step further and created many accounts and started spamming the comment system at Digg to prove a point. Every single story on the frontpage had over 500 comments via his automated bot.

"reddit.com","t5_6","U is a combinator, a function that takes a function and returns another function.
f is a function that takes a number or function and returns a number or calls the function.
n is a number

So U applies its argument to itself.  This means it makes a recursive function of its argument.  This means, in turn, that its argument must be a function capable of taking a functional argument.  Note that f fills this description.  So you can write a nonrecursive function (note that fact-nr is not recursive.), and then pass that nonrecursive function to U, which will make it a traditional recursive factorial, just like we have all written the first time we try out a  new lisp.

But why do all this?  If this were all there is to combinators, no one would use them.  But combinators can be used to fundamentally change the way function calls work in your language.  For instance, memoization can be an interesting technique-you can memorize the value of a function call, and then just return that when you get the same call again.  If your language supports combinators, you can hack in memoization yourself.  This is very cool.  I will try to write an essay about this, in my copious spare time.

"reddit.com","t5_6","See if your school has something like an Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP). These seem to be relatively common, and typically provide something on the order of $1,500 to $2,000 for work on research projects under a faculty member. Not much money, but it is a start. This can be supplemented by additional grant money if it can be found (a well connected faculty member can help).

It might be possible for your department to create a short term job position for you if it has the funds available. This is a big 'if' and depends on a lot of factors ('extra' department cash, compliant faculty member, compelling project).

For student projects, it will be easier to find funding if you are working on something that qualifies as a research problem. Try to show potential funders that your idea is worth sinking a couple grand into. If you're thinking of some kind of message board 'Web 2.0' buzzword crap, you will have problems. Not that this junk isn't interesting but: much has already been done by people with more resources and experience, it's not really that innovative from a CS perspective (ooh, 'tagging'), and as a result the educational advantages would be slim.

I've focused on academic funding sources since much of the commercial world has problems understanding OSS. Since OSS scares many of the 'intellectual property' trolls, they will not be too inclined to risk cash for what they perceive as no return.

In any case, it would be helpful to develop a working relationship with a faculty member with related interests. This will bring you drastically more benefit than trying to whore yourself out to business. Working with faculty can also make for references when it is time to whore yourself out to business, or graduate shcools...

* Define your project as a **research** problem.
* Find a faculty mentor.

The only *belief* that I would say I have is a metabelief in the correctness of the scientific method for deciding what is fact. And in that context (most) religious people have two metabeliefs, one saying that the scientific method is *one* way of obtaining facts, and another saying that the bible (ku'ran/talmud etc) is also a source for facts, along with historical and modern interpretaions of their specific religious tradition.

I would claim that religous people are delusional because I think that the *facts* they believe are not true facts, but that is not a philisophicaly sound position because it comes down to the fact that I don't agree with one of their metabeliefs, which is subjective.

However, if we are to demand simplicity then holding two metabeliefs when one suffices is clearly excessive. So then we're left with atheists who's only metabelief is in the scientific method and fundamentalists who's only belief is in the religious tradition of their choice.

* The universe and we ourselves actually exist
* Our senses can be trusted and correspond in a significant way to the reality of the universe (we are not ""brains in a vat"" or ""copper-tops"")
* Information which is not scientifically demonstrable is not a ""fact"" (e.g., my wife loves me, Abraham Lincoln existed)

&gt;This new study identifies various noncoding or junk DNA sequences in the human genome that are conserved when compared to the corresponding regions in the genomes of a wide range of vertebrates.

""Conserved"" of course meaning conserved over evolution.  Now perhaps the authors of reason.org mean ""conserved"" in that the sense that the designer gave different species some similar stretches of DNA, except with minor changes that make it only appear to look like it was a product of evolution, rather than design. (Isn't that designer a tricky fellow?)

They then go on to imply that if there are a few new annotations in the 99% of DNA that appears to be non-functional, then &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; of it must be important, and not look like the huge mess of imperfection and non-design that it looks like. Ridiculous. Biologists have always known that there are likely functional elements, and for that very reason most avoid the term ""junk DNA"" as its used in that paper summary.

No sir, there is **no** way that ""people can believe that science does not support the theory that we were spontaneously created from inorganic material and still be rational human beings,"" as you said, unless they are simultaneously seriously misinformed.  And misinformation is the way that creationism persists; its all a load of dishonest tripe.

One more thing, you use the word ""spontaneous,"" which isn't quite the way that any biologist would describe evolution, which is very gradual, and which is random only in half: the mutation, or generation of minor variations.  The selection half is quite non-random, and which eventually selects the variations that provide the slightest of advantages.

Second, it is correct that those who promote scientific discovery should do so at the expense of certain untenable ideas within religious systems. It is not necessary to dismiss or contradict the progress of science in order to have some belief in the supernatural; neither is it necessary to ridicule all religion in order to promote science. I think those who do should be told to stick to science and avoid public discourse. Science, like religion, should expose itself by confidence in facts, not through spectacular displays of irrelevant criticism.

That may be a bit extreme, but it certainly is no different than if somebody linked to an interview with a Catholic cardinal as to why Catholicism is so great.  The Dawkins piece?  130+ mod-up points and counting.  The piece on the cardinal?  Minus double digits points and probably lower.

It's the lack of balance and at least the pretense of objectivity in these matters that is frustrating.

Were this an article on Dawkins's specialty, biology, then I would have no problem with it.  His so-called scholarship on biology has been dealt with by scholars of his caliber or higher.

But I take issue with the claim that the contempt of Dawkins for those ""with religion"" is based on a cool analysis of his academic findings and observations.  Even the most entrenched atheists won't make public comments like his.

Even in his academic specialty, he finds spectacular ways to treat the opposition:

""It is absolutely safe to say that if you meet someone who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).""",1136920596

Whenever someone who is uncomfortable with technology reads or hears about Alan Turing's original proposed test for artificial intelligence for the first time, they inevitably make an objection. Just as inevitably, that objection was covered in Turing's original paper on the subject. No popular media has ever provided me anything new about artificial intelligence.

Similarly, religious twits will be upset and confused by reality until the heat death of the universe. So I read about the latest tireless efforts by Richard Dawkins to explain concepts that were well understood 100 years ago, and I'm irritated. Irritated silly.

i don't know about you, but i see reporting and posts about religion _a lot_ more often than i do pieces about atheism. both online and in ""traditional"" media. maybe i'm looking in the wrong places, but i could easily dig up half a dozen interviews with various catholic strange-hat wearers talking about their (to me, repulsive) opinions on policy and society for each piece like this one i spot, and that's even *after* i count the atheist blogs i read.

really, the anti-religion crowd is nowhere near as loud and obnoxious as the anti-atheism wingnut brigade (cf. pat robertson), and the atheists tend to be more erudite when they *do* start jousting. i see no reason why they should be any more strongly criticized than their counterparts... who, IMO, don't catch nearly enough criticism for *their* jousting.

"reddit.com","t5_6","I can think of two useful beliefs I espouse that contradict yours.

I believe that the scientific method can be used to decide a great many facts. I'm of the opinion that there are a class of real facts for which the scientific method is inadequate. My hope is that in the future the line between the two will become clear enough that the theologians can reclaim what is theirs and possibly look after this body of knowledge with some rigor.

I also believe that all people believe themselves to be acting in good faith, doing the right thing nearly all the time. As much as Dawkins' typical atheistic tone makes my blood boil, I can put myself in his position and appreciate where he is coming from.

I think he's getting an unearned easy pass right now though. It's easy to point accusing fingers at ""religion"" right now and get modded up hundreds of points. It's a fact that Gen X and Gen Y demographic groups tend to be suspicious of institutions. Cast religion as evil instutution and Dawkins' can just ""ride the wave"" and huge number of viewers will natually assume he is right.

Just as there are stand out atrocities to tar the name of religion, there are stand out atrocities committed by governments devoid of supposed religious influence. Just as there are stand out examples of human care and kindness due to religion, maybe you can find me some examples those brought about by communisim.

In the long run, I expect that ""religion"" as Dawkins accuses of being the root of all evil, will be found to be either a red herring, or statistially a deterrent to evil. He doesn't seem willing to consider that right now, wrapped up in an emotional response to a lot of anecdotes.

and the thing about talkorigins is not their objectivity (though i note they link to rather more of their opponents than bother linking back to them...), but rather that they _list peer-reviewed references_ and explain _why_ the mainstream scientific point of view -- which they unashamedly present -- is mainstream and considered credible. they back up their positions with evidence and logic, not faith alone; it is really not a matter of belief in the religious sense at all.

it makes as much sense to say you ""believe"" in evolution as to say you ""believe"" in Newton's theory of gravity. both are scientific theories that explain the observed facts and make predictions we can test, which have stood up to testing very well for a very long time. both of them could be disproven, if sufficiently weighty facts were found that didn't fit into their explanations and predictions (and Newton's theory has been, to an extent, by Einstein), but by and large that just hasn't happened, despite centuries of testing.

neither of them explain everything -- in fact, both of them leave quite a bit unexplained -- but each of them explain a lot of things that no competing, rival theory gets close to settling. religion simply doesn't play in this league at all; i think it would be fair to say that this isn't what religion is _for_.

There are two seperate concepts being mixed up here, that evolution happened, and how evolution works. 
That evolution happened is fairly well established. As for how it happens, we've figured out many mechanisms responsible (genetic drift, natural selection, sexual selection, etc) and these may fully explain the phenomena. However if it could be shown that there was a solid statistical problem with the timeframe of the evolution of higher life forms, then that would be evidence of more mechanisms at work yet to be uncovered. Sure, one of the extra mechanisms could be an interventionist god, but jumping to this conclusion immediately would be premature given how much has been discovered since Darwin's time (thanks to a growning understanding of genetics). It wouldn't be evidence against evolution (in the sense that Jurassic rabbit fossiles would be).

been dishonest strawman constructions and sophestry, I imagine genuine research into the area (which I'm sure exists) is interesting.

He gained much by his exploits. He also seems very double-minded.

If Muhammad was tricked by Satan once, how do you know he wasn't tricked the entire time?

Joeseph Smith was even worse. This is a man who destroyed a printing press because they said negative things about him. This is a man who said that the American government would be destroyed by the wrath of God (still standing, btw). This is a man who married many many women, including women that already were married. He, like Muhammad, became extremely wealthy.

Joseph Smith had ""prophecy"" after ""prophecy"" that ended up being completely false. Several of the original men who swore that they saw the golden tablets the Book of Mormon was translated on later ended up recanting their story. 

Not only that, but the Book of Mormon has absolutely no historical or archaelogical backing. This is not the case at all with the Bible.

But the I look at Christ's actions. He never gained anything by what he preached. He didn't become weathly. He didn't marry many women. He didn't try to overthrow the government or start wars. He, much like the Bible says, ""was led like a lamb to the slaughter"".

I also see many OT prophecies concerning Christ that are very specific and fit his character exactly. For example, 

""And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit [a] of grace and supplication. They will look on [b] me, the one they have pierced, and they will mourn for him..."" - Zechariah 12:9-11

Keep in mind, this is written at least 400 years before Christ, and is written by a Jew in a society that was so scared of idolatry that they wouldn't even say his name, much less ascribe to him any kind of a physical form. Yet this piercing of God very much fits the image of Christ.

Anyway, to make a long story short, Christ practiced what he preached, ""To love the Lord your God with all your heart and to love your neigbhor as yourself"". He didn't have anything to gain. Infact, he gave everything for his message. Muhammad and JS gained many worldy pleasures for what they did.

I also think that something that isolates Christianity from other religions is it is the only religion that teaches salvation by faith as opposed to salvation by works. Whether it be Mormonism or Buddhism, every other religion except Christianity teaches that to reach God or heaven or Nirvana you must be a good person. You must do good things. Christianity teaches that no number of good deeds will get you into heaven, only through faith in Jesus Christ will you get into heaven. Only through putting your trust in him.

Joseph Smith:  No.

He married them because he had to teach his religion to women by using his wifes. Many of his teachings and principals (called sunnah) was firstly learnt and spreaded by this women.

I care not one whit whether you are in fact Christian or of any other faith - you have made three statements in your original post that are worthy of rebuttal. 

In paragraph 1 you state:
""The basis for intelligent Christian thought is the belief in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, as recorded in the gospels, which form a historical (rather than mystical) basis. I do not appreciate those who represent Christianity as an arbitrary blind belief, either by those who believe it or those who do not.""

More succinctly, _you_ state that Christianity is not a blind belief because _Christians_ _believe_ it is rooted in history. I hope it is clear that this is a patently absurd statement to make. The belief in the historical reality of the gospels is but a plaster on a wooden leg, a convenient but hollow excuse to make it acceptable to believe - but it is still a circular reasoning, because the historical reality of the gospels is far from being accepted in mainstream science.

Id say the problem that freenet, the most notorious example,  had with this was caused by several factors:

1. Its performance was so terrible that only those doing the most elicit things bothered to stick around.
2. The size of these files, usually small pictures, was optimal for freenet. There just aren't that many 200k files out there these days.
3. There was a culture that celebrated the idea of being totally freed from all censorship. By human nature, this intrigued many people who then began, out of curiosity, to test the limits and see if such a thing is really possible.

I2P (by itself), on the other hand, can be very poor for one to many distribution of dangerous content over a long period of time. A simple attack would be incrementally DOS or otherwise interrupt known blocks of suspected ip addresses and watching for the server in question to go offline in I2P. This will be effectively solved by layering a DHT system, perhaps freenet, on top of a mixnet like I2P.. but I digress. 

All in all, I think the most advanced p2p networks have contributed very little to the spread of cp. I'm against it as much as the next guy, but this age old argument has been proving untrue.

1. GIL doesn't matter on unithread systems whatsoever (the vast majority of systems fall into this category). Therefore, since thread concurrency isn't used in most systems there must be another reason. What reason? Threads are a concurrency abstraction. No, let me modify that: A good concurrency abstraction. Especially when waiting for IO, threads are an elegant solution (granted not the only).

2. The GIL is not a feature of Python. Stackless, as I pointed out, doesn't even have the GIL. The GIL is an implementation feature. In other words, get a new VM without the GIL and you don't have to worry about it. Currently there are 3 major implementations of pyhton without the GIL: Stackless, IronPython and Jython.

I think what Griffiths and Tenebaum really show is that peoples' mental models, learning, and decision making appear to make use of Bayesian computations (or structured mental representations that bear some likeness to bayesian networks).  This isn't terribly surprising: to the extent that conditional probabilities accurately describe the world and to the extent that one believes the mind is well-adapted to understand and reason about the world, there *should* be a link between the math and the cognition.",1136991703

The silver bullet is the application of individual differences in programmers to hiring. The fact that there are huge individual differences in programmer productivity was discovered (or, rather, well-documented) in the late 60's.

Second, looks like you're also bringing in the god=absolute morality thing, which I have trouble with.

I see four possibilities:

God exists, and there is such a thing as absolute morality,

God exists, and there is no such thing as absolute morality,

God doesn't exist, and there is such a thing as absolute morality.

God doesn't exist, and there is no such thing as absolute morality.

You seem to claim that only the first and last options are possible.

ie, that morality is simply whatever god says to do. But then I could say ""what obligates me to do what god says?""

ie, you have to assume some sort of absolute morality anyways that implies a concept of doing what god says being a Good Thing(tm).

But then, it no longer seems unreasonable that lack of a god would directly imply lack of an absolute morality.

For Islam, the burden is upon Mohammed to explain how the phenomena of Christianity that progressed over the centuries and existed in his day was in complete error on so fundamental an issue.  There was an established body of Christian doctrine, Christian institutions, gospel fragements, copies of Christian scripture meticulously maintained, and writings of early church fathers which all apparently made this error.

"reddit.com","t5_6","That would not be the science that I am familiar with. 

Firstly, no _belief_ is needed to be convinced that there is no whispy dragon in the garage. We do not need belief to bridge a gap in our knowledge here - just our common-sense understanding of the world is enough. We go into that garage many times a week and never see a dragon, we know nobody has in fact ever seen one in the wild, let alone in his garage, etc. We have NO positive proof. But we do have an overwhelming amount of negative proof: it would run against all our other knowledge of the world to have a whispy dragon in the garage. Thus, I can safely and scientifically say that there is no dragon in the garage.

'Ah, but there might be one NOW!', you might say. There might be, but what are the odds? I would have to say that the odds are approximately equal to the existence of a bad-breadthed bogeyman under your bed. You made it up, it has no basis in reality.

So until you show me some whispy dragon excrement or a nice picture of it sleeping in the corner, I will 'believe' (I think 'be convinced of' is a better expression) in the non-existence of whispy dragons in the garage.

The exact same applies to God (in the theistic sense). To remain on the fence, I think, shows not an adherence to science, but rather shows you haven't really thought it through.

"reddit.com","t5_6","here's the press release:

Following the success of our digital line-up over the last seven years, which has resulted in more than 95% of Nikonâs UK business being within the digital area, Nikon Corporation has made the decision to focus management resources on digital cameras in place of film cameras. This decision will allow Nikon to continue to develop products that match the demands of an increasingly competitive market place.


Despite this growing competition Nikon Corporation has continued to outperform the market, and has recently reported positive financial results which saw group net profit climb by 20% in the fiscal first half which ended in September. Group sales also increased by 9.8% to 342.85 billion yen in the same period. Sales of high end digital SLR cameras and the success of products like the D70s and D50 have helped contribute to these positive figures.


As the film camera market shrinks and the popularity of compact digital cameras increases, demand for products that offer advanced features and extra value is continuing to grow. High performance digital SLR cameras are performing well as users shift from film-based SLR cameras or upgrade from compact digital cameras to digital SLR cameras.


As a result of the new strategy Nikon will discontinue production of all lenses for large format cameras and enlarging lenses with sales of these products ceasing as soon as they run out of stock. This also applies to most of our film camera bodies, interchangeable manual focus lenses and related accessories. Although Nikon anticipates that the products will still be in retail distribution up to Summer 2006.


In recognition of Nikonâs commitment to professional photographers we will continue to manufacturer and sell the F6, our flagship film model, as well as a number of manual interchangeable lenses. Sales of the manual FM10 will also continue outside Europe.

So he said, ""Suppose that over the course of a few weeks this spring, groups of physicists working at different universities successfully prove that the universe was created by a group of superintelligent entities that the press has taken to calling 'The Big Bangers'.  Astronomical work to identify instances of their intervention in the movements of certain star clusters is proceeding rapidly, and some researchers have begun to speculate about the possibility of talking to them.  Now suppose that you've been out hiking on the Appalachian Trail for the last two months, so you learn about this all at once when you stop for gas on the drive home.  How does all this make you feel?""


The story illustrates a couple of points:
* ""Belief in God"" is not inherently unscientific.  It is unsupported by everything we know, but the existence of an agentive, purposeful creator of the universe hasn't been *disproven* either.
* As a corollary, there are some elements of faith in atheism, but you need a pretty far-fetched example to shake that faith.
* It's **not** correct to say that religion and science are about two different things (the truth-belief dichotomy), because people won't place their faith in something they know to be untrue.  Monotheists in our story would be in for an interesting ride.
* It **is** correct that knowledge can be put to use in different ways, and that most people are interested in scientific knowledge in only a very cursory way.  A devout Lutheran real-estate developer in Minnesota, for example, might find ways to reconcile the polytheistic revelation with his faith (""No God before me"" =&gt; existence of other Gods), and go on living the same way as before.  He'd be able to do this because his fundamental place in the world wouldn't have changed much.  A lapsed Hindu physicist, on the other hand, would have her professional *and* personal worlds turned upside down.  Besides the implications for physics, she might feel the need to make all kinds of changes to her life after thinking about what it all means, despite the fact that she already ""knows"", as a Hindu, that the Universe is basically ageless and is populated by many Gods   (my apologies to any Hindus out there if I've gotten this all wrong).",1137046531

Q: You've kindly made Xtend available for download, but will it work on my Win2K SP4 box with .Net2?
A: I think so, I haven't tried so I can't be sure but it should work.

Q: Will it have a significant cost in terms of overall performance?
A: Not really, it is essentially just a database of URLS and links between URLS, i.e. it is quite simple under the hood.

Q: If I install it, will it destroy my current folder hierarchy?
A: No, it is very unobtrusive.

Q: I assume that files are still saved in a folder somewhere ""under the hood"" as it were. Will they still be accessible without using the Xtend interface? 
A: Yes you can get hold of all the files you create directly in XTend or Move to XTend as your repository is simply a folder with a lots of subfolders containing the actual files. If you are worried you can LINK your documents with XTend instead of moving them and they will stay in the same place as where you created them.

Q: Does Xtend replace Explorer completely or just the Search tool?
A: Ideally you use it instead of Explorer when working with documents, but it doesn't completely replace Explorer for things like working with System files.

Q: ...It's a shame this product was so ahead of it's time...perhaps if you open-sourced it and put it on Sourceforge, more people would use it and development could continue.

While I'm glad someone tried summarizing it, I really doubt anyone will gain a lot of benefit from reading that outline. The original fills page after page with examples. Examples illustrate why you should never criticize, always listen to people and keep your mouth shut when they are talking. From examples you realize that every moment you listen to that person, even if they are blathering on about nonsense, you are gaining thier trust.

People tend to retain far more from anecdotal examples than bullet points. Even if the bullet points are spot on accurate summaries, brains don't remember that stuff. They remember the stories behind them. Stories build bridges between the reality I live in, and those bullet points.

I read the book. After hundreds of pages of examples, I could see that getting people to act is an art I could master with practice. With this mastery comes the ability to accomplish incredible things.

The outlines while I'm sure they give a person a leg up, fall woefully short of the grand theme of understanding people. It's that theme that made the book the amazing piece of research and explanation that it was.

I remember when Norton was the name associated with quality products and quality people.  Do you really have to stoop so low as to attack an open source competitor in such an underhanded way?  Symantec is a big company, with lots of money and talent but it appears that you are too lazy to compete head on with a more nimble competitor.

You should use the âchildâ rule to determine if what you are doing is unethical.  Tell your child that you want to lie to your customers so you can get ahead, make more money or just feel like a mover and shaker.  Then ask them if they think it is the right thing to do.  If your child say â âUck that is mean daddyâ, then you know you should not do it.  

I suggest this approach because it is apparent that you do not know what is ethical behavior.

* There is no evidence supporting the existence of the IPU
* There is no evidence for the existence of the IPU

One could then make an argument, based on ""Do not proliferate entities unnecessarily"", that belief in the IPU is unjustified. However, this is not called evidence. This is a philosophical argument, not scientific evidence *per se*. Note that to make this argument, one must also argue that the IPU is an ""unnecessary"" entity.

"reddit.com","t5_6","There are several caveats to this paper. First, methane is a minor greenhouse gas compared with CO2. Second, the authors do not claim at all that the methane content of the atmosphere needs to be revised. They simply found that living plants produce methane, by cultivating plants under a bell jar and irradiating them to preclude the possibility of bacteria contaminating the measurement. The political aim here, if there is one, is rather to undermine the notion of planting trees to act as a carbon sink.

Finally, it is interesting that 'Levels of methane were ""very temperature sensitive,"" with concentrations approximately doubling with every 10 degrees centigrade rise in temperature in a range between 30 degrees centigrade and 70 degrees centigrade'. If that's the case, increased production of methane might be caused by global warming.",1137096460

From that page (other sources agree with it):
*Methane is the second largest contributor to global warming. It is a very effective greenhouse gas, 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years. Methane is a large contributor to global warming, second only to carbon dioxide. Its atmospheric concentration is 1.7 ppmv, much less than carbon dioxide; but each molecule of methane is twenty times more effective than each molecule of carbon dioxide at trapping infrared radiation (Mackenzie and Mackenzie, 1995). Its large contribution to global warming is due in part to its potency in trapping heat in the earth's atmosphere. It is 20 to 60 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the next 100 years. Emissions of methane have grown dramatically; methane emissions from human-related activities now represent about 70% of total emissions, as opposed to less than 10% some 200 years ago.*

I'll preface my comment by saying that I don't necessarily think that ID should be taught in schools. However, the whole **separation of church and state** thing is so misused that its getting tiring.

""Separation of church and state"" originates from a letter that Thomas Jefferson wrote to a collection of Baptist ministers promising that the US government would never enact any kind of ruling that would restrict the free practice of religion in any way.

There is nothing Constitutionally or otherwise that says that Christianity or any other religion cannot be involved in the government in some way. Infact, democracy implies quite the opposite: rule by the people, and if the majority of people follow one religion, it follows that governmental decisions will likely be influenced by that religion.

This is not an issue of church and state. This is an issue of science and teaching science, and I personally have yet to see really strong science that supports creationism, although I have come across many interesting things in the past few years.

I personally don't think it matters. Whether evolution is true or not, I still think it is God who did the creating. I do not think that ID needs to be taught in school unless it is taught in a scientific manner. ID can be taught in the approach of, yes, there is evidence for evolution, but there is also strong evidence that the complexity of life and the ridiculous amount of ""coincidences"" make it highly improbably that this all happened by accident.

However, it shouldn't be a matter of popping out the Bible and saying, ""Okay, kids, this is what ID is"", because that isn't the point of school.

No there isn't.  There is no serious doubt among scientists that evolution, driven by natural selection (which is anything but 'random' or 'accidental'), mutation, and genetic drift, is able to produce complex life.  This ""life is too complex"" argument was long ago dismissed and discredited, but keeps getting dredged up by creationists and others who are simply ignorant of the available evidence.  If you want to believe that God created the Universe and occasionally intervened in evolution to achieve a desired result (whether it be humans, mosquitoes, or bubonic plague), fine - science can neither prove or disprove such occasional meddling - but don't call it science.  ID is inherently unscientific (it isn't testable), and thus cannot truly be taught in a scientific manner.

There has been so much that is willfully made up and lied about to support either view that I don't really know who to believe. A few years back I was reading a book about evolution and the explanation that was given as to how dinosaurs led to birds was that certain dinosaurs started jumping from tree to tree, and slowly their scales would become feathered from this. Eventually that led to the development of feathers. I'm sorry, but that is downright the most retarded thing I've ever heard in my life. No matter how much I take a lizard and feather his scales, its offspring aren't going to slowly develop feathers. That just doesn't happen. I don't know if it was just a bad explanation, but it doesn't take a biologist to realize that many explanations given for both evolution and creation are inherently flawed.

--- pp. 51-52:
âIf a particular amino acid sequence was selected by chance, how rare an event would this be?
âThis is an easy exercise in combinatorials.  Suppose the chain is about two hundred amino acids long; this is, if anything rather less than the average length of proteins of all types.  Since we have just twenty possibilities at each place, the number of possibilities is twenty multiplied by itself some two hundred times.  This is conveniently written 20200 and is approximately equal to 10260, that is, a one followed by 260 zeros.
âMoreover, we have only considered a polypeptide chain of rather modest length.  Had we considered longer ones as well, the figure would have been even more immense.  The great majority of sequences can never have been synthesized at all, at any time.â

p. 88:
âAn honest man, armed with all the knowledge available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.  ...The plain fact is that the time available was too long, the many microenvironments on the earthâs surface too diverse, the various chemical possibilities too numerous and our own knowledge and imagination too feeble to allow us to be able to unravel exactly how it might or might not have happened such a long time ago, especially as we have no experimental evidence from that era to check our ideas against.â ---

Also, maybe I am interpreting this differently than you, but I understand that to mean that Congress will not respect the *establishment* of one particular religion (ie, the Anglican Church of England).

"reddit.com","t5_6","Argument for dynamic typing.

My reaction? Yes and no.

It is convenience at low cost in terms of errors and bloating we are actually talking about.

It's true that a fairly good coder will get further quicker with Python and I like the language, but I've already run into enough run-time trouble (like accidentally truncing floats by adding them to integer variables, and having a library's incompatible string types that I needed to always cast to str() anyway), and testing will only take you only so much beyond simple bordercases. And yes, neither testing or strong typing is ideal, but I don't like not actually writing types in what is acually a typed language - imagine having to type 'int' in Python. would that destroy all its good? And what happened to the complaints about function and especially operator overloading in C++?
That said, I would probably prefer inferential typing like OCaml has. No time wasted, and never ambigious.

Of course, the main point here and in various discussion as of late is 'good programmer'. Clean programmers will often treat variables as if they were statically typed anyhow just because it's more transparent and there's rarely a reason not to. A bad programmer will write spaghetti both ways. You can onyl really argue against a language's syntax when it lures even okay coders into bad code. (often details like perhaps java's exceptions, which invite you to either become extremely verbose, or catch and re-throw exceptions, the latter destroying the useful part of the stack trace, rendering exceptions half-useless)

Frankly, you can say any of this for any abstraction - and, like for most of them, also that you need to know know the rules to break them. For example, I'd say you cannot handle dynamic typing well without understanding typing.",1137175463

In Belgium all schools are government-subsidized (including universities and other higher eduction, by the way - my university education cost me about $400 per year in fees). There are public schools (government-run) and 'free' schools (mostly Catholic, a smaller percentage using alternative education systems like Steiner schools e.a.). 

So all schools are subsidized, but they are not all government run. There's quite a range to choose from - from disciplinarian Catholic schools to anything-goes Steiner-like schools. 

Now, there still are large difference even between government-run schools. The teaching staff has a lot of choice in how to fill in the curriculum. And location makes a difference - e.g. if a kindergarten school is located in an immigrant neighbourhood, the teachers need to spend a lot of effort teaching Dutch to the children that don't speak it at home, which is kind of boring for those that do.

Sarcasm aside, I don't see how what I wrote deserved that response, so I'll clarify a few things in the hope we can have a reasonable conversation:

* I wanted the wording of my reaction to Dawkins's beliefs to convey extreme distaste without any sense of urgency or need for action.  Thus I could suggest, without explicitly stating, my *opinion* that this interview probably embodies the sort of posturing that a public intellectual with a documentary out and a book forthcoming might use to boost his exposure, and therefore not to be taken seriously.

* Am I correct in assuming you think I'm faulting Dawkins for going to Church *too much* to be a credible atheist?  On the contrary, my own experience with church was similar, and I've reached conclusions that are different only in degree.  But I would never claim that twice-yearly church services in my early childhood and halfhearted attempts to read the scripture qualify me to pass judgement on the worldview of a billion other human beings.  I find it surpassingly lame that Dawkins does.

* I'd be happy to prove that I am in fact an atheist.  How do you suggest I do that?

* I spent my college years in Chapel Hill, North Carolina -- a very liberal university town in a very conservative state.  I know a fair bit about ""out there"" stereotyping by the culture at large, though I admit I've never been to Beserkeley.  I can think of several people I knew at UNC who would be physically pained to think that a British scientist studied for two years at an American University and never learned that firing professors for their religious beliefs (or lack thereof) is just not done here.  Would that not be the case at UCB?",1137190109

The reason in USA may be this, but I want to share a different
experience. In Italy education was mostly government monopoly, much more monopoly than it is in the United States. In the past decades
Italian school was at the top of european standards, but now it is no
longer true, for multiple reasons. Social changes (today a lot of people graduates, teachers are no longer selected as they were in the past),
a reform that made the school more like a company: now school managers
tend to lower the level of the school so kids will select this simpler school
instead of an hard one: more kids, more money. Also in the past it was
possible to selectively reject a kid for math, or latin, now you can
either pass or be rejected for the whole year.

Another counter-example of this may be Cuba: schools are a
government monopoly there but education level is high compared
to other more freedom countries speding a similar amount of money

"reddit.com","t5_6","Recently, an Indiana State Rep. suggested paying teachers based on their class state test results... Think about this: schools in impovrished areas have lower test scores than areas where the wealthier/higher class live. Can you imagine how quickly good teachers would flock to those ""better"" areas, away from the kids who have lower test scores (and teachers actually get parental support)? To me, this idea is the same logic that Stossel uses.

The main point: IT IS NOT THE TEACHERS THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Yes, we all had several teachers that were idiots, but if you look at the system you need to realize that teachers are constrained by ADMIN, parents, government, the unions and other fellow teachers. Good teachers can't teach anymore because the methods that work aren't PC anymore.

My wife is a teacher and spends 75% of her time disciplining kids whose parents never taught them discipline. She has to act like a lawyer and gather enough evidence to prove the she did not ""make up"" allegations of misbehavior, otherwise the parents go nuts (my kid can never do wrong-syndrome) and she gets in big trouble (which then necessitates the union's existence to back her up, which should be ADMIN's job, but they're too scared of not being PC enough in front of the parents, who do not have to account to anyone).

Blaming the teacher is just finding a scapegoat and not addressing the real issues, or at least understanding that it's a lot more complex than bad teachers or ""no child left behind.""

This is pretty obvious.  It won't happen in 2006, but it will definately happen.  I think it is likely that that ""desktop operating system"" will become irrelevent; just a platform on which to run the web browser.  Most people will stop buying Windows and Mac OS and will instead switch to free OS's provided by Google, Sun, and eventually Microsoft. 

&gt; 12) Intel is spending $2 billion to re-brand itself as a consumer electronics company because the future is in being cheaper, not faster. The next big consumer market will be a network computing appliance. When it hits anyone's processor can be used and Intel will be$2 billion behind.

I don't know if Intel is wasting its money or not.  I believe that the next big consumer market is the handheld network computing appliance.  First, America has to discover that cellphones are for more than just talking - they're for using the Internet.

Here's my prediction for 2006 (or what I think would be cool, even if it is highly unlikely):
  Handheld computer makers, like blackberry, palm, handspring, and cellphone manufacturers, will FINALLY put chorded keyboards on their devices.  Kids and power users will be the first to adopt the new typing style, and everybody else will slowly catch on over several years.  Maybe in 2008 we'll see handhelds that have no buttons but are operated by touch-screens and chorded keys on the periphery of the device.

Second prediction: American cellphone companies will completely miss this innovation and will continue to offer poor cellphones with horrible software.

1. Mr. Edmundson might have 5 students in the 50 who care deeply about Friday. Maybe 10; more would require the admissions office at U.Va. to have mastered time travel. He has almost as many who've transferred in at the last minute because of schedule conflicts, and a broad middle bunch in to fulfill a requirement and get a grade. For about 80% of the class, then, Mr. Edmundson is the keeper of one of about 40 gates they must pass through to get that degree.

2. Let's imagine two students, Jim Bored and Jane Engaged. Jim cares not for Freud, but he needs the credits toward his degree, which in turn he needs because he wishes to go to law school. Indifferent though he is to Freud, he does the reading, does the writing, at semester's end can give a lucid account of Thanatos, Eros, Oedipus, and the psychopathology of everyday life. Jane, heaven help her, wants to go to grad school in the humanities, and someone has suggested the class to her. She does the reading, and quickly comes to agree with Karl Kraus that psychoanalysis is a disease masquerading as a cure. She bags the class, and spends the time it would have taken in reading Kraus, on to Von Hoffmanstal, Musil, etc., etc., really engaged intellectually. Mr. Edmundson will I suppose have no option but to give her an F, unless U.Va. has provision for long-term Incompletes.

So now Jim will get his B.A., and Jane perhaps not. Whatever they know about Freud, kids who get into U.Va. understand the degree/no-degree distinction in their bones.

_Chatterjee added that the public image of Mother Teresa as a ""helper of the poor"" was misleading, and that only a few hundred people are served by even the largest of the homes._

_Many of Teresa's donors were evidently under the impression that their money was being used to build hospitals. In 1991, Dr. Robin Fox, then editor of the British medical journal The Lancet, visited the Home for Dying Destitutes in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and described the medical care the patients received as ""haphazard"". He observed that sisters and volunteers, some of whom had no medical knowledge, had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors in the hospice. Dr. Fox specifically held Teresa responsible for conditions in this home, and observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment._

_Fox conceded that the regimen he observed included cleanliness, the tending of wounds and sores, and kindness, but he noted that the sisters' approach to managing pain was ""disturbingly lacking""._",1137264482

I know what it is like. I worked as a missionary down in the slums of South Dallas last summer.

Sometimes you don't have enough money to help someone. Sometimes people use you just to continue with their addictions. But you try. And that's all you really can do.

The church I worked at was poor, and when I say poor, I mean poor. It wasn't any megachurch with seating for 40,000, it was a single-room building with seating for maybe 75. But this little church had managed to rent out an apartment complex across the street, renovate it, and was now serving homeless people food every other day. They provided medical care to prostitutes and crack addicts. Sometimes I wonder what some of those people would do if that church wasn't there. And the pastor? I think that man worked about 15 hours a day. I promise you he wasn't getting a lot of money for doing it. But he loved people, and he is still currently giving up his life to help others.

_Okay, so Theresa had to make difficult decisions about medical care because they didn't have enough doctors. Is that a fault of her own?_

Yes. The order received hundreds of millions of dollars, but chose _not_ to use it to alleviate the suffering of the poor.

Mother Theresa's mission was a _religious_ one, and despite being probably the richtest religious order in the world (to the tune of probably $100 million in donations per year), despite this money being given by donors to alleviate the suffering of the poor, the poor were helped little at all, and the donors were cheated (with the money probably going to the Vatican, not to the poor).

I'll just point to this translation of an article in the German magazine 'Stern':

http://are.berkeley.edu/~atanu/Writing/teresa.html

_All this points to one thing, something that Mother Teresa reiterated very frequently in her speeches and addresses -- that she far more concerened with life after death than the mortal life._

_Mother Teresa's business was : Money for a good conscience. The donors benefitted the most from this. The poor hardly. Whosoever believed that Mother Teresa wanted to cahnge the world, eliminate suffering or fight poverty, simply wanted to believe it for their own sakes. Such people did not listen to her. To be poor, to suffer was a goal, almost an ambition or an achievement for her and she imposed this goal upon those under her wings; her actual ordained goal was the hereafter._

_With growing fame, the founder of the order became somewhat conscious of the misconceptioons on which the Mother Teresa phenomenon was based. She wrote a few words and hung them outside Mother House:_

_""Tell them we are not here for work, we are here for Jesus. We are religious above all else. We are not social workers, not teachers, not doctors. We are nuns.""_

Christianity, a most familiar case study, has a messiah who is the ultimate pacifist. There is no ambiguity with the avatar who taught his followers to offer the other cheek to the transgressor. An eight-year-old should be able to pick up on that one, but apparently century after century of kings and dictators were unable to grasp it, even while they proclaimed to carry Christ's banners.

This isn't a thing of the past either. I'm assuming you've read the new testament pretty well.

Admittedly, he could be one of a few misguided souls, but if that's the case, how come the organized political wing of the Christian Right supports him so staunchly, and church goers overwhelmingly voted for him?

Granted, during my 12 years of Catholic schooling I did not pay a great deal of attention, but when the 'next life' is forever, and you really, _really_ believe this is true, as Mother Theresa did, then the pain and suffering in this life are of less importance, and probably beneficial to the soul. Her actions (or inaction) are logical seen from her belief in the afterlife. From a non-believer's point of view, her order has squandered a great opportunity to help the weak and alleviate the pain of the suffering, and has sucked up a great deal of money that was intended to be used in such a way.

I wasn't talking about _their_ lives (i.e. ""The Missionaries of Charity""), I was talking about the lives of the ones that turned to them for help.

You have misinterpreted what I wrote, so I will try to explain myself again. Mother Theresa's driving force was her belief, which led her not to take the actions that a humanistic western world would have expected her to take, but led her to care more for the souls than for the bodies of those in her care. In the logic of the true believer, it is more important to save a soul from eternal damnation than it is to cure their tuberculosis - in fact a bit of suffering is good for the soul. Baptising is more important than sterilizing needles. That is the inescapable logic if you truly believe in the afterlife. This was the belief of Mother Theresa. And the Catholic church agrees, since Mother Theresa is well on her way to sainthood (she has already been beatified).

"reddit.com","t5_6","Grade Point Average

For every class that a student completes, a number of points are earned.  The number of points is given by the following equation:

Points = (# credit hours) x (grade points)

Where the credit hours roughly corresponds to the number of hours that the class meets per week.  In American universities and colleges, students can expect that for every hour spent in the classroom, 2-3 hours will be necessary outside the classroom for homework and studying.  In one semester, the typical student takes 3-5 classes, for a total of about 15 credit hours.  A 12 credit hour schedule is considered 'full-time' and earns eligibility for financial aid.

Grade points are assigned by a grading scale.  The most common scale is the 4.0 scale, where A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0.  Most schools do not use 'E'.  Anything below a 'D' is considered failing, and receives 'F'.

My Software Engineering class meets three times a week, MWF, from 12 to 12:50.  This is 2.5 hours of actual time in class, but the class is for 3 credit hours.  If I receive an 'A' in the class, I will get 3x4 = 12 points.

The Grade Point Average is calculated from all classes for which the student has received grade points:

GPA = SUM(grade points) / SUM(credit hours)

The semester GPA includes classes taken in a particular semester.  The 'cumulative' GPA includes all classes that the student has taken in university.

A student must earn only 'A's to get a 4.0 GPA.  A student who receives an equal number of 'A's as 'B's will have a GPA around 3.50.  Each grade's contribution to the GPA is weighted by the class's number of credit hours.  This means that a 4 hour class has more affect on your GPA than a 3 hour class.

Let's take a hypothetical student, called Joe.  Joe has just begun his third year in university (he's a Junior).  He has already taken 56 credit hours of classes, for which he has earned 191 grade points.

Joe's current cumulative GPA = 191 / 56 = 3.41

This indicates that Joe receives roughly equal numbers of 'A's and 'B's.  Or for every 'C' that Joe receives, he earns three 'A's to make up for it.  Now let's look at Joe's schedule for this semester:

3 credits Software Design

3 credits Linear Algebra

3 credits Intermediate Japanese I

4 credits Physics II

3 credits Introduction to Sociology
--
16 credits total

Let's pretend that it is the end of the semester and Joe is expecting to receive an 'A' in Linear Algebra, a 'B' in Software Design, and an 'A' in Japanese.  His grades for Physics and Sociology are hovering between 'A's and 'B's.  These two classes have pending assignments that will swing the grades to 'A' or to 'B'.  Joe is a pretty good student but he didn't manage his time very well and now doesn't have enough time to do an excellent job on both assignments.  Should Joe choose to earn an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology, or vice versa?  The merits of the two subjects aside, let's look at the effect on his GPA.  An 'A' in Physics will earn 16 grade points while an 'A' in Sociology would earn 12.  A 'B' in Physics earns 12 grade points, while a 'B' in Sociology earns 9.  He's anticipating these grade points:

191 points (previously earned)

9 points for a 'B' in Software Design (3 hr)

12 points for an 'A' in Linear Algebra (3 hr)

12 points for an 'A' in Intermediate Japanese I (3 hr)

16 or 12 points for Physics II (4 hr)

12 or 9 points for Introduction to Sociology (3 hr)

When the semester is finished, he will have 56+16=72 hours of earned credit.  If he gets an 'A' in Physics and a 'B' in Sociology then he will earn 58 grade points.  If he goes for an 'B' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology then he will get 57 grade points.  How will this affect his cumulative GPA?

Cumulative GPA = (191+58)/72 = 249/72 = 3.458 = 3.46

Cumulative GPA = (191+57)/72 = 248/72 = 3.444 = 3.44

Joe perceives himself to be in the interval between 3.0 and 4.0, so the choice appears to have a bearing of 2% on his cumulative GPA!  This is flawed reasoning that snares many students.  Joe must remember that he will have earned about 130 credit hours when he graduates.  If his GPA is 3.5 then he will have 455 grade points.  His choice between an 'A' in Physics and an 'A' in Sociology accounts for only 1/455 or 0.2% of his final GPA.

The typical engineering student spends at least 3 years thinking about his GPA.  Students who begin thinking about their GPA after their first year of study will probably graduate in 4 years.  Engineering students who take 2 years to realize their academic peril usually require 5 years to graduate.

The GPA is our slave master.  Students with more than 3.5 feel that every grade less than an 'A' is a black mark on their transcript because it brings their GPA down.  They work so hard for their grades and give up social activities to spend more time studying.

In my opinion, the comfortable region is between 3.1 and 3.5.  Students in this region are earning 'A's and 'B's and can afford to get a 'C' in a class that is very boring.  These students may be just as smart as the &gt;3.5 students, but they make different choices.  Some of them would be &gt;3.5 but they have to work and don't have much time to study.

The biggest injustice of the GPA system is that everyone looks at the cumulative GPA, which represents the student's entire undergraduate career.  Students who have difficulty adjusting to life at university often earn poor grades in their first and second years.  These poor grades mar the GPA and make significant improvement impossible.  Even if a student consistently earns 3.75 in each subsequent semester, the cumulative GPA can remain very low.  Most graduate school programs have minimum cumulative GPA requirements.  Many employers look only at the cumulative GPA when evaluating a new graduate's academic performance.  The knowledge of this can evince an enormous amount of stress for the struggling first or second year student.

In my opinion, schools should calculate a 2-year GPA rather than a cumulative GPA.  At least, employers and graduate schools should request the semester GPAs for the final 4 semesters of a student's undergraduate studies.  These scores will show any improvement in the student's performance that may be hidden in a cumulative GPA.",1137295936
"reddit.com","t5_6","""I agree with everything except your last line. You really thing the solution is to kick people out of college? I keep running into this elitism thats starting to bug me.""

Actually, I think he's dead-on. He's not talking about ""kicking people out"" of college, and it's not elitism. The only reason it *seems* like elitism is because our culture has an irrational obsession with college education. A university degree used to be a special thing that only a certain percentage of people -- a certain number of professions -- really had any need for. Now it is seen as the bare minimum requirement for anything other than a minimum-wage service job. And the sad truth is that, in many cases, a person's degree has little or nothing to do with the profession they end up in; and even if it does, the reality of that profession is often wildly different from what they learned in school. Result: they (or, more likely, their parents) blew tens of thousands of dollars for a piece of paper in order to gain entry to a job that they would have been no less qualified for without a day of college.

We don't need to kick people out of college (unless they're failing, of course), but we -- as parents, employers, companies, and a society -- do need to stop indoctrinating our children with the notion that college is the One True Path for Success. There are plenty of people who need a higher education for what they want to do with their lives, and plenty of people who can benefit from it in general. There are also plenty of people who have no need for it, or at least don't need to jump into it right out of high school. We are drastically misusing our universities, and the results are not the least bit surprising.",1137296055

"reddit.com","t5_6","First time I heard Nazis described as socialists. One of Orwell's big objections to Soviet Russia was that it was perceived as socialist when it was nothing of the kind. He saw Stalinism as equivalent to any other form of fascism which made him unpopular with certain elements of the left (and the UK government who tried to block publication when Russia was an ally). As far as I understand he didn't turn on his socialist views at all, rather ironic that the book jacket should say that he did.

""Because of the obvious anti-communism in Nineteen Eighty-Four, the book was a great success in the USA where McCarthyism had just reared its head. It was overlooked, however, that Orwell in the book says that all ideologies in the mid-twentieth century were authoritarian. Because Nineteen Eighty-Four was misinterpreted and in some cases misused, Orwell wrote in 1949: 

My recent novel is NOT intended as an attack on Socialism or on the British Labour Party (of which I am a supporter) but as a show-up of the perversions to which a centralized economy is liable and which have already been partly realized in communism and Fascism. I do not believe that the kind of society I describe necessarily will arrive, but I believe (allowing of course for the fact that the book is a satire) that something resembling it could arrive. I believe also that totalitarian ideas have taken root in the minds of intellectuals everywhere, and I have tried to draw these ideas out to their logical consequences.""

To me, the threat or use of government force against its citizens is the definition of totalitarianism.  It doesn't matter if the government was democratically elected or seized power - the net result is the same and only varies by degrees.

 ""We have been able to monitor, for the first time, the synthesis of protein at the synapses between neurons as an animal learns, and we found a biochemical pathway that determines if and where this protein synthesis happens. This pathway, called RISC, interacts with RNA at synapses to facilitate the protein synthesis associated with forming a stable memory.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Sriram Krishnan seems to be making a couple different points in his post.

1) CL and Scheme aren't easy to use for commom programming tasks.  There are issues with library availablity and compatability with a specific implementation.  

2) As languages like C# and Python evolve, they will become the inheiritors of the Lisp legacy, and the masses of programmers will finally use Lisp concepts because they already know the rest of the programming language.

As for point #1, I think the Lisp community is more aware of this, and it has become a higher priority.  But there are definitely some big hurdles still to overcome here.  I don't forsee much contraversy on this point.

As for point #2... I don't agree with that at all.  He seems to make the point that learning the advanced concepts of CS like closures, continuations, and FP style are too difficult for the majority of programmers.

So why does he think it will be easier for these programmers to learn and use these concepts when they are wrapped up in a clunky syntax in C# or Python?  If they can't wrap their heads around such concepts, then they can't.  It doesn't matter if it is Scheme, CL, C# or Python.

Here's the thing.  I could get much of the power and expressiveness I get from Lisp with some other language, notably Python or Ruby.  But I don't want to compromise on this, I want all the power!  I want to be able to write code which is as beautiful as I am capable of.",1137358886

Actually, the C#/Java way of closures has its own merits (it tends to be a heck of a lot easier to automate around them as you have nice interface definitions and lots of scope limitations and there is strength in that apparent dumbing down), but that doesn't give you a free pass to call it 'functional programming'.

It's a line of thought I hear about frequently, and people like to believe it and promote it for reasons which often comes across to me as unpleasant. But I think it's the plain woolly thinking behind conclusions like that which makes me so curt when I encounter it.

I could make up all sorts of things if I wanted an analysis to be ""interesting"", but I don't think ""interesting"" would be the right yardstick to use here.

There are many reasons people remove hair, for example no hair in certain places reduces body odor, there are also advantages I won't mention here. Smooth skin does feel nice, but obviously the main reason for a lot of people is aesthetic and many aesthetic principles can be put forward without resorting to children.

But I can also do some amateur pop-psychology analysis that reduces everybody's individual feelings and experiences into one simple sentence yet still sounds kinda plausible as long as you don't think too hard: Men are naturally hairier than women, so more hair is naturally associated with masculinity and less hair with femininity, by removing all hair you can widen that gap and push yourself even further over to the feminine direction. 

Besides, I would say this society is obsessed with the physical attributes of post-pubescence, not pre.

I'm a guy. While I'd heard about cyclists I'd never thought about guys getting their legs etc done, and wouldn't have seen the point if I did, then someone persuaded me to try it and, well, I'm never going back to hairy.

"reddit.com","t5_6","The slashdotter's appreciation of the difference in value systems is right on, though his subtle suggestion of rational discourse between the differing sides is not. It's too late. Globalization has pervaded a society that has largely stagnated in economic, social, and governmental evolution (or GROWTH if the term 'evolution' strikes you as too politically incorrect). The consumer goods of the west or their knockoffs have shown up en masse, and satellite dishes with hot chips hang from the balconies of level after level of government built ghettos. They've seen what they don't have, there aren't many promising jobs or even a distant hope of one, and they have religious leaders antagonizing them further by insisting that what intrigues them is the work of the devil. It was nearly enough to make one miss the Christian fundamentalists, but not quite.

On top of that, there was a wounded pride that was shared regardless of religious sect or ethnic difference, which is really something, since you could construct a complex flow chart of who hates who just going by those factors. The Shiites hate the Sunnis, the Sunnis hate the Shiites, and the Kurds see them both as dogs. They all support the Palestinians against the Israelis (anti-semitism might be the one unifying factor I stumbled  across...or anti-Jew might be more apt, 'cause aren't most of the region technically Semitic?), which was ironic, since all of them looked at the Palestinians with a shameful disdain.

The interesting part was how many of them were disgusted with the the religious leaders that scare the west, though  this was voiced in very quite tones indicative of how they scare the locals too. I should dislose that my amateur anthropology was largely confined to college educated english speakers (in most of the area universities, particularly the technical ones, you learn english or you flunk out, since the the courses are taught in english, and the textbooks are western). They were also mostly practicing Muslims, though they reminded me of American Catholics, picking and choosing what aspects of the doctrine they would observe.

I came away from my little foray realizing just how screwed we were. The conflict between the west and the middle east, or near east, or central asia, or whatever the hell you want to label it has so many different converging factors and long building momentum that it seems inevitable. It also seems as if it shouldn't be a suprise. It also appears logical that other parts of the world (particularly Africa) will be following suit in some way as soon as it crawls out of unbelievably destitute poverty to just ridiculously destitute poverty. Envy, religion, oppression, poverty all play a roll. I don't think anyone has a clue as to how to solve it, but I'm sure that any alleviation is a lot more complex than just the application of hard power. I didn't support the justification for Iraq, and war sucks, but damn I hope it works out.

We should notice that we live under a state capitalism, with massive government input. This is in contrast to the state communism of the Soviets.

The reason we don't live in a decentralized capitalism is because it apparently couldn't survive. People tend to point to histories like Polanyi's _The Great Transformation_ in explaining this (though I haven't yet gotten around to reading it). This appears to be a mainstream opinion; you can even read editorials on [The American Conservative](http://www.amconmag.com/2005_03_14/article1.html) pointing this out.

This is why people like [Einstein](http://www.monthlyreview.org/598einst.htm) searched for a kind of command economy with democratic planning.

And the data-directed technique that Lisp users can use, where you enter data in your sourcecode and have that be ""executed.""

The biggest smoking gun I've seen (among many): In the very pro-official-story PBS documentary on the subject, Larry Silverstein, the lease-holder of the whole complex at the time (who took on the lease a year earlier in what an outsider would have called a very bad deal), says that, on 9/11, after building 7 had been burning for a while, they ""MADE THE DECISION TO PULL IT"".  As you can verify for yourself, 'pull' is a construction term for controlled demolition.  Officially the building lost structural integretity (and neatly collapsed into its own footprint at freefall speed).  This is important because there is no earthly way that charges could have been set up to demolish building seven on that day.  It would have taken a week with a non-burning building.  I am not a 'nut'; I am a rational human being.  Any other rational person, who isn't too frightened to examine the evidence closely, will come to the same conclusion.

"reddit.com","t5_6","Athiests are stuck in their belief that everything is 'provable'. The dominant belief is that if it's not measurable, it does not exist.

Unfortunately, humans perception of the world is completely subjective. We have people that we 'love'. How does an atheist measure love?

How do we measure joy? or Happiness?

You can't. But does that mean that those experiences do not exist?
No amount of logic can deny the subjective experience of love.

Devout atheists are like a child that says:
""Prove to me that sugar is sweet, only then will I taste it.""
 The proof of the sweetness is in the mouth not in the sugar. To know it is sweet, you must taste it, there is no other way. Of course, you begin by asking: 
Is it sugar? 
Is it sweet? 
And you accept my assurance until you taste it. Then only all doubts dissolve and your knowledge becomes firsta hand and unshakable. We do not ask you to believe us, just trust us enough to begin. Every step either proves or disproves itself.

we know perfectly well that love exists. we just don't think that love ""exists"" in the same way as (say) we ourselves ""exist"", or the same way as the internet ""exists"", or (fill in the blank) ""exists"". there are many different kinds of ""things"" (objects, concepts, emotions, and so on), which may each ""exist"" in a different fashion.

"reddit.com","t5_6","A clarification: sometimes you hear this argument phrased as if ""the ecomomy"" will magically cause more oil to appear after present supplies are gone, and that's misleading.

In actuality, there's a lot of oil left in the ground that oil drillers never collect because oil drilling is usually only 30% to 70% efficient.  That figure is driven more by the world demand for oil than by limitations in extraction technology.  So as the oil price rises, it's cost-effective to recover more and more oil from existing wells.  This is one reason (taxes are another) why gas prices in the US are much lower than in Europe -- at ~ $35/bbl, lots of oil fields in Texas, Oklahoma, &amp; Louisiana ""turn on"".  

**Some people** take this argument further and say there's nothing to worry about at all, because a world oil price stays above $50/bbl for a few years would make it economical to start going after tar sands in Canada and oil shale deposits in the Rocky Mountains, although the technologies necessary to do this have never been demonstrated at scale.",1137429102

"reddit.com","t5_6","Another thing to keep in mind is that while oil supply may be limited, coal and natural gas reserves are much larger. Estimates are 1,000,000 million short tons recoverable coal and 5,500 million short tons annual demand (natural gas numbers are in a similar ratio). These sources count for 58% of emissions, and 96% of emissions from electricity sectors. Major changes are inevitable in transportation, but oil is not the limiting factor for energy-related emissions. Given that China and India have plenty of coal, limited oil does not imply sufficient reductions in emissions.

I think this is the biggest problem with conspiracy theory. As soon as a theory is denounced as being ludicrous, or irrational, the conspiracy theorists jump back and claim that they know the one true reality and that everything else is a lie. (kind of reminiscent of the intelligent design debate) The conspiracy theorists and the rationalists each find the other's views to be incoprehensible. 

If anything, researching conspiracy theory has taught me the fallacies of holding on to any one, objective reality, as being an absolute truth. A while ago I went, in a few days, from believing conspiracy theories were absurd, to being afraid that one of David Icke's reptoids was going to eat me, or something like that. I still think Icke's theories are brilliant, in the way they incorporate so many other theories and religions into one grand conspiracy, but I think of it more as a novel now than as an absolute truth.

Maybe instead of immediately denouncing any conspiracy theory, or anti-conspiracy-theory as being unobjective and a lie (especially for the 9/11 theories, of which I seem to change my mind every few days), we could simply cite the evidence, and look at it from a real objective, distanced viewpoint.",1137434271

"reddit.com","t5_6","Yes, _incredibly_ hard, I will explain why below, but first I'd like to point out that electricity from a gas station doesn't help solve the problem because the problem here is finding cheap energy, not deciding which form we should turn it into once we have it. I brought up the chicken/egg problem with building the necessary infrastructure because you seemed to think central planning will likely be unnecessary.

But onto how ""incredibly simple"" a charging station at every gas station would be: My 2liter 4-cylinder non-turbo car engine is 130Kw, to put that into perspective a heater (on full) draws about 2Kw and over a year a home averages about 0.5Kw. When I floor it, I am consuming enough power to run 260 houses, this is a small car, especially by American standards.

Now granted, the car is only 130Kw when I floor it, but at a gas station I don't want to wait 3 days for the car to be charged enough to run 7 days. Petrol contains 8.9Kwh/liter, so assuming I want to only wait 10 minutes for the equivalent of a 40 liter tank (10 gallons of gas), that's a 2.1 megawatt source of power the petrol station requires, alongside 2.1 megawatt cabling.

But I don't want to wait an hour for the 6 cars ahead of me to charge, the petrol station should have at least 5 pumps, meaning a 10 megawatt power feed.

Moreover, we have to install this infrastructure in every gas station (or perhaps every 10th station to begin with), and then somehow get that kind of power to them - every gas station in the country is now consuming the equivalent of 7,000 homes (21,000 homes if demand is round the clock).

Now I hear America already has trouble producing enough electricity.

There are also more subtle problems, peak oil will cause a permanent oil shock, the spike (which isn't really a spike, because it won't be coming down) will likely force the economy into recession and with oil initially costing nearly 10 times what it does today (a figure lots of people seem to bandy around, but perhaps it wont be that bad), building new infrastructure becomes prohibitively expensive.

So really, we need to be laying out the alternative fuel infrastructure _now_ while we still have some cheap oil to build it with.

(And I say ""now"" because when America has to dip into the strategic reserve in order to avoid oil shocks because _global_ production can't manage anymore when a few oil rigs in the gulf coast go offline from a hurricane - you know peak oil is right around the corner)",1137490945

"reddit.com","t5_6","hmm, thought I should clarify peak oil since you're talking about when the oil will run out, but the oil runing out is not the problem, and my post won't make sense if you think that's what I mean.

The reason oil is important isn't because our cars run on it (they only account for 20% of it), but because our economy runs on it (the other 80%). In the past, whenever we have grown the economy we have just pumped a little more oil each day to supply it. Peek oil is when we've reached the fastest that we can pump oil, and any economy that wants to grow has to either find another source of cheap energy, or take oil out of someone else's economy. To make matters worse, after peek oil the speed at which we can pump it will start to decline, furthering the gap between supply and demand.

Imagine 50 people in the desert find a tap of water, eventually they figure out the flow is only enough water to keep 47 of them alive - so if they split it evenly they'd all eventually die of thirst. There's plenty of water coming out of the tap (it certainly hasn't run out), just not enough for 50 people. So rather than split it evenly and all die they decide to apply a market model to it. The water was dirt cheap when there was enough (like oil is now), but once there isn't enough (and it's only a tiny fraction not enough), nobody wants to be one of the 3 people that will die, and so they all bid everything they can spare for something that used to cost so little, yet the water isn't anywhere near running out.",1137493217

"reddit.com","t5_6","I gave this one points (because I find the subject very interesting and think others should think about it as well), but I think the author, and perhaps the professor interviewed paint an incomplete picture of the challenges of learning Chinese. 

First, it is *very* important to note that ""Chinese"" is at best an incomplete definition of the languages currently spoken in the people's republic of china and by the diaspora of Han Chinese around the world. Even the separation into Mandarin (Putonghua) and Cantonese (Guangdonghua) doesn't do justice to the variety of spoken Chinese throughout China. 
Whereas Mandarin is the official language of China, based largely on the local language in Beijing, the capitol, Cantonese is spoken in Hong Kong and Guangdong province and traditionally has been the language of the Chinese diaspora, due to the importance of the South-east of China in international trade. That said, there are many different local variants of Chinese, which when spoken are mutually unintelligible. Useful comparisons to the structure of the Chinese languages can be drawn from the relation of the Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, Occitan, etc.) to Latin. [All of these languages share some degree of mutual intelligibility] Another is the case of Arabic, where there are many varieties of spoken Arabic (Iraqi, Morrocan, Egyptian, Syrian, etc.) and literary Arabic, which is common throughout, based on the qur'anic version of Arabic. 

That said, Chinese, like any language is very easy for children to learn how to speak. It is, nonetheless, a difficult writing system to master, even for chinese-born native speakers. [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0824810686] 
For adult foreigners, however, it poses a bit more of a challenge. 
The article points out that writing and tonality are the two main hurdles to overcome. 
I generally agree, however, there are a number of phonemes ( sounds) which simply do not occur in English (insert your local language here), which to occur in Chinese. These pose a challenge as well. 
Tonality is either a huge problem (my father is tone-deaf;I don't believe he could ever become fluent in Chinese) or just takes a lot of discipline/practice (remembering the mapping between sound/tone combinations and meaning; Fortunately context, aids in this process)
The writing system is not so bad, though it requires *a lot* of practice to maintain one's skill. To my surprise, I find it is more similar to Western writing systems, than I ever would have suspected. (In the process of this discovery, I feel I have learned very much about the relation between written and spoken language)
Finally, I find the comment by Dr. Weightman on Grammar at the end particularly misleading. Chinese grammar seems transparent to English speakers, particularly those who have studied a language where modifiers are tacked on to the end of words, to modify tense, declension, etc. (read: Finnish) This is due to the lack of inflection in Chinese - that is changes in word order lead to changes in meaning.

I am not too far along in my study of Chinese language, but I find the difficulty is often over-sold. (except to the tone-deaf, who should never try to learn tonal languages) That's not to say that it is a piece of cake. There are some mental hurdles - tonality, bizzare sounds, a different writing paradigm, and an unfamiliar approach to grammar. Once those are managable at a basic level, I find that dilligence and practice are all that are required.

I disagree. I think that, in a fair world, the blatant deception leading to the Iraq invasion should lead to impeachment (and possibly prison). But Bush's opponents know that there's not enough of a case in that. The wiretapping, OTOH, is not only a blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act -- it's one that Bush has fully admitted to and shown absolutely no remorse or regret for. If anything will bring him down, that will be it.

Where I work it is a daily grind, with pressure from the competition for a product that is not nearly so demonstrably critical.  When paying a little less for a product that might not have all the bells and whistles is a viable option, suddenly you can't empower the employees - the capatilist system means that you are going to have to screw your employees at some stage (a process which starts with skimping on training and ends in Christmas layoffs, vanishing pension plans, etc.)

""Early in the 20th century, the U.S. economy began to dominate the world economy. ""

Well, the US became a major economic player early in the 20th century.  But it wasn't until after WWII that it began to ""dominate"" the world economy.

""The Great Depression, with its preceding inflation from 1921 to 1929...""

Inflation was extremely low during that period, with several years of outright deflation.  See: http://eh.net/hmit/compare/result.php?use%5B%5D=DOLLAR&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPDEFLATION&amp;use%5B%5D=UNSKILLED&amp;use%5B%5D=GDPCP&amp;use%5B%5D=NOMINALGDP&amp;amount2=1&amp;year2=&amp;year_result=1929&amp;amount=1&amp;year_source=1921 and http://inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Rate/HistoricalInflation.aspx?dsInflation_currentPage=6

""It did not enforce the direct payment of taxes like all of its predecessor empires did, but distributed instead its own fiat currency, the U.S. Dollar, to other nations in exchange for goods""

That's not typically how it works.  The US exchanges it's own fiat (actually fiat+fiduciary) dollar to other nations in exchange for their currency (typically, also fiat+fiduciary), which is then exchanged for foriegn goods (and vice versa).

""The increase in dollar holdings of foreigners via persistent U.S. trade deficits..""

Yeah, that happened.  In the 1980s.  What's this doing in a paragraph talking about Lyndon Johnson?

""When in 1970-1971 foreigners demanded payment for their dollars in gold, The U.S. Government defaulted on its payment on August 15, 1971. While the popular spin told the story of âsevering the link between the dollar and goldâ, in reality the denial to pay back in gold was an act of bankruptcy by the U.S. Government. Essentially, the U.S. declared itself an Empire. It had extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the rest of the world, with no intention or ability to return those goods...""

This is exactly backwards.  The US ran significant trade *surpluses* during that period.  In other words, the world extracted an enormous amount of economic goods from the US - in exchange for promises to pay us back with their goods and services later, at interest (aka - debt).  Inflating the currency at that point would have no effect on debts denominated in other currencies, and would actually reduce the return to american holders of foreign debt denominated in dollars.

What Has Government Done to Our Money?
Murray Rothbard

The American dollar is worth nothing.  It has no intrinsic value outside of the paper and ink.  The value of a fiat currency is 100% based on the reputation of the issuing government.  Remember, this is a VERY short experiment.  35 years since the gold window was closed, and inflation has been absolutely astronomical.  It is all related to the increase in dollars being manufactuered by the US Government.  The entire world has had to bend over and take it.  They have had to sit back while the USA waggled its finger at them and made them behave.  The majority has been forced to sit idly by as the USG planted military installations across the globe, and stomped anybody's dick in the dirt that got frisky.

Can a global switch to a Euro for oil system virtually cripple the USG?  Yes.  Yes it can.

The Euro is essentially a piece of shit too, just like all the other fiat currency on the planet.  Nothing to back it up except political bullshit and endless streams of rhetoric.

Erlang makes it very easy to optimize for the special case.  Often a simple solution is best.  If the domain of the function is known in advance a simple optimization can yield high performance without bug-inducing complixity.

factorial(Acc, 50) -&gt; Acc*30414093201...512000000000000;

It seems so obvious, yet it isn't.  Find out where people are going before they get in, so they can be grouped appropriately.

Even in a small building, it seems as if it would help.  Think about this situation:  It's the end of lunchtime in an office building, and a group of 10 coworkers returns, all wanting to go to the 8th floor.  Five others arrive as well, wanting to go to various lower floors.  If the system had their destinations ahead of time, it could direct the 10 people to one elevator, and everyone else to another one, so that the group of 10 wouldn't have to wait for all the other stops.  The 10 people would arrive at their destinations sooner.

"reddit.com","t5_6","From what I read, I suspect two drawing factors:  1) super lightweight threading/coroutines and 2) aesthetic factors.

With regards to 2), well, I like how Ruby looks myself, but I can see people enjoying writing code in this language.  I see some patterns that make me think of JavaScript, which is also a prototype based language, so there's a possible vector for adopters.

But where I'm with you is that the io page does a poor job of articulating what it's strengths are.

Just about the only way it would be the ""next Ruby"" is if it had some killer app which really caught people's eyes. Don't get me wrong, Ruby is an excellent language and I use it over anything else, but the main uniqueness of Ruby was how much its killer app bumped it over many other languages in the public eye. Other languages are very similar to Ruby in other ways.

The main problem I have from Io right now just glancing at it, is I don't think there are many books written on it. Programming languages can be complicated things, and unless the language is well documented (I think part of that is having several books that the public can go out and pick up in order to learn the language), its not only hard to get people knowing about a language, but its also hard to get them to learn it.

This is because the characters hold the core ideas of the language.

Knowledge of the characters is critical for understanding jokes and other subtleties of the language.

The process of learning to communicate in another language involves conversation, reading, writing, and countless hours learning the culture (spending time with native speakers).

For example, it has a massive advantage over ruby/python, it is damn simple to embed and it is very small. One of the main inspiration for Io is Lua, which is somewhat becoming the de facto standard as an extension language (think world of warcraft). 
And it has a somewhat big advantage over most languages by providing actor based concurrency, which is really simple to reason about and is a great boost over dumb shared state concurrency a-la pthread/javathreads.

But most importantly, Io provides macro support, which means you can morph it into whatever language you want but still retain the advantages of the platform, and avoiding a s-exp based environment (which may be considered a bad thing :).

So, I think Io may mostly appeal, at first sight, to people that already hit some wall while working with other similar languages.

At one point, you mention that any job no one really wants to do will go away, much like servants for the rich have mostly dissapeared.  I have a question and a statement for you:

1) Why are people janitors?  There is little to no prestige, it doesn't pay well, and I'm pretty sure most people that do that job aren't there for the love of it.

2) What makes you feel that servants for the rich are gone?  It seems to me that the job has just been a bit more delgated.  Most of the rich people I know personally, people that 100 years ago would have had servants, now have a personal assistant, a maid, a cook, a masage therapist, a haridresser, etc., all of which come to their house to do things for them.",1137558977

Bush had the fortune of coming in after Clinton, who burned out a lot of people on Presidential scandals.  At this point people just expect anything having to do with Bush to be like this situation.  We're in the midst of a period of lowered expectations.  Hopefully we're at or past the middle of it, and not at the beginning.

You can access the AST in Io (and I've had need to do that in Ruby, but you have to resort to ripper or ParseTree which are a bit hackish), multiple VMs can run in the same application, and the actor-based concurrency model sounds interesting.

When you look at the misery these folks create, it is hard to imagine how you could fight the crime and ever be accused of being ""too hard"" on such amoral scum. And to think there's a huge number of them, all working together, to keep the criminal conspiracy going.

This is the sort of situation that makes you think we'd all be better off if the Albanians moved to ""Planet Albania"", and we just remained here in this world.",1138232565

"reddit.com","t5_6","I find his ""I am a mathematician"" approach kind of annoying. IMO, his analogy between learning a new programming language and a new mathematical field is wrong on so many levels. Judging from an earlier post he made today he's still stuck on intro problems in Baby Rudin (introductory real analysis book, used for freshman honours courses at good schools), so I don't think he has the experience yet to accurately make such analogies.",1138751411
