"transformers","t5_2qh5t","If you want to collect the figures, the best tip is: Start with the ones you think look the coolest. You got Siege and Earthrise (Earthrise is the new one but Siege can still be found on shelves) for a G1 style and aesthetic. You got the Studio Series for the Bayformers. Get what YOU like, not what WE like.

As to shows and everything well...there's a lot. A LOT. IMO might as well start with the Netflix War For Cybertron series. Siege is out, 6 episodes, Earthrise is coming soon(?). But 6 episodes is not a big investment of time really. It's enough to see if you want to continue on.

If you do want more, the free streaming app Tubi has nearly every Transformers series you can stream. For free. With ads, but they're not that bad, about a regular TV broadcast worth of ads. Not like some places that put 2 minutes of ads every 2 minutes.

As for comics...don't worry about them right now. Seriously, don't. If you dive off the deep end and try to get every back issue, even in trade paperback form, that's hundreds of dollars of material. Just see if you like the few toys and the few series first. Then find what you like most. Then get comics based off of what you enjoy most. 

Video games are currently a tough nut. No one has the rights (that I'm aware of) for a proper video game. Just phone app crap. Console game wise, the last company lost the rights years ago and no one has taken them since. So they could be hard to find. That said. You can possibly find 3 good ones at Gamestop. The first is Transformers Devastation, for just about every console from the PS3/360 era up. I got mine on PS4. It's very much a love letter to G1. Bit short. But it is not bad.

On the Xbox 360, if you still got one, are two great games. You can't play the multiplayer anymore (sadly), but the storyline is still great. ""War For Cybertron"" and ""Fall of Cybertron"" are their names, and in that order. Fall is the sequel to War. They may have been on PS3 also not sure. Regardless, neither is backwards compatible with the Xbox one or PS4. So, you need the old consoles to play them.

If you want lore, hit up the tfwiki I say. Read some articles. On history, on geography of Cybertron, on whatever. There's some great books that been published over the past few years. Not 'Covenant of Primus' even though it's all lore, it's also all junk. But the ""Allspark Almanacs"" for Animated are amazing for example, as are a few other books. Just go to your favorite book retailer (I like thriftbooks myself) and search up Transformers books. See your options, check in detail on the ones that interest you. Ask us about this or that book if you want.

But seriously: Start with what YOU like, start a bit slow so you don't feel like you wasted (too much) money if you want to get out of it, and enjoy what you enjoy.",1604188803

Find two superstars like simmons and embiid and then trade assets for support to win while on their rookie deals. Sixers did exactly that, just Tobias Harris and horford were not the right pieces and jimmy Butler left them. 

We actually don't know whether hinkie would've pulled it off any better. He was good at acquiring assets but what he did really didn't require any scouting skills or basketball knowledge. His draft record was actually pretty bad but that was the whole point of the process to give you more chances. 

So while hinkie should've gotten the chance to finish it we have no idea if he would've done any better tbh. He never proved he could put together a winning team. Its a lot easier to trade everyone and suck for 3 years then it is to put pieces together for a championship squad.",1604188803

In my view of the world, each human is a unique entity. We can group people into groups along any arbitrary traits. Some groupings will have greater variance in outcome than others. But there are only 7.8 billion people and any grouping will be granular. 

Eg. If you choose to group people be height you find that outcomes are heavily weighted in favour of those over 6 feet (but not too tall) when compared to people under 6 feet tall. 

Reducing this example to ""You're either believe this discrepancy is systemic or you're a Height-Traitor Height Supremacist"" is creating a false dichotomy.",1604188806

FMLA does not guarantee any pay or benefits, just that your job is protected for the 3 months after birth.  The NJFLI provides money for family leave, but no benefits. But I think most districts (mine included) do cover health benefits during the time taken for FMLA. Some districts require that you pay your contribution, but mine did not. So it can vary...my district actually had us meet with the board secretaries who explained everything. That made it easier to understand and talking to my colleagues who also had babies recently helped a lot too. 

I had my daughter in December, so I started my maternity leave in November, had FMLA run from Jan through April, and then took an unpaid child rearing leave of absence for May and June. We switched to my husbands health insurance for May through August since I wanted to avoid paying COBRA.

You're not the the asshole, you're an incredibly sexist one to boot.

Besides, if ""being a Mom"" is her job now, then considering she spent her entire fucking day doing that job already and was now busy doing her *second job*, shouldn't you have been the one to do the parent stuff at that moment??

Find what will truly push you, anger, fear, hopelessness, being hopeful and positive, being a man, or woman of pure will, finding motivation through the positivity of this and other helpful online communities, sheer determination and discipline. 

Use anything, and everything you can. Renaissance periodization has a somewhat recent video on training motivation, and how it‚Äôs not just about being motivated, and it‚Äôs not just discipline, it‚Äôs multi faceted, and your best chance at staying on track and staying as consistent as possible is to use everything at your disposal and be aware of all aspects to keep pushing. 

It might sound silly, but if I am having really low motivation I do a few things. 

1. Putting in some effort, even if I know it‚Äôs a crappy session is good for me, because I stay consistent and don‚Äôt break the good habit I‚Äôve formed. 

2. I think of specific movie moments or documentaries that help motivate me, e.g. Apollo telling Rocky in Rocky III that ‚Äúthere is no tomorrow.‚Äù If you keep putting things off until ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, you‚Äôll lose years before you know it. 

I also like in Westside Versus The World doc, Louie Simmons literally comes out of he hospital after a major surgery and has a hole in his throat, and goes and maxes out. This is obviously extreme and there should be a balance, but Dave Tate talks about it, and it made him realize, there‚Äôs never an excuse good enough to NOT train. I just tell myself, no matter what, no matter how tired I‚Äôm feeling, or lazy, or unmotivated, no matter what I am going to train. Because I know in the long run, it‚Äôs paying off. 

3. Finally, I look at logs and see how much progress I‚Äôve made. And think about moments in my day to day life where things are easier because I‚Äôm at stronger, and in better shape. 

Find whatever motivates you, and know that at times it‚Äôs hard for any one of us. But discipline, and determination help you keep pushing through the hard times. Anyone can train when they feel good. Not everyone when can when they don‚Äôt. 

You can do it, it might take a huge push for now, but after enough time a good habit will form, maybe 5-12 weeks, and you won‚Äôt even think about it, for the most part you‚Äôll just do it. 

You got this.",1604188807

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Ok, I know this will probably get buried, but I just have to say this. Froskyrinn is my favorite caster by far. This is for a couple of reasons. 

Firstly, and this is the low hanging fruit, I think it's incredible that League has maintained a badass woman caster for several years. I know that this isn't exactly merit to her personal accomplishments but for esports (and just general sports) as a whole, she's been an absolute pioneer. Casting sports is an extremely male-dominant profession-- I'm thinking of the ""boys clubs"" that run American sports, or even global sports in general. I'm just really impressed with how Froskyrinn has been able to thrive in this scene, and never seem to be a ""token woman"" by having consistent valuable input to add. Part of why I've gotten more into League as an esport in recent years has been a direct result of her, and respect for Riot to back her up. It definitely offset some of my hesitancy resulting from League's notoriously toxic community.

Now this being said, I've not always appreciated Froskyrinn. About a year ago I got extremely fed up with her blatant unapologetic bias towards the LEC and G2 specifically. As a NA fan, with very little attachment to LEC teams, only ever really watching to keep up with global best teams (I really don't buy into the NA/EU allegiance as the ""West""), I wanted a more objective take-- especially when G2 repeatedly underperform in the regular season. To my astonishment, though, Froskyrinn in this last year has shown what almost NO OTHER analysts or casters have: adaptability. I have routinely looked forward to her inputs because its clear to me that she has recognized her bias being a fault, and toned it back a lot. As of now, she gives extremely objective input with just the right amount of hype.

She was the one who predicted SUN to win, and say what you will, SUN had the harder bracket (decisively beating the tournament favorites TES), and showed greater draft flexibility. Nobody else had the stones to draw attention to that. Of course DWG won the tournament, but I think the series was much closer than most predicted.

Basically I hope Riot re-signs her, I think she has a lot more to offer as a caster.",1604188807

For instance, the elimination of hospitals doing things like cancer screenings has meant that people have had to live with having cancer. It‚Äôs also eliminated other testing and assistance for other health conditions.

So in trying to save people from CoVid, we‚Äôre causing people to suffer from ailments that could kill them and we could be preventing just as much as CoVid.

You also have to consider that suicides have increased as a result of the mental health issues created by CoVid. These are preventable deaths which we‚Äôve let happen.

To be fair, my parents are paying for my school which is why it feels wrong, but I have also accumulated about 30k in investments so far, should be closer to 45k when I graduate. My reasons for fire are around financial stability and supporting my parents towards them being able to retire. I had initially planned to be a bit more relaxed financially senior year after making a good amount from my summer internship and enjoy, but now COVID of course has altered that. Whether it be just going out more senior year or traveling post graduation before starting full time, looks like those plans wont go through now. So I finally have some money at least relative for my age and a good job lined up, but cant really even enjoy senior year the way I had hoped to.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

The hooker set contains all the sparrows basic hooks in 0.025"", with handles.  The other sets don't have handles which might be okay, but might turn him off if it's uncomfortable.

The heavy bars fit the keyway of the sparrows locks best (I think - mine are on the way but the thickest of the flat 5 is a bit sloppy in my cutaway).

Revolver is slightly cheaper than cutaway + reload kit with tweezers.  I would only go with this if you think he'll be able to figure things out without a cutaway.  The other upside to the revolver is he doesn't have to do any repinning to get into the security pins.  Depends on whether you think he'd mind doing the tinkery work of gutting and repinning.

No case is included but you can get the tuxedo case for $8.

c) mike has always given me the creeps

e) nobody that had never heard of AVGN was going to get into the web series from hearing about the movie. For that reason, the movie shouldn‚Äôt have been anything more than a really big budget version of what an episode of AVGN is like.

"toastme","t5_39em5","Ooooh... I didn‚Äôt say depression gets better. I haven‚Äôt ever been diagnosed with depression or anxiety (by a professional, anyway) so I can‚Äôt allude to any experience or knowledge of either - I meant ‚Äòit gets better‚Äô as in general life. I won‚Äôt wang on about it, because I had older people telling me the same things when I was in a similar situation to you and I know it‚Äôs not helpful in the moment - but as I got older it turned out to be true, so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

To be successful in socialising, all I can recommend is practice practice practice. You said you‚Äôre successful in video games - do you play multiplayer ones? Can you join societies or forums for it to look for other gamers who are near enough for you to meet up with? Keep searching and practicing until you start to find people you click with. If you have a rubbish conversation or think you said/did the wrong thing, it‚Äôs a lesson learned. Take it on board, and next time something like that comes up, you‚Äôll know to side-step it. Romantically... I can‚Äôt give you much advice on this as I‚Äôm extremely appalling and evasive when it comes to that side of socialising. I didn‚Äôt have a physical relationship with anyone until I was 25, and I completely recognise that feeling you describe of ‚ÄúBy next year, it will have happened‚Äù - what I do know is it tends to follow on from getting better at the socialising side of things.

As for the last point - stop worrying about being ‚Äúbehind‚Äù everyone else and focus on yourself. It‚Äôs your life - don‚Äôt let comparisons to others take up space in it. I know this is easier said than done, but try. It feels so much better and you get so much further",1604188812

Macron is a democratically chosen leader in a safe country that has the added bonus of being secular. Many countries that are not secular and have islam as a nations religion are in state of political unrest and face long term absence of democracy.

&gt;That‚Äôs the point of polls, it means something.

It doesn't. If I were to ask Shiite and Suni muslims if they condoned the attack, there wouldn't be a number that high. If I were to reach out to salafists, you'd get a number of 25% in youth groups yes. Besides that, polls always have the issue of bias, meaning that people who don't feel strongly about the attack wouldn't bother taking time to answer it. People who are constantly defending these attacks would gladly take the time to fill out a pol to make their voice heard. Also I think your figure is shit ans that you're either lying or misrepresenting data in order to spread hate.

Yes, less than a percent of muslims across the world support these attacks. Once again, I don't think you understand how many muslims this planet has, ans that everyone has their own morals regardless of religion.",1604188812

It designates more of a mode and position of reading, engaging, and undermining the tenets upon which hegemonic sociality rests.  Etc.",1604188813

I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so fun to keep people from dying..  but sometimes when I keep myself or others alive against rogue-types or whatever, I like to imagine how angry sweaty little basement-dwellers are getting bc their dps against my hps ain‚Äôt shit.

(most times, however, the opposing team marks me pretty quick and I can‚Äôt heal much for others.  When that happens I try to grab as many of the opposing team I can and stay alive as long as possible to distract while my teammates capture the flag or node or whatever)

I only like first person shooters or RPG‚Äôs for their story..  Like, I only played COD for the campaign.  especially if there are multiple endings or dialogue options (like KOTOR, The ME Trilogy especially).  Those are almost like a different game every time.",1604188813

1) I'm an American with Pakistani origin, and I have a lot of friends from different backgrounds, and one thing I've found is that a lot of cultures share is the concept of ""the evil eye."" I don't know about the specifics of other cultures but in Pakistani culture, the evil eye is basically something that happens when someone compliments you with hints of jealousy. The person then begins to have random small bad things happen to them, and the ""purification"" process is different from region to region, with some places having simple prayers and others having a whole ritual. What is it about the evil eye that's persists in many different cultures and why doesn't western culture have anything like this sort of thing in its list of old superstitions? (Or does it and I'm not aware?)

2) why is Alchemy treated like some sort of magic potion making art in western culture? Alchemy as far as I know is just Arabic for chemistry. Was Alchemy seen as mystic potion making early in its time?

3) the concept of a spell needing to be said out loud by the magic user is something many cultures share, but having ""magic artifacts"" like wands, staffs, etc is something I've only seen in western magic stories. Is magic weaponry something that only originates in western culture?",1604188814

Most Americans don't live in comfortable, clean suburban homes (even if you actually live in a suburb chances are your house isn't that great. ASK ME HOW I KNOW.). Most aren't pampered Jersey Shore douchebags. Most don't live in major cities. Most black people in the US aren't hip-hop listening urbanites. Most people will never go to college at all, and plenty will only go to a community college that will still contrive to fleece them for money. All those ubiquitous medical dramas? Yeah, like 90% of the patients in those shows will have to file for bankruptcy after the episode ends (hey, House, all those bullshit tests and treatments you ordered caused the patient's insurance to hit its cap and now they're personally in debt for $200,000, like 30k of which will end up in Cuddy's bank account).

&amp;#x200B;

The closest shows to real America are *Breaking Bad* and *Better Call Saul,* where the start of the plot is a guy needing cash to pay for his cancer treatment and where even at its peak the meth empire is only dealing in tens of millions of dollars. The stakes always stay pretty petty in the grand scheme of things. It's a world where scrapping together a few hundred thousand to pay the secret forger guy who works out of a vacuum repair shop is a major obstacle.

&amp;#x200B;

There's also stuff like *Treme* (before David Simon lost his mind), and *99 Homes*, the only legitimately good and truthful film made about the 2008 crisis.

My brother and I were shipped off to the Grandparents the week after school got out to show back up the week before it started. My parents sort of did ‚Äúget better‚Äù, but not until after I left home and essentially stopped talking to them for a few years. By the time they became grandparents themselves they were much better. My mom tried to get me to send my kids to spend the summer with her. I didn‚Äôt want that to happen, but I did give her a couple of weeks. I wanted to spend summers with my kids. I never let my kids feel the way I did. A tool to be used against the other parent.

The most important part of living with a mental illness is finding a combination of coping skills that helps you effectively while not harming you too much in return.

Sone examples I've figured out:

- physical self harm does nothing for me
- alcohol just stresses me out
- smoking is lowkey disgusting (no offense to smokers)
- weed is ... meh
- emotional self harm is one hell of a drug
- sweets can help from time to time
- hot showers twice daily help against the inner cold, but blow up the water bills
- just lying in bed doesn't do much good, but it doesn't do much bad either

This will vary from person to person, make sure to see what's a decent combination for you. If weed helps you relax and you can stem the bills, go for it. It's a lot healthier than alcohol or cigarettes.",1604188816

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Where am I?"" Raymond looked around. He is in a space suit, it's pitch black dark, except for the stars. He realized he's literally in cold and empty space, he drifted around and looked at his home, Earth.

""What is this game? I don't remember playing it,"" he asked himself. He began inspecting his suit, tools floated away in space when he picked them one by one then he came across a crumpled bit of paper that read, 'Sorry about that, don't play VR in VR, it gets buggy.'

Subsequently his suit system alerted with a message that displayed, '60% oxygen left.'

""Oh shit, what did I do? Is this some kind of a test? How do I get out?"" Raymond freaked out.

""Think. Just- think. What was the last game I played? Why is it so hard to focus?""

Momentarily Raymond started backtracking.

‚ÄîWE ARE here for the future. Help us shape a better world. Change is in your hands. The new VR changes everything‚Äî

""What are you looking at?""

""Did you see the new Ad, Bill? It looks rather divergent, don't you think?""

""I don't know Ray, did you check the new VR? It's dope. Come to the point tonight, will you?'

""Sure, man.""

Raymond hooks himself into the VR and lies down on his bed. START. It takes him to his VR garage. He proceeds to go meet his friends at the point.

""He's here,"" said Pokemonzter. ""Finally, what took you so long?"" asked his friend WildGamer89 aka Bill.

""Garage business,"" replied Venusmachete aka Raymond.

""Okay let's dive into the game shall we?""

The three of them went to the popular weekly event game 'Cosmic Road Rage' to rack up the rewards except this time they did not score as much as they did last week.

""Disappointing. I swear there are hackers in here man,"" said WildGamer89.

""It's not hackable, they've told us it's secure,"" argued Pokemonzter.

""Nothing is secure Derrick,"" Raymond put forth his notion.

They moved along to try something new in the digital world. Soon Derrick and Bill got tired of it and wanted to log out but Ray has set his eyes on something, he wanted to try it before he logged out.

""Okay, Ray I'll meet you tomorrow, don't stay too long,"" said his friend Bill as his and Derrick's avatar disappeared from the virtual world.

Ray went near the display, it said 'ONLY IF YOU THINK YOU'RE READY.' He felt lucky cause he's earned his place as one of the 3000 pro gamers around the world in this virtual world.

Upon close inspection he noticed the only rule that read, 'To enter the game, you will have to log out and log in again in a specific real world location after 24 hours. Further details will be instructed to you.'

It excited Raymond. He quickly inserted the cable into his wearable he had in the arm of his avatar. It logged him out.

He woke up in his bedroom, he had his dinner and slept early.

""Ray, you hear me man? What did you do last night?"" asked Bill, the next morning.

""Oh, it's nothing. I thought I could play it but it wasn't for me."" Ray hid it from his best friend.

""Okay then what's the plan today?""

""Let's go to the old downtown. I didn't visit there for the last few days.""

""Didn't you know?""

""What?""

""The place is blocked, there's no way we can access it. Some new construction is being planned there.""

""All of a sudden?"" Raymond was confused.

The next morning Raymond received the location exactly after 24 hours. He started looking for the place through his handheld PC as he went past the city in his hoverbike. He'd finally found it, the cross-tech booth commissioned by the same company that creates VR devices.

He was told they would need to insert the plug straight into his spinal cord right at the back of his neck, ""it'll only feel like a tingle, kid"" one of them told him.

""It feels more than a tingle,"" Ray thought to himself.

Then they began injecting him with a substitute VR inducing material. He slowly closed his eyes in hopes of playing the promised Pro Game competing directly with other top players in the world.

Raymond's space suit alerted, 'Oxygen level dropping rapidly, 20%, 18%...'

""What the hell? That wasn't VR in VR, I'm still at that damned location, is this some kind of a test?"" Raymond realized what he had to do.

'Alert: Oxygen level 5% and dropping.'

Raymond pulled the plug from the back of his neck. Earth's gravity pulled him in at the speed of sound.

Ray woke up in his bedroom. He quickly removed the headset he was wearing and throwed it on the floor. His heart was pouding and he began sweating like a pig.

""Why, How am I here? What just happened?"" Raymond questioned everything, perplexed than ever.

He looked at his headset, it displayed a message, 'Congratulations on successfully completing the beta test conducted to fix the crucial bug in the system, please collect your $1,000,000 reward in cash at the nearest MindScape VR Global Center. You can spend without limits. We look forward to working with you.'

""What up Ray? I heard you got some hefty amount from them. What did you do? Seriously, tell me all about it,"" asked Bill the next day.

""I'll tell you Bill, now help me wi-"" Ray stopped, ""Did you feel that?"" he asked.

""Feel what?""

""I don't know I felt something, like I just had goosebumps. Like I, I..."" Ray stuttered.

""What did you say before about helping you?"" asked Bill.

""Sorry, yeah, I just want to donate all the money to the people in the old downtown past the grid sector, will you help me?""

Ray wanted to spend it all for the run-down neighborhood in the real world. Talk about real world, it's still the night when Raymond first hooked himself into the new VR device. The device was distributed to handpick few people among millions of gamers who are already being surveiled by the company without user consent, then the software was rolled out inside the VR, to mimic their actual life and to propose a test. Raymond has got their attention, comprehensive virtual life for eternity is the price he paid.

He's being secretly moved into a portable cryogenic pod at the middle of the night. His young life is being kidnapped by Mindscape VR Global. Raymond is one of the handful of gamers around the world who have effectively become a goldilock source for them to farm data on.

His mind is far more valuable to them than the cost they will spend on keeping his body in stasis. He is now an asset to the company that is hell bent on remaking the world in its own image.

"warcraftlore","t5_2s5rg","I only see this happening if the next expansion is Azeroth based with the levelling experience taking place in those zones (Similiar to Cata). It's a ton of work to do this so I don't think it's plausable to do it ""on the side"" of main expansion content so to speak.

I think we're probably going to see evidence of other worlds in Shadowlands (we know this already) which will set up a few other planets/realms that we need to go to for whatever reason. We're running out of places to go on Azeroth, that's for sure!

Not to mention Chromies time skip completely removes the need to revamp the world as well as it's not a mandatory piece of levelling anymore like it was before so the argument I used to see that it's ""due an update"" isn't really relevant anymore.

I think the best we can hope for is some development in key areas (the ones you've outlined are great examples) but I don't think we'll see a full world revamp.",1604188816

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Yes Americans did let them keep their God King. And by their Japanese Belief, the God King was the ""empire"", well at least until the end of the war. The Emperor came out of the war as a powerless figurehead, which I believe was one of the main goals that America wanted to achieve at the end of the war. But here you go again, you just said it yourself ""They unconditionally surrendered except..."" &lt;--- That's a Conditional Surrender. Asking for a neutral party to mediate is also considered a Conditional Surrender. So once again, we're back at the start. There was no unconditional surrender until 1945.

From the Paper you posted, by the way:

&gt;In  summary,  we  see  that  the  Japanese  government was  indeed  at  least  open  to  the  possibility  of  discussing  ways  to  formally  surrender  to  the  Allies.  And this historical reality runs counter to the fallacious assumption  that  the  Japanese‚Äîboth  the  people  at  large as  well  as  their  leaders‚Äîwere  hell-bent  on  a  course  of mass suicide unless some kind of dramatic gesture, i.e., the atomic bombs, could shock them into surrendering. But  President  Truman  was  unwilling  to  address  this possibility,  and  **he  refused  to  budge  from  his  position of demanding unconditional and immediate surrender.**

Japanese leaders knew the terms required for a surrender to be accepted by the Americans. They did not to that until the bombs dropped.",1604188816

After years of trying to avoid them and not explaining how I felt, just let them assume whatever, that I'm a bad child and misbehaving, I sat them down and explained exactly how I felt. I told them how this can't continue like this anymore. Before I had said that, I had told them how I plan on moving out for ""work"" and they didn't take that well. When I spoke to them I brought that up, how I am leaving because there's no point of me staying here and how I'm only being treated as a servant whenever they need something. It really shook them. I also told them that if they really care about they need to give me space to figure myself out. Since then, they have been more gentle and caring but there are still assumptions and advices that they think will help me and I shut them up real quick. I told them how I am helping myself right now and don't want their help unless I ask for it.

  


It's very normal that they will always assume and ""forget"" the real reasons because they will never understand how we actually feel. I found that focusing on myself and making myself happy first and then worrying about their opinion of me really helped my situation. And for the feeling of not belonging is only temporary.

Just about every time I see someone I stop. I kind of got out of the habit in the last couple of years, moved to a big city and all that, my girlfriend wasn't too stoked on the practice. Then some shit happened to me that changed me and I am back to offering rides habitually. If you would indulge me, it is long story and has almost nothing to do with hitch hiking other than happening on a road.

This past year I have had 3 instances of car trouble. A blow out on a freeway, a bunch of blown fuses and an out of gas situation. All of them were while driving other people's cars which, for some reason, makes it worse on an emotional level. It makes it worse on a practical level as well, what with the fact that I carry things like a jack and extra fuses in my car, and know enough not to park, facing downhill, on a steep incline with less than a gallon of fuel.

Anyway, each of these times this shit happened I was DISGUSTED with how people would not bother to help me. I spent hours on the side of the freeway waiting, watching roadside assistance vehicles blow past me, for AAA to show. The 4 gas stations I asked for a gas can at told me that they couldn't loan them out ""for my safety"" but I could buy a really shitty 1-gallon one with no cap for $15. It was enough, each time, to make you say shit like ""this country is going to hell in a handbasket.""

But you know who came to my rescue all three times? Immigrants. Mexican immigrants. None of them spoke a lick of the language. But one of those dudes had a profound affect on me.

He was the guy that stopped to help me with a blow out with his whole family of 6 in tow. I was on the side of the road for close to 4 hours. Big jeep, blown rear tire, had a spare but no jack. I had signs in the windows of the car, big signs that said NEED A JACK and offered money. No dice. Right as I am about to give up and just hitch out there a van pulls over and dude bounds out. He sizes the situation up and calls for his youngest daughter who speaks english. He conveys through her that he has a jack but it is too small for the Jeep so we will need to brace it. He produces a saw from the van and cuts a log out of a downed tree on the side of the road. We rolled it over, put his jack on top, and bam, in business. I start taking the wheel off and, if you can believe it, I broke his tire iron. It was one of those collapsible ones and I wasn't careful and I snapped the head I needed clean off. Fuck.

No worries, he runs to the van, gives it to his wife and she is gone in a flash, down the road to buy a tire iron. She is back in 15 minutes, we finish the job with a little sweat and cussing (stupid log was starting to give), and I am a very happy man. We are both filthy and sweaty. The wife produces a large water jug for us to wash our hands in. I tried to put a 20 in the man's hand but he wouldn't take it so I instead gave it to his wife as quietly as I could. I thanked them up one side and down the other. I asked the little girl where they lived, thinking maybe I could send them a gift for being so awesome. She says they live in Mexico. They are here so mommy and daddy can pick peaches for the next few weeks. After that they are going to pick cherries then go back home. She asks if I have had lunch and when I told her no she gave me a tamale from their cooler, the best fucking tamale I have ever had.

So, to clarify, a family that is undoubtedly poorer than you, me, and just about everyone else on that stretch of road, working on a seasonal basis where time **is** money, took an hour or two out of their day to help some strange dude on the side of the road when people in tow trucks were just passing me by. Wow...

But we aren't done yet. I thank them again and walk back to my car and open the foil on the tamale cause I am starving at this point and what do I find inside? My fucking $20 bill! I whirl around and run up to the van and the guy rolls his window down. He sees the $20 in my hand and just shaking his head no like he won't take it. All I can think to say is ""Por Favor, Por Favor, Por Favor"" with my hands out. Dude just smiles, shakes his head and, with what looked like great concentration, tried his hardest to speak to me in English:

""Today you.... tomorrow me.""

Rolled up his window, drove away, his daughter waving to me in the rear view. I sat in my car eating the best fucking tamale of all time and I just cried. Like a little girl. It has been a rough year and nothing has broke my way. This was so out of left field I just couldn't deal.

In the 5 months since I have changed a couple of tires, given a few rides to gas stations and, once, went 50 miles out of my way to get a girl to an airport. I won't accept money. Every time I tell them the same thing when we are through:

""Today you.... tomorrow me.""

tl;dr: long rambling story about how the kindness of strangers, particularly folks from south of the border, forced me to be more helpful on the road and in life in general. I am sure it won't be as meaningful to anyone else but it was seriously the highlight of my 2010.

**edit: To the OP, sorry to jack your thread, this has nothing to do with Hitch Hiking. I sort of thought I could just get this off my chest, enjoy the catharsis and watch the story languish at the bottom of the page. Glad people like hearing the tale and I hope it moves you to be more helpful in your day to day. **",1604188817

"arduino","t5_2qknj","Why it's needed. A digital input port has a high input impedance (= the resistance of the silicon stuff behind the pin is large). When the pin is floating (= not driven by another chip's digital output or not ""pulled"" high or low with a resistor) it will drift randomly between logic levels, eating power and possibly causing noise.

A pull-up resistor of a moderate size ""nails"" the input pin to a particular state. The resistor needs to be large enough that another device's digital output can still drive it to the opposite state but the exact value is usually immaterial (\*) and values between 4K7 and 22K are common with 10K probably the most used default value.

Many microcontrollers have built-in pull-up or pull-down resistors in their input ports. There's some configuration stuff to go through to get them enabled. If an internal pull-up/-down resistor is used, then an external one isn't needed.

It's good practice to be sure that *every* input pin is pulled either to Vcc (logic 1) or ground (logic 0) somehow, with either an external resistor or else an internal one if available.

(\*) In very high speed applications it can be necessary to run the numbers for the I/O port characteristics (resistance and reactive impedance), the pull-up/-down resistor, and even the circuit board traces. When you get to the point of working with that stuff, you'll know it. In the meantime, a 10K pull-up is always correct ... except when it isn't.",1604188818

The weight of the stone on her chest began to lighten as she closed her eyes. She heard their muffled cheers. Cries of jubilation as they rid themselves of another witch. 
Tears that she could not feel, slid down her cheeks as she sank to the bottom of the lake. They knew not what they did. They sought only to destroy what they did not understand. As she sank into the comfortable dark it all faded. 
Hours later, she was jolted awake. As she opened her eyes she could not believe them. She was still trapped beneath the lake by the stone, but still she lived. There were a million thoughts running through her head. She shifted her body, trying to use friction to adjust the rope that held the stone fast. Slowly, she successfully wriggled her way out. She quickly kicked to the surface and broke it, gasping for air. She looked around and saw no one. Making her way to the lake side she tried to understand why she had not died. Even as a witch of the Old Ways, she was not immortal. The moon was full and bright. She felt the power of the Goddess as lunar rays washed over her cold skin. They filled her with warmth and invigoration. She would make these humans see the error of their ways. Walking through the thick underbrush she felt the power of the Earth through her bare feet. She was awash with a new feeling. Something feral. She made her way to nowhere in particular when she heard the soft sound of a woman singing. Calling to her. She followed, entranced. In a clearing, sat the most magnificent being to grace her eyes. Immediately she cried out in exultation. This was the Goddess herself. There was no mistaking it. Slowly she approached. The Goddess looked up and spoke. "" Hello my daughter. You have risen because I have a task for you.""  Rian, our witch, was astounded but could not speak. "" I wish for you to go forth, and take with you this sword"". A sword that seems to be made of steel and moonlight materialized before Rian. ""You must take it and give it to the one true King"".""You will know him when you see him my daughter"". ""Do not fear. He will teach these humans the Old Ways, and in that you shall have your revenge"".  With barely a sound, the Goddess was gone and Rian was left with her sword, and her thoughts. It seemed like her life was just beginning, on the day she died.",1604188819

I rescued her crying in the bushes and took her in, loved her, cherished her, fed her, bathroomed her. Watching the love's of my life being tolled away with such disregard. The last I ever saw of those Angel's, leter I was informed of the Beautiful Tortoiseshell Kitten's passing, I have yet to see the three blue eyed beauties again either. So I can only assume of their passing. There was one last kitten left in the carrier, by himself with his mother, 3 weeks ago somebody stole him from the carrier to my unknowing and I have never seen him again. Nobody understands just how much my heart aches. It hurts so much oh GOD it hurts END IT PLEASE END THIS, THIS IS HELL

Edit: please forgive my grammar, I was emotional while writing this.",1604188821

So far I just been feeding her regular water when she tells me she's thirsty so I don't risk overwatering and plus I feel like it's better for her to droop a bit to tell me she's thirsty than me continually feeding her on a schedule cause when I did that on my first grow I had nothing but issues so this has been working for me.

"CamelotUnchained","t5_2w92e","&gt; Where did I stifle criticism?

This can‚Äôt be a serious response. If it is, seek help. If not, then literally just look at 2 of the posts from the last week that were locked for no reason other than your dislike of them. In this single thread alone there are removed posts.

&gt; What I posted is based on the hard information we have access to,

There is no ‚Äúhard information‚Äù I or anyone is aware of, because it doesn‚Äôt exist. A developer saying ‚Äúeverything is going great! Keep supporting us!‚Äù is not hard information. It‚Äôs a company doing what any company would do, save face and admit no fault. Whether or not they are guilty is irrelevant, without any actual evidence to the contrary their word is no different than the word of a random passerby ‚Äî if anything their word is even less valuable because they have much more to lose and would absolutely be inclined to lie to keep the company going. 

&gt; ...COVID &amp; GDPR...

Can‚Äôt go over this any more than I already have. There is nothing in GDPR that requires anything they are doing. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs not even a debatable point, it‚Äôs literally just not a thing. If they wanted to move that data for other reasons that is 100% on them, not GDPR, and they have no one to blame but themselves. Don‚Äôt drag the European Union into it as your new scapegoat because you fucked up.

&gt; ...8 months...

The first US COVID case was in December I believe, but maybe very early January, I‚Äôd have to double check. Either way your argument of being pedantic is wrong because tomorrow is November. If you are going to be a stickler for details at least try to confirm your details beforehand.

[Zombie / Zombi 2 / Zombie Flesh Eaters (1979)](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0080057/) - A very basic, but incredibly stylish zombie film marketed as an unlicensed sequel to Dawn of the Dead despite no association.

Fuck off with indoor dining, people. I'm all for supporting the business owners and employees, but going out to eat right now is irresponsible and completely unnecessary.

Going on any sort of trip right now? Also fucking stupid. Why are people thinking now is a good time to travel?

""Oh, we can get together, its just a few of us"" WRONG. There are safe ways to do it, but many are not doing it that way. You can wait to see your friends/family. Thanksgiving isn't even here yet and I'm frustrated already just thinking about the inevitable recklessness and resulting impact.

Watching BC vs Clemson earlier (which I know was out of state), and the number of people permitted in the stands was utterly shocking. Nationally, we are also being total idiots about this, so thats fun. I guess we're getting what we deserve.

"law","t5_2qh9k","&gt; I know Tony is nominally a Democrat (formerly a Republican, backed by Broward County GOP establishment) and by all appearances he has turned his life around, but dammit, DeSantis should have done a much better job of vetting him. People deserved to know.

Would DeSantis have been able to get these records, if they are sealed?

&gt;Better yet, DeSantis should not have removed Scott Israel from office. The special master appointed by the Senate found no support of ANY of the ""charges"" DeSantis cited for removing Israel. (Even though the Senate voted to back DeSantis anyway). After the airport shootings and Parkland, voters probably would have removed Israel themselves, but that was their decision to make, not the governor's.

As I understand it, Florida law gives the governor a lot of discretion over local officials, including the ability to remove prosecutors from cases and even to remove officials from office and replace them. If that's the case, it does sound like it is up to the governor and not the voters for the most part. Even if Tony is reelected, if misconduct or ineligiblity is proven than DeSantis can replace him with someone else without having to go through another election.",1604188827

Tory MPs ideologically opposed to lockdown are - shock horror! - opposed to the government imposing a lockdown.  They'll consider that incompetent.

They are both valid in their criticisms because they are coming from two separate ideologies.  That's what I mean by ""legitimate""; each side is being true to its own tenets.

What I can say is that you should pursue what you are passionate for. Both are really great degrees and that monash law honours will put you among the best law students in Australia. 

As someone who chose science over biomed, I would say, considering your academic ability (you got in monash law), do biomed. Yes, it is harder but the cohort is more supportive of each other and if you make a study group with motivated and like-minded students, it will have an invaluable effect on your success as a student. As I said, that law deg is also very good. 

If you're just looking to cruise through and not really passionate, med might not be the best option for you. Its highly competitive, grueling and from the interviews I've had, the med schools really look for passion and dedication above all else. 

At the end of the day, if you just want a secure career with decent job prospects, save yourself the trouble and do something like Deakin Optometry if you can apply. It has an graduate employment rate well above 90%. If you can think about your given choices and find passion, choose that one!",1604188828

Pros:

Youngest up and coming team with arguably the best farm system in baseball.

A super fun gm (JeDi) who will likely make the most trades a year.

ROY Kyle Lewis

A fun history peppered with legends (a-rod pre steroids, Griffey, big unit, ichiro..)

A cacophony of online material to dive into. The history of the franchise by sb nation, go watch my oh my the 95‚Äô season and of course the 116 win season in review. Basically YouTube loves the m‚Äôs.

One of the coolest color schemes and uniforms in sports. From the regular uni‚Äôs to the teal to the old school yellow/blue.

One of the best subreddits with the gold standard for memes, gifs and commercials 

Cons: 

We haven‚Äôt won in your lifetime and our existence is pain.


Real talk it‚Äôs a great time to be an m‚Äôs fan. We‚Äôre not great now but with the asterisks losing guys and old, the a‚Äôs not really being a powerhouse, the angels being mike trout Only (FMT) and well the rangers being a shit show I‚Äôd expect the m‚Äôs to be a lot like the Braves are now in about two years.

"Unity3D","t5_2qwj8","I've recently worked on this quite a bit and it's not easy. I split this into five parts parts. 

The first and easiest was a class to handle user input. It handles wrapping unity input (and soon the new input system). The only logic in here is handling multi-key - e.g. you what happens if you press W and S together. It's also really easy here to disable all user input because it all goes through the same Update. 

The second class is the player state. It holds the actual player state (standing, jumping, ...), received messages from other objects (e.g. we've been hit by enemy) and evaluates the inputs given. This allows me to easily say that when you're running, the action button is jump. But if you're swimming, the same input is dive, and if you're carrying a weapon, it's attack. This code is very very ugly - lots of ifs and special cases - but because I don't handle input, animation, audio, or anything else here, the code is very compact. The whole state evaluation is only about 150 lines. In the end, it outputs a single value: the new player state.

The third class takes the state and converts it into position information. It also checks if the movement is valid. E.g. if you can move forward with a wall in front of you.

The fourth class takes the state and translates that into the animation to play, including any transition animations necessary. Also handles IK. Since all it takes is the state from PlayerState, the code is really clean. 

And finally the fifth monobehaviour is responsible for dealing with audio. If you transition to jump, land, ... Again, the code is very clean. 

I think this was a very very long way of saying I don't think there is a clean, beautiful way to write all that. But if you structure your code well, then the ugly part gets more compact and becomes actually maintainable. Our state info is the state (jump, run, ...) and when we transitioned into the state. For the most part we're going through a bunch of ifs with current state, input, when was current state started...",1604188829

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I would suggest starting on Amazon(ebay much smaller and way less traffic), if someone sells on amazon and Ebay, amazon will account 95%+ of sales and Ebay a couple percent maybe. 

Yes, Amazon selling is less SEO that's needed but those who still manage to learn SEO will do better, but its best to start using Amazons traffic, see how your results are and then max out capacity with Amazon and then can get outside sources. Social media is always a good thing to start with from the beginning but hard to make a following unless your great at it.

Shopify will be tougher and less profits from the beginning. I dont really see the advantages of starting on Shopify over an Amazon store starting out. Amazon is great to prove your product, make more money utilizing Amazons traffic and then as you grow can slowly expand out to your own website and such by using product insert cards telling your customers you also have a website with discount codes go get them to move over to your website later. 

I would highly suggest starting Amazon first. Shopify you'll end up spending so much money on ads to make the sale that there wont be any left over for profits and tend to loose money. Amazon is a cheaper start up cost.

Edit: you mentioned making your own products. If you mean handmade goods you should sell those on Etsy. Its pretty easy to make a couple sales there",1604188831

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","Disagree.

You are ignoring the following facts:
1) flu season means more hospitalizations than back in spring
2) back in spring the hospitals could defer elective surgeries (everything but A&amp;E). A lot of those surgeries cannot be deferred any further.
3) medical staff are overworked, exhausted and medical facilities don't have any spare capacity anymore (how long are you going to defer annual leaves? What about nurses who are disenfranchised, or doctors hearing their president accusing them of profiteering from declaring deaths by covid.. All these add up to a worse morale outlook).
4) people are saturated and are pushing back on restrictions more than in the beginning of the pandemic

All the above mean that icu capacity is far lower than back in spring, and it takes fewer covid emergencies now in order to see people dying at home or simply dying due to lack of medical capacity (think of new York at the height of the pandemic),people that could be saved.

Vaccines are around the corner, but experts don't expect them to offer immunity, just lighter symptoms, plus a lot of people are rightfully sceptical about how many corners are being cut.. That will reduce uptake. Hopefully we will get some therapeutic asap.

I was so comfortable with it that I didn't think twice about being naked in my bedroom with my boyfriend. It was no big deal for him to spend the night in bed with me either. 

He had spent the night one Friday and we both woke up with serious morning wood and feeling extra frisky. We were on my bed, both of us naked, with me on all four and him kneeling behind me, just plowing away at my ass when my bedroom door swung open. My mom, trying to juggle two stacked baskets of dirty clothes had bumped my door which, because I had gotten lazy with the privacy thing, I hadn't shut all the way when my BF had come over. 

You gotta know my mom, she's really weird and super New Agey, she and my stepdad were old hippies. Her reaction at seeing her naked 14-year-old son getting his ass pounded was to smile and give me that weird 'mom stare' of pride that her baby boy was growing up. I know this because for days she kept hugging me and telling me she loved me and was proud of me.

I'm sympathetic that these are unprecedented times, but I am a single parent and DO need my money returned.

Why is it that using a car is NEEDED? I'm pretty sure humans did just fine without them before the 20s. It's a luxury, just like having a pet is, and it's the responsibility of the owner to understand the responsibilities of these luxury's. If you have a cat, you need to know how to care for it. A cat will get depressed and start going crazy if it lived in a 10x10 room with it's owner all it's life, it would start to pull out fur and destroy furniture.

What you can do in this case is make a note of the Standesamt that you could not search online. 

That the index is not online sometimes means that the index spans several years and is still at the Standesamt in question.  In this case the State Archive cannot upload it.

But knowing which Standesamt you haven't been able to search narrows down the possibilities, that plus the birth date and the potential address of the mother should make the search for the birth certificate a reasonable request for the staff of the state archive.

"retrobattlestations","t5_2xd38","Spent a couple happy hours giving both of these gorgeous Amiga 1000's a deep-cleaning, and I'm delighted to report that both power up nicely and cheerfully request a KickStart disk - awesome! However:

* I don't have a KickStart disk. I do have, however, an external FlashFloppy device and a USB stick full of great Amiga software in ADF format. The one thing I can't seem to find a conclusive answer too, though, is this: can an A1000 boot from a FlashFloppy drive, or is this a chicken-and-egg situation? I'm seeing conflicting info online and I'm not sure what to do. I should note that I'm a registered owner of ""Amiga Forever,"" if any of that content would help here
* As noted in a previous thread, I believe I have an A1000-style ""tank mouse"" in a box somewhere, but I definitely don't have an A1000-style keyboard. I know they're rare and I'm aware there are adapters for using non-A1000-style keyboards, but my goal is to find a ""correct"" keyboard if possible. If anyone has one, hit me up!",1604188837

The way it is used in the comments above is that the more people have it, the more antibodies exist in the population. With this method you can't control which variation of the virus you let out into the wild. Is it the mild one? Is it the aggressive one? This herd immunity will not work.

* No selfies or human family pics, youtube channels, discord links, personal blogs. 
This also includes requests for research participants and any self-promotion/donation

* No memes or infographics link posts unless it's Friday

* No ""why did my bipolar SO/coworker/ex/parent/staff/boss do this?"" type posts. Short 
answer: No idea. Ask them or talk to a therapist about it. 

* Be kind to fellow users. No harassment or abusive language will be tolerated. Report 
and move on. Engaging just brings everyone down. 

* We are not Drs so please don't post asking us if you have BP. You wouldn't ask a 
cancer support group if you have cancer, so please don't ask us. 

* Please report self-harm and suicide threats. Users aren't equipped to intervene. 

Most of all be kind to yourself. We have a really great piece of the internet due to 
users like all of you sharing your struggles and offering support. We're here for each

&gt; About 170,000 Detroiters, who are overwhelmingly Democratic, have requested absentee ballots ahead of the election.

&gt; Groups of employees on each shift pull ballots from the mail stream and expedite their processing, so Woods is confident that election mail is moving through the system quicker than the other first class letters.

more serious answer, Penny.

i know most ofher stuff is 'woe is me', but imagine her POV, her internal thoughts.  i can imagine that there is a lot of conflict internally.  probably a thousand thoughts going through her head all the time, but it always comes down to 'what can i say or do that will keep me safe today?'.... just imagine having to constantly swallow your true feelings, your words, never feeling like you can really say what you are thinking or feeling - for the fear that someone bigger and stronger will just laugh at best, push you aside - or at worst.....do whatever the fuck they want to you...and no one will give a damn.   

we got a small taste of this with young sansa, but imagine not being pretty, 'royal', heir to a vast kingdom, etc, ?  imagine being in that spot and having no perceived worth beyond how much you can entertain others?  and knowing for a fact that sooner rather than later, they arent gonna find you entertaining anymore...",1604188839

I personally don't see this being terribly useful, especially for a brand new mouse. It takes a little while to really get used to a new shape and find the correct grip, so initial impressions are usually a bit off in my experience. I'd say unless you hate it out of the box, main the mouse for a week or two, then maybe do these tests. But I think after a week you'd know anyways if you like a mouse or not. 

Personally, I can't really measure any performance difference among my mice that couldn't be explained by run-to-run variance, unless I use like a brick mouse. I feel like once you're using a good mouse, it's mostly about preference and confidence, but it may be different for other people.",1604188840

Some might argue that this has to with ""Freedom of Speech."" but Freedom of Speech also means that you have consequences to your actions/words. 

You shout fire in a movie theater as a ""troll"" attempt, and the Owner/Manager has every right to have you thrown out like a stray dog.  But so many Social Media sites are refusing to do anything about this. Hell, right now the creator of Twitter is in SERIOUS deep shit because of it, and he just keeps putting on a smug look the entire time. Youtube also falls into this category too.

I didn't shit on voting for the lesser evil, I shat upon the overly idealistic assumption people had about what voting for a lesser evil alone would accomplish in terms of the broader goals of progressive politics. 

You cannot find a single line where I said ""don't vote for the lesser evil"". At this point you're just I dunno... saving face? You seem to have turned your own hasty misinterpretation, which I don't consider justifiable and logical whatsoever, into something I'm responsible for.

But please, go ahead and quote the actual part where I said ""voting for the lesser evil does nothing of any consequence"". Because the whole point of this argument hinged on the premise that people were overselling what lesser evil voting accomplishes, unless you have a broader political movement operating between elections.",1604188842

"samharris","t5_2thqg","Here is Umberto Eco's description of fascism. He lived through it.

The cult of tradition. ‚ÄúOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.‚Äù

The rejection of modernism. ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.‚Äù

The cult of action for action‚Äôs sake. ‚ÄúAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.‚Äù

Disagreement is treason. ‚ÄúThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.‚Äù

Fear of difference. ‚ÄúThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.‚Äù

Appeal to social frustration. ‚ÄúOne of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.‚Äù

The obsession with a plot. ‚ÄúThus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.‚Äù

The enemy is both strong and weak. ‚ÄúBy a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.‚Äù

Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. ‚ÄúFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.‚Äù

Contempt for the weak. ‚ÄúElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.‚Äù

Everybody is educated to become a hero. ‚ÄúIn Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.‚Äù

Machismo and weaponry. ‚ÄúMachismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.‚Äù

Selective populism. ‚ÄúThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.‚Äù

Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. ‚ÄúAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.‚Äù",1604188845

In most pants, my hips and thighs are the tightest spot, so I often have to get a slightly bigger waist to avoid them being too tight below. But I can't imagine my thighs needing to breathe quite THIS much.

If there were pictures of them looking as baggy as they do on me on the product page, I would have probably assumed they weren't for me right from the start. But the photos make them look very sleek, and frankly pretty flattering. And both of those models seem to be pretty small-waisted too.

But I've come to wonder if it's also their poses. When I stand or sit certain ways, they look perfectly fine on me. But then when I move in them or they billow out a bit, I can't help but think that it looks a little like I'm wearing clown pants.

However some people such as yourself don't seem to have that issue, so I'm not entirely sure how to explain it. Body type and preferences I suppose! Either way, thanks for adding your perspective!

Even though they aren't what I expected and won't fit all the use cases I wanted them for, I decided to keep mine because they are ridiculously comfortable, and now I have a pair of Outlier pants I can wear around the house in place in sweatpants.",1604188845

I'm not at all suggesting they play her YouTube videos on Dynamite, but there are any number of ways to get her personality over in interviews or promos and they've completely missed the opportunity. She's actively working on improving her English and loves exploring American culture. The night she won the title, she celebrated by eating her favorite junk food on YouTube. Something tells me the American wrestling audience could instantly relate to that. They could just air segments where Kenny or her cheerleader friend show her around and have her react.",1604188846

My take will be business side..  cause it's their own solo work,if they want the company spend the cost for marketing,it will deduct the profit from the song.
The less cost the more profit..it's common sense in business.


Ex: Daechwita MV,CNS licence &amp;MV fee are definitely funded by company, which as business practice will deduct the cost to the sales of the song/MV gather.

Metaphors aren‚Äôt real life. 

Like, I‚Äôm an adult human woman, not a lock, not a seatbelt.

Of course, some of them can vent about the abuse they suffered but they can't tell anyone they don't know that they have BPD. This people are traumatized towards BPD behaviors and anything BPD related is immediately canceled by them.. of course, it's not the healthiest coping mechanism but I don't look at it as a personal attack, just as people in suffering that want to vent, while discriminating an unidentifiable group of people by default. 

It's demonizing BPD, yeah some of them do it, but I think the main purpose is sharing abusive experiences and find other people who know what they are talking about. Just think of it like, it's not directed towards ""us"", it's just about the issues they have of some BPD behaviors.",1604188851

"HealthyFood","t5_2rhbm","**To all participants, a couple of reminders before you join in:** 

Nutrition is not a solved science and diet approaches are often based on individual needs and circumstances. This subreddit caters to all approaches to what is deemed ""healthy"". Each POV has the opportunity to share info within the rules. Sometimes we get more of one POV set than another but the waves come and go. Don't generalize other participants or even the subreddit itself just because you don't get the votes you want or because others disagree with you and certainly don't attack anyone for it. You do not have to agree but *EDUCATE your POV rather than BERATE them for theirs* 

* **Avoid being rude pt 1** - Our Reddiquette rule requires that you not engage in insults, trolling, or other antagonistic behaviors towards anyone in this sub (even when others break the rule). It also means downvote complaining is not allowed. Talk about the food, not the other person.

* **Avoid being rude pt 2** - Our dietary activism rule requires that you be respectful towards other dietary points of view. Therefore, crusading, diet shaming, food ethics / morals, and absolutism are not allowed and often result in a ban. Diet warriors, be aware that this is not the place to camp in wait to bash others with your beliefs.  

* **Avoid being rude pt 3** - Do not add comments calling food disgusting or gross or any other non-constructive criticisms.  Do not claim foods as non-healthy without citing specific studies proving it (with links) and do not do so disrespectfully.  Again, people come in varieties so AVOID absolutist claims.

If someone is violating a rule, don't fight fire with fire.  Report rule violations.  If things get ugly, you can counter points with science, never insults. You can also opt to just walk away.

**TLDR:** Educate. Don't berate. No complaining or diet war BS

2.	Mash the banana

Notes:

-	I used monkfruit extract sweetener, it might be in my head but I think since it‚Äôs from a fruit it works better with fruit

He became obsessed with dick and made a plot to USES his father and barbara to get to dick. He then tries to kill barbara to prove his point that emotions are a weakness not a strength. The entire time hes never interested in barbara he doesnt care about barbara the only reason hes even a gordon is so that it gives dick a personal connection since hes so close to the gordons. 

He doesnt work as a villain for barbara because barbara is boring to him, he has her figured out,
He knew she was onto him from the very start and remained 10 steps ahead of her. Plus their dynamic is boring shes too serious and honestly almost as cold as bruce at times so theres no dichotomy between them like there is between James and Dick they‚Äôre two sides to the same coin while dick is a beacon of hope and happiness using his friends and family to build himself up James does the opposite not caring about anything and anyone but himself and sees all attachments as weakness. 

He‚Äôs obsessed with dick grayson in the same way the joker is obsessed with batman and that alone is reason enough for him be dicks arch enemy",1604188853
"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","This sub's gentrified opinion on this album: This album serves as a juxtaposition on the black American experience with the classic villainous and macabre monsters of classic cinema. It evokes an passionate descriptive overview of the subjective experience in the low-income households and the visceral ethical choice of murder, grand larceny and a life of spiralling crime.

"AskARussian","t5_2xzpo","Fellow American here. I love Russian people, the culture, and the language. Minored in Russian in school and still practice, though I‚Äôm not as fluent as I‚Äôd hoped to be by now. 

From seeing Americans in general to American politics and media to my personal life, I think a lot of Americans are uneducated when it comes to Russia and other countries in general. I think this partly comes from our education in high school and sometime uni and also the lack of international travel of a lot of Americans, particularly in the South where I‚Äôm from. I think many people here use Russia as a scapegoat for our problems so they don‚Äôt have to acknowledge and face our actual problems. I‚Äôve also always found it funny and ironic how people will say ‚ÄúRussia is interfering in our politics and elections‚Äù and ‚ÄúRussia is doing this and that‚Äù, but those same people ignore the US‚Äôs history of more directly interfering in other countries‚Äô politics and sovereignty as well as currently. 

I think it‚Äôs a general problem worldwide as well. Countries with different and sometime conflicting social and/or political cultures tend to portray each other in a negative manner so their people follow suit.

Remember, being mature means considering the facts, not resorting to fear-mongering and brow-beating.

While indeed we are dealing with a viral pandemic (as the disease exists on every continent), the lethality of this virus is extraordinarily low when considering the death-per-infection rate for the majority of demographics. As such, since we already know how to protect the most vulnerable via transmission vectors and preventatives, there is literally no need for the world governments to overstep on our liberties to ""protect"" us from each other. We can leave it to the private businesses to enforce ""no-mask-no-entry"" policies.

In terms of Coronavirus, your safety is defined by the probability of contracting the virus, multiplied by the probability of having serious complications requiring hospitalization. While the first factor is technically defined by your actions and the actions of those around you (masks + social distancing), the second factor is determined entirely by you. You have yet to define a coherent argument (aside from the ""your freedom, my safety"" soundbite) why governments must place fines, penalties, or other legal actions against citizens that would accomplish more than what private businesses can accomplish.",1604188856

*****
&gt; A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said.

&gt; According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a &amp;quot;Boogaloo Boi&amp;quot; based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: &amp;quot;I need a headcount.""

&gt; By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a &amp;quot;Playground for renegade cops&amp;quot;, was being set on fire.

"MBA","t5_2rbd9","And the worse part is that this is heartbreaking for us and admissions just don't get it.  We know there's at best one or two slots per country, and when you are competing against the son of the President then the race was already lost at birth. 43% of white Harvard students pretty much got there due to their family relationships, which is indeed a lot, but at least the rest has a chance left. We don't even have that.

This whole thing is all about having fake diversity, both socioeconomic and ethnic. The descent of an European lord is not really a Latin American. Not culturally, not even physically. Heck, even the same religious groups get all of the slots for the greatest international schools, Fulbright scholarships and so on. I have seen that myself, as when I applied to Fulbright (as the #1 of the national top school) that year literally all of the slots for my country were taken by one religious group, based on the surnames of the admitted people. Literally stood no chance to get to the top, no matter what I did.
 
I just wish that at least those schools (and others) become more honest about this. Wharton does not promote that fake diversity BS that much, as far as I recall, so they don't make us lose our time, money and dreams. Especially dreams. Thank you for not selling me false hopes, unlike others.

And funnily these so-called diversity-minded schools are the same ones that want alumni to get into nonprofit and saving the world. Dude, they are asking the descents of billionaires to get into nonprofit, so no wonder only 1% of alumni do it. Literally asking the sons of the local Trump's.

Well that was a really nice vent. Guess I was inspired because last week my country voted to have a new Constitution, which happened precisely because people got fed up of the lack of opportunities. They rioted against the same President that I have named three times here, who studied at Harvard yet somehow can't speak in English to save his life, therefore most likely got there because he is the son of a major politician and literally a direct descent of an Inca emperor (or at least he says he is). And sadly that cycle is bound to be repeated, sometime in the future by his son that clearly got admitted by MIT in a shady way, and who most likely took all of the slots for the country that year.

The idea is to swarm the board round one with as many beasts as possible, including tokens, which you'll purify with Siegfried after you have them all out. If you miss any skirmishers or Morkvarg, the bears are good to discard since having one in the graveyard gives the other an extra charge. 

Depending on the situation, you can push round two with Gedy and go for a short round three with Flaminica (I've seen 19 points or so from her), or you can use both in a long round three. Either Gedy or the discard package and all the other beasts you have available mean Axel can be used for big points in pretty much any round if you play it right and need him. 

Also, if you discard one Crow Clan Druid and make sure to keep a copy of Freya's Blessing in your deck, you can use Ermion to trigger Gedy in one turn for a massive point swing. Any bronze druid in the graveyard is fine, but Crow Clan is probably the biggest swing.",1604188856

"LegaciesCW","t5_j4gi1","His character feels largely unnecessary to me. Sure, at the start he was that link to TVD, like Hope was the link to TO, but once all the new characters and relationships were established he quickly became surplus to requirement for me. 
The fact he's the only permanent adult character on the show makes him stand out too. In fact, I find his presence makes Caroline's absence all the more noticable. If they insist on keeping him around he needs to have more to do, and that would mean taking even more screen time from the characters who don't get enough as it is. 
I know it might be down to the actress not wanting to come back to the show but Caroline would be a way more interesting character. Her relationship with Klaus was completely different to everyone else's and would make for an interesting dynamic with Hope, on top of her absentee relationship with the twins, plus she became a vampire as a teen so she'd actually be able to relate to some of her students.

Personal : Sick of cooking and eating my own food and terribly missing Kerala food (I'm a sucker for that) so not in the best of places mentally - other international student friends share this sentiment.

Classes : I am not attending classes anymore, synchronous sessions are recorded and I watch them before doing assignments or exams. Almost nil class engagement at this point but that might also be because I'm simultaneously job searching, and **I can't wait to graduate**. I've talked to classmates and \*all\* of them feel the same way. Not the professors' fault given all the personal mentalblocks we international students have staying away from home, and just general lack of motivation to study. (But of course some weeks are better than others)

*Quality* of teaching hasn't dropped at all in any of my classes, but I don't hear the same about ALL subjects in my college.  
Note : my course already had an online degree so transitioning was easy.

*****
&gt; A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said.

&gt; According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a &amp;quot;Boogaloo Boi&amp;quot; based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: &amp;quot;I need a headcount.""

&gt; By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a &amp;quot;Playground for renegade cops&amp;quot;, was being set on fire.

&gt; A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said.

&gt; According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a &amp;quot;Boogaloo Boi&amp;quot; based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: &amp;quot;I need a headcount.""

&gt; By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a &amp;quot;Playground for renegade cops&amp;quot;, was being set on fire.

Because most of the time you make more money than you bought it for.

&gt;Wouldn‚Äôt it just be better to save money renting a cheap apt until you have enough saved for a dream home? 

So you're basically paying rent on a ""starter apartment"" but not building any equity in it. You can have a mortgage on a starter home for less than many apartments. With a mortgage you're building equity and with an apartment you're paying your landlord's mortgage with nothing in return.

&gt;I think there‚Äôs a key point that I‚Äôm missing...

We have a mainly pretty chill local trans scene, I really clicked with maybe 5 others. Mostly men, only 1 other woman. We all shared the view that we were transitioning, but our lives and identities weren‚Äôt about being trans. So basically we mostly just kind of faded out, living our lives, which is nice. We still keep in touch.

When we hung out is was more about just hanging out with people, not trans people. We all thought dysphoria was needed to be trans, and there were more trenders in the younger crowd, more fetishists in the older crowd.

So yeah, don‚Äôt really participate much in trans stuff anymore (though I still feel like I‚Äôm transitioning) unless it‚Äôs like reddit since I‚Äôm on here already lol. Having a guy that I met force himself on me kinda turned me off in person stuff as well. He also stalked me, would bring me random obscure presents to the meetings, try to corner me by myself. Luckily the guys kind of looked out for me when I finally built up enough courage to go back to the support group, so that was really nice.

But yeah, anyways, I see it as a stepping stone, but it is nice to commiserate or seek advice from  others transitioning.",1604188864

Now, if you want to talk about it for the intellectual excercise, it's basically a text drag (taxes on dividends) and a capital gains tax versus taxes at ordinary income.

&gt;I understand all of it, to say it‚Äôs stupid, is me being generous and kind. Despite you not deserving any such measured responses.

&amp;#x200B;

You do realize that you started this conversation with me, and not the other way around right? Hell, you wanted an answer so badly that you started your own thread! The inverse relationship between your ego and your IQ is readily apparent.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I think you mean ‚Äúreality.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Huh, I'm surprised you can think at all.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What...? I honestly have no idea how you connected those two things or believe that they need to be connected to prove that societal failing are the reason for them. In your own example of someone needing to steal food to survive, what connection does the merchant someone steals from have to do with the thief‚Äôs upbringing or choice? Nothing at all, you still believe that it is society‚Äôs fault someone would need to.

&amp;#x200B;

The merchant sells food that is unaffordable. And, assuming the best, that food is most likely unaffordable because the merchant would go about of business if it was any lower. The man should have other services that allow him to support himself and his family, but in this hypothetical, he doesn't, or it's ineffective. That's what makes it a societal issue, you being blind to that doesn't change anything.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What...? I think it‚Äôs appalling how you have all the capacity that the human brain has, and just refuse to use it in any way other than bad faith.

&amp;#x200B;

Ironic Statement of the Day.

&gt;Even if you do take what I said as the way you did, which is a laughably incorrect way, it STILL isn‚Äôt enlightenedcentrism...  
&gt;  
&gt;I really don‚Äôt understand how you can be this shockingly stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

The running theme here is that you don't understand a lot of things.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What...? First off that has to be the worst account of appeasement I‚Äôve ever read. Second no, since that has nothing to do with WWI... the more you write the dumber you sound. Usually when people go into further detail, what sounded off gets more clear, the only thing more clear as we go is how stupid you are.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah. No. We're talking about the holocaust, and unless you can point out that the Treaty of Versailles was signed in a synagogue, the holocaust and this are two different issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Their treatment by other countries can be used to show the surge towards nationalism, not anti-semitism.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;No one said anything about them being exclusive. YOU turned emotion and empathy into a logical equation, which is wrong. Empathy is a mathematical equation you create, and choose to apply...how does that need explanation?

&amp;#x200B;

Oh sure, so we should instead ignore all common sense. You're setting a great example of that.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Are you joking...? Your entire point is trying to boil this down to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever feel bad for anyone who does bad stuff, and don‚Äôt acknowledge that there‚Äôs more to them than just the stuff they did.‚Äù Your entire stance is dumbing it down to ‚Äúonly feel bad for the direct victims.‚Äù Everything you‚Äôre writing is antithetical to having a complex view...

&amp;#x200B;

My logic is to not be sympathetic to people you know wouldn't be sympathetic to you. You're the one who is incapable of realizing that this is a specific situation despite the fact that even in my ""logic equation"" I gave you 4 other main situations that could also be the case. My only question is how you're managing to type this out from your fishbowl.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What are you talking about you keep using this phrase, I really don‚Äôt think you know what it means...

&amp;#x200B;

"" *Dogma* in the broad sense is any belief held unquestioningly and with undefended certainty.  ""

&amp;#x200B;

""We should be compassionate to everyone, even those who literally tried to commit genocide against you, and if they had a gun and no witnesses, they'd kill you on the spot.""

&amp;#x200B;

Dogma in it's purest form.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What‚Äôs disgusting is in 2020, you‚Äôre presumably an adult with the internet at your fingertips and cannot read. Or worse yet you‚Äôre choosing to be a dumbass. I don‚Äôt really care which.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually, this is the Ironic Statement of the Day.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

&amp;nbsp;

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

&amp;nbsp;

Please read the Post Guidelines, Rules, and Newcomers sections located in the sidebar for more information. Please also note that *the Mod Team is not able to edit titles*, so you will have to start over and repost your content with these changes. Thanks for understanding!

"tech","t5_2qh48","&gt; I would rather have my company pay everyone on staff 2-3% more than have them get a tax increase. 

I‚Äôm not trying to attack you, I just disagree with this opinion. I would much rather have the government take that 2-3% as taxes, and use it for something that positively effects all Americans, rather than let the employees use that money as they see fit. Say the government takes that 2-3% from every American and uses it to pay for something like Medicare for All, or student debt forgiveness. I‚Äôd rather that happen, instead of giving each American marginally more spending power. If the government can pool all that money together and spend it on one or two things, it can cause much greater positive change than a few hundred million small individual purchases by the people. Now, if the government takes that money and spends it on useless stuff like tacking it onto the military budget, or buying new staplers for every post office, I wouldn‚Äôt support that new tax.

Right NOW I feel great."" Maybe try some new things that can be wholly yours as a couple.

Since others have brought up the option of leaving I will give you my standard speech. If there are significant years of marriage, children, or assets then it can make sense to reconcile. If not then it is probably far too much effort. It takes years of intensive therapy to reconcile, years of pain, and it's just not worth it for a short term relationship.

*****
&gt; A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said.

&gt; According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a &amp;quot;Boogaloo Boi&amp;quot; based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: &amp;quot;I need a headcount.""

&gt; By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a &amp;quot;Playground for renegade cops&amp;quot;, was being set on fire.

-Crucifies the Masters of Meereen (cruel, literally a war crime, tipping point of justified behavior)

-Immolates an insurrection leader (cruel, war crime)

-Usurps leadership of the Dothraki, immolates them (now in completely unjustified tyranny territory)

-Executes Sons of the Harpy leaders at parlay (war crime)

-Executes surrendered leaders of the Lannister and Tarly army for not betraying their houses (war crime)

-And this all leads us to the indiscriminate slaughter of the citizenry of King's Landing for not immediately surrendering

Anyone who says this was not in character for her ignored over 6 seasons of growing abuse of power and tyranny.  You should have known she was going mad with power when she assumed leadership of the Dothraki despite having absolutely no claim whatsoever to them, and her casual use of cruel and unusual punishment throughout her story.  It was all there, plain as day, underneath all that ""girl power!"" cheerleading.  She lived as a tyrant, and died as one.",1604188870

However, that is a minor issue that I can reconcile. My far bigger issue with monks is that I don't think they are believable in combat. The image of punching an enemy who is wearing plate and being as effective as a steel weapon is just ridiculous.

"marvelchampionslcg","t5_22cwwn","It's not just a trend, it's math. This game has a win condition of getting the villain to zero health, and heroes are balanced around stats of 2.  If a hero can deal more damage than that, by default, from turn one, they *will* win faster.  A hero with 1 ATK can be put on even ground with better thwarting and hero cards, but there are only so many ways you can cripple a hero who can just win faster with higher ATK.

Limiting their thwarting doesn't fix the problem that they will just win faster. You could make their hero cards worse at dealing damage, but anyone who thematically has higher ATK should thematically deal more damage.

You can make their hero cards cost more for the same effect, but all that accomplishes is ensuring that players will rely on aspect cards, which makes it feel less like that character.

So the balancing mechanic that they've settled on is decreasing hand size. It's not perfect, but it gets the job done.",1604188872

Allowed by whom?  When you are seeking validation for those feelings from reddit then you are asking society to condone your inappropriate emotional reaction.  My unpopular opinion is that we need to stop doing that shit.  The answer should be: No, you are having an unreasonable reaction.

&gt; What is unacceptable is if Joe lets this anger out on the waitress.

This is definitely true.  But I think he's an asshole for having rage in the first place, even if he doesn't act on it.

&gt; In your example you talk about stepping back and evaluating your emotions. That's correct, that's what you should do. And if you're doing that, no one would ever know you were pissed about some mayo in the first place. No harm done.

Except the missing step where you come onto social media and ask to have your completely irrational feelings validated by strangers.  That part makes it seem like Joe has not succeeded in evaluating his emotions and recognizing them as over-the-top.  He believes his over-the-top emotions are valid.",1604188872

No.

Usyk showed nothing to suggest that he can deal with someone who has all Chisora's troublesome heft, vastly more power and vastly more skill to land it with. He looks to have neither the physical strength or the power. Joshua would brutalize him.

Never said it was painless, I said it's a financial protection.

For 7 years. It kind of makes sense that if you're broke you shouldn't take out loans to buy things that you can't afford. 

&gt; but that's assuming you knew who caused the accident and that they even have insurance

Well, it's legally required to carry insurance to drive in this country. Unfortunately, politically, people give it a pass to certain groups of people. Any bad accident would have a police investigation.  Any court order awarding you in court would likely apply that debt to the responsible party as well. 

&gt;So it's not hard for our unfortunate hypothetical uninsured accident victim through no fault of their own to wind up owing a lot of medical bills that they're unable to pay.

&gt; A rightwing extremist boasted of driving from Texas to Minneapolis to help set fire to a police precinct during the George Floyd protests, federal prosecutors said.

&gt; According to the criminal complaint against Hunter, on 26 May, as intense protests broke out in Minneapolis over the killing of George Floyd by a city police officer, a &amp;quot;Boogaloo Boi&amp;quot; based in Minnesota posted a public Facebook message: &amp;quot;I need a headcount.""

&gt; By 28 May, during a night of the most intense unrest and destruction in the city, Hunter was in Minneapolis, just as the 3rd precinct police station, known locally as a &amp;quot;Playground for renegade cops&amp;quot;, was being set on fire.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I calculated the Expected Value of the Electoral College using 50 years of past voting history (under the assumption that the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior). For probability, I used how states have traditionally voted (so if a state voted Republican 50% of the time, I assume there is a 50% of probability of that state voting Republican). I then multiplied that by point outcomes (so if the above state is worth 20 points, the Expected Value would be 10; .5 (20) = 10).

I think most of us know that the Electoral College unfairly favors Republicans. I wanted to see how much. 

Well, the Expected Value of all 50 states is Republican 319, Democrat 219. Which means that, even if a Democrat wins the popular vote, they will have to beat the odds in several states for a typical win. This is in line with what many articles have been saying the past few years about 60-70% of the population only have 30-40% of the representation and 30-40% of the population getting 60-70% of the representation. This is predicted to get worse as liberals and conservatives tend to concentrate in cities and rural areas, respectively.

To get back to the point at hand, however, if the Expected Value of a Republican presidential election is 319, anything shy of that is actually a below average or below expectations outcome.

To be completely transparent, there is a possible flaw in my calculations and it's assuming that how states have voted in the past actually gives a probability of how they will vote in the future. You need a lot of data points to draw strong conclusions, but it's possible that states have changed too much in 50 years to fairly use all those data points. On the other hand, you don't want to use too few data points (because it increases the likelihood that any pattern is due to variance, and thus not a good predictor).",1604188875

"microdosing","t5_2yt3g","Hello, I am writing this first sentence after having finished writing the rest of this post below, I just want to say if anyone wants to actually talk to me instead of us taking sides and trying to bring each other down or argue or fight each other I am here for that and would like that to happen I dont want this arguement to continue but anyways here is this arguement I wrote before* I came to this conclusion of wanting PEACE and DISCUSSION now rather than continuing this arguement:


No I am willing and am very aware of my own dark side and assess myself so your theory is wrong and literally has nothing to do with the factual things I said in my post. You just tried to strawman me by
coming at me at a side angle to try to make what I said seem illegitimate without even having to address the things i actually said just making up a figment of your imagination and placing it on me. It seems you and the people who tried to downvote me need some self reflection and maybe are trying to hide from painful truths themselves, if your views on things are flimsy and you hear someone speak the truth you can use that to bring yourself into an updated more truthful encompassing view or you can double down on your own motivated ideological beliefs and stay blind. Notice I mentioned the good and bad side of psychedelics. If you cant acknowledge both of those your truly an unjustifiably bigoted coward who will probably get people hurt, as everyone is NOT like you people who only have fine experiences, and it is NOT only because people wont face something or arent as strong as you guys. Also I literally experienced the DEVIL on psychedelics and you say I just try to blame the devil?? Where was I even blaming the devil? I was stating a fact, all I was trying to do is educate the psychedelic and also the weed bigots because some peoples brains cannot handle this stuff it's that simple they will fall of the edge of the world and you cowards will have nothing to say to them there I've been there where I didnt regain my normal mind for many many months and would have flashbacks all the time and thought I would be insane for the rest of my life how dare you cowards try to downvote the truth of my experience. You can say this and that all you want YOU WILL NEVER GET ME TO FALSIFY MY EXPERIENCE !!!!! YOU WILL NEVER TAKE AWAY THE TRUTH OF MY EXPERIENCE !!!!! THE TRUE STORY OF INDIVIDUALS **EXPERIENCE** AND SUFFERING STANDS FOR ITSELF IN ITS TRUTH, LIGHT, AND WISDOM ITS NOT FOR ANY COWARDS TO NEGATE AND BRING OR TEAR DOWN.",1604188876

&gt;A ton of cops move into sales.

Great idea!

&gt;Claims investigation and management in insurance is a path too. Even if he was only patrol he'll have some investigative experience to point to. 

Yes, this would be very ideal. Do you know if insurance companies hire ex-cops for these positions?

&gt;Corporate security is usual very well paying and i don't mean the uniformed security but consultants or management. 

You mean designing the security setup?

&gt;Various positions in the local or state government hire a lot of cops too. Workers comp investigation, human resources, DoT positions, DoR investigators, and a lot more.

Another good idea. I'm not sure many of those places are hiring right now with budget cutbacks.

&gt;The bigger problem is he's been driving a truck for a few years now. He's going to have to explain how any of those police skills are still applicable. 

This is why I hate hiring managers.

It's like a comedian telling an old joke. People recognize it as a joke, they see it was once funny but they already heard it and it's been used up by now.)

But worse, the crisis-chasing has lead to a point where Americans don't seem able to piece it together that being in a constant state of anger, fear and anxiety might not be a great way to live your life, to the point of correcting each other and even themselves when they feel joy ""inappropriately.""",1604188876

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

I have seen many more to others than I have experienced,  the worst of which were the Musgrave Incident and the piercing of a fencer's hand I mentioned in the other thread.

I'm bummed because I had to come along way mentally to get to this point where I can have fun with men I find physically attractive. It's not easy. Sex produces hormones that are beyond our control. I kind of had to out-dirty talk him to find a comfortable place, and because of my age, I am able to clearly articulate my sexual preferences and ways I liked to be pleased. Which might be a shock for a young guy. 

But it's funny how in a world of porn, when it comes to guys, a porn-addicted virgin and a womanizer can seem about the same. He talks like he has ""experience"", (i.e. I said I liked doggie, he lol'd and said it's because I don't have to do any of the work... but anyone that knows good sex, both people are working. amirite... it's not just the movement, girls can tighten up etc.).

&gt; 2 Min Read.BRASILIA - Brazilian Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello is in stable condition in a hospital after being diagnosed with COVID-19, the ministry said in a statement on Saturday.

&gt; Bolsonaro recovered from a bout of COVID-19 in July.The president said Pazuello&amp;#039;s case was another instance demonstrating that the controversial drug chloroquine helped those with COVID-19 to recover quickly.

&gt; Pazuello, an active-duty Army general without a medical degree, has expanded access to chloroquine and allowed it to be prescribed to virtually anyone who tests positive for the coronavirus.

"Necrontyr","t5_325hw","In theory, he can heal 4 wound per turn, one for living metal and up to 3 from his Matter Absorption, but he only gets the extra heal chance if he kills at least one vehicle. So, if somehow you get that line shot to kill 3 vehicles, he has a good chance at getting 3 wounds back from that. He gains nothing if he is up against non-vehicles.

And his weapons only gain the extra damage profile if targeting a vehicle.

Those two right there make him best used while up against massive amounts of vehicle lists.

Now, his line ability can kill up to one model per unit from the targeted unit and any unit that the line goes through.  Granted, he can use the attack in melee, but he will only be able to target units he is in melee with, and the line does nothing there. Might be able to kill one more model that survives his Powers, while in melee.

He does have a good amount of attacks, 5 base, using spear against basic marines is 3.47 wounds, so 1 dead marine, one with 1 wound, then the tail for another 2.2 max average wounds, so 3 dead marines from melee.

Or 5+d6 from the tail, same marine example: 6 attacks averages 2.22 wounds, which is 1 dead marine to a max of 11 attacks which averages to 4.07 wounds, which is only 2 dead marines.

So, once again, a solo Void Dragon on an objective marker is not a for sure way of holding the objective.

If the game was about killing units, it might be okay. But the game is all about getting objectives now, this is where this idea for this exact list, in this exact situation is not a good idea to do.

# October Mod Report

* Began a revision of our current policies page in order to better assist the team and its moderation.

* Discussed whether to host a megathread for Netflix‚Äôs upcoming anime announcements:

 - The official Netflix account will host the thread themselves. **[vote passed]**
 - The thread will be stickied on the front page. **[vote passed]**
 - Remove threads of said announcements posted outside the megathread. **[vote passed]**

* Added /r/goodanimemes to the list of subreddits given by AutoMod when removing meme posts.

* Discussed whether comments from the submitter (within self-promotion threads) affect their ratio:

 - The mod team believes that the submitter‚Äôs comments should not affect their ratio. **[vote passed]**

* Discussed whether to ban the usage of ‚Äúautistic/autism‚Äù and related words as insults regardless of the target. **[vote failed]**. *The terms can be used towards fictional characters, shows and as a phrase in general; it will only be removed when used to insult a real person*.

* From the point above, we began discussion about hosting a subreddit-wide census/poll to measure the community‚Äôs perception of controversial terms, as well as other miscellaneous information regarding sub demographics. This is still in the planning stage.

* Added ‚Äústable framerate‚Äù to the list of clip quality guidelines. **[vote passed]**

 - Users can only post clips (in general) twice per month. **[vote passed]** *The current restriction is once per week*.
 - Clips should require the episode number in title. **[vote failed]**
 - A blacklist of shows will be introduced, which will change on a monthly basis; clips from an anime on the list will not be allowed for that entire month. **[vote failed]**

* After analyzing front page data over a period of time, the team started another discussion regarding clips, their purpose and our expectations regarding the subreddit. This is still in progress.

* Established a concrete policy regarding ‚Äúwho would win‚Äù posts:

 - These posts should be allowed without any restriction. **[vote failed]**
 - These posts should be allowed when the submitter provides specific conditions. **[vote passed]**
 - These posts should be allowed when the submitter provides their own analysis. **[vote passed]**
 - If these restrictions are ignored, the post will be removed as ‚Äúlow-effort restricted content‚Äù. **[vote passed]**

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

We are told to present new content daily, but most of read that line to mean ‚Äústudents must have meaningful work daily.‚Äù I teach HS math and I present notes in class and at-home days are for practice/assignments. We‚Äôre supposed to have Friday remote assignments, but for my Ss that means Friday or Monday depending on which days they attend. 

I personally LOVE having only half the kids on this hybrid model for HS. The only thing I‚Äôd change is running buses on Fridays for students that want to come during a set time period for tutoring or extra help. 
I can help everyone in class every day if there‚Äôs questions after notes when there‚Äôs only 7-15 in the room (the weirdly split groups where I only have 3-6 on a certain day are kinda boring though). Everyone has room to spread out. 

I have students working during the day on their work days so they have every evening free to do homework. Others get more work hours in during the evenings after school and then work on school work all day the next.",1604188890

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","It's tempting to be skeptical of China's numbers, but I will accept them at face value for the purposes of this discussion, since it is too easy to be skeptical of statistics that don't fit one's current theory.

When I said ""it's quite obvious that less human to human contact will result in less spread of a contagious disease"", that is of course an admission that a certain kind of lockdown _necessarily_ will work.  But given that that kind of lockdown seemed to entail literally locking people in their homes, it is unfeasible in a free society like the USA.  While it's not currently politically palatable to say so on the left where I am (and probably won't be anytime soon), the cost of that free society may just be that a pandemic can occur that results in a 10% increase in the death rate for a period of time.

A huge source of political conflict in 2020 has been in the inability or unwillingness of the media, political leaders, and internet denizens to recognize that these sorts of trade-offs exist; and that disagreements largely amount to a difference in valuing the trade offs on both sides of the coin: how effective are certain kinds of lockdowns in preventing deaths, and how bad are lockdowns for society.",1604188891

It's the polling equivalent of knowing not to conflate correlation with causation. If this is true, that does such a massive hit to her credibility that it makes her entire poll questionable because what other basic mistakes is her firm making?

If she weighted by education it would probably make the poll show Trump up double digits, and that makes this poll even more of an outlier than it already is.

Wrong. The right to life does not cancel out the right to bodily autonomy. Ever heard of the violinist problem? Can the state force a kidney donation from an unwilling citizen because they're a match for someone that would die without a kidney? 

The answer is that no, the right to bodily autonomy outweighs the right to life. I cannot be forced to sacrifice my body to save your life. Ergo, a mother cannot be forced to bring a healthy pregnancy to conclusion either. It's her body, she's allowed to put a coat hanger inside her body the way she wants to, she's allowed to poison herself badly enough to miscarry while surviving. And if she's not allowed to do those things, women aren't full citizens/humans. 

And if women aren't full humans to ""catholics"", the state doesn't need to tolerate their ideas any further than sharia law. Why on earth would anyone ever expect me to consider their opinions on law if they violate the very principle our state is founded on and the contract between priests and rulers that has existed for all of Christianity? God makes the laws in heaven, men make the laws on earth. If our laws anger god, we reap the consequences later, but we have to be free to make those laws. 

The law says I'm right, the concept of statehood says I'm right and Catholic theology says I'm right too. Priests do not make laws, they give spiritual guidance. They tell you not to have an abortion, but they don't force you to carry a pregancy to term. Know your place.",1604188892

"OnePieceTC","t5_36oy2","That multi looks good. 

I would consider Vivi/Rebecca a top tier sub legend mostly because their swap effect is really good, similar to why Shanks Crew is so popular. But Mihawk/Perona is still very strong with their unique conditional attack and potential to go around all debuff protection. Having Kidd now will make things easier as he is recent and all upcoming content will be designed for him for at least a few weeks. Overall it is a good start for an account and worth keeping a hold of in case it takes too long to find a better reroll.

I think the best to actually hope for is getting Shanks Crew + at least one of the following: Vivi/Rebecca, Luffy/Law, Sabo/Koala, V2 Snakeman",1604188892

"coaxedintoasnafu","t5_2w7ch","Don‚Äôt gatekeep struggle and distress. 

Both places can suck, and people in America can struggle just as much as you in war torn Lebanon. Poverty in America is a serious problem. Millions of people are starving, living on the street, struggling with mental and physical health, being murdered by the cops, being murdered by far-right fascists, being bankrupted for getting sick, working 16 hour days and barely surviving, being constantly abused by the government and the corporate oligarchy that runs the country. And what makes it worse is that the US is the richest country in the world, yet 50% to 75% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck, 25% have no savings, and 30% couldn‚Äôt come up with $400 in an emergency.

The struggle of poverty is massively damaging to your mental and physical health whether you live in a war torn country or in the richest country in the world. And the effects of poverty go far beyond your immediate material needs. 

Poor people in cities (particularly black and brown people) face systemic and pervasive struggles every day. Their communities are decimated and they have few opportunities to leave. People live in food deserts with no access to healthy food in the middle of major cities. Education funding is tied to property taxes, so if everyone is poor, their schools get no funding. If a kid even manages to finish the subpar education that‚Äôs available to them, there are no decent paying job opportunities. People are working minimum wage jobs, but unfortunately, 40 hours a week at minimum wage isn‚Äôt enough to afford rent in any state in the US. You can‚Äôt pay rent, utilities, food, healthcare, so you turn to crime because it‚Äôs the only way to survive for a lot of people. Now you get arrested for selling drugs, go to prison for years, and when you get out you‚Äôre a felon. You can‚Äôt vote, you can‚Äôt get a job, and you‚Äôre further discriminated against in your own community. You‚Äôre stuck in a cycle of poverty and your children will be probably be too.

I understand that you have struggles, but so do other people. I don‚Äôt know what picture you have of the US in your mind, but a whole hell of a lot of people are living in what is basically a war torn country here. This was a drug and economic war, but I assure you, the results are largely the same for many people.",1604188893

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

I know you don't care, but once I turn 18, I plan on going to college to major in education and minor in atomic physics, world history, and philosophy. My local college is a community college, so I graduate at 20, allowing me to start teaching history (or science, I kinda don't care lol) to gather the money to move out to a more Liberal area. I also plan to start saving up after getting my first job this summer, when Fauci says things will largely be back to normal.

"gerbil","t5_2sof2","&gt;what kind or mix of substrate/bedding is best?     

In my opinion the ""tea bag"" paper bedding, specialized paper bedding or hemp is the best.  It's generally a good idea to avoid other wood shaving based bedding due to respiratory issues.   Some people swear by peat soil, but wouldn't recommend this for a beginner.  




&gt;If getting 2 male gerbils should I have them neutered when appropriate?     

You should get either 2 females or 2-4 males.  neutering is dangerous (and sometimes expensive) for small animals.  Males housed together don't need to be neutered without a female.   

&gt;Do gerbils need any kind of lights during the day?    

No, they should be fine with regular sunlight.  

&gt;I will be looking into a tank instead of a cage since I read it‚Äôs safer for them...I assume it‚Äôs basically a fish tank? (10 gallon size per gerbil)    

I have a 280L (70-80 Gallon) for my 2 Gerbils.  I personally recommend getting at least a 40 Gallon.  20 Gallon for 2 Gerbils is an absolute minimum and not a recommended amount.   
  
&gt;Is it safe to leave them in case of vacation or emergency?     

I'd always recommend using a pet sitter who is familiar with small animals.  You can never premeditate all possible issues.  I'd imagine that if you provide them with the chew type foods, multiple water sources, a good scattering of regular food and a clean tank that they would likely be-able to take care of themselves for a few days, maybe a week.",1604188897

That provides you no additional security that what you could do with an intelligent proxy. You can effectively segment off portions of the network in a scalable manner with stateless filters as well. Am I going to get any benefit in turning on DPI/TLS Decryption on all traffic? No - more than likely you're going to see a ton of false positives and having to go through every alert will lead to alert fatigue, and missing critical attacks because they're buried underneath a deluge of bullshit.

Then it just becomes a good old fashion witch hunt.
If you punch and or are violent towards those you hate they will gain from it. They will show the world just how bad you are and good they are. It will have the opposite effect of what you are trying to accomplish. I mean its corny as hell but the only way to stop hate is to not associate with it and discourage it peacefully.

Your mum's dude sounds like a douche and not worth the time. A grandpa at 33? Pffft. If that's a deal breaker for him, ok,  but I don't think there's anything ""disgusting"" about the baby being already an uncle. You're not the first family something like that happens ever.

"rant","t5_2qn2b","Don't give up. I think that you are amazing for dealing with anxiety and still doing your schoolwork, even if it isn't perfect. I've never had anxiety, so I don't know how that feels, but I know that it's rough. I do know how loneliness feels though, and I'll talk with you if you need someone to talk with, even if it's just sharing jokes or talking about random stuff. I don't care if you think you're ugly. I don't care if you view yourself as less than others. That just means you have the capability to learn and grow without your view being clouded by pride. One of the most annoying things is when people view themselves as better than everybody else, and you're about as far from that as you can possibly be. But just because you recognize the areas of your life that need improvement doesn't mean you have to linger on them. Instead of complaining about how you view yourself, do something to change it! And beyond just finding ways to improve yourself, admire the parts you do like! Surround yourself with people who will support you and accept you as you are. You can't be completely defined by what other people expect of you. If somebody says you're ugly, go ahead and prove them wrong by being the person you want to be. If you are the only person saying that you're ugly, stop expecting to be a magazine cover model. Does everyone you pass on the street have a perfect face, or a stellar body? No! That would be absurd! You are human, just like everyone else, and even the most perfect looking people have their own share of scars and insecurities they deal with.",1604188900
"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","never said there wasnt a whole world of stuff to do and farm but to do meaningful progress for characters it still requires resin cause promoting lvling and talents still use resin resources.

whale only would be the scenario of losing its casual playerbase because the game is just as time consuming as other gachas while the progress is minor due to resin and it being written off as grindy but not rewarding and not some pay2play wall you try to put up.  
  
you re starting to assume things like me wanting everything for free while my argument is that the primogem rate and prices are bad where you can expect a new toy every 2-3 months as a low spender while as a f2p you look at 6-9 months.",1604188900

Title: **Can my insurance provider force me to use their HSA manager?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I have an HSA account that is already established and growing. It's a cheaper account than Payflex would be and it's already setup.
&gt; 
&gt; When I called the INS company and asked if I can move it they told me know that I'm required to use Payflex. It seems shady that many of the big INS companies force their people to Payflex. Is there any way out if it?

&gt; Crew changes are always a &amp;quot;Logistical puzzle&amp;quot;, according to Mr H&amp;oslash;jgaard - who is also the chief executive of Anglo-Eastern, a manning agency that currently has 16,000 seafarers on ships around the world.

&gt; Cocoa, soybean oil, vanilla and palm oil are all shipped from different parts of the world before they&amp;#039;re made into soap or ice cream - which are then shipped elsewhere.

&gt; Unions have already taken action in Australia, where two ships have been detained by the authorities after unions reported them for keeping seafarers beyond the legal limit.

 That was the most rational explanation at the time.

They did a safety talk and then a talk around a bike, maintenance etc. Then a talk about gear. After that it's on the bikes in a tarmacked area. I started off on a 125 learning clutch and gears etc. Riding round in circles and then figures of 8 etc. Take your time and enjoy it, dont rush yourself. Use it to get used to the bike and ask any questions, there's no silly questions. I took to it quite well so they let me have a go on a 500cc they had there. Felt a lot better than the 125 and they said I was able to use that on the road section if I wanted. I wasn't expecting it but was going to be doing direct access and felt happy so took that. The road bit is 2 hours long. We went out 2 students per instructor. If you've got lots of road experience it will help, if not just take your time and don't worry about pulling over if you feel uncomfortable with anything. 

Remember, its not a test so you can't fail. You just need to complete it. They will be assessing you during the part in the tarmacked area to make sure you're going to be OK on the road bit.

Tested a few products and creatives, and soon enough found one that outperformed the rest, so decided to scale it aggressively and by mid Oct had a campaign running at $2k at around 2.5 ROAS. 
Then scaled it to $3k(daily) on ~ 15th Oct, and everything went to shits for the following 2-3 days, after slowly downscaling it we had to go all the way down to $150 daily spend to be profitable again.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined post &amp; comment karma

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

A state can set a higher minimum than federal, but if state minimum is lower than federal, federal minimum applies. ""Split wage"" is because federal law requires that if more than 20% of the time (over a pay period) of someone getting the lower ""tipped"" wage is spent doing work that can't earn tips, they have to get full minimum for all their time in that pay period.

Waiting around for an order to come in doesn't count to the 20%, but folding boxes, helping out on the makeline, washing dishes, etc. all do. By having the ""split wage"" it avoids the need for time tracking because they aren't getting the lower ""tipped"" wage while doing non-tippable work.

The reasoning being that the burden of proof is a ‚Äúmere preponderance‚Äù as opposed to the criminal ‚Äúbeyond a reasonable doubt‚Äù. Think 51% instead if 99.9%. It follows that it is easier to convince a jury.

EDIT: Remember that a civil finding of guilty cannot carry any incarceration. That‚Äôs because of the lower burden required. There is also a cap on the monetary judgement. That varies from state to state. I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs enough to ‚Äúhurt‚Äù any billionaire though.",1604188905

"JenniferFairgate","t5_3a9abr","Fair enough. I understand your discomfort with the case conclusion. I enjoy the speculation, but going back and forth about the same thing is just not in my interest. I want to see if this (her identity) can actually be solved since there has been a massive digitization of records from years past made available on the internet. Completely understanding that this all will rely on whether or not she made any hint, knowingly or unknowingly, to her identity. If not, hey, it's going to be a fun investigation.

I'll take a look at the phone numbers along with potential variations of misdialings and correlate that to digitized phone books from around 1995. Drawing special attention to any in the area of a Rue de la Station #148 (a long shot, but worth a chase). From there I will look at census records, phone book name/address entries, archived newspapers (especially obituaries with matching surnames that typically list next of kin), etc. Maybe that surname is associated with a missing person's report around 1995. Basically, variations of the numbers she dialed, if they were to her kin, May reveal a registered surname and therefore address. Perhaps that surname comes up in archived newspapers as filing a missing person report. I have a small hunch she might have tried to contact her kin (of some sort) while contemplating suicide. I believe the police took this angle but I have never heard of them attempting any other variations of the number. That would be more productive than sitting around throwing darts at the board without digging into potential clues. When I fail? Probably, but for myself I'm going to rule a lot of things out.",1604188905

The issue isn‚Äôt that the pay isn‚Äôt great while on assignment. The hourly numbers are good... H pay and OT, etc. But here in R5 many feds work along side state and local cooperators who have much better hourly pay and are portal to portal.

Fed seasonals have no retirement either. By comparison, state and local seasonal fire folks pay into retirement and at least have something to show for those years.

"Starfield","t5_3g41m","I do not know about impossible, but yes, it is conceivable the game won't release in 2021.  

1)  We've no idea how close to finishing production BGS is with Starfield. 

2)  MS acquisition of Bethesda/Zenimax won't be finalized until early to mid year 2021. If the game is ready, marketing likely won't take place till after that.  6-7 months of marketing might be enough, but MS could alter that start depending on their own judgement, and what other games they want to promote from other studios. 

3) COVID .... it's not looking too great here in the States right now. While it sounds like the move to working remotely has gone smoothly, I seriously doubt BGS has been able to stick to their original development schedule... most every person I've talked to who now works from home says worker productivity and meeting target goals has been compromised, it takes longer due health and other familial concerns, often related to children homeschooling/remote learning etc.  I'm sure BGS is weathering similar factors. 

That being said, if BGS is in the QA stages, well, this is a 2021 4th quarter game. Todd and Pete, have said ""Be very , very patient""   WE should all be heading back for  a re-fill from that well... game is not likely to be dropping in the next 6 months....",1604188906

&gt; Crew changes are always a &amp;quot;Logistical puzzle&amp;quot;, according to Mr H&amp;oslash;jgaard - who is also the chief executive of Anglo-Eastern, a manning agency that currently has 16,000 seafarers on ships around the world.

&gt; Cocoa, soybean oil, vanilla and palm oil are all shipped from different parts of the world before they&amp;#039;re made into soap or ice cream - which are then shipped elsewhere.

&gt; Unions have already taken action in Australia, where two ships have been detained by the authorities after unions reported them for keeping seafarers beyond the legal limit.

"BaldursGate3","t5_12967t","Having a separate layer option akin to makeup and tattoos for freckles, dirt/grime, and blemishes would be awesome. Also, adding some of my own opinions to this. I'd just like to see more traditionally unattractive features in character creator. Just gonna mention a few thoughts I had when messing around with the character creator.

Older faces. Slapping a big white beard on a young face doesn't really give you the wizened old wizard look you'd typically expect.

Blind/clouded eyes. You can kind of already get away with this aesthetic with certain eye colors, but it would be cool to have the option to have one or both of your eyes have a cloudy or damaged appearance. Hermit druid and blind monk characters will absolutely be desired tropes when those classes are available. &gt;!might also apply this as a temporary visual effect to an eye damaged from a certain botched surgery for example!&lt;

More hair options. Almost definitely in the works already, but playing around with the creator I was trying to recreate some famous faces that I couldn't even approximate with the options available. Hornless tieflings are a thing, but hard to make a believable hellboy without sideburns and the balding option that's there already doesn't do it justice. Also just like, a mustache with no soul patch would make it much easier to make a good Freddie Mercury once bards are introduced.

And since I'm being picky, gimme a lightning bolt tattoo across the face and a mullet so I can properly make a gith Ziggy Stardust.",1604188908

"HPfanfiction","t5_2t100","After all the crap Harry had to go through there? Negative evidence just makes him putting up with it for the majority of his life feel meaningless.

It's more for validation. For Harry's AND Dumbledore's sake. It would make Harry feel better. And Dumbledore look like less of a... an uncaring so and so.

There's a movie called *Would You Rather(2012).* The protagonist goes through a torturous (literally tortured) gameshow to get enough money for her brother's medical treatment. I'll twist the plot here a bit for this example (so no spoilers): Imagine winning (with great suffering on your part), heading home and finding out your brother had a miraculous recovery? Yeah, that's how I would feel every time Dumbledore says Harry has to go back and there's no evidence to support Dumbledore's reasoning.

Fanon does have some things right. The magical world is kinda sheep-like. With nobody to point them around, they will just putter about until things boil over again. And everyone falls victim of the ""But everyone says-"" excuse.

Edit: Holy crap, I submitted by accident and got distracted... ANYWHO\~ continuing.

It's just as valid for ALL of the bad guys (Death Eaters, Blood Purists, and even Voldemort himself) to go ""Dumbledore has to have put countless protections on Potter. We'll have to strike somewhere else."" When in reality, the ""protections"" are either not worth much (they are charged by him being there \~1-1.5 MONTHS a year), uber serious wards that ONLY work against Voldemort, or they aren't even working because of the Dursley's treatment of him.

For authors like Stephen King who have been so frequently photographed, interviewed - when I read his books I picture him sitting there typing away at a computer. I wish it wasn't that way.

If for example, an author is a lot older than me - subconsciously I may be reading and think 'well an older person would think like that' etc. I don't want to know their age. I'll cover up their photo as I'm browsing their Kindle author page even. That's a big one but also their views on current events, not interested.

I like to think of a story created 'out of the ether' essentially ;) And I'll use my imagination to create how I see it. Good to see someone who can relate to my thoughts on this. I see so many who love to watch interviews and things of the authors they read, which is fair also.",1604188913

Slytherin-

Rachel (no explanation needed) 

Quinn (could also be a Ravenclaw but would get along better in Slytherin) 

Mercedes (she's more ambitious than people who give her credit for, also early seasons Mercedes was kind of a gossip who only seemed to be a loyal friend to Kurt and maybe Artie and Tina)

Ravenclaw-

Tina (she's creative, intelligent, independent) 

Brittany (Smart in her own way, kind of aloof, Marches to the beat of her own drummer) 

Kurt  (witty, self sufficient, Creatively intelligent, artistic) 

Artie (whip smart, independent, artistically creative) 

Gryffindor-

Finn (acts first thinks later) 

Santana (Santana is a hard one to place, shows traits of all houses but I think her bravery and hot-headed Ness over rules) 

Puck (again acts first thinks later, despite some shitty behaviour he can be pretty honourable at times) 

Hufflepuff-

Mike (could also be in Ravenclaw but I think he values being hard working and loyal) 

Sam (literal hufflepuff, unless you come for his friend's so he could also be a Gryffindor) 

Blaine (has elements of all houses but I think he would be placed here)",1604188913

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","That is right, servants do not level up from fighting. You‚Äôll have to use [experience cards](https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Experience_Cards) (colloquially called embers) to level up servants. There are a few ways to get experience cards:
- battle drops (this is occasional and I wouldn‚Äôt count on it)
- friend points summons
- Chaldea Gate -&gt; Daily quests -&gt; Ember Gathering. These quests change every day, and whatever the name says is the class ember you can expect to get from the quests, berserker embers may or may not drop from any of these quests. In the long run, this will be the most reliable way to get embers
- Da Vinci shop, which you can access by going to Shop -&gt; Exchange mana prisms
- event shops, when there‚Äôs an event happening 
- login bonuses and milestones, not a lot is given from these channels tho

When your servants hit level caps, you‚Äôll need to ascend them (aka unlock level cap) by using class pieces and monuments, they drop from battles, are available in event shops, and if you need more, go to Chaldea Gate -&gt; Daily Quests -&gt; Training Ground.

Skills: levelling skills will make world of a difference. To level skills you‚Äôll need skill gems and a variety of other materials depending on the servant. Skill gems can drop from battles and Training Ground quests

If this is too much, early game you‚Äôll only need to worry about levelling. Ascension and skills can come a little later.",1604188915

Where you may not be satisfied is on the highway. You shouldn't expect to go any faster than 70 mph and will find the bike is most comfortable around 50. If you need to you can hit 85 but the bike feels like it is begging for mercy. You can certainly do long rides. I rode mine from Pittsburg to Houston.

There are a bunch of ""dirty tricks"" to untangle the center lines on the water which basically boil down to unhooking and passing the bar through itself which is only possible on a low Y bar. Its really risky though as you can lose the kite completely or end up in a real kitemare where the bar is jammed in the center lines.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Garland isnt an ideal example because that was after they changed it from requiring a simple majority. If it required a strong majority at the time of his nomination they probably would have settled with him since he was a moderate pick. Due to the simple majority rule they were able to take a gamble and bank on winning the presidency later in the year and nominating their own justice. 

Also look at it in the inverse, if the rule was never changed both Kavanaugh and ACB would have been denied their seats. It was a stupid decision to change that rule and I think that decision is the major reason the Supreme court is so controversial now. 

A simple majority rule removes any and all incentive to compromise with the other parties because you don't need to. Requiring a strong majority basically obligates you to compromise because one party holding 75+ senate seats is incredibly rare.",1604188917

"cars","t5_2qhl2","&gt; All of Ford's passenger cars seem to come with the same engine configurations they have since the 90s.

Correct.  Because look at what's happened in the last 20 years: cars don't get much better fuel economy than they did in the 1990s, but they produce far more power.  While that wasn't what ""downsizing"" was originally planned to be, one can argue that going all-in on turbocharging prevent Ford from having to develop larger engines to meet that demand, which reduces the growth of vehicle curb weight.

Of course, that didn't end up mattering a whole lot because of poor weight control in other places, but I digress.

&gt; I guess the Crown Victoria to Five Hundred/Taurus change over lost the V8, but that was the case well before Ford had any turbo options available.

The Five Hundred is actually a good case in point for the concept of downsizing, albeit in a different execution as both the Duratec 30 and the 4.6L 2-valve V8 are NA engines.  The Five Hundred's Duratec produced almost as much power as the Crown Vic's old V8, and had to move a car that was 200-400lbs lighter than the Crown Vic.  I don't know enough about the program to claim what role the smaller engine played in that lower curb weight, but you can be sure that, if the car was enlarged to take the V8 instead, it would weigh more.  That could've been offset by putting a more powerful version of the 4.6 in, but that more powerful engine is also more expensive to produce (as it would have to be a 3- or 4-valve motor).

&gt; Interesting point on the truck engines, but there again, they ended up building a newish V8 anyway. The coyote was launched in the F150 concurrently with the EcoBoost in 2011.

They may not look this way at times, but Ford isn't stupid.  They knew EcoBoost in a truck was a massive gamble; the sentiments thrown out today about why the Coyote is still better than the 3.5L EcoBoost despite producing inferior power, torque, and torque curve were much, *much* stronger among truck buyers back in 2011.  The Coyote was intended to provide them with a competitive fallback offering until EcoBoost had proven itself.

&gt; I do mean to suggest that with so much investment and a decade of experience in turbo technology, a big bore NA pushrod V8 is a weird followup if the high-power turbo engines are cost-effectively achieving their performance/economy and reliability goals.

True enough.  I will, however, reiterate the point from my original reply that the nature of the Modular engine effectively forced Ford to lean on EcoBoost for the F-150.  Because of its immense footprint-for-displacement, Ford couldn't make a V8 with the low-end torque needed to compete with GM/FCA pushrods, never mind while delivering comparable fuel economy.  If they had a pushrod engine available, you'd likely be right in that cylinder deactivation would've been cheaper.  Probably would've produced better real-world fuel economy numbers, too.  On top of this, the reliability questions with turbocharged engines, although perhaps overblown by EcoBoost disparagers, are still valid, and however reliable, a pushrod NA V8 is still a simpler (read as: cheaper) setup than a TTV6.  Ford has also bought into cylinder deactivation for its existing engines: the 1.0L Fox has it (for some reason), as will the Coyote in the 2021 F-150, so they've already got the tech in-hand to economize a new big-block.  Last but not least the 6.2L Boss found in base Super Dutys is coming up (if not past due) for replacement.  The Boss is not only SOHC (which severely restricts its upgrade potential without a redesign), but also pairs with the ancient 6R140 transmission, and both are coming up on over 10 years of age at this point.

However, given the compactness of pushrod engines, and the fact the 6.8L will certainly be paired with the 10-speed transmission, Ford would stand to lose very little but gain a lot by expanding use of this new engine into the F-150 and Mustang lineups.  It'll probably fit anywhere a Coyote will (the larger Godzilla already does), and  There are still a large chunk of F-150 buyers who are adamant about having a V8 truck, even if their number has dropped significantly since 2011, and Ford would be silly to throw them under the bus when they will most assuredly go to GM or FCA instead.  Moreover, they've also flat-out dismissed the notion of removing the V8 from the Mustang, so even if this is a special-edition engine and not a Coyote replacement, it drives home the point.",1604188919

*****
&gt; LONDON - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered England back into a national lockdown after the United Kingdom passed the milestone of one million Covid-19 cases and a second wave of infections threatened to overwhelm the health service.

&gt; Johnson, at a hastily convened news conference in Downing Street after news of a lockdown leaked to local media, said that the one-month lockdown across England would kick in after midnight on Thursday morning and last until Dec 2.

&gt; The new lockdown will heap more pressure on finance minister Rishi Sunak and the Bank of England to increase their already huge support for the UK economy, the world&amp;#039;s sixth-biggest.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","""Which can be directly linked to your economic and family upbringing.""

Please refer to my previous citation, that shows IQ to be majorly down to biological factors. Of course, as the aforementioned studies show; there is some wiggle room in regards to IQ. About 13-44% to be precise (average of around 25% based on the cited scientific papers). The average IQ of a Black person in America is 80, so if we do the maths and understand that 25% of 80 = 20, and that by adding 20 to 80 we reach an IQ of 100. This is still just below the average White IQ, and quite a bit below the average Asian IQ. So even with the best upbringing and all the tax thrown at the issue, it's still difficult to resolve. In fact, I'd argue that evo-psychology shows us that equality is a flawed concept.",1604188920

"LetsTalkMusic","t5_2t4it","it's fine to like older music. most music hobbyists are bound to have at least a few (usually many) favorite artists from before their time. 

the issue with the ""wrong generation"" sentiment is that it's reductive. it oversimplifies and romanticizes older generations because from a distance it's easier to ignore the bad music that was on the charts, and more broadly, the problems and discontents older generations faced. if you were born in another time, your complaints about the world might be different, but you would probably still have plenty of them. 

also, you seem to be generalizing ""the past"" to conflate several different generations. the 50s to the 2000s is a pretty broad span of time during which many social and cultural movements came and went, and multiple generations grew up and gave birth to new generations. for instance: one of your major disappointments with being born more recently seems to be having missed out on artists you love who are now deceased or no longer performing. but every generation has this problem; there is always something you've missed out on no matter what year you were born. if you were born in the 80s, you could have seen Tupac as a teenager, but you would have missed out on Jimi Hendrix, because he had already died. if you were born in the 50s, you could have seen Hendrix as a teen, but Tupac might not have resonated with you as much when he came along in your 40s, because the world of the 90s would be the world of a new generation, and chances are you'd be part of the majority of middle aged people who wouldn't ""get"" new music. being born in the 50s would also mean Elvis was the pop music of your parents' generation. you would be just a baby/small child at his peak. 

TLDR: old music is great. people just don't like when you romanticize and oversimplify the complexities of bygone eras.",1604188920

"TexasPolitics","t5_2t47s","Welp, not Larry and  I don't live in a gated suburb, but I do own several shotguns.  They're mostly novelty guns though since I don't think they're good for anything ""practical"".

That said, I own and carry a gun because I grew up in the deep red part of Texas and I've seen gay friends stomped by good old boys for kissing the dude they were dating in a parking lot (the pearl clutching horror!).  I've had people from the same area ask me how I ended up marrying a minority woman because ""don't you know they're replacing us"" as well as ""well, she seems like one of the good ones, but I never thought I'd see someone from here do that"".  And because I had a couple more good ole boys mad dog me and start to follow me back to my car in Madisonville at Buck-ee's for wearing my ""Make Racists Afraid Again"" shirt.

To insist that people don't ""need"" to own gun is about the most isolated and entitled take I can imagine in 2020 after watching these motherfuckers come out of the woodwork since 2015... We've also been watching the cops murder people, on camera, for nearly 10 years with zero repercussions or real discussion of reform from our leadership, so I'm certainly not expecting them to be of any help if the redcaps decide they want to do shit like this.

So, congrats for being privileged enough to not have to worry about violence directed against you based on race or sexual preference and being lucky enough to live in a world where the cops will come to help you if you need it...  But understand that not everyone has that option.

And as to your earlier comment, about needing to prep if right wingers start shooting up Austin...  They won't be shooting at the capitol, they'll be shooting at minorities and ""leftists"".  If that happens, it's too late to prep.

You probably also want to be aware of what the Lt Governor of Texas is saying about the election, because it sounds like he's **really** hoping shooting starts:

&gt; During the radio interview, Patrick predicted some Texans will take to the streets to protest election results, depending on who wins.

&gt; ‚ÄúIf he wins or whenever it‚Äôs announced, or if he's ahead on that day, I'm afraid our cities are gonna burn in America,‚Äù Patrick said. ‚ÄúTexans, we're law and order people. **We'll follow the law, and for those who don‚Äôt, we'll be ready to take them on.**‚Äù

&gt; ‚ÄúThe Democrats have just decided this election, Mark, we don't have to pay attention to any laws. We're gonna use COVID as an excuse to steal the election, and that's what they're trying to do everywhere,‚Äù Patrick, a Republican, said during a radio interview on ‚ÄúThe Mark Davis Show.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf the president loses Pennsylvania or North Carolina, Mark, or Florida, they'll lose it because they stole it.‚Äù",1604188920

Now if there was a platform that was orbiting the black hole somehow in a fixed location creating an area of intense gravity? That'd make sense, but i mean how would the platform not get sucked into the black hole? Also it'd be the same as every other training room they had, it'd just be x1000+ gravity instead of 100 or whatever depending on how close to the black hole he is. But again, it's anime so anything could happen. ""Making sense"" doesn't really matter in the world of dragon ball all that much.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

"dirtykikpals","t5_2wtau","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/dirtykikpals because your title did not comply with our official [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtykikpals/wiki/guidelines). 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Even in a self defense situation shooting someone with a gun you don't own is going to be scrutinized heavily by the police. In a situation like that most times the justice system is going to try their damnedest to prosecute someone, and it becomes much easier to do so if you kill someone with someone else's gun.  To answer another question don't lock it up. there is no point to owning a self defense gun if you don't have fast access to it, at the most keep the gun unloaded at the magazine separate from the gun (but keep the magazine loaded). Also take her shooting a few times so she can get more comfortable with the idea of having a gun around.  Hope this helps a little bit,  and Sorry for the essay lol.",1604188922

If you want to just be a stronger person generally, cool, then try StrongLifts 5x5, /r/bodyweightfitness, that Greyskull thing or something else. However, don't expect it to make you a better climber, because it likely won't. Climbing is a skill sport, and you have to do it to improve at it.

&gt; Climbing on the home wall is very hard on my forearms because of the overhanging angle of it/size of the holds. A session on there typically lasts 45 minutes to an hour before my fingers get tired and I can't do any more.

And I imagine this hasn't improved at all since you started the 5x5 you're currently doing? Finger strength and endurance *can* be trained, you're just not training them.

You've got two goals and you're combining them in a way that isn't really helping either. Wanting to be a stronger person is fine, but do your lifts and focus on that if that's what you want to do. If you want to climb harder, you need to shift the focus away from the extra stuff and back to climbing.",1604188923

"TheMandalorianTV","t5_u8wq5","I‚Äôm going to do the classic I don‚Äôt have a child but here is my opinion thing: You know your child the best, if she has seen Star Wars and the death, destruction and bad guys in the movies with no ill effects then there should be minimal reason for her to experience any watching The Mandalorian. 

The show is not a comedy, but I can‚Äôt say I would classify it as any darker or more disturbing than anything else set in the Star Wars universe so as such you can safely watch it with her and I am sure she will love it. And if there is anything she finds scary or disturbing (tho I don‚Äôt think there would) you‚Äôll just have to talk to her about it and she will be able to handle it.

As a side note: Children can usually handle quite a lot in fiction. They learn very early what is real and what is fiction. The only difference between children (and people) are what we get scared by or what we find to be too much. 

I know both from my education and personal life that there are things we adults find disturbing and bad that children just don‚Äôt understand the full effect of. An example of this is that children love Coraline because they see her ‚Äòwinning‚Äô and adults find the movie (and book) disturbing because a child is clearly in danger.",1604188923

This is also a false conflation of the issues considering that false rape claims don't need action to be made against anyone, while an actual rape does. I can make a rape claim against you with nothing but your name. I don't even have to have met you before in my life.

So, I'm curious as to what these ""precautions"" would look like, assuming that they're not the same irrational fear and similar actions like not being alone with some random guy that they've only just met.

The stats on rape cases alone are enough to conclude that women's fear of rape from strangers is not warranted since the vast majority of rapes are done by people who were close to the victim - a friend of theirs or their family's; a family member; a previous partner.

Sex and sex hormones definitely play a major role in libido, but the role is complicated and the individual variance is pretty huge.",1604188926

"glee","t5_2royn","Ryder (AKA Finn 2.0 as Finn was also a football player and did use a homophobic slur when talking to Kurt) is a character that is still growing up when he made acted in such a way that perhaps has labeled him as transphobic. He was surrounded by people who for some reason think it is okay to treat LGBT+ people the way they do and who is surrounded by men on teams where masculinity is probably tested daily in various ways (scorekeeping, bullying others, sleeping with as many girls, etc), didn‚Äôt know how to react. It is clear that he developed feelings for this person who Unique was pretending to be and lashed out violently when he finds this out.

Believe it or not, this is unfortunately a common reaction some trans people face when someone finds them attractive and doesn‚Äôt yet know they are trans. So much so that many end up beaten up (A woman was bet the other day during a BLM protest) or killed.

Ohio doesn‚Äôt seem like the most LGBT+ friendly place to be at the time of the show. There are several examples of this being true. (Blaine‚Äôs experience at his high school dance, Kurt being bullied, Dave and Santana hiding their sexuality, Dave getting cyberbullied when his sexuality is discovered, the treatment of Unique by several people at different schools, Unique‚Äôs parents encouraging her to wait until she‚Äôs grown up to love however she wanted to, the fact that there was a commercial about Santana‚Äôs sexuality for the world to see which was supposed to be something bad to get Sue less votes). Ryder and others who share the same sentiment (Jesse wasn‚Äôt too happy when Unique performed as herself instead of Wade), chose to act based on what they thought was appropriate given what they have observed their whole lives, and by many people in their community.

While it is shocking and disappointing to see Ryder react in such a way, it is not unrealistic given where he grew up and the assumed treatment of LGBT+ people in Ohio (Lima and Westerville are pretty far apart).

The importance of this story (and Finn‚Äôs in season 1) show us that people do change and learn to accept others who are different. Some years ago, gay marriage was illegal. People were against it. People changed their minds and now it's legal. Today, the supreme court ruled that people can not get fired for their sexual orientation or transgender status. It wasn't always this way.",1604188926

3. The last world, would be a world wide web world. This is one where you pick a plot of land and make it your own. This one would play like the Sims Online, except more immersive. Where you could own stores, go to work, everything you can do to an extent in real world. As it would start you could have the stereotypical sims jobs to earn money, but have them cap out fairly early as to encourage player growth. Especially if they found a way to make it so you could have employees of player stores, so if someone wanted to own like a place like Costco they could! Not only that but you could implement farming which would allow for a ton of new jobs and could host events like farmers markets.

Come on, man. 

You mention that Connery's ""Rising Sun"" co-star Wesley Snipes is really the Asiaphile ...

and then you casually mention that you like him in ""The Rock"" where he was ""paired up with another Asiaphile, Nick Cage though.""

Coincidence? Maybe. But men are judged by the company they keep.

If that's not enough for you, have you seen his ""classic"" 007 role in ""You Only Live Twice""?

[https://youtu.be/JLau1ANQO2I?t=74](https://youtu.be/JLau1ANQO2I?t=74)

There's more of that where that came from.

I think the difference is more generational than essential. Snipes and Cage are younger and dorkier, so they wifed their Asian fetishes. 

Connery's old school man's man, from an age where white men were above all, that's why he's getting so much love. And for these types, Asian women aren't worthy of wifing, just disposable tail.",1604188929
"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","On the genetic side, Human babies have evolved to have a very dissonant and loud sound; known as crying. Usually a cry contains two main harmonics areas, one being the early unisons to help with volume, the other being loud pitches that fall between the 6th and 7th degrees in a musical scale. The 6th-7th degree area causes high dissonance and alerts the parents to the baby, ensuring that the baby is cared for. It can be assumed that early humans were poor parents for the most part, and these were genetic things that occurred over time. In fact, probably over 50% of people's interpersonal actions, including anxiety, are genetic adaptations specific to humans.",1604188929

I was debating if I should just shell out for the cordless which is within reach and he's trying to give me the wrong voltage battery and then telling me I have the wrong voltage (I picked out the right one first, he corrected me and gave me the other one, then pointed out it was wrong like he was scolding me). I had to politely put it back just bc I was getting irritated.

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Spurgeon Study Bible owner here: 

I have really enjoyed the study bible so far. You get snippets here and there of Spurgeon's commentary on the text plus a few sermon outlines on select passages. There isn't commentary on every page though, which could be viewed as a good or bad thing, so sometimes the pages will just be the text itself. 

As someone who enjoys the ESV, I have also been super impressed with the CSB. It's very readable and doesn't force me to figure out mentally how long is 30 cubits. The font and size are good, too.

The downfall of the Spurgeon Bible for me though is the lack of cross references. You get a couple here and there, but as someone who enjoys seeing how the Bible connects across books, that has been disappointing.",1604188930

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","The point was made that breeding by eating humans, and especially evil humans, caused them to become wicked. However, as far as Youpi, Pouf, Pitou, and Meruem go, I don't think they can be called evil or immoral. The three Royal Guards actually act according to their biology - feeding and protecting the King, who to them is the only life that matters, and who also has that outlook: only he matters. Meruem compares slaying humans to what we do to ""inferior"" animals, such as slaying cattle to feed. But, arguably more importantly, none of those four ants feels empathy, and the Royal Guards don't even make their own lives a priority, so I don't think morality applies. 

Empathy is why Gon gets mad at Nobunaga in Yorknew: if you are capable of it, which until that moment he had not believed the Troupe to be, and there are people you care about, there is no reason why you should not extend that to others, and that is what makes your actions right or wrong. Hisoka, on the other hand, feels no such thing, which I believe is part of the reason Gon does not hate him (although the fact that he revels in how evil his actions are does still make them ""wrong""). 

The Royal Guards and Meruem, however, follow the priorities dictated by their biology, even though Komugi's arrival perverted them; and as soon as Meruem became attached to her, came to care for her, and thus to feel empathy, *that* is the moment when we can begin to call his actions wrong... although he does seem less constrained by biology than the Royal Guards, so one could just argue that he was an egomaniacal prick all along. As far as Youpi, Pitou, and Pouf go, however, I am not comfortable calling them ""evil"", even though from humannity's perspective they are villains,",1604188931

Hermione says that ‚Äú it‚Äôs supposed to smell different to each of us, according to what attracts us, and I can smell freshly mown lawn and new parchment and-‚Äú  we obviously know that at this point she is attracted to Ron but his does fresh parchment relate to Ron? It relates to Hermione though because she loves work and parchment is part of that. As to what the person would smell if they are already under a love potion then that‚Äôs a different matter. I believe that they would smell still what attracts them (e.x. The parchment for Hermione) but they would also smell that of the person they are now infatuated with. For your third point I think that Harry had not been optioned yet. At this point we know of no fights between her and Dean and for all we know she could have been happy. She probably still liked Harry but had just lost hope. However if she was happy with Dean at the time then I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in Ginny‚Äôs character potion Harry( I don‚Äôt think her optioning him in general is in her character but that‚Äôs besides the point) so I don‚Äôt believe that at the time he smelled Ginny in that love potion he was under another potions effect.",1604188931

Some of the more general issues I could cite for you include:

* It made it difficult to do any sort of redemption arc for Kylo
* Removed any sort of credible antagonist you could buy into going into the final film
* Turned Finn into a bit of a side character
* Mixed attempts at injecting Marvel like humour
* Much of the plot relies on stupidity of characters in important roles rather than others competence; First Order (FO) failing to target the Raddus first over D'Qar. That whole attack against the Dreadnought. FO engaging in a slow chase rather than jumping ahead... or just sending more ties. Finn &amp; Rose parking in plain sight. Deciding DJ would do though not the code breaker they were looking for. Rey escapes... how? Holdo refusing to talk to her crew, thereby instigating the mutiny and side mission
* The Holdo manoeuvre raising questions retrospectively as to why this has never been used before (amusingly ret-conned and then un ret-conned in EP9)",1604188933

As for mims, I have my doubts bc I think he doesn't separate well. But given his contract and pecking order to contend with, he's likely going to flirt with a floor of wr3 ROS and next year. As for development, I think he could be a fringe wr1 if lawrence/darnold pan out. But I'm preparing for that 7-12 ppr range most weeks until they either...

Land Lawrence and don't draft another wr in the first or second round. 

Somehow ruin the tank job and win a few too many games and lose Lawrence, and still don't draft a wr in the first or second round.

As a lifelong jet fan, I just don't think the jets are ready to support 2 wrs in the next 3-4 years (even with Lawrence). They can never build around an offense.

I think it's fine to want a place to share your joy in something, rather than debate its merits.

I have no strong feelings about QC, but I've been part of other nerd communities (e.g. for a multiplayer video game) where some people seem to fundamentally resent the thing in question, and only stick around out of a combination of habit and spite. They are buzzkills and not in an interesting way.

If you don't plan on getting a partner for him then no also. The 20 - 25 % are completely wrong for de-sexing a rabbit!! I would ask for the source of the information!

When my personal rabbits are involved I get a vet that does a lot of spays or neuters with good results. Get a blood workup before to help rule out any underlying issues. SubQ fluids from the vet before going home. Get pain meds for 5-7 days after giving 2 times a day at a modern dose of 1 mg/kg (metacam). It has been shown that males recover a bit over 1/2 day sooner and females just under a day.

The point is nothing wrong here and it happens almostly with everyone having RCT. If it really discomfort you,  you can ask your dentist to remove 1 mm from the occlusal surface of your molar.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My wife and I bought a house which came with an active AHS policy which covered, among other things, the over 30 year old central AC system.

One *hot* Florida summer the AC died. Called AHS and they arranged for a local tech to come out. That tech assessed the system and said in no uncertain terms that a ""band aid"" fix could be applied, but the same issue would recur later. He recommended replacing the system entirely.

Called AHS and spoke with one of their reps. I explained that my highest priority was keeping my heart attack survivor wife comfortable and cool and relayed the tech's recommendation for full system replacement. In response, they said they would only pay for the band aid fix, meaning that they were perfectly fine with the same problem happening down the road and again subjecting the love of my life to uncomfortable lack of AC.

We ditched them and took advantage of our local utility company's rebates to replace the roof, attic insulation, water heater, and AC. 

Prior to this mess, they'd otherwise lowballed us by offering to replace a shorted-out stove with a black one that didn't match the other white appliances in our kitchen. We weren't looking to sell our home so it was no big deal, but it was a sign of things to come.",1604188936

I bet you waste your seed into napkins, tissue, and tube socks. How sad, wasting all that protein. Wasting all those offspring. Its optimal for me to masturbate with my legs over my head so I can practice stretching before my workout while I obtain my protein. All the gym betas in the locker room just look away in disgust, but again, I wouldn't be offended by an asshole who only focus on vanity muscles.

It‚Äôs clear BioWare had no intention of delivering a meaningful conclusion to KOTOR 2, they even turned the exile into a plot device to free Revan, and then killed her off.

2. Adjudicating individual rights: Maximize the freedom of individuals, determine where the line is drawn when rights clash.
3. Deal with externalities: Regulate those economic activities where the market does provide appropriate controls. In

There is a moratorium on their harvesting in many states where they are native because....they're fucking disappearing. And the ones left are smaller and younger so we are essentially putting pressure on the remaining population to stay small. And since they take a long time to mature to sexual reproduction, they aren't replacing themselves at the rate they are being harvested. 

They are mostly being canned. And sent live to Asia as cargo. Where they are then eaten. 

So while I agree that there is merit and weight to the idea that all living things have inherent dignity and deserve to be free from torture,  i will come down on the side of biodiversity every time.

If you punch me twice, and I then put you into a submission flow chain that runs for 4 minutes where you're doing nothing but surviving. No one will score that for the puncher. But if you beat for 4 minutes and then as the time runs out I end up on your back in a scramble, no one will score that for the grappler. Those are the most extreme versions of that.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I think ideally, a game that takes a handful of mechanics-- rally, trick weapons, ect; and some of the aesthetic horror stuff, but applied it to a significantly different setting would be best. Or maybe different time? I think a direct sequel would be kind of redundant. I could imagine something sort of eastern european, similar time?

"politics","t5_2cneq","  **The 14 Characteristics of Fascism** 

1. **Powerful and Continuing Nationalism**  
Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.  

2. **Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights**  
Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of ""need."" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.  

3. **Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause**  
The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.  

4. **Supremacy of the Military**  
Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.  

5. **Rampant Sexism**  
The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Opposition to abortion is high, as is homophobia and anti-gay legislation and national policy.  

6. **Controlled Mass Media**  
Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.  

7. **Obsession with National Security**  
Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.  

8. **Religion and Government are Intertwined**  
Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.  

9. **Corporate Power is Protected**  
The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.  

10. **Labor Power is Suppressed**  
Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed .  

11. **Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts**  
Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts is openly attacked, and governments often refuse to fund the arts.  

12. **Obsession with Crime and Punishment**  
Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.  

13. **Rampant Cronyism and Corruption**  
Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.  

14. **Fraudulent Elections**  
Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.",1604188941

Let's phrase that differently.  You showed them that you are not only good at what you do, but you have the guts to practice it and keep getting better at what you do!

If your competition can't handle the fact that they did not get the prestigious chair, they need to practice more so that they can get to first chair.

* It did not have a community-approved [tag] **typed** into the title (this is the #1 reason posts are rejected)
* The [tag] was formatted incorrectly (i.e. the brackets were not included or the wrong brackets were used)
* The [tag] was misspelled

&amp;nbsp;

The tag system helps to organize your posts into searchable categories and to filter out spam/bots. If you want your post to make it through my filter, you will need to create a new post, but this time make sure you **type in** a **properly formatted** and **correctly spelled** tag at the beginning of your title. The list of community-approved tags is as follows: 

* [gourmet]
* [medicinal]
* [actives]
* [general]
* [freebies]
* [trade]
* [technique]
* [contamination]
* [article]
* [business]
* [now hiring]
* [meet up]

Descriptions of what these tags mean can be found in the sidebar. If you're still unsure of how to type up your title properly, check out some of the most recent posts on the front page of the subreddit and try to mimic their formatting (you can just copy-paste them into the title if you're still unsure). You can also work off of the examples listed below:

&amp;nbsp;

* ""[]"" ‚Üê these are the proper brackets. Don't use ""()"" or ""{}""

* [You type one of the tags from the list in here, between these brackets] You type a descriptive title/question for your post here, outside of the brackets

* It should look something like this: ""**[General] How do I grow mushrooms?**""

Also, if Momo is shy, like another poster said, the pressure of being alone with maybe just an interrupter in a foreign land could force her further into her shell. Look at Takumi as an example of someone Chigusa worked with that never left Japan. Sure the experience level was different, but Takumi was about the same age when she started working with Chigusa. On the other side of your she must be widely known coin is that a lot of those vets and trainers would have a good idea if they could help her grow or not.

I should mention though if you were buying the gaming magazines available at the time im sure it was mentioned there too.

Not ignorant at all! Gaming was definitely highly regulated, from memory we had altered releases of certain games (San Andreas i think was one of them). I think this came down to no R18+ games so everything had to be tailored to fit under MA15+ guidelines. That being said they changed the rules and we had 18+ games start popping up around 2010 - that might not be exact though.

The best example i could use of a game i would have no idea existed otherwise is Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories for GBA. I was a big fan of Kingdom Hearts but I dont think I ever actually saw a physical copy of chain of memories in stores and from memory GBA wasn't exactly going strong in AUS at that point. That could have just been my personal experience, but I never remember the game stores having big game boy sections of any kind, atleast compared to standard consoles (and then the psp).",1604188942

You'll be delighted to know all those thai trans still have thier biological gender they were born with on their ID's and passports. Again, bark like a dog, wear a muzzle etc, still a human. They also still have to show up for military service, same as any other guy. And I'm pretty sure they're living with a lot less hassle than trans in the west. You gotta LOVE that info lol",1604188942

"Informedgunowners","t5_31340i","I could see improvement to how sales are regulated but more along the lines of making sure databases are updated with records or quality of the background check. In some cases response time has been reported to be an issue. I do like that there is a ""shall issue"" type rule where technically issues can't be used to deny sales. 3 days is pretty reasonable when it normally takes seconds.

Manufacturing is a different can of worms. I don't see 3d printing as legally different than milling a receiver or otherwise building your own firearm. I don't think 3d printing as straightforward as some people fear but it will get there. People can absolutely print plastic gun parts it's just not easy to get the prints good. I personally wouldn't want to fire anything where 3d printed parts were structural.

For the gun control advocate another problem is they aren't trusted by most people who support gun rights. Intentional or not the goal post keep moving. They might argue they support the 2nd but it rings hollow when they also want to ban things.

For the gun rights supporter they might appear obstinate because well they're skeptical of everything and tired of ""compromise"" every so often. Then since to right has claimed ownership of supporting the 2nd their arguments can have problems. When a republican senator talks about how it isn't a gun problem but a mental health or social problem it sounds like an excuse. The next question is then ""well what are you doing to improve metal health or income inequality?"" Then the senator doesn't really have a good answer. That's probably going to make the gun control advocate forget about trying to hear that side all that much.",1604188943

This is less feminine than it is emotionally mature, which is a good thing. I don't think being feminine makes you less attractive though. It's more about the type of woman you meet in your case. There definitely are women who like feminine guys out there for sure.

I don't play games. But have met a fair amount of guys who played league of legends and other competitive game (when I was younger). I don't want to stereotype, but I have never met one who wasn't extremely obnoxious/off putting (in personality). So that may be something putting women you meet off. I'm not going to tell you to stop playing though. People should be free to enjoy life how they want.",1604188944

"u_MyEarthBreeze","t5_2ppewn","Yk, I honestly don't get two things:

1. How this is supposed to help with the problem of pollution? By cutting down on the carbon footprint, sure, but is there some special way this combats pollution? Like contained within the detergent? 

2. Why are people so offended by this? It's not like this commercial is trying to blame YOU personally - unless, ofc, you feel the need to take it that way, I guess. This is genuinely a good product in its early development stages, your questions are being answered, what more do you want from a company that's trying to make the above statement? It's not even like you simply responded to the first thing you saw either: no, you waited until the very end to comment about the WORST part of the commercial. You very clearly cherry picked that one line at the very end of the commercial, when there were several other things you could have taken from this. Why?? Because you want someone to take out your frustrations on?? How does this benefit you, the consumer, and the natural environment? By making YOU feel like you're not causing a world disaster?? I don't get it. Please enlighten me whether it was this commercial that made you feel this way, or your own Insecurities about your contributions to the environment.",1604188944

""Ethniu's good arm blurred. She seized him by the throat, lifted him with no noticeable effort, gave her arm a little bob, a little twist, and broke his neck.""  


She had only one good arm, so it would have been hard for her to tear him in half.  We know Marcone is conversant with most forms of brutal violence, and we have also seen a Fallen accelerate their bearer's thought processes. Either Marcone himself or Thorned Namshiel probably recognized what was coming. How much could have been done to prevent the damage from killing him is up for debate. Also, Ethniu could have been going for the more cruel option of making him a quadriplegic. Hard to say.  


We have also seen the battle forms of the fallen, and some other shape-change masters. Thorned Namshiel's previous host had his back broken and was a paraplegic for a bit before being killed. It is entirely possible that Thorned Namshiel took that to heart, and took measures to make its bearer's spine more durable/less prone to injury.

The upside is they have extra cooling lines, frame reinforcement in a couple spots, beefed up alternator, beefed up brakes and shocks, and oddly I found the ticket light to be pretty damn handy (currently trying to find a replacement cover for it that won't cost me an arm and a leg).

"destiny2","t5_2we4j","First off, using the ViDoc as evidence, barricade energy does NOT recharge while Icefall overshield is active. Additionally, taking hits while your shield is up lengthens the timer, so there is built in delay between uses, on top of the use animation being about 1 second, plenty of time to shotgun or get a kill before the shield pops. Overshield will not be infinite, and will still require some thought to use. ""Support"" does not inherently mean buff teammates.

Second, yes. Combined with top tree sentinel, this exotic would give the ability to be a tank support class. The ability to give yourself an overshield will be immensely helpful for revives in tricky situations, whether it is GM Nightfalls or Raids, which is actually pretty helpful if you care about helping your teammates. The melee ability of top tree will also allow for more constant shields (in PVE), which means that you can keep yourself at high health constantly. Got a job that requires taking a lot of hits? Icefall titan has your back.

Third, with skill, the two new hunter exotics can be extremely helpful. Improved knife throw and target acquisition means that precision throws will be more common and easier to get. Additionally, blink replacing dodge means that you temporarily have NO HITBOX. Essentially, instead of replacing your jump with it like warlocks do, you get both jumps, and the ability to temporarily phase out of existence and doge potentially fatal encounters, and then easily counter your opponent. 

Hope this helps you make sense of it all!",1604188946

also I don't have archived data from 2014 and we are speaking LOR.
I don't see how this affects the conversation.
given that the base character is just the base character. if not y have Ornn be Ornn when you could just have thunder lord Ornn.
as you can tell if you read lore the characters all come from or interact with Runeterra. For an example of what you are saying is like all marvel projects live in the exact same world. meaning Lego iron-man is cannon with end-game iron-man.
anyone who has a critical eye can see that runeterra is the cannon of the league game. 
from recent game reveal if you keep up with the news you saw the cannon characters are all there at no point point did anyone see KDA Ahri or psy-ops Pyke. no one expects that because that is not the cannon lore. and please show me where you see KDA psy-ops and base runeterra people interact.",1604188946

His call was a bad call at the time that he made it.  A bad call that got a lot of people killed.  He 100% did the wrong thing.  That serendipity made it beneficial to their survival doesn't mean he made the right choice at that moment.  

And it doesn't give him a pass on defying a direct order.

This was a couple of years ago and nothing happened, when UK forced one of those mosques to close that was a local Muslim uproar but that's about it. 

It has been also reported many times that Muslim culture doesn't not integrate well into western societies. Which isn't inherently bad -See cultural Jews. However Islam is one of if not the most violent religion which the culture is heavily based on. Many muslims hold shariah law in the highest regard.

Those in power simply don't want to deal with it after they invited these problems. France is now the future of what will happen in UK and Germany soon enough if no action will be taken.",1604188949

If anything, it's their fault the fashion contests are now rigged after LKWD decided to remove the gifts from the contests, but that's a whole different story.

And trust me. Its all false accusations on the reports regardless of the amount of people that report you when you relaize how many trollers are on this game 24/7. You got people that report you just for being silent or not gifting them, and you see stuff like that on this reddit pretty often, yet LKWD seems to not have done anything about it

And, I'm pretty sure everyone still agree's on the wings sucking pretty bad, people are still complaining about it right now, so no denying that it's on LKWD for having the people salty on those wings.

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","to your ""urban"" scene question, pretty much what you colloquially defined in the latter portion of your sentence. Toronto's music scene. studios, house clubs, afro/caribb clubs, uni campuses, dance competitions, etc etc.

I genuinely do not remember hearing a lot of the accent in pre-2015 era Toronto. At a hip-hop dance competition? Yes. At a club? Maybe. At the levels we see today, as you can encounter it pretty much anywhere in the city at any time? Nah. Mind you, I was 21 at the time so if i friends with someone, they were bound to be in the age bracket and often also into hip-hop/grew up in the city. I did not grow up in the city or country personally, and just moved there for work. So I have no reference to what a high school campus in Scarborough looks like.

It's hard to define these things. Some people just incorporate a few words here and there into their lexicon, and mix that into the ubiquitous ""20-something-attending-UofT/Ryerson"" accent. Others sound like they immigrated from the islands three years prior to the conversation you're having. 

The mans working @ a clothing store saying ""wagwan"" when you come in circa 2013? Definitely.

A barista @ one of those trendy juice/smoothie spots in Kensington circa 2013? Unlikely. But nowadays you see it everywhere. Young professionals on Bay street do it when their managers aren't about.

I guess what I'm saying is that there is an element of popularization/trending that's happening with the Toronto road accent. Drake played a major role, although it's hard to stritctly define when/how. He's not ""faking"", just as much as I'm not faking mine when I codeswitch, but he definitely utilizes it to supplement his sound AND his image.",1604188951

"Eve","t5_2qil9","Ohh, ok we're block quoting now. Fun times!

I'm gonna go in reverse order as I'm on mobile while sorting my Pi (Saturday night, woohoo Pi Partaaaay!)

When I say ""I'm no PvPer, I mean I don't take myself as seriously as you clearly do, friend. Try not to take things so literally.

You say you give no thought to the complaints of people who don't like your engagements. Why do you think anyone should care about yours? I actually do care, I'm interested in getting good fights but I also like to win fights, and so if I find a way to consistently win engagements against certain fleet types, I will try to force those conditions every time. 

Now we're getting to the meat of the subject, and the source of the frustration on my side. You see, not all people want a *good* fight per se, they want a successful repulsion of the aggressing force, so that the corpies who don't want to fight can get back to their indi, ratting or whatever. If you go to an area where known PvP guys live, you will get good fights. If you go to where known PvE guys live, you will get blobs or nothing as those guys do not want (and most likely don't have the interest or patience to learn how) to fight you. So there is no point in going there, other than for soft kills (which you don't complain about I presume)

So, the complaints that the areas of space that you visit give entirely predictable responses just seem to be really hollow and - ultimately - shallow, as you already know full well what the response will be. So, just smugpost in local then fly on rather than the whole rigmarole ""you're cancer in this game"" tiresome schtick, rinsed and repeated endlessly here and on the forums.

I am not a PvP FC - never claimed to be one - though as I've said I really enjoy a good scrap and am busy learning how to do so with some modicum of if not skill then at least learned survival instinct. I have been on many a roam looking for engagements though, so I know exactly what you mean here.
 
You know where we look for good fights? Where good fighters live. While the amount of dead space is concerning, where you'll only see scout alts for entire constellations, when we do find an engagement it's always against people who know what they're about. Why? That's great fun! You know where we don't look for good fights? Where the botters and the industry guys live. If we go there, we're hunting soft kills and know exactly what to expect - easy afk kills, duck and cover  or death by extreme blob.

Either way round, I don't go around bitching about how other people play the damn game - unless you're into the whole ""forum posting is meta-gaming"" thing which.... well.... yeah, but also no.

Also worth noting, I'm talking specifically about null here. WH is very different - not lived there, but I know a few folks who have. I imagine, however, that what I've set out above is broadly the same, though anyone living in J space is gonna be either interested in PvP or evicted and penniless, so there'll be some differences too...",1604188951
"sewing","t5_2sczp","I made this costume with inspiration from this post: https://www.sippycupmom.com/daniel-tiger-inspired-costume/

Fur is light and dark brown Sherpa. Hood is lined with fleece and edged with quilting cotton. Hood snaps to a jacket that I bought new. I wanted to be able to keep using the jacket as normal or use the hood next year if he likes it by transferring the snaps.

Where can I find more info on what to focus on first as a new player? The Hyperdrive bundle says it will allow me to upgrade 64 characters, but I have no clue whom to choose. It also allows me to upgrade 16 ships, but I have yet to find out what they are.",1604188953

"BeginnerWoodWorking","t5_3edk4","Well I hate to disappoint, but I went and tested like 8 more  pocket holes. And I felt that the results were still inconclusive.

Only 1 ended up poking out (maybe by a 16th of an inch). I cut out a cross section and could deduce: 

The holes may not have been drilled square. The initial entry on one hole seemed a bit higher than the other (maybe by a 16th of an inch). Either my board was bent, my cut wasn't 90¬∞, or I didn't clamp the board down completely flush on the end grain.

The surface for the pocket screw to rest on down deep in the pocket, after putting a screw in, was lower than the other (the one that poked through). This discrepancy felt closer to an 8th of an inch. Either this was a result from the initial hole entry being off, or I over drove my screw, or both.

Lastly, the end grain didn't seem perfectly 1.5"" on the board I was attaching to. It looked short by about a 16th of an inch. More short on one side than the other.

So my conclusions:

There is much less room between the face and the end of the screw than I imagined.

Likely room for user improvement to begin with (double checking square on end grain, and flushness with jig). 

I'm leaning more towards the direction of the wood I am using being just bad. Too soft, not perfect in dimensions, warpedness. 

What I will do next time:

If I am using big box store lumber (which I'll try to never do again), I'll back my collar off by an 8th of an inch. 

Otherwise I'll use lumber that is true to square and dimension, and run a test on an offcut before anything else. As well as doing better on my side of things as mentioned above.",1604188953

"space","t5_2qh87","#Details:
**Left** is a Single exposure straight out of the camera on how the sky(and particularly the galaxy) looked. **Right** is what I got after stacking 3000+ frames of the Galaxy.

Andromeda Galaxy is about 2.5 Million Light Years away from us. Normally, you'd photograph a subject like this using a motorized tracking mount or at least going to a darker area. I couldn't afford either of those things(the latter due to the current pandemic) so I just took all these shots from my roof instead. I know that some other shots you may have seen of M31 are probably _way_ better than this, but the fact that I could even get Andromeda from a Bortle Class 6 sky was enough for me. 

**If you like this shot, you can check out my other work on my insta @astronot_yet . I do Astrophotography with a cheap/affordable camera and try to demonstrate that beautiful night sky shots are possible even without driving hundreds of miles to a forest or to spend your entire month's salary on buying expensive gear.** 

#TIP:
If you don't like to read a huge wall of text, I would recommend watching 'Nebula Photos' on YouTube instead. He has a series on [Andromeda without a tracker](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrzbdmripj1fZJ-8BWm5CMU_Moj4lBnnk) and it's absolutely the most comprehensive and detailed guide I have ever seen.

#What is Stacking?  
Stacking means taking lots of images of the same subject, align them together and take an average of all the frames. This increases the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the image and reduces the random noise that creeps up in your photos. Bottom line: You can get really high details by stacking multiple images than using just one image. 
 
#Equipment-

Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm telephoto lens, a cheap tripod, a wired remote shutter(optional)

#EXIF: 
155mm, F/4.5, ISO 12800, 2sx3084 exposures


#Process:
1) Getting the focus right is the single biggest challenge while shooting dim objects like these, so I spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible.

2) Next, we need to locate the Andromeda Galaxy. The best way is to download any star chart app, and use the Augmented Reality feature that most of them have these days. I used [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.simulationcurriculum.skysafari5&amp;amp;hl=en_IN) but you can use your own favorite.

3) Point your camera roughly between the constellation Cassiopeia and the star Mirach. M31 should be just a little below Mirach.

4) A remote shutter or intervaloemter is advised to avoid touching the camera again and again and minimize blurriness/disturbance. You can buy a cheap wired remote, or if your camera is fairly new it may already have an intervaloemeter built in. If neither of these are possible, just put your camera in a 2s delay timer and you'll essentially achieve the same result.

5) How to select your exposure length: If you set your camera's shutter duration for let's say 15-20s or something, what you will see are [star trails](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/ua/PegasusTrails.jpg) where instead of pin pointed stars, you'd see them moving in a line, ruining our shot. In order to get sharp looking stars, we use the [rule of 500](https://petapixel.com/2015/01/06/avoid-star-trails-following-500-rule/) which is essentially 
&gt;Shutter duration = 500/(Focal length x your camera's crop factor)

Take a shot, zoom in and check the stars, if you see some trailing, lower your shutter length and test again. For my case, Nikon cameras have a crop factor of 1.5, so at the focal length of 155mm, Rule of 500 gave me 500/(155x1.5)= ~2s.

6) Take as many exposures as you can. If you're already in a darker area, 1000 exposures would be good enough. DO NOT change any settings in between the exposures. It's a good idea to not disturb the camera at all while it's taking the shots.

7) Take a few bias, dark and flat frames. These are called ""Calibration Frames"" and their job is to remove any noise that is being generated by the Camera itself(Heat, dust on the sensor, etc). [How to take these here](http://deepskystacker.free.fr/english/faq.htm#lightdarkflatoffset)

8) After all this, you can use any stacking software to process these shots. My favorite is Deep Sky Stacker and Sequator. Pixinsight is also a capable one, but it's not free so pick whichever one you like. The main job of stacking software is to align all the exposures and then sort of take an average of the frames which decreases noise and increases the Signal to Noise ratio of our image, so the final shot results in extremely high details and very less noise.

9) I processed the result in Pixinsight, and retouched it a bit in Lightroom.


Please note that this is a very simple explanation, and some of the rules and technologies I wrote above might have mistakes, or may not work in your case. Please remember, experiment and experience will give you the best results. Also, if I indeed made some mistakes above, please correct me.

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","Part One: The UK has outsourced their tech support jobs to us, and I'm one of their Employees. If they fuck up, then I'm looking for a job. 



Part Two: We just switched to democracy 30 years ago, after killing our dictator. This has opened our country to capitalism and competition, and perhaps one of our proudest achievements is our robust, high performance and very cheap internet. I pay 10 quids per month for a 1000mbps fiber optic link straight to my bedroom. I can literally switch off the modem while laying in bed. 


But unfortunately, our communist leaders aren't so easily switched off, I'm afraid. They live on, like cockroaches , infesting every branch of our so called democratic government. Resulting in a corrupt government that has allowed the disease to spread as much as it did already. 


What's the UK government's excuse?",1604188954

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","It doenst change that I cant with a good conscious consider someone who gets off on that kind of thing a good person. People are good at talking but painfully bad at doing anything good and the biggest talkers are always the ones who do the least good and do the worst. It's just another facet of social media culture where every leech is looking for their limelight. Great you've cancelled a multimillionaire. Now they've dissapeared from the public eye and can conduct their bad dealings far away from twitter. It's an inconvenience that doenst harm the people it should. And when an average person does something worthy of scorn you've fucked their life up irreparably and done nothing to change their mind.  I've seen it dozens of times where alt right circles essentially adopt people who've been ostracized by the general public and they come back as pundits who once maybe did something wrong unknowingly and now they do the wrong thing intentionally. And why not? No employer wants someone whose branded like that. If the best way to ensure you wont lose your house is by going on some racist dudes podcast well it's that or nothing.

All cancelling does is essentially hide the nastiness from the public eye for the mega rich and for the average it just narrows your career choices to the exact thing people doing the cancelling hate. 

What has cancel culture done to the dozens of celebrities who visited Epsteins Island? Or is it only wrong when a celebrity rapes an intern and not a sex slave? 
Will Smith visited his Island BUT LOOK HES CRYING BECAUSE HIS WIFE CHEATED ON HIM! ISNT THAT SAAAAAD? 
The real evil is still happening and not one of those fuckers cares because they dont care about making the world a better place they care about their image and condemning the most recent person on the mobs hit list is what's in.

-allows you to create a proper model, large with specific relationships among tables. Associative maybe makes this easier, but Tabular is as flexible or more (aggregations, direct query, Dual mode...). Once you understand it properly, it you can create models in many shapes. 
-best in class compression. I've done Over 200M rows on a laptop, and we have a Tabular server with over 5bn rows of data with only 256gb ram
- the dax language lets you do pretty much everything dinamically. It is not  easy, but it is very powerful. Damn fast and flexible. Take a look at stuff you can dinamically do at Daxpatterns.com  . As far as I know it has no rival in this regard. Recently they added calculation groups, which is the icing in the cake. 

I like qliks web environment and it shows, and they have polished it a lot, as they started more from the visualization aspect of business. 
PowerBI started more from the model side (tabular as a replacement for multidimensional), and their first powerbi desktop versions were very weak visually, but with a very good engine. A few years ago their presentation layer was weak, but they have been pushing monthly updates and are quite OK now, while still having the best engine/model. 

I envy what some of my colleagues that work with qlik are able to do in regards with app development, deployment, sharing and saving, etc. They envy what I can do model-wise, and the native support of Excel as a client of my models",1604188958

The making serbia great again politics and your fondness for ethnical cleansings did not helped in securing stability or a stable economy. Ever wondered why there were no english investments in serbia after the balkan wars even though england was the main provider of loans for serbia.

Many years later I live in another state and they live in a different house, and on the phone I brought up that old place, and as an adult now I'm not afraid what they will think so I talked about it and my dad said he had seen them around a lot there too! 

Another time, me and a friend of mine went to a place that was alleged to be haunted and we both saw one moving VERY swiftly along the treeline. We both looked at each other wide eyed DID YOU SEE- yep!!

Saw another in a room of a house I lived in with my ex too but thats a very long story. Anyway yeah they exist haha

"de","t5_22i0","&gt; zwei muslimischen Frauen erstochen 

Das wird hier mehrfach aufgebraucht, aber alles was ich finden kann sind dutzende Artikel die davon reden dass die Frauen verletzt wurden, aber keine ist gestorben. Gibt es da irgend einen Artikel den ich verpasse?

&gt;Das ist eine explizite Assoziation zwischen Terror und Islam. Das f√ºhrt dazu, dass sich friedliche Muslime wie beispielsweise ich kategorisiert f√ºhlen. ""In den Augen der Franzosen bin ich nur ein Terrorist"" ist mein Gedanke. Und dieses Gedankengut polarisiert und f√ºhrt zu Segregation, Radikalisierung und Aggression, auch bei friedlichen Muslimen, weil ihre Stimme unterdr√ºckt wird. Eine Gruppe von Menschen als Terroristen zu beleidigen, die mehrheitlich friedlich ist, und es dann unter den Deckmantel ""Meinungsfreiheit"" zu kehren ist daher falsch und Macron h√§tte diese Haltung √ºberhaupt nicht verteidigen d√ºrfen. Zu sagen, dass der Islam an allem schuld ist, zeigt nur, dass er nicht versteht, wo der Hass in der franz√∂sischen Gesellschaft verwurzelt ist.

Ich will jetzt 100% ehrlich sein. Du gibst dem ganzen doch erst dadurch Feuer, dass du dich dadurch angegriffen f√ºhlst. Wenn ich irgend eine Karikatur von einem deutschen Michel sehe, dann f√ºhle ich mich dadurch jetzt nicht angegfriffen. Egal was. Es ist eine fucking Karrikatur. Ich wei√ü dass unter dem Deckmantel der Satire viel schei√üe getrieben wird, aber es ist KEINE FUCKING ENTSCHULDIGUNG f√ºr was da passiert. Da k√∂nnen die auch gerne Jesus malen wie er kleine Kinde anal fi*** bis sie bluten und dabei lacht ist mir alles egal. Es darf einfach eine Person nicht so mitnehmen.

&gt;In Amerika ist das Wort ""N****r"" nicht gesch√ºtzt durch die Meinungsfreiheit

Es ist frei das Wort in Musik, Film und Kunst zu verwenden.  Es wird in Hollywood filmen, Serien  (in South Park z.B. gerne h√§ufig) verwendet. Es ist nicht frei, es jemanden an den Kopf zu schmei√üen. Eine Karikatur ist nicht dasselbe wie jemandem etwas pers√∂nlich ins Gesicht zu sagen. Ist es einfach nicht. Und selbst wenn ich jemanden so beleidige gibt es ihm keinerlei Recht k√∂rperliche Gewalt anzuwenden. Auch wenn ich dich und deine Mutter beleidige bis aufs √§u√üerste ist das 0,0000000000000 Recht f√ºr k√∂rperliche Gewalt. Eine Klage wegen Beleidigung gerne, aber nichts anderes.

&gt;Es ist auch sehr heuchlerisch von ihm zu sagen, dass doch die Muslime franz√∂sische Produkte nicht zu boykottieren sollen. Boykott ist eine Form von Meinungsfreiheit, welche er ja so sehr besch√ºtzt und wertsch√§tzt. Wenn sie aber gegen ihn gerichtet wird, dann werden seine Knie weich.

Genau so ist es doch seine Meinungsfreiheit diesen Boykott zu verurteilen, weil er aus komplett idiotischen Gr√ºnden geschieht.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","#Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution

- Too many people in America either know nothing about the Panthers or exclusively parrot debunked propaganda talking points that have been in circulation since the 70s. The *actual* Panthers were vastly different from how they were portrayed, and programs such as the school lunch programs were started **entirely** because of what they were already doing, and because they were getting too popular because of it.

#Inside Job

- Vital (and oddly prescient) breakdown on how one of the worst financial crises in American history happened entirely because of unregulated greed and stupidity. Think we learned our lesson? Spoiler: we didn't.

#Alt-Right: Age of Rage

- There couldn't be a more topical documentary to watch with current day events in America degrading by the day. This documentary combs through the exact processes through which white working class people are radicalized, and it greatly exposes the fact that otherwise well-intentioned people are often the ones who submit to the hatred that's spoonfed to them to enrich their identity. Incredibly important.

#I Am Not Your Negro

- Concerning the legend himself James Baldwin, this documentary explores the deeper and *deliberately* avoided conversations that are has in any intimate capacity between white and black Americans. Baldwin fleshes out the differences in his experiences in America and France, and develops the newfound conclusion that many of the institutions of racism in America persist, even to this day, **because otherwise well-intentioned people don't want to talk about it or think about it**. This documentary elegantly uproots the common talking points that depict black Americans in ways that aren't at all objective. Another incredibly important one.

#13th

- A close and extremely uncomfortable look at America's prison system and how it's been augmented in such a way that it provides cheap labor to private interests while ensuring that inmates cannot feasibly break from from the cycle. Moreover, it shows how black Americans were overtly and systemically targeted by this system, chiefly after successful victories throughout American history such as the Reconstruction Era and the Civil Rights movement afterward. This is a painful one to watch.

#Captial in the 21st Century

- Not one that's exclusive to America, but still relevant nonetheless. This one takes a very thorough breakdown of the history of capitalism and how it developed into the titan that it is today. It highlights key players who were responsible for crafting the world we live in now, and the overall persistent sentiment that attempts to justify the notion that people are nothing more than resources to be exploited. This one gives plenty of evidence behind its claims and shows the likely ramifications of a capitalist paradigm, not even just for America, but for the human race as a whole.

#The Social Dilemma

- A sobering and somewhat demoralizing outlook of how social media has been designed to learn more about us than we know about ourselves. The information we unwittingly divulge on a regular basis is readily available at all times to whomever pays the most for it, and said information is also routinely used to manipulate us into buying what we don't want, or worse, doctoring propaganda that's finely tailored to our own biases. This *will* make you view social media and its influence on the planet in a completely different way.",1604188962

Your sister had to make a horrible choice, and instead of supporting her, you went off on her.  And you didn‚Äôt just go off.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA, Idk what cps wants you to work on but you do that and also focus on keeping working, you should look into filing for social security for your daughters, they are eligible for social security from their father because he has passed and that will help you financially support them, then focus all of the rest of your attention on your daughters and becoming a family with the 3 of you. As far as his family goes, none of them have any legal rights to see or spend time with your children and since they are crossing boundries and trying to take them away from you, I would consider going no contact. What he did is vindictive and its very worrying. Idk if you have cps involved but you being a single mother is not a reason to have your children taken away. He put them in danger of being placed in a foster home because you won't do what he says and them being removed doesn't guarantee they would be placed him or with any family members period. I would definitely go no contact with them and if you need to speak with your social worker about your fears and the possible reprocussions of doing that, then do it, save every harassing text, message and email to show you are being unfairly attacked because this man thinks that he needs some kids and you just happen to have a couple that were his brothers. Always worry about your daughters and yourself over ANYBODY. If you can, speak to an attorney about all of this. Having someone who has your back is definitely something you should do if you can afford to do so.

Let‚Äôs not forget that she also messed with the timeline more than once. Plus Thawne can manipulate people even though it‚Äôs not shown that much. I agree he hasn‚Äôt been as great as he was but we can‚Äôt always expect top quality from CW writers. Thawne wasn‚Äôt used as fan service in S6; Thawne is what made Barry who he is. He‚Äôs kinda like Robert Queen in Arrow, he‚Äôs one of the people that turned Oliver into who he eventually became. So goes for Thawne. Just like Robert never quite left Arrow in a way, neither will Thawne. Plus for whatever reason RF is still around then they quite obviously have a plan for him. Plus with Eric as the only remaining showrunner he could easily have a better plan for him. One of the very first things when I think of the flash I immediately think of RF. That‚Äôs how much of an important character I feel he is to the show.

*****
&gt; After being turned away from the Texas Supreme Court, a group of Republicans have filed a new legal challenge to Harris County&amp;#039;s implementation of drive-thru voting sites in federal court, claiming the system set up by County Clerk Chris Hollins encourages an &amp;quot;Illegal voting scheme.&amp;quot; Though experts don&amp;#039;t think the plaintiffs have a particularly strong legal argument, the case has been assigned to one of the most conservative judges in the district.

&gt; The suit wants the court to grant an injunction prohibiting drive-thru voting from continuing, and to reject all ballots cast through the process as being in violation of the Texas Election Code.

&gt; The plaintiffs are arguing that Hollins&amp;#039;s drive-thru voting locations are an illegal extension of the curbside voting, which is reserved for individuals who would require assistance in the booth.

Some players enjoy DnD for the power fantasy. Throw big spells, kill big monsters. But the Paragon (and offshoot of the Munchkin or Minmaxer) *needs* the power ingame, needs his character to be perfect. Every failure in the game is a catastrophe in real life. Dice will get jailed and replace. Spells permanently deleted from the spellbook if the enemy makes his save once. Any plan without a 100% success rate is worthless, and any action taken that is not described as amazing and flawless will be haggled over until the DM concedes the character performed like a genius. 
This player can get frustrated very easily by what is in essence a game of chance, but will take that challenge to close any holes, seal off any possible chance of failure the character might have in his career.

If you wanted you could use a drone and use your ears to match the pitch instead of watching the needle on the tuner.

I feel like that is what makes it so grey. Like Sharleen said, that just conveys to him that the issue wasn‚Äôt that Clare didn‚Äôt want to kiss him, but that she thought he didn‚Äôt. I can totally understand Clare revoking consent and backing away from the kiss. I can even understand her original maybe just awkward coverup of why she backed away saying he pulled away. But the second time? That muddles the water. And I wouldn‚Äôt want to blame Zach J for not reading past the clear verbal reasoning he was given to the truth in a moment he was also panicked and embarrassed in.",1604188965

First off napalm burns as hot as balistic magma at 1200¬∞C actually is so hot water doesn't affect it and can even burn underwater. Do some research before acting like an all knowing dumbass.  As I've said the novel for KOTM established that mamalian titans get fireproof fur when they become adults.

""Blue white flames jetted toward the titan from somewhere near her. Behemoth screamed and turned around. He was facing now. The fire spewed at him again. This time she saw where it came from, a nozzle protruding from the ceiling. Behemoth turned back towards the cave entrance covered in flames. The fire seemed to find no purchase on his fur and it quickly burned out. He didn't look hurt at all ""


Blue white flames as in flames as hot as 3000¬∞F. As hot as a nuclear meltdown and Godzilla's atomic breath is just that.  There goes your"" it would melt the flesh from his bones ""thing. The director makes the lore of the movie. If he says Kong is not a gorilla than Kong is not a gorilla no matter what you say. All you have to say is headcanon and will remain as such. He doesn't have claws but he has fistts bigger than Goji's entire head, with arms that have a longer reach, sharp canine bigger than any of Goji's own teeth. I find hard to believe that with fist that big Goji won't get at least rattled and pushed back.  A fist that big to Goji's small head would be like a battering ram. Isn't the hollow earth also in the deep depths of the hollow earth with high temperature and pressures? 

Godzilla's evolution is earned? Bruh he massively evolved off screen with the fanboy Dougherty changing a lot of things about him. That's earned? More like an evolution that was handed to him on a silver plater.

Kong won't have any lightning power ita been confirmed that he doesn't have any special abilities. He doesn't need one like the overatted lizard. And that axe is made from a godzilla dorsal plate either broken by Kong or manufactured by another of Kong's ancestors. 


Yes Kong needed to go into the hollow earth. Godzilla just needed a fanboy director to hand him an evolution off screen and use a plot device to further overpower him.  That mascot privilege coming in handy.",1604188966

Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine, a natural product of the opium poppy. Bayer commercialized the drug when they began mass producing it in 1898. The drug was promoted as a cough suppressant as well as a better and safer substitute for morphine and codeine. Heroin was welcomed with open arms as an effective remedy by the medical community ‚Äì this being an age when pneumonia, tuberculosis and even the common cold could kill you ‚Äì and doctors by the thousand were sent free samples to use on their patients. A year later, however, stories began emerging of people becoming tolerant to the drug, and soon after that, addiction cases started to be reported.

A remake is completely re-doing everything like animations, textures, models, soundtrack, dialogue, etc. I think you're confusing a reboot that follows the same story as the original with a remake which isnt the same at all. Calling Demons Souls a remaster is honestly an insult to Blue Point and the incredible job they have done with this remake. Go compare God of War 3 Remastered to the original and then watch Demons Souls Remake and compare it to the original. They are not the same.

I don't know where this takes place, but isn't there a law or something about informing well and thouroughly patients about tests and procedures?

I would be anxious too if my doctor is vague answering my questions and not explaining anything well.

She would be more relieved if you told her you were testing her for something serious and everything turns out fine, than not telling her anything and being an unreliable doctor giving her a bad impression.

At its extreme it is idiotic.  If you wear a cotton shirt you are appropriating Egyptian culture.  If you walk on a fancy rug, Persian.  If you have a wide collared shirt, you are appropriating the Eton collar of England.  It‚Äôs completely stupid to call most things cultural appropriation.  Grow up and understand ALL history folks.  Not just your own narrow history, which probably also has a huge amount appropriated from elsewhere.  If you don‚Äôt believe me, watch the PBS series Wigh Joseph Campbell called The Power of Myth.  It will open your eyes that religions and cultures have all appropriated their traditions, meanings, religious stories and social lessons from handed down myths, many of which are the same.

"SWGalaxyOfHeroes","t5_39umt","Hyperdrive bundle basically boosts you to level 85 (maxed) right away and gives you loads of 5 star gear 8 characters, but you still get put in a new arena group so you end up dominating all of the non-hyperdrive players for at the very least like 5 or 6 months and so you end up earning loads from arena for ages very easily

On top of that the value of the gear alone in the bundle is worth more than what ¬£100 worth of crystals could get you

It's expensive but if you're considering spending, nothing else in the game even comes close to the same value and the earlier you get it the more helpful it is

Can't remember all the characters that come in it but I think a jedi team is the best one you can make right away after buying it; bastila lead, ezra, old ben(I think he comes in it?), anakin and yoda (he doesn't come in it but you can unlock him right away from his event with the jedi the bundle gives you)",1604188969

That's pretty much all I have to say. I completely agree with you. 

When we first locked down in March (several weeks after the govt were advised of the potential death rate) the government didn't bother quarantining or shutting down international flights. We're an island, you'd expect that if there was a proper lockdown that you'd be able to combat and control and eliminate the virus over time. But no. Lockdown was half arsed. The top advisor to the Prime Minister broke quarantine rules himself and escaped unpunished. Our politicians are not leaders, they are morons put in charge by a large  stupid racist minority of people in England and Wales controlled by the press who themselves are controlled by the millionaires that really run the country.

The whole foxnews ""it's marxism!"" Scare is an attempt to smear it.

Same thing happened in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.  Those who protested segregation were smeared as ""communists"".

I was a single teen mom.. they were always out there praying to stop abortion and yet when i was pregnant with my kid they acted like i didnt exist. My kid was born. I left the church and went through some dark dark years. 

Then i had a slew of family members die in a few weeks and it was even worse, i was going through custody drama with my childs dad... I started thinking similar to you... anyways I decided to give church a try (I'm now Methodist) and found the podcast Touched By Heaven. I started praying more.. especially on my runs when I have an hour of uninterrupted time. Everything turned around. I feel much more at peace with all the negativity I was dealing with and all the anxiety and hate I had held onto is gone.

"Wordpress","t5_2qhjq","I upvoted you. There is absolutely nothing wrong with disabling auto updates on sites you actively manage and are well up to date on. If you want to take that over, then by all means do so. That is each site's choice and it is a perfectly responsible decision to make. WordPress.org has absolutely zero ability to override user choices there, and it will remain that way.

That said, automatic updates are intended for those that don't have that sort of detailed level of management, so that we can quickly roll out these basic fixes to the vast majority. This is a good thing for the web as a whole, and it has saved many sites from being hacked since it was implemented.

On the whole, it has been a good thing. And yes, people make mistakes. It happens. That doesn't invalidate the benefits from the overall whole picture. So, take that into account as well. I have no issue with people managing their own updates. I wish they all did.",1604188974

This always baffles me.  There is absolutely zero correlation between the ammount of crunch in a game and how focused the game is on ""what your character does"".  Its a false dicotomy.

If you don't like crunchy systems just say that, why drag the ammount or quality of RP into it (which is a contentious topic at best, and an outright dogwhistle at worst).",1604188976

&gt;It‚Äôs grounder, it‚Äôs inverse kinematics. We‚Äôve turned it off because it produced stutters.Too many players on the maps, that thing is not optimised correctly in Unity. We completely removed grounder because it produced stutters and freezes, it was done a long time ago.We can possibly we can get it back into the game, because with the legs are being placed better with the grounder. I don‚Äôt like it either, but that‚Äôs just how it is.  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;Potentially, we can make it work in first person. But then you‚Äôd have to do it for those who are close to you. And we can‚Äôt make it like ‚Äúit works when close, it doesn‚Äôt work when far‚Äù. Grounder switching is spiking and freezing the game hard. And we can‚Äôt make it smooth. Unity doesn‚Äôt have the option to smoothly switch between a standard thingy and when your legs are placed correctly. If you look into other games, then you‚Äôll notice it‚Äôs turned off in them too. It makes stutters, that rascal.  
&gt;  
&gt;(...)  
&gt;  
&gt;It works like this - the grounders are working with the high density colliders, which in turn are working with bullet hits. And to put it short, it‚Äôs a constant physical interaction with those high poly, high density colliders. Unity, especially when there are many people on the map, when there are many people in one frame, it begins to suffer from it. Did you see how he twitched slightly? (...) The character is going forward and is twitching a little. (...) Yes, this is the grounder. It may react differently to small objects. It can twist the legs outward because IT WORKS LIKE ASS.",1604188977

"nintendohelp","t5_3cogi","Hi! Thank you for your submission to /r/NintendoHelp! Please note that we are a fan community and **not officially endorsed by Nintendo**.

While you're waiting for an answer, here are some tips to help you along the way:

First, did you try Googling your question? A lot of questions about Nintendo can be answered quickly by just typing them into your search bar.

If you are asking a question about an older Nintendo system, try searching the subreddit most relevant to that system's hardware. It's likely someone has already asked a similar question before.

If your question is about Wii U, 3DS or Switch hardware, you'll likely get a better answer if you contact Nintendo directly, rather than posting here.

Nintendo's contact information is as follows:

* **North America** - 1-800-255-3700
* **Europe** - +44 (0)345 60 50 247
* **Australia** - +61 3 9730 9900
* **Japan** - +81-75-662-9600

Please note that contacting Nintendo **by phone** is the best way to get support. If you send an email or use the web chat you are not likely to get the support you need.

Good luck with your support endeavors!

I am reasonably sure that you can shrink the partition and then nudge it over 100-200 mb over. but maybe you can just shrink the partition and then add EFI on the end?

[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI\_system\_partition](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFI_system_partition) here they suggest 260 or 512mb

You might be better off resizing the NTFS partition with that other copy of windowss, on the HDD. 

I'm just looking at the partitions on my SSD and its 450MB 100MB  &lt;the rest&gt; 523MB

The second partition is 100MB for EFI, and the other two say recovery.

If the repair tools don't work, I'd try shrinking the partition, and then try the repair tools again, let those tools make the partitions if possible.",1604188979

Otherwise, what you wear doesn‚Äôt matter too much. More skin is more grip so a tank top or sports bra is better than a skivy but early on it doesn‚Äôt matter too much. You‚Äôll likely be without shoes but I found socks helped to start with climbs.

Probably the biggest difference is Chance. In The Landlord game, when you roll doubles, you move again but now roll the Chance Cube. Certain numbers will gain rewards or penalties.

Literally Page 3 of the BitD rulebook says that a session is like an episode of a TV show, that 12 sessions should constitute a ""season"", and that you as the GM should set up arcs accordingly. I would suggest reading at least the introductory section of what the game is about, as well as the Players and GM's best practices.

&gt;The players of BitD are told ""Here's what you're attempting, here's how hard it will be, here's what happens if you fail or succeed. Here is a complication down the line that will also happen.""

You don't have to be up front about the specifics of consequences. I often am, but not on every roll in a session. Sometimes rolls happen and I have no idea what the consequences should be. The Position and Effect part of the system exists specifically so that GM and players have the same idea of how severe a fail will be and how successful a triumph should be. The specifics can be made up post-facto.

As a Blades GM, you can totally throw curveballs at the players. In fact, you should do it all the time, because it's a crucial part to diminishing the players' resources. An unexpected surprise might force a player to resist or flash back to adjust the fiction.",1604188982

"PhilosophyofScience","t5_2r7mh","It does not explain why personalities are the way they are. *At all*. If it did explain why personalities are the way they are we would be able to do something quantifiable. Psychologists would be required to study it. People would market things based on it. They are studies that *prove* this isn't the case. One studied people born in the same hospital with seconds between their birth have wildly different personalities. This single-handedly shows astrology is BS. Einstein said that we accept beautiful theories, thats true. Mainly because beautiful theories are more likely to be correct. The less assumptions you make the better. That is why occams razor works well. The problem is beautiful theories aren't always correct. Sure it might be nice to think the stars you were born under played a role in your life but that is just wishful thinking. On the topic of astrology, Einstein said ‚ÄúI fully agree with you concerning the pseudo-science of astrology. The interesting point is that this kind of superstition is so tenacious that it could persist through so many centuries‚Äù. I have to agree with him here. It's superstition. I said astrologers are liars because they *are*. Sorry bud, but saying I'm ""bigoted"" against non-scientific systems of belief is moronic. By that metric I'm also bigoted against flat earth, are you? I'm also bigoted against people who claim vaccines cause autism, are you? if you are then you should be able to tell why astrology is no different.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Copied, with slight changes, from an [earlier response](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/esb385/when_did_the_first_distinct_american_accents/ffdd2cm/) of mine:

Variations on this question come up with some frequency in this sub, and I have answered them a few times. You can read a couple of those answers [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5toz0o/how_and_when_did_the_american_accent_come_to_be/ddo0tf2/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9gzief/when_did_americans_lose_their_british_accents/e696mtj/). 

With more specificity, I have addressed the question of the difference in accents between George Washington and King George III in an answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/hjmar4/george_iii_and_george_washington_would_they_have/fwrvlr5/).

I have addressed the question of the development of regional accents within America by the time of the Revolution in an answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ftycju/in_the_1776_did_the_northern_and_southern_states/fmao1zk/).

I have addressed the related myth about the American accent being ""closer to the original British accent"" or Shakespearean or Elizabethen English in an answer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/9ju72b/is_there_any_truth_to_the_narrative_that_the/e6uwpvx/). 

To paraphrase again: there was likely a distinct American accent just as soon as there were enough American-born adults around for English/British visitors to converse with to notice. This could have happened as early as the late 1620s in Virginia and the early 1640s in Massachusetts, though the initial American-born populations were tiny. They were swamped by a much bigger influx of English immigrants shortly after the colonies were established. In Plymouth and Massachusetts, this coincided with the Great Puritan Migration that started with the Winthrop Fleet in 1630. Thus, it's likely an accent wouldn't have been noticed until about mid-century, since so many of the adults until then would still have been immigrants.

According to historian Paul K. Longmore, there were enough American-born English speakers by the 1670s that English visitors would have noticed a distinct American manner of speech. Historian and language scholar Allen Walker Read found evidence going back to 1663 of commentary by English visitors on how Americans were using words and language differently from how the language was being used back in England. From that point forward, there is regular indirect evidence that there was a separate American accent from any accent heard back in England.

The first direct evidence of an American accent comes from Hugh Jones, an English-born professor who taught at the College of William and Mary in Virginia between 1715 and 1721. After his return to Great Britain, he wrote a book called *Accidence to the English Tongue*, published in 1724, which described some of the new innovations of American speech (like pronouncing the letter *s* in some words closer to *z* as in ""has"" and ""raspberry""). He also commented that the American accent was much more uniform and much more old-fashioned, which he considered a good thing since he thought the accents then developing in England were uncouth.

From that point forward, there are regular mentions by English visitors noticing the American accent, or English immigrants sticking out as a foreigner. In fact, as early as 1739, Benjamin Franklin had written in *Poor Richard's Almanack* about regional differences from colony to colony in the American way of talking.

By the time of the American Revolution, not only was ""the"" American accent commented upon regularly, but regional and social dialects were being commented upon as well.

&gt; **Promotional Content Requirements**

&gt; We have strict rules for promoting content. Posting links to your own or affiliated content are considered self-promotion. Promotion should not be the main purpose of your account, you should be an active, participating member of this community first. Violation of these rules can result in a ban either on your user or on the site or game in question. Remember that Reddit has [its own advertising feature](https://www.redditinc.com/advertising) which is a much better, appropriate way to use Reddit for the purpose of advertising!

&gt; **Post Compensation and Disclosure** - Receiving compensation of any kind to post about something **without disclosure** is strictly against the rules. This includes money, Reddit Gold, or anything in between.

&gt; **Account History Requirement** - No more than 10% of your submissions across all of Reddit may be to any single site, profile, channel, or on any given topic. This is not limited to your own content: you can be in violation of the promotion rules for a site that you have no direct affiliation with. Comments usually do not factor into the 10% rule. That being said, we can take comments into account if we feel they are being used to circumvent the 10% submission restriction (such as posting a specific domain repeatedly in comments)

&gt; * **Vote manipulation and fake accounts:** We do not allow vote manipulation of any kind.

"findapath","t5_2wqq6","Hey OP,

Minus the huge mental health burden, in the same boat as you. (I'm also realizing that tech / coding isn't right for me after a few years in the industry. Found this post cause i was searching ""software quit"" in this subreddit lol). I have little experience with pursuing extra schooling, so won't leave a comment here.

First things first, if you're feeling suicidal, please contact a mental health professional. I've always said that if it got to the point where I'd rather off myself instead of continue coding, then I would quit on the spot and take time off.

Second, from my perspective, it seems like you may be tunnel-visioned on a few aspects of this decision. First, I can't imagine you'd cripple your career completely just for quitting your first job now. Your resume is already set with education + big tech job, you can definitely explain the time away as a bad fit + needed to take some personal time off / family situation, etc. It's not a 1-way door. Plus it's your first job, you would get some leniency. (Maybe if you have a history of short 9-month stints at companies, then it be a bigger cause for concern, but not for a single job).

But more importantly, you say you want to leave this career. What exactly is it about your job that makes it that mind-numbing / mental health destroying? If you were coding similar things, but working at a company that truly made a difference, would that make any difference for you? Or is it the dull of coding (and how everything reduces down to crud / api translations / figuring out a new framework / etc). Wondering if leaving for a different company would address any of the huge concerns you have.

There's also the over-bearing family aspect you mentioned. I'm not sure what your situation is like, but is there anyone in the family that you can confide with that might see more to your perspective? (I know this can be super difficult, but ultimately, you have to look out what's best for yourself).

One nice exercise I read through was ([https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html)) to sort of introspect on what I want from a career / take time to reflect.

Sorry for the lack of organization, but wishing you the best of luck OP. You are not an idiot for wanting to leave a high-paying cushy job. Our lives are more than just $$$ on a paycheck. (In fact a lot of personal finance subs / early retirement subs will even say that it's important to focus on happiness throughout your entire life, not just when you finally retire).",1604188985

"afdwatch","t5_3g4p3","&gt;Am Samstagnachmittag erstattete die Regensburger Hilfsorganisation Sea-Eye Strafanzeige wegen aller in Frage kommenden Straftaten gegen den AfD-Politiker Georg Pazderski bei der Regensburger Polizei. Zuvor verbreitete der Berliner Rechtspopulist, dass die Crew der ALAN KURDI Mitverantwortung f√ºr den Tod der Terroropfer von Nizza tragen k√∂nnte. In seiner Erkl√§rung auf Facebook bezog er sich dabei auf ‚ÄûRecherchen‚Äú und ver√∂ffentlichte ein Bild mit der Schlagzeile ‚ÄûDeutsche ‚ÄûAlan Kurdi‚Äú brachte Nizza-Attent√§ter nach Europa‚Äú, ohne konkrete Quellen f√ºr seine Behauptung zu benennen. Zuvor berichtete auch das rechtsextreme Nachrichtenportal Journalistenwatch √ºber Zusammenh√§nge zwischen einer Rettungsmission der ALAN KURDI und dem Terroranschlag von Nizza.  
&gt;  
&gt;Die [S√ºddeutsche Zeitung](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/frankreich-nizza-messerattacke-1.5100016) beschrieb bereits am Freitagabend, wie der Attent√§ter nach Frankreich gelangte. Er war nicht an Bord der ALAN KURDI.  
&gt;  
&gt;&gt;‚ÄûWider besseren Wissens  verbreitet Pazderski die Unwahrheit, um die Trauer und Betroffenheit der  Menschen zu missbrauchen und sie gegen Seenotretter aufzuhetzen‚Äú, sagt Gorden Isler, Vorsitzender von Sea-Eye.  
&gt;  
&gt;Innerhalb weniger Stunden wurde Pazderskis Post mehr als 1000 Mal  geteilt. Den Verein erreichen seither verst√§rkt Anschuldigungen,  Beleidigungen und schwere Vorw√ºrfe.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;‚ÄûHier versucht ein  Rechtspopulist auf sch√§ndlichste Weise das Leid der Opfer und deren  Angeh√∂rige sowie die Betroffenheit der Menschen f√ºr seine eigene  politische Agenda auszunutzen. Diese Attacke muss Konsequenzen haben. Er  muss als Fraktionsvorsitzender zur√ºcktreten‚Äú, sagt Isler weiter.
&gt;
&gt;Seit der Gr√ºndung des Vereins im Jahr 2015 hat Sea-Eye √ºber 15.000  Menschenleben gerettet. Die Organisation steht f√ºr das Leben, f√ºr die  Menschenrechte und f√ºr ziviles Engagement.
&gt;
&gt;&gt;‚ÄûWir waren alle schrecklich  entsetzt √ºber diesen Terroranschlag und verurteilen ihn aufs Sch√§rfste.  Wir nehmen Anteil an der tiefen Trauer der Angeh√∂rigen und stehen an der  Seite aller Menschen, die sich gegen Gewalt und Terror stellen‚Äú, so Isler.

"confessions","t5_2qq6g","From your post from 5 days ago:

‚ÄúI am mentally ill. Funny thing is, I‚Äôm not bothered by it. I don‚Äôt feel like I have a social responsibility. I don‚Äôt feel the need to ‚Äúbecome better‚Äù. I want to serve myself first and foremost - but I pretend to care about others in order to be accepted. A few people know my dark side and some of them called me out on it. I don‚Äôt want to admit to those pricks that I‚Äôm wrong. Fuck them. I think they‚Äôre insignificant maggots and their opinions are worthless.

That‚Äôs a very lonely life. I‚Äôm lying in bed unable to cry. I want to cut through the veins on my forearm. Why can‚Äôt I have people who glorify me all the time? Why won‚Äôt people accept me? I‚Äôm too good for them, they‚Äôre just too stupid to see. Or maybe, I am garbage.

I don‚Äôt feel like changing. Admitting flaws is admitting imperfection. I can be either 100% perfect or 100% worthless. My thinking is black and white.

I‚Äôll have to face it, eventually - if only for selfish reasons. Thank you.‚Äù

If you are a narcissist, which in my experience, you definitely fit the bill.  You abuse ppl for your pleasure &amp; to boost your ego.  You DON‚ÄôT deserve to have a loving human being in your life, you DO deserve a miserable existence for the rest of your days.  You hate your therapist cause they‚Äôre right - you believe you‚Äôre much more intelligent, that is false.  I don‚Äôt care if I get downvoted, unless you have faced the abuse of a narc, you have NO idea how evil they are.  This narc is looking for sympathy that he does NOT deserve!

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","I get downvoted to hell in the Rangers sub everytime I mention not giving a fuck about Tony D's politics. I honestly don't, and I don't understand why it's important to anyone else. I'm a registered Democrat, and have voted in every election since I've been legally able. I'm not a Trump supporter by any means, but I'm also not a fan of Biden. As such, I'm not voting at all this time. I refuse to lend my stamp of approval to shit candidates, on either side. To me, both sides are shit.

An athlete's politics are none of my damn business, especially if it's an athlete that plays on the team I root for. Why? Because in cases like that, all that matters to me is what he does on the field or on the ice to help my team win games. And I'm not one to ""cancel"" an athelete, simply because he may disagree with me politically. People *are* allowed to have different opinions and different priorities in life, in a free country. With the type of person we know Piazza to be, it shouldn't surprise anyone that he may have traditionally conservative ideals. It doesn't change my love and respect for what he accomplished for the team as a player, especially after 9-11. Athletes are humans too, despite the fact that we as fans elevate them to hero status.

America isn't perfect. Any rational person understands that. But nothing in life ever is ""perfect"". I'll just say this: I'm going on 40 now. If you're a young (or even if you're not young), good intentioned person in here, and you genuinely believe America to be an irredeemable shithole, ask yourself: Wow, shit's bad here, but what about other places around the world, where people literally have NO rights?

What about communist China, and their ""social credit system"", and their treatment of the Uyghurs, who they're currently holding in camps? What about Muslim majority countries, where gay people are literally thrown off roofs or hung by cranes, just for being gay? What about women in Muslim majority countries, who are subject to arrest or death, simply for the 'crime' of not wearing a piece of religiously mandated cloth on their heads? The same head covering that spoiled people in the West are trying to say is a 'choice' and prop up as a symbol of beauty? What about protestors in Nigeria, getting robbed, shot at and killed by their own police for wearing their hair naturally, because it is seen as an affront to 'tradition'? Do we ever stop to think about the fact that we may be viewed as fucked up as we scream and yell about these things from the comforts of our homes here in free America by those who live in these other countries? We as Americans are truly ignorant if we think we have it really bad. Compared to all that, we have it great.

Apologies for the long post, but I'm just tired of 'cancel culture' and punishment for 'wrong think'. Fuck tribalism in every facet, taking the joy out of life. If you're always looking to be offended by everything, you're not living.

"FA30plus","t5_37trq","Like for example I and many people hate getting yelled at. But there's lots of people who are used to being yelled at. They think that it demonstrates you care when you get so upset you lose your temper, and they can react badly to people who seem ""robotic"" simply because they're not screaming when they should be. You say ""those people are crazy for staying with such a hotheaded asshole!"" but to them it's actually reassuring and normal.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I have dealt with many a person like that, and it's fun not reacting and seeing them get that upset cause they don't get their way. One time they said ""You clearly don't care"", and they were right. Robotic? Or self control? If one person who is that upset seems robotic when they don't want to hear their childish temper tantrum, then they have a problem. They say don't let shit get to you, or let them get under your skin etc, and then when you do, they're still upset. Yeah makes no sense to me. Or perhaps they should not try to do it in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, for people who get yelled at and ""stay calm and comforted"", eventually they're going to do what anyone does and go ""FUCK YOU TOO MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!"" right back. I mean hey, if you want people to show they ""Care"", and then they do, ah but it wasn't what you wanted, or you got what you wanted but not the magical way you thought?

On a related note, I was watching this video on youtube, ironically, about reddit, and it was about asking the ladies what things are men insecure about that you are really not bothered by? And one of them men being emotionally vulnerable.

&amp;#x200B;

Well the comments section delved into guys who did such, only for it to be used against them. So hence there as to why some people are ""robotic"". Like you can't sit there and ask people be more open/emotional/vulnerable and then when they are, you walk away or hold it against them? That's fucked up. Esp. if you expect them to be more open and honest etc. Sure, I was over insecure once, cost me what could have been a great relationship. 

Like I get not wanting to deal with shit at a certain time, or certain people's certain shit, but I think we need to stop with this dealing with  other people's problems and shit makes you stronger. No, it makes you a doormat. Or well in certain corners of the internet speak, a simp. And some of these type of people will say to you you need to stand up for yourself, but then when you do, they get all upset.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, learning how to handle stress is important and doing favors is good and all, but I think this shit needs to stop.",1604188989

You don't ban posts where users target other users,without directly naming them,and are basically high school bathroom gossip sessions,even though that's against the rules

You allow so many posts spreading misinformation about various kpop groups to exist. Like 'group X is racist'. I mean,there's a very long way from saying 'group x did something that hurts me and I want them to stop' to 'entire group x is racist and doesn't see us as human',isn't it?

Worst,you don't ban users who directly insult others,and attempt to create divisive troll posts riddled with misinformation who clearly violate rule 1: Not your personal army. 

But when some fans,many of them *minorities*,say 1. something doesn't offend them 2. something might not be ~ist/phobic but rather ignorance 3. try expressing their frustration with how quick everyone is to judge and decide things are problematic.

Suddenly,it's 'microagressions'? No,someone having a different point of view on topics which you *grossly oversimplify* is not invalidating you.  Someone simply not agreeing to everything you say is not a microaggression. Your post or comment getting less upvotes is not others 'pushing you aside'. 

I,too,thought this was supposed to be a diverse community,but I see all you want is an echo chamber. 

Or was it someone calling out American-centric thinking that caused this reaction? Was someone 'calling out' 'problematic' American ways of thinking,too much,maybe? Cause,you know,that's really not a good image when you want to talk about a creating a community which is 'welcoming' to people from all countries and from all cultures...

Many of the people who are gonna get banned are actually going to be other POC fans who just said once they didn't like the word educate,or tried explaining that they didn't feel something an idol did was disrespectful.",1604188990

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","First, great question, I've been thinking about this too. But anyway here are my candidates:

Senua from Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice:

&gt;!-Had schizophrenia in an era when there was very little knowledge about it!&lt;

&gt;!-Lived in isolation locked her up in her house (sometimes even in a hole in the ground) her entire childhood!&lt;

&gt;!-Her mother was burned alive in front of her when she was a child!&lt;

&gt;!-Is blamed for starting a plague in her homeland just because she's different, making her isolate herself in the wilds!&lt;

&gt;!-When she goes back home, one of the only people that really cared about her, her husband, is found brutally dead (search up Blood Eagle)!&lt;

&gt;!-Fought dozens of vikings, getting many physical injuries while consumed by self doubt and self hatred (it is debatable if she was fighting real people throughout the game)!&lt;

Jennifer from Rule Of Rose:

&gt;!-When she was 8 years old, she was in an airship accident where everyone but her died, including her parents!&lt;

&gt;!-She was then kidnapped by a suicidal farmer, Gregory, who made her dress and look like his missing son while she was locked in his basement (rape was probably not involved fortunately)!&lt;

&gt;!-After fleeing the farm, she was extremely bullied (like being tied up, locked in a coffin, stuffed into a bag full of insects and many other forms of physical and psychological abuse) by other kids from a godforsaken orphanage just because a girl named Wendy was jealous of Jennifer's love for her puppy Brown!&lt;

&gt;!-The kids in the orphanage then brutally kill her only friend, the puppy Brown!&lt;

&gt;!-Finally, the farmer Gregory goes to the orphanage and massacres all the children except Jennifer (who he still believes to be his son) and then kills himself, making her again a sole survivor!&lt;

&gt;!-This orphanage shit happened when she was only 9 years old, she only makes peace with her memories 10 years later and even then I don't think all of her traumas will ever be gone!&lt;

I definitely think these two suffered more than Max",1604188992

Likewise, I'm talking about the British far right, not the far right in general - which would include ultra-conservative Islamism and Islamic fundamentalism as well.

I truly don't understand the point of the ""let's not derail the conversion"" picture.. no clue, nothing to say.

""Crime is directly linked to poverty"" I completely agree, and most blacks are poor.. It's the reason why many are targeted by police as it also states later in the picture.

blacks are poorer than whites on average: I agree but they truly have the tools to strive to be successful given a drive and will to do so. it will be harder than some white people with established parents to help them, but the tools are there.
 
poor schools: sadly most children that go to those schools will probably drop out. All they have to do is finish with a D average or above to graduate and get a entry level job somewhere. most lack the work ethic to stay at the job and move their way up the company ladder. they need a hard working role models to mentor them in my opinion. but sadly most people in poor communities will take the easy way out.

Assuming that I drive 22000 km per year and I drive for 30 years that gives me 660 000 km. If I do 1 left turn per 20 km, that gives me 33 000 left turns. If a car makes 1 mistake per 100 000 left turns then I will have 33% (33 000 / 100 000) chance to have crash just due to left turns.

"JoeBiden","t5_2t0th","And Selzer has been wrong by wide margins before. Just because there is precisely one (1) previous example we can point to of a +7 Selzer poll correlating with a late Midwestern surge for Trump doesn‚Äôt mean that‚Äôs what this one means. 800 Iowans don‚Äôt dictate Biden‚Äôs fate in the Midwest. And you also have to take into account the number of votes already cast - even if this poll reflects an actual late surge, it won‚Äôt have nearly the same impact as the 2016 surge. 

Setting aside the banked votes factor, Trump being +7 in IA would *still* be consistent with Biden flipping a bunch of Midwest states and winning the EC. This assumes that this outlier is perfectly accurate. 

Remember that recent A+ poll that had Biden +17 in Wisconsin, a state which borders Iowa? These polls don‚Äôt exist in the same universe. The truth lies somewhere in the middle. You can‚Äôt act like one‚Äôs gospel while ignoring the other. We‚Äôve got just as much reason to ignore this poll as we have to ignore the +17 poll.",1604188995

"FTC","t5_2sks6","&gt;Education Solidworks licenses are harder to come by

I'd just like to add that Solidworks does have a scholarship application for FTC teams to get a full license and they don't seem to be too selective - our team got one this year, we just had to put in some team information and a little paragraph about why we wanted to use Solidworks.

And as a side note to the OP, our team has gone through 4 different CAD programs in a relatively recent time span and I've been through all of them - I'd agree that Fusion 360 is really good for starting out and for lower spec computers, although I prefer Inventor as far as the Autodesk suite goes. Onshape is fine for if you're using a computer that can't run cad software, but it lacks a lot of the functionality that I like having in Solidworks or the Autodesk products. It's all up to user preference and technology access though. I've never used Blender though, so I don't know how it compares to all of these.",1604188995

"Genshin_Impact","t5_12p4l2","So, I've been trying to do the Nine Pillars of Peace quest (for three weeks now, retrying at every world level and dying every time) and I can't get past the ruin hunter. I got him down to less than 25% health multiple times, but I always die trying to destroy the last enhancement stone, since you have to climb to get past the wind barrier. The ruin hunter shoots me down while I'm climbing, then my camera angle gets all messed up, and by the time I try climbing up again, I get shot down again and killed. Or, I actually manage to land in the wind barrier, try swinging at it, but then end up swinging myself out of the barrier and have to find a way back up, which is when I end up dead. Again.

I'm at World Level 4 now, and my characters are:

Level 64 Fischl: I use her for Oz and to shoot the Ruin Hunter down, but I have terrible aim and can rarely get him to fall, so that's a problem in and out of itself.

Level 70 Xiangling: I use Guoba and her spear attack on the off-chance that I can get the ruin hunter to fall down.

Level 60 Barbara: She's my healer, but I also use her water ability to do Electro-charged, which actually causes a good amount of damage. If only I could get past that third (final?) enhancement stone...

Level 32 Noelle: To destroy the enhancement stones. That's it. I need a claymore user for the enhancement stones, and she's all I got. And I really don't want to level her up just for this quest.

Does anyone have any advice on how to beat this? Do I need to break the third stone? Can I still kill the Ruin Hunter if I leave it activated?

Also, can you co-op this quest? Because I feel like it would be a lot easier if I had some of the OP characters.

Thank you!",1604188996

Regardless of whether or not theres any merit to his ""jokes"". His vivid imagination of these fake events is enough to seriously put her safety significantly into question.

I'm the type of person that lives in grey areas. I appreciate nuance and analyzing all the factors. I often come on this sub and encourage people to consider the whole picture and communicate more to gain more information/explore feelings, but this time, I'm 100% in agreement that OP needs to leave asap. She will never and can never know if her bf actually has any violent tendencies (until he acts on them) but he very obviously has fantasized about these things at least which means in the right circumstances, hes very likely capable of committing them or at the very least finds something appealing in the thought of committing them (hence why he thinks it funny and not frighteningly gross). I would get out of there and if he displays ANY resistance, I'd get a restraining order asap.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't smoked (or ingested any form of marijuana) in 3-4 years, yet I've had low energy and am slow to awake in the mornings, sometimes going as far as to refusing to wake up with the alarm and knocking out for another 1-3 hours. I find myself slowly pulling myself to the gym after a coffee, and questioning if I'm really even awake enough to do the workout I want lol.

&amp;#x200B;

Point is, I think low energy can be attributed to numerous things. Just as high energy can. I think you're somewhat excited about it, and it's getting extra adrenaline. Some of that may be placebo, or it may not be, but it's otherwise welcomed.",1604188999
"Hedgehog","t5_2rvox","WHS can only be positively diagnosed postmortem at the present, though it can be kind of diagnosed by ruling out Lots of other things, which is where you are now. And for that, it sounds like an exotic vet won‚Äôt be enough: you need a hedgehog vet. And those are hard to find. From where I am, I have to drive 45 minutes to my regular vet and 2 hours to a 24-hour emergency room. 

Luckily the community over at the Hedgehog Welfare Society does a great job maintaining a list of veterinarians who specialize in hedgehogs [here](http://www.hedgehogwelfare.org/veterinarians.asp). Also, if you‚Äôre lucky enough to be even remotely near a veterinary college with a teaching hospital, definitely consider going there. The 2 hour drive for emergency/urgent care is worth it mostly because it‚Äôs Tufts University. I know Cornell also has a robust veterinary program, because right now Tufts isn‚Äôt doing necropsy due to Covid, so we drove our Durin out there when he passed. (They confirmed WHS)

That said, a wobbly walk can be so many other things. If she‚Äôs three, she‚Äôs on the young end for uterine cancer, but she is within the range where it becomes common. My Gracie had a uterine mass that made her waddle like she was pregnant. She also had lethargy and weakness in her limbs that were related to internal bleeding (from the cancerous mass). 

TLDR: find a hedgehog vet. We can all speculate but we‚Äôre not vets and can‚Äôt examine her over reddit. Also, big snuggles all around.",1604188999

They had the curfew. A policy that puts kids in harms way. (Some kid gets picked up and gets a $250 fine. You can‚Äôt tell me that there would be some parents who would not beat a kid for costing them $250)

They had the Bradfield scheme and the Bruce highway duplication. Big ticket items they admitted would take 10 to 15 years to start. 

Meanwhile Labor are getting things done. Cross river rail is a big one. They built new Buildings at my daughters school. They duplicated a much used bridge in my area.

Stop fumbling in the dark, throwing things into a pan and hoping it'll recreate a dish whose identify is self-admittedly vague to you to begin with. Identify the specific dishes that your girlfriend likes, whether they're Indian or Japanese, and search out those recipes specifically by name. Read and watch multiple versions of the same dish so that you begin to understand the common techniques involved, some of which (like heating whole spices in oil at the beginning of a dish) have already been mentioned in this thread. You could also ask the restaurant staff personally for tips on recreating specific dishes that they offer. I'm not telling you this to stifle your creativity, but to say that studying the sorts of recipes you want to base your food off of will help you understand why those recipes are constructed the way they are in the first place.

Ultimately you can make whatever you like as long as you enjoy it, but don't be surprised if your girlfriend loves shahi paneer above all else and frowns when you present her with something that was made with the vaguest impression of shahi paneer in mind.",1604189000

Welp, at last I got the Active Carbon Water Filter Cubes.  That I will use to try to remove the ""mustard"" color from the water of one of my tanks.

[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081B49MBL/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_asin\_title\_o01\_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081B49MBL/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1)

&amp;#x200B;

As I was going to put the cube it, I discovered that the first time I measure the opening of the Exec Suite tank was wrong. It is 4"", not 4 1/2"".

I was wondering why UPS sent me a text asking if I wanted the delivery upgraded to UPS ground, that I ignored. Then I realized, looks like UPS has a cheaper alternative for other countries, that they receive it, but then ship it through USPS. üòÑ

It came from China, and took over 3 weeks.

These are my first comments...

\- No instructions included

\- I was expecting for them to be flexible. They are not. They are hard and crumbly. (That might be a good thing, if you want to try smaller tanks, but I do not recommend it).

\- I was barely able to fit it, fortunately it crumbled enough when I push it down.

\- It takes most of the center of the Exec Suite tank.

\- No way it can fit as-is in a typical Sea Monkeys tank of 12 oz (450 ml) or even the 16 oz (470 ml) Ocean Volcano tank.

\- Since I read from another source that the water needs to move through the holes to be affective, I increased the air flow of the air stone to see if that helps.

\- This was designed for fish, not for Brine Shrimps. If the babies fit through the holes, I suspect they will not survive the experience, since supposedly that is how algae and organic material ""gets removed"".

\- From other sources, they claim that water will clear in days, so I will give it at most a couple of weeks, unless I see is harming the colony.

I will report on the results at that time.",1604189002

All the other stuff you get with pre-orders are what you actually pre-order for--plus just getting the game early obviously. I've always considered themes to be low to mid tier bonuses *at best*.

"wildrift","t5_24knsa","First thing maybe is that newer players are playing ranked now that it is already in open beta. When I started, I rarely get feeding/bad team. 

Second, if you're still in lower rank, it's fairly easy to hook the enemies and make them feed. Just spam your hooks (having 50% acc is actually already good). You can use hook 2-4 times depending on level every minute. It doesn't matter how bad your adc is, they will be strong and can carry the game.The goal with blitzcrank support is to pressure your enemies. They will be afraid to get close and lose farm while your adc gets a lot of minions. 

Third, don't worry about it if your adc can't capitalize. That's already minus one teammate to drag the team. Once you've won the lane and you think your adc can be on their own, participate in skirmishes. Go with your mid and jungle and kill enemies. Your hooks doesn't end in the lane. O-3 or 0-4 mid or jungler is not the end, you just support them like what you did with your adc. Help your jungler get the dragon. Secure the half of the map during laning phase. You don't have to babysit the adc all the time. Most of the time, from my experience, my adc can go alone and kill enemies while pushing. The thing is, if the enemies hunt my adc, they will sacrifice towers and objectives, so it's a win-win. Always check the map if they're going to gank the adc, then go to the rescue. 

Fourth, check your combat participation in the end. If you have the badge, then you're doing a good job. Maybe 80% of my games I've had the badge where I partcipated in most combat/teamfights. You must be always there whether to disrupt the enemy or peel for your team.

Fifth, build solari first. It will save you and your adc in a lot situation early. It only costs 1500, so it's very cost efficient.

Sixth, the only bad match up you'll have are against braum and Seraphine (seraphine range is nuts). Alistar is pretty easy to kill, and usually it's a free lane win. Janna is a bit tough, but if you have runes and movement speed, you can outmatch her. 

Lastly, your ability as Blitz does not only rely on your accuracy in hooks but also as a support in general. You're not just a platform for your adc. Worry less about how the carries will capitalize on the advantage but more on what more you can do. There are many times when it looks like we will lose but I just carried on and hooked as many enemies as I can and voila, we still win. Comebacks are more possible in wildrift than in PC because even if the score is, for examples, 12-30+ you can still win from a won teamfight. Support is much more impactful that what others think and it doesn't end in the laning phase.",1604189002

"lolgrindr","t5_2u0op","Thank you for making the effort to renormalize the conversation. I went the insulting direction after reading your claims about ""proving my ignorance"" as reductive insults. I'm happy to back down from it because insults aren't productive to discussion. Apologies.

\*\*\*

**I don't disagree that ALM can be insulting and potentially offensive**, but I'm not of the notion that offensive == wrong or bad. Look at what it's doing to empower and justify extremist Islamic terror in France right now. It's a slippery slope. 

Instead, I believe we need to tolerate the distasteful ideas we encounter, so that we may grapple with them, rather than dismiss them (and their bearers) as unworthy of rational engagement. Otherwise, ""that's offensive"" will always be a trump card to win an argument or shut down conversation, as it so often is these days. But when you shut down a conversation, you silence another person. That does nothing to change the ideas they hold, it just creates a division that will fester. 

So, while ALM may be ""offensive,"" it must be tolerated. We need to become curious as to what's behind it, and hear what's being said. The people you cite who call ALM racist can do that until they're blue in the face, but they don't do it actually having heard out the people who say it. They write those things as a justification for silencing those people, so that you can call them racist, and so that you don't feel obliged to listen. I'd ask you to reconsider that notion.

\*\*\*

Further, I don't feel it appropriate to use my relationship with Black people to justify my views, but it would be a mistake to assume that my opinions exist in some kind of racial vacuum just because they're anti-Woke and anti-BLM. 

Rather, I think that comes down to using identity to make an argument rather than seeking truth in universals. But I appreciate that you may be motivated by compassion as well as a desire for truth, so instead I'll point to a few voices in the Black community whose views are concordant with mine and have been instrumental in helping me follow the threads of principle up through practical action: Glenn Loury, Thomas Chatterton Williams, Ayaan Hirsi Ali (African &amp; Muslim). 

\*\*\*

As to the Grindr profile you posted, hell yes, it's dickish and so simplistic that it seems like a troll. But if it's even a real person, I agree that they're probably not very well informed, not terribly compassionate (how could they be when they're deliberately trying to stir anger?), and likely have at best a shallow understanding of the First Amendment/Constitution they're so eager to invoke. I wouldn't meet a person with a profile like that, but I'd totally meet up with someone that voted Republican (ideally for governor, or on specific issues, but Trump voters I'm not sure I could stomach). 

That said, I'm similarly reluctant to meet people who post #BlackLivesMatter in their profiles. #BLM profiles will sometimes also post outright racist shit in their profiles, and they're empowered to do so by Woke politics. To them, it's okay to say ""no white people"" but not ""no black people,"" or ""ACAB"", a damaging and harmful oversimplification. **I believe that any racism is still racism, and I see a great deal of real racism present and shamelessly on display in Woke ideology.** 

BLM is an easy slogan to support if you believe the phrase itself. But that belief is used to shoehorn support for a lot of damaging ideology and behavior.[If you don't support BLM activities or other BLM propaganda, you get called a racist because you must not believe that Black Lives Matter.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy) 

It's an abuse of compassion to shout ""racism"" at the top of your lungs to bully people on a hundred different fronts. It's like the boy who cried wolf, and one of the tragic consequences is that real racial justice (not to mention class justice) isn't on the agenda. 

\*\*\*

The  claims I'm making: 

* being opposed to BLM and Wokeness do not logically imply that one is a racist. 
   * That said, and as someone who recently \[temporarily\] moved back to the South from the PNW, it's clear that legit racism is still alive and well, holy fuck. And I'm almost certain that BLM-related activity is making it worse. When shitty people see decent people getting called racist, it empowers them to be shitty and actively racist. It's heartbreaking and shatters your belief in the goodness of humanity.)
* the accusation of racism and our automatic compassionate response to it is being abused in the context of Woke ideology. I'd encourage you - no, I'm begging you - please be less liberal with your accusations of racism. Save it for when it'll be impactful and change a situation, not when you can call someone out for social points. 
* gay people who vote Republican deserve respect and for their voice to be heard, too. And might even be lovable. I say ""vote Republican,"" not ""vote Trump"", because I want to be specific that I think the conservative voice still has a place in our society. Further, gay rights WERE all but settled awhile back, and reducing a person's value system to their sexuality is overly simplistic. Again - identity based, rather than looking for universal values... something that conservatism used to be based on. There are better threads than this one that pick apart the issues, but I think it's sufficient to say that people are complex creatures and, again, identity isn't everything. 
   * That said, I personally think the Republican party is currently driven by a nearly sociopathic degree of selfishness and sociopathy that fundamentally betrays conservative values. I can't imagine Jesus voting Republican. That said, their voices still deserve to be heard, and they're still humans, even if they make your skin crawl. Prejudice is prejudice.

Sorry for being longwinded. But what you said deserved a thoughtful response, and I wanted to at least try to provide an anti-Woke, anti-BLM perspective that isn't just another can of MAGA.",1604189004

"strength","t5_2r5rn","OP. Power or Strength = Mass √ó Acceleration. 

Whenever we lift weights, we are exerting force against the barbell. In physics, we measure force using Newton‚Äôs Second Law of Motion via the equation f = ma, or put differently, force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. To generate more force, we must either increase mass or acceleration (or both). We measure force in terms of Newtons (N) which we can also translate into other measurements including horsepower.

To put it simply, at some point in time, you will hit your genetic barrier if you want to do what you are describing here. To bypass that barrier, you must gain size and mass. Mass, is density of an object. If you want to get stronger, you must increase your density by increasing the number of atoms in your makeup which is your body and increase the amount of your gut flora and also drink more water and creatine to fill the muscles and the body with water. An extra 5 to 10lbs of water in your body will increase your strength significantly but you must keep drinking water and creatine. Also, eat more saturated fats such as animal fats because your body needs cholesterol to manufacture a variety of hormones and eat lots of dairy products like yogurts to increase bacteria count.

TLDR: Eat more calories which are fats, carbohydrates and protein. You must fuel the body and provide ample hydration to the body. 

Power or Strength = Mass √ó Acceleration which is proportional to the endurance and stamina which you get from doing the cardio. Don't forget flexibility and doing specific exercises at certain angles as that will force different muscles to work even better.",1604189004

any with a plan for universal healthcare. being Hawkins right now.

&gt; Politics isn‚Äôt about voting for your perfect candidate. It‚Äôs looking at the candidates and deciding which one out of your choices you think should lead the country.

this is the choice im making by voting third party.

&gt; If you want different than that, you need to do much more than sit around and just wait until the big elections and complain that you don‚Äôt like the choices that you allowed others to make for you.

So when one person decided to downvote (maybe by accident) the above comment it may have influenced a second person to do so as well. 

Once the comment gets to negative upvotes then people hardly look at the comment before downvoting. This occurs when (1) the person who is *getting* downvoted may not have made their comment clear enough, or (2) the person who downvoted the comment did not read the comment properly.

This includes one who worships an idol, and one who slaughters an animal as an idolatrous offering, and one who burns incense as an idolatrous offering, and one who pours a libation in idol worship, and one who bows to an idol, and one who declares that he accepts an idol upon himself as a god, and one who says to an idol: You are my god. But with regard to one who hugs an idol, or one who kisses it, or one who cleans it, or one who sprays water before it, or one who washes it, or one who rubs it with oil, or one who dresses it, or one who puts its shoes on it, he transgresses a prohibition but is not liable to receive capital punishment. With regard to one who vows in an idol‚Äôs name and one who affirms his statement by an oath in its name, he transgresses a prohibition. One who defecates before the idol known as Ba‚Äôal-Peor is liable to receive capital punishment, even though defecating is a degrading act, as that is its form of worship. Likewise, one who throws a stone at Mercury is liable to receive capital punishment, as that is its form of worship.""",1604189008

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined post &amp; comment karma

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

Longbowmen then started to taunt French soldiers by presenting those two fingers as a ""come and get it"" gesture. The gesture then spread throughout English culture.",1604189011

"COVID19positive","t5_2hnraa","For me it came back almost instantly. I lost it over 3 days, but mostly of it on the 3rd day. I could smell and taste nothing for about a week. 

Then after that week, I went from smelling/tasting nothing in the morning to being able to taste and smell reasonable well by that evening. 

However, I did continue to have it come and go, never entirely again, and some smells and tastes were wrong. I had persistent smells that didn‚Äôt exist (mostly the smell of poop) where I couldn‚Äôt tell if the smells were real or not except by asking my family if they could smell it too. 

I also had many instances where my brain triggered into conciousness the idea of a smell without me ever smelling the scent. Meaning not only didn‚Äôt scent exist in reality, I also couldn‚Äôt smell it, just the idea of smells popped into consciousness (like my brain saying ‚ÄúYou are smelling artichokes‚Äù, but it was confusing because I never even had the imagined smell of it. This was the weirdest. For the first few weeks, it happened maybe 3-5 times an hour. Now, 50+ days post COVID, it still happens maybe once an hour. 

I am a long-hauler, and this isn‚Äôt my only remaining symptom. I don‚Äôt have it near as bad as some but I‚Äôm still fairly limited in my capacity to do things normally. I had a fever every day for 40+ days. I went a week without a confirmed fever (I think I still had them but I stopped checking so often), but had a fever again today.

"Kengan_Ashura","t5_m9xyl","He definitely didnt want to actually kill Misasa, he's familiar with the rules here. If you mean he was very angry at him that doesnt negate Yumi being a cocky bitch who wouldnt take Misasa seriously. He didnt take a little guy like Misasa serious from the beginning.  
 Misasa's knowledge absolutely changes the fact that he destroyed Yumi. Yumi didnt have knowledge about Misasa but Misasa knew almost everything about Yumi's style, this led to him being able to easily predict Yumi whilst Yumi had no clue what Misasa would do next, information is one of the key elements of a fight and whoever has it is at a massive advantage.  
 Gao also doesnt blitz very often and even if he did he would immediately be caught by a grapple. Yumi has shown to not be afraid to go for grappling when its advantageous to him and Gao, being mainly a boxer, is very susceptable to such a thing. As I said earlier one of the things that brought Gao down was Agito using grappling so Yumi would likely be able to subdue him using his very large frame and grappling.   
Gao also has next to no way of breaking through the long ranged combat Yumi specialized in from what I can tell, and even if he does who's to say Yumi doesnt have an answer to someone getting in too close for a moment? We didnt get to see him use anything like this because of Misasa being his worst possible matchup in every sense.   
Furthermore even if Gao chooses to blitz Yumi, breaks through his wall of ranged combat, dodges all his grappling attempts, weaves through his close range capabilities and manages to start landing blows, Yumi is too durable to simply be blitzed. The guy has roughly equal specs to Agito for crying out loud. He would simply take a few hits and then grapple Gao, not letting go to give Gao time to recover and capatilizing on his weaknesses.  
Yumi is a fighter who isnt gonna get risky for no reason, he knows Gao is weak against grappling and he will use it to defeat him.  
 Now all this is just my opinion and you're free to disagree but I hope you can see why I feel like its at least a 50/50 for Yumi. Dont count him out just because he got beaten by his worst matchup in the worst rules possible, hell even then Yumi got a few hits in, thats more than some can say",1604189012

"modernwarfare","t5_2r8qf","Bro, you say that like people don‚Äôt come back to play these games for years. It would be damn good news to hear that an actual solution to cheating is being implemented in a game that I love even if the size of the community that actively plays it shrinks drastically over the years.

It‚Äôs really not that hard or difficult to develop and implement software code into the game to tackle the massive cheaters problem. They just choose not to because it would cost money and slightly diminish their revenues. They‚Äôre more concerned about keeping stockholders happy than providing an experience that makes the customer demand more.
I‚Äôm not saying that it isn‚Äôt important as balls to keep your investors and stockholders happy, but it‚Äôs practically corporate suicide to ignore a glaring problem that could eventually throw off a huge chunk of customers from returning in the future.

Like, literally all it would take is someone coming up with a game that plays and feels almost like Call Of Duty that is just as fun and addictive, and doesn‚Äôt have a massive cheater problem and bam player drop off will be like a floodgate opening.

Call Of Duty isn‚Äôt the juggernaut it once was. It‚Äôs a glass canon and making one big mistake or a series of small ones can destroy its reputation for good.",1604189012

Newton‚Äôs first law says that an object will remain in the same state of motion, i.e. same velocity, unless an external force acts on it. Assuming the things that we feel are forces, we only feel movement when it is changing, i.e. acceleration. Newton‚Äôs second law confirms this as it states that force is directly proportional to acceleration. Again I probably just got wooshed but whatever.",1604189012

'give me that' is less polite than 'could you give me that' or 'give me that, please'.

what I am arguing against is the people making comments as if the art team working on this specific aspect of the game (hero art) somehow stops or hinders the development of new content. as if the art team could be reallocated to coding new content.

look at this meme. the first option is: ""improve the game based on opinions"". nobody has opinions about the art and those opinions cannot be fixed by the art team. the art team cannot be reallocated to something like creating gear loadouts for example. it's a completely lazy take and you're trying to pin me down on an argument I did not make.

this happens ALL THE TIME in every game I've played for the longest time and I always see these lazy arguments. some new art thing comes out and people argue ""why not fix this other thing instead"" that has nothing to do with art.

That's the mentality I'm arguing against.

If you think the art team has other art related things that they should be doing instead, great. I can possibly agree with you on that. But that's not the argument I am making or the conversation the meme at the head of this thread is trying to incite.",1604189017

"IndianCountry","t5_34kjy","Hey there. I‚Äôm a Native adoptee too (post-ICWA), though I was lucky enough to know my dad‚Äôs Tribe (shortly after I found out I was adopted on accident at 18)! I don‚Äôt have many answers but I‚Äôm happy to help in any way I can.

I personally haven‚Äôt connected with family through DNA tests (though from what I hear on /r/Adoption, AncestryDNA and 23andMe are the commercial DNA tests with the largest user base, so using those sites has the greatest likelihood of connecting with family - many recommend taking tests on both sites to increase the likelihood of matching with family incase a relative tests on one site and not the other). A lot of Natives don‚Äôt take commercial DNA tests for a variety of reasons, so I‚Äôm not sure if you‚Äôll be successful finding relatives that way, though I really hope that‚Äôs what happens!! There was a fairly recent post where someone connected with a cousin through a DNA test, I‚Äôll try to find the post tonight or tomorrow and link it here!

Something else people recommend is using a ‚Äúsearch angel‚Äù, they‚Äôre volunteers who help adoptees find their families (for free) and sometimes can offer further help with reunion. I haven‚Äôt worked with one personally, so I can‚Äôt speak to it much, but I think there‚Äôs a few Facebook groups where you can ask for help and link up with someone. I‚Äôd recommend searching /r/Adoption or making a post there asking for more info if you end up going that route. (Despite lack of personal experience, I‚Äôd encourage it! Folks who‚Äôve gotten their help speak very highly of them. I wish I had known about search angels when I first started looking for my dad. He ended up passing away very young, and I really wish I‚Äôd known that there were other people who could‚Äôve maybe helped me find him before he walked on.)

Do you have your adoption papers, or were you adopted through an agency that you could request all of your adoption records from? When people are adopted, they‚Äôre issued a new birth certificate (with no indication it was amended), but if your family didn‚Äôt save a copy of your original birth certificate you can [check to see if the state you were born in allows adoptees access to their original birth certificate](https://adopteerightslaw.com/united-states-obc/). If not, you can try to petition the state to unseal your OBC.

Once you know your bio parent‚Äôs names, you can trace your genealogy to find out who your greater family and what Tribe/s your family belongs to. 

It‚Äôs a really difficult process, I wish it was easier. Hopefully you can connect with family through DNA or a search angel, but if not, don‚Äôt lose hope, it‚Äôs still possible to find your family and your Tribe.

If it‚Äôs okay to ask, did the social workers &amp; parents know you were Native when you were being adopted? Did you know your bio family was Native growing up? Have you asked your adoptive family how they knew you were Native, but not the specific Tribe?",1604189017

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","Oh right. If order does matter than this becomes a much bigger problem. Instead of `n C k` you get `n P k` where P stands for permutation. Instead of 8!/(4!4!) you have just 8!/4!, which is 1680 - much larger than 70. Although possible given a couple of hours or maybe even a day or two, I don't think you'd want to go through all that.

So maybe the thing you were thinking about, going for fingerings on guitar rather than just note names, is in fact what we want to do. The thing is, you'll have to better define how to decide mathematically if something is physically realizable on the guitar. I said it was messy last time, and that might be true, but you might be able to make some simplifying assumptions. I mean, we did that even in the note identity case: we said that *any* collection of four distinct notes is a chord, even if it sounds weird and crunchy.

For example, we might relax our restriction on being from the diminished scale to be the full chromatic scale so we don't have to deal with that weirdness. Then, we can say we use all four fingers on all four different strings. That alone gives 4! = 24 different orderings of the fingers on the string. Then maybe you can say you have different hand positions on the neck... like, eight or something (I don't play guitar, so I don't really know what's a reasonable number here) so multiply 24 by 8. Or maybe even within a position each finger has a choice of two or three different frets? If two frets for each of your four fingers, this is 4^(2), which becomes 24 * 8 * (4^(2)) = 3072, which is... also kind of a lot, and actually more than the other method.

But these are my assumptions, and I don't really know what I'm talking about with respect to guitars. (Violas, maybe we can talk, but guitars are a bit more foreign.) You'll have to figure out how you best want to translate your situation into math, what variables you can vary and by how much.

Also, seeing you write this whole list out - it very well might be worth your time to try to figure out how to make a Python (or other language) script to do this for you, because that does look tedious and hard to see which ones you've missed when doing it manually. But even 1680 is nothing for a computer to list out, and this isn't too complicated of a problem to code up. Learning a scripting language is definitely something that's worth your time if this is the kind of problem you think about often, just so you don't have to go through the boring gruntwork.",1604189017

"RedditAlternatives","t5_2ufot","the kind of trust that matters most in a platform focused on feed generation and info discovery is trust that the platform is not focusing on their own priorities rather than the users' priorities - the least transparency in feed generation and info gatekeeping the more trust required

on centralised platforms there are inherent trust factors that users are fully responsible to accept IMO, like the assumption that the provider will always do their best to collect and use your data for their own advantage, including in user-hostile ways. Also that the work you put in your posts is not necessarily going to be specially looked after beyond the platform interest, which is usually short-term and popularity-based. But these factors, as opposed to the ones in the first paragraph, are strongly coupled with the nature of centralised platforms and thus you have signed into them by participating

In https://archive.vn/SZV1c (""Don't Contribute Anything Relevant in Web Forums Like Reddit"")

this particular issue CAN and SHOULD be mitigated IMO. I interpret your platform as an attempt to mitigate a proxy issue of this one (user-interaction generating quality problems that are typically mitigated through semi-automatic mod/admin intervention, which in turn leads to major trouble - thus through mitigating the first link in that chain you also mitigate the second in practice).

"PSO2","t5_2sjei","Hero naturally has a 65% crit rate when attacking weak points, and this jumps to 85% with the critical strike rings.  Given that, the critical hit damage (Precision Will) is always better on hero than raw damage (Agressive Will).

S1: Skillful Adept is tempting.  15% more crit rate brings you to 100%, but it seems to be mathematically less damage than S1: Agressive Will, even when combined with S2/S3: Precision Will.

Since you have an 8 slot weapon, S1: Augment Will is extremely powerful, a 4% damage boost at all times.  This is probably the best S1 in the game for most weapons, but it's also extremely expensive. 

Double Edge is a neat set of affixes if you're good.  Cheaper and more powerful than other damage options, with a tradeoff of taking more damage.  Since Heros want to be dodging most attacks, a sufficiently good hero player will really like these affixes, while a sufficiently bad one will hate them. 

Leach Life as your S4 is always a safe choice.  You can substitute it for something else if you have a reason to, but if you don't have something else in mind it's a great fallback plan.  Especially for TMGs.",1604189020

"AskAChristian","t5_2s79d","Some of the commentaries bring out that the Hebrew verb carries with it the aspect of intent. Thus JFB has:

- y¬™shuwpkaa (H7779) ro'sh (H7218), shall watch or lie in wait, so as to attack; to fall upon suddenly (cf. Job 9:17; Psa 139:2; cf. Rom 16:20), and the clause is thus rendered by Gesenius, **'He shall seek to crush thy head, and thou shalt seek to bite his heel'.** 

Thus the prophecy is more about an ongoing condition of enmity between Jesus and satan than about Jesus' ultimate victory, though we can surmise that victory implicit in it. The emphasis then becomes the contrast between what the two antagonists can do: Jesus will be looking to bruise the head; while satan will only be able to bruise the heel. Since satan's portion is decidedly inferior, it makes sense that the clause referring to him comes second. The sense could be written as, ""He will seek to crush your head, while you will only be able to bite his heel'. IOW, you lose, satan.",1604189020

 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-0009.12469)  
  
&gt;Changes in US state policies since the 1970s, particularly after 2010, have played an important role in the stagnation and recent decline in US life expectancy.

&gt;Some US state policies appear to be key levers for improving life expectancy, such as policies on tobacco, labor, immigration, civil rights, and the environment.

&gt;US life expectancy is estimated to be 2.8 years longer among women and 2.1 years longer among men if all US states enjoyed the health advantages of states with more liberal policies, which would put US life expectancy on par with other high‚Äêincome countries.

"EscapefromTarkov","t5_3aq6o","If you could watch it after the raid end, I think that it is definelty something that should be in the game. However, replays can be buggy and a lot of games have issues with replays not being super accurate and will often miss out on fine detail. 

Take CS:GO for an example, watching someone flick with an AWP will often miss the actual movement of the sights, leading to it looking like the player shot way of but still hit dead on. Now think of having that in a game with a lot of bugs and allegedly ""bad net code"".

Also, it doesn't really feel like something that should be in Tarkov, but it definelty would give me a lot of "" okay yeah he got me in a fair way, I was being stupid"" moments. Instead of ""wow this game dumb, that's bullshit""",1604189021

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules
&gt;
&gt;r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

And once the family no longer has any news from their child, they might change their minds. If they don't, don't come back into their lives.

Further, the prospects for another economy that could replace the agricultural economy of the south (which relied HEAVILY on slavery) were never really found. 

Basically, and I really don't mean to come off as provocative, but the USA needs to mend the ""hearts and minds"" of the South in the same way we have fought for cultural victory in the wake of a military victory in other countries. To make a (provocative) point: the US needs to invade the south, give them better education, better healthcare, more economic opportunities and greater recognition of equality, the same way the US has attempted (sometimes harder than others) to re-stabilize a region of the world.",1604189024

"starlingbankuk","t5_3lhkx","Paying for accounts does seem like the general direction of travel - interest rates are heading to zero, benefits of premium current accounts are being cut, and the FCA has been cutting down on punitive fees and rates charged to customers. Not to mention that it's a lot harder to cross-sell pointless PPI products these days.

It would appear margins are getting thinner.

In my opinion (and I realise it's an unpopular one), we should be paying for even basic current account service. It's fairer to charge everyone a base fee, so that other fees can more accurately reflect the actual cost of service, rather than have to recover margin. Current accounts cost a lot of money to run, although presumably banks such as Starling and Monzo have a much lower overheads than high street banks.

But if Starling can do it by up-selling useful features, that would seem better to me than bundling them into account tiers with features I don't want.",1604189027

"Stadia","t5_xa0lk","&gt;their marketing team is awful at communicating this properly

Oh my gosh, yes, a thousand time this! I actually had a conversation with a friend who didn't believe me that this was the case, and wanted to invest in a different streaming platform as a result. I told him I was certain it worked this way, but he said there wasn't any marketing data about it from the Stadia team. He didn't trust the answer as a result. My friend went with a different platform. That's just once anecdotal example, but I can't help but wonder how many potential customers Stadia lost out on just by not making these points painfully clear:

1. You don't need a subscription to play. Purchased games and demos are available without a subscription at all. 
2. Any games you claim if you have a Pro sub will always be available to you when you have an active Pro sub. Even if you cancel and reactivate later, those games will still be present. 

People just don't seem to believe these two things are real, mostly because Stadia's marketing isn't clear about them.",1604189027

(Extra effect on casting detached spells, maybe moving MS buff to on-attach so you have to detatch to apply it, maybe making AF temporary on E use, reverting the health buff that dis-incentivized cut down autoing, things like that.)

But all that stuff 1. Increase the complexity of her kit, which I don‚Äôt think is a bad thing but Riot clearly wants her to be a simple champ (edit: which, to be clear, I think is respectable. But I think it's too extreme currently) and 2. Would definitely require a lot of testing to get a good balance with her W... which I think is worth the effort, but yknow, Riot wanted her out of proplay ASAP instead of making her more interesting to watch.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt; That's in hindsight

Hahah, you asked why it's his fault pandemic is bad......and then just waive off the first valid reason with ""hindsight"". What a tool. lol

No rational people blame him *for* covid-19 happening (just like no rational people believe Covid-19 is a conspiracy or hoax). But it is factual he did things that actively (and continues to do so) make it worse. But you just say, ""pffft - that's hindsight that dismantling a highly educated team that is meant to deal with a pandemic made the pandemic worse."" If you don't have the foresight to understand that would do that....can you really just claim ""hindsight is 20/20""

""I drove wasted, really it's hindsight that I shouldn't have driven wasted and got in that wreck killing masses of people. Just hindsight is all, not my issue.""

Obviously you're just supporting someone blindly and all this will fly in and out of your ear and just get some stupid response out of you. This is mostly for others. Why do these people exist? Why do we (US) have so many people that can't admit someone they support fucked up.

"OpenVPN","t5_2sei0","In the openvpn manual, it mentions that these are indeed aliases for IP addresses. You want to be able to route to some remote host (e.g. company.internal) through the VPN, using the remote gateway (e.g. 10.8.0.1) to get there.

So remote_host is going to be the IP of what you want to access, and the remote_gateway is the IP of the machine hosting the VPN server (usually 10.8.0.1).

The subnet mask says which hosts to also forward traffic for. 255.255.255.255 says ""just route that one machine through VPN"". 255.255.255.0 says ""route it and its 255 neighbours through VPN"".

Ubuntu import tool simply doesn't understand that they need to pass these verbatim through to OpenVPN client.

In terms of your Internet connection, do you want to forward everything through the VPN? If so, there is a setting ""redirect_gateway def1"" which essentially takes care of that for you. It might not have been imported correctly. It would probably be an advanced configuration setting.

The ""Use this connection for only resources on this network"" is another Ubuntu quirk setting which emplaces another soft limit over the top of any connection preventing you from sending your whole Internet connection through. Best leave it off if you want to do that.",1604189028

Drive the nozzle so low that it almost hits the part - so just a layer above. Make sure in the meanwhile your bed is still heated. Note the Z hight and turn off the hot end to prevent cooking the filament. Head to your PC and modify the original gcode. Just cut everything from the beginning right to the layer the print failed at. Reupload the new gcode under a new name. Heat up the hot end and purge enough filament to ensure everything works fine.  Now stop the paused, failed print, turn on the bed heating right away and start the cut-down print right away.

Within your stated budget there‚Äôs the [Miele Classic C1 Pure Suction](https://www.amazon.com/Miele-Classic-Suction-Canister-Graphite/dp/B07P97CD5T), but to better care for your area rugs, I would recommend spending a bit more for the [Miele Classic C1 Turbo Team](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P97JJNZ/?ref=exp_performancereviews_dp_vv_mw) which comes with both a hard floor tool and and air powered turbo brush for your rugs. 

Another great option if you can stretch your budget to about $400 is to buy a Karcher CV300, which is a cheaper commercial variant of the SEBO Dart/Felix for about $329. It only comes with a (really good) motorized cleaner head for use on carpets and rugs (because the brush roll cannot be switched off. It is exceptional with pet hat though) *but* you can also buy the SEBO *Kombi* cleaner head which is suited for both hard floors and area rugs.

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","&gt;During the city's construction, the Nords unearthed the Eye of Magnus, **which they attempted to keep secret by burying it under the city**. The Snow Elves learned of the powerful artifact, however, and wanted it for themselves. They attacked the city in order to secure this power, an event known as the Night of Tears. Everyone except for Ysgramor and his two sons, Yngol and Ylgar, were killed and the city was burned to the ground. Ysgramor fled back to Atmora to gather an army with which to fight the Elves. **Before the Snow Elves could find their prize**, Ysgramor and his Five Hundred Companions returned, strengthened by powerful enchanted weapons and armor created by Ahzidal, drove the Elves back from Saarthal, and began a campaign to drive them from Skyrim entirely.

Additionally, Chirirnis detailed Nord architecture and its durability:

&gt;Indeed, I was surprised to find that many areas of the city, far more than I would have believed, retained much of the original stonework. Work was clearly done to remedy the effects of the city being burned after the elves' assault, but I suspect they underestimated the durability of Nordic craftsmanship.

They were unable to find the Eye because of how well constructed it was. After Saarthal was abandoned:

&gt;Jyrik Gauldurson discovered the source of his father's power: a mysterious amulet. Together with his brothers, Sigdis and Mikrul, they conspired to murder their father in his sleep and divide his amulet between them. Consumed by power, he and his brothers laid waste to the surrounding villages until the High King sent Archmage Geirmund leading a company of battlemages to stop them. After a fierce battle, Geirmund pursued Jyrik to the ruined city of **Saarthal, where he was defeated and sealed away within**.

Since we meet Jyrik in the Eye's chamber, it is clear that man was responsible for sealing away the Eye.

&gt;Be bound here, Jyrik, murderer, betrayer  
Condemned by your crimes against realm and lord.  
May your name and your deeds be forgotten forever  
And the charm which you bear be sealed by our ward.

You failed to give an example, so I did. I provided facts and reasons for why it failed, citing existing economic and historic political issues rather than it purely being their socialist government. I gave you an opportunity to explain why it being socialist caused it to fail. You failed to give reasons, and summed it up to nothing more than ""cuz dictators and socialism"" as to why it failed, then proceeded to go back to ""everytime"" when I mentioned the country's previous political unrest when it was a democracy, and provided examples of democratic politicians becoming power hungry even now. As such, I went back to asking for an eample because clearly you weren't well-versed in the example I gave. Rather than sparking a debate on a topic in your expertise that would allow us to narrow down specifics and determine if socialism was the cause or if there were outside variables at play that could have influenced it, you proceed to say ""bad faith"" and that you don't need to provide and example. From the information gathered, you're nothing but an illogical teen who goes on Facebook looking for conservative memes bashing socialism.

"Anarchy101","t5_2s960","I don't disagree with you if we're talking about sciences in general however in my experience the way STEM is taught doesn't teach critical thinking in the same way criticism of capitalism is done. It might depend on particular curriculum (unversity, country, teacher) but STEM people are often taught how to crank numbers to get answers, not how to question whether line going up actually makes sense outside of given context. There's little space dedicated to morals and ethics since such answers are just answers. After all most people are expected to become a part of workforce, educational systems are still based on idea of making us productive rather than critical.

In my experience people who go into humanities are already thinking a bit more critically or are at least interested in what other people have to say, it's rare they'd disregard other sciences like STEM people tend to do. Then they actually might have something to do with sociology, psychology, history etc. that might help them see systemic problems.

I'm in IT and the amount of ancap-ish ideas and neoliberals in this and similar industries is staggering. Maybe that's because IT in my area (Poland) still is privilleged since salaries are closer to Western salaries than in many other industries and being overworked like you happens mostly in gamedev or specific corporations. Maybe it's because STEM people are praised too much as those who create wealth, change the world or whatever and think too highly of themselves. Maybe our educational system is just more fucked up - we have lots of issues with conservatives and neoliberals using unis to teach bullshit.",1604189030

But you're probably right about the ""demographic"" being a little different for Chess in the 60s vs other tournaments today.  Wouldn't BEING in a tournament though, in and of itself, make participants feel a little more at home and on even ground?  Because everyone is there for the same reason.  It's not like walking through a school hallway and being the odd man out, everyone around you is there for the same reason.  But yeah I can completely see the difference between how a nerdy dude approaches a woman he's interested in, vs a guy who's used to attracting his own attention.  There's more caution applied, usually, less entitlement and expectation...of course that's not always the case, but still.  I think most Chess Champions sit firmly in the knowledge of their own intellect, and that has a way of overpowering other insecurities.  Also, being highly logical, the approach to social circumstances may also end up being a bit more formulaic.  I wouldn't really know though, I'm just speculating.

I like studying human behavior, so even in a work of fiction I'm assessing the realism of how characters interact...and at first I felt like the show was giving me an accurate depiction of what would have gone on at these tournaments, right down to the sideline relationships she allowed to form.  But then at the very end, when she was in Moscow, it just started to feel unrealistic, or idealized maybe.  And the only thing I could think of to account for why everyone was treating her like an angel (though she played like a shark) was because she ""looked"" like one.  I think you're right, the men would have still been polite, and gentlemanly regardless, out of duty and respect...but they all seemed to practically THANK HER for beating them and that made me want to pull my hair out.  Especially when we never saw that kind of behavior at any point before.",1604189031
"SubSimGPT2Interactive","t5_2oxp1s","I'm curious what you think. I mean, your username (there's also a /r/dungeonsanddragons sub) gives you an insight for a different way of thinking about one thing.

Yeah, it would be nice to have some time to get out of the house. I always think about how I'll end up, and then how I'll have to think about why I did it the way I did. What started as a ""I can't eat the shit that's in the fridge"" idea comes in handy with a fridge full of food (I always wanted to get a bit more out of the fridge before I started. Also, I am a huge nerd, and I like my fridge filled with a lot of junk food).

Yeah. I would think about what happens when you're in a good place, and then you're in a bad place. I have really bad memories of the last time I was in the good place, and then you're in the bad place, and then you're back where you were, and there is a reason for why. It's always interesting to find out how memories affect how they are remembered within a situation, and how they affect when you're in one place and then there's another place that you're in.

Not always, just the best time of your life is the time I spent with you as a kid, back when we were still with each other. I think your username gave you an insight into how people act around each other in a situation that could have been anywhere. We need to remember that shit happens, and it's funny to see it, because something else that happens to us. It's funny because when you're an idiot, there's a lot of things that can happen to us.

Yeah. I think it's so much better when you're a kid, and the girl is your sister. Then you're an idiot, and then you're a smart idiot. Don't be so obvious when you're around people, you'd probably end up in a rich acquaintance spot. You'd probably just be a dumb ass, and you'd end up like the guy at the party. It's better when you're close with who you are than when you're just too weird to feel comfortable around people. Maybe you can even just end up kind of bored.

I start by pressing both arms straight out in front of me and then pulling back to my chest.  

Then I hold my arms straight out to the side (with a very slight bend at the elbow just to keep my elbows from locking), and keeping my arms extended move them toward each other til my hands kind of touch at the front

Then I press both arms straight up overhead and then bring them back down to my shoulders

Then I do bicep curls

Then I do a modified bicep curl, where I keep my elbows by my side but hold my hands out at a 45 degree angle

Then I make circles by holding my arms kind of straight and moving them toward the center of my body and letting my arms cross one over the other and then up over my head, and then the circle continues with both arms out to the sides and kind of end up in my lap

Then I put one weight down, and using the other weight, I hold it in one hand with my arm straight over my head, using my other hand to kind of hold and support my tricep, and then bend the arm holding the weight at a 90 degree angle behind me - you feel this one in your tricep

"gpdxd","t5_3fjfx","The XD Plus has a better CPU than the Pocket 2 and does everything up to PSP/Dreamcast well. I don't have a Pocket 2, but from videos I've seen online, it looks like limited PSP/ Dreamcast and some spotty N64 will be the best you can get out of it. 

The XD Plus is fairly well made, controls are good and it had a great battery life. You will need to install CleanROM to get the most out of your device, although it's a fairly painless task to achieve, and once you've done it, is easy to upgrade. 

I'd say Dreamcast with ReDream is pretty much flawless on VGA mode, PSP is pretty good but you'll have to use frame skip to get GOW to play nice - most others will play well with up to 2 X resolution with the right setup. I wouldn't advice GC though - it requires a lot of work to get a small set of games to play at 30fps, and even then you'll have to switch Dolphin builds to play certain games at a half decent speed. If GC is your thing, you're best off getting the Moqi I7s. Only drawbacks with the Moqi are it lacks L2/R2/L3/R3 buttons, which can be handy for some of the more advanced systems (which the XD Plus does have) nor does it have HDMI out (which the XD Plus has). Plus it's a lot more expensive.

As an alternative, for slightly better performance than the XD Plus (but not as good as the the I7s), you could look at the Moqi I7 - it has a better CPU/GPU than the XD Plus, but again, has no L2/R2/L3/R3 buttons or HDMI out. It retails for slightly cheaper than the XD Plus at the moment as well.",1604189032

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt;Today [US spending] hovers at around 40% [of GDP].

That is _enormous_ when you keep in mind that welfare programs (and thus expenses) are really small compared to other countries. 

I live in Switzerland, our government spending is 30% of GDP and unlike the US we have a functional social security net, expansive welfare programs and universal healthcare. Also, public schools are extremely well-funded (almost better than private schools imo) and college education is free. 

It's not like we don't spend anything on the military either, we have a militia system which means (theoretically) every Swiss male (myself included) spends at least half a year of their life in basic military training and can be mobilized in case of war, which means the state has to pay for an enormous amount of equipment, food, salaries etc.

You‚Äôre acting like what they required is like insane, when for a lot of parents that is bare minimum, a lot wouldn‚Äôt let the partner sleep over at all. They‚Äôre old school, and obviously saying no sex as their only birth control talk does no one any favors, asking him to sleep in the other room isn‚Äôt that big a deal. For people that strict I‚Äôm surprised he was allowed to stay at all. They‚Äôre assholes because obviously the bucket thing was over the top and they failed on the BC talk with you when you were younger.

I‚Äôm 25 and moved back home at the moment saving up, and I‚Äôm in a long distance relationship. We‚Äôve been together 6 years and my parents have always had the rule he could stay but he had to sleep on a separate mattress on the floor. Normally we stay in a hotel but he stays at the house a few days every time he‚Äôs here. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm 25 and not allowed to have sex, they just aren‚Äôt comfortable with me being unmarried and sleeping with a guy in their home. If I want to do it anywhere else on the planet it‚Äôs fine, just not their house. And I can respect that rule because it‚Äôs their house. I don‚Äôt like the rule but I‚Äôm the one living in THEIR house.

&gt;	Despite numerous studies, there is no evidence that symptoms associated with CLD are caused by any persistent infection.[3] The symptoms attributed to chronic Lyme are generic and non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain, and in many cases are likely due to fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome.[4][5] Fibromyalgia can be triggered by an infection, and antibiotics are not a safe or effective treatment for post-infectious fibromyalgia.

Astrid seems much more likely a candidate. And given what Caleb's seen in her so far, possibly a better choice from Caleb's perspective anyways, since it gives him someone at the head of the Assembly he knows he can... maybe not really trust, but at least not really distrust who he thinks is equally in favour of burning out what he sees as the corruption at Assembly's heart.",1604189036

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","When you rent an apartment or condo or house from someone else, you are left without anything of value at the end of your lease. 

When you take out a mortgage for a house, you can start to build equity with it. As a bad example, say you take out a 15-year $200,000 loan for a $200,000 house. In 5 years if you've only paid the minimum payment, you'll have paid off $66,000 worth of the loan. And *hopefully* the property value has either stayed the same (fine) or increased (desirable). So when you've had a place to live for five years, plus when you go to sell it, you'll actually get a return on the money that you put in to owning it. 

There are other variables, it's not always a clean thing since obviously you have to pay for repairs, new appliances, etc. whenever something goes bad. But it's still usually overall a gain on your original investment.

And you can take out a second mortgage in the form of a home equity loan or line of credit to use as a down payment for a second property; in doing this, you can rent out the original property that you purchased while moving in to a larger place (or live in your first place and rent out the second place).

edit: Also it's pretty common to work your way up through things you can afford. I.e., a financially savvy person is not going to graduate college, get an entry level job, and buy a Lamborghini. You *should* live within your means, and for many people who can afford to get a house it makes sense to start with a cheaper house and move into a larger one as your family and income grow.",1604189038

And scientists are now up saying that the current sea level rise is increasing. IF the IPCC models made wrong predictions, it's because they *under*estimated the rate of land ice shells melting.

I wouldn't focus on the disasters of the Permian mass extinction event - the ones we are triggering now are worse enough on their own.

"TryingForABaby","t5_2sil5","This!! I am an only and hated it. I live 2000km away from my parents now if that says anything. They're not bad people (although my dad was an alcoholic - he quit drinking the week i moved out to go to uni), we're just not close. I always wanted to have kids and couldn't stand the thought of having an only child because I was so lonely growing up. I often gravitated (knowingly or not) to friends with big families - I loved the hustle and bustle and the noise, whereas my house felt like a sanctuary... cold and empty.

My partner has 2 older siblings and the 3 all live in different countries. One sib is in the Western US, the other in Europe. His mom lives in the Midwest and dad in the South, and we're in eastern Canada. Despite the distance, he's really close with one sibling and his mom, and fairly close with the other sibling. I don't know what will happen if either parent falls ill (or mine for that matter), but technology makes it so easy to connect nowadays. 

I think anything can happen in relationships and I know I'm risking (hopefully) raising 2 kids that may never get along. But I think fostering deep relationships as a parent affects that. I feel like my relationship with my parents is very surface level (not a deep emotional bond) and i think that's spilled over into most of my other relationships.

All that to say, OP I don't think there's a right or wrong answer. I knew lots of only children that loved it. I know lots of people with siblings who wouldn't trade it for the world and others that haven't talked to their siblings in decades. A lot of it is a gamble. I think the only hope we have as (prospective) parents is to create safe, secure and deep connections with our (future) kids.

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","&gt;25% more of your paycheck. Do you know how insane that is?!

Considering you just made that number up completely, yes that is insane. Providing free post secondary education would not cost that much even if you use current estimates, and if the government was negotiating on behalf of a group of students who just grew in size due to newly available loans the prices will begin to drop dramatically.

The same with healthcare lol. Once the government can negotiate with corporations on behalf of ALL of its citizens, you can the leverage necessary to create competitive pricing. Once you have a much larger part of the population using that service, its costs drop due to economies of scale.

But forget all that, lets stick to this comment and address the fundamental delusions that have lead you to your confusion. You think;

A) The US government ""has loads of unnecessary spending"". In reality only 2 first world governments have a lower rate of governments pending per gdp. If the US government were to cut the so called ""unnecessary spending"" you're complaining about, it would surely make them rank as the worst.

[https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-spending-to-gdp](https://tradingeconomics.com/country-list/government-spending-to-gdp)

B)That implementing the plan would cause the average persons taxes to increase by 25%. It could be entirely funded through relatively modest (relative to every other first world country) taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Or instead of charging Trillions to taxpayers and giving that money out to the aforementioned corporations and billionaires like Trump did with the largest bailout in US history, maybe we just give it to kids so they can go to school?

Start taking 5,000 IUs (or 125 micrograms) of vitamin D3 per day.  Lithuania is a really dark and dreary place this time of year.  You are probably suffering from vitamin D3 deficiency.  In a week or so, move up to 10,000 IUs per day.

Buy the 5,000 IU (125 microgram) pills so that you can take 5,000 IUs and then 10,000 IUs.  You can get these pills on Amazon.  They are not very expensive.

Initially you may have what is known as a detox.  It feels like you are going backward.  Don't worry about that.  You will get over that.  It is a natural part of the healing process.

"Oxygennotincluded","t5_3f1fv","&gt; overheating is a serious issue in my base designs.

More space to expand absolutely won't help you there other than allowing you to use the entire map as a heat sink. But trust me, it's not lack of space holding you back there.

&gt; I do not possess information of optimized cooling setups and in principle do not like copycatting the designs of others. 

The one setup that you honestly absolutely *have to* learn is the Steam Turbine + Aquatuner setup. And the reason for that is that even a shoddy one creates massive amounts of cooling unmatched by any other building in the game. One of those provides more cooling than 70 wheeze worts, and more cooling than 10 AETNs.

&gt; For my base cooling setup I tried to make a massive cold room around the Anti Entropy Thermo-Nullifier I found. My thought process was that I would allow the cooled hydrogen to be pumped around my base only when it had reached a cold enough temperature.

Everything about this is wrong, both in real life physics, and in in-game physics. Temperature is an almost completely useless measurement, because the thing that really matters is *thermal mass*, which in turn depends on specific heat capacity, and actual mass.

So you wanted to ""store"" cold in a room around your AETN, and you decided to use hydrogen. If your hydrogen is pressurized at 5kg/tile, then a single tempshift plate made out of dirt can ""store"" *350 times* as much cold as one tile of hydrogen, because that's the difference in thermal mass between the two.

If you use a pool of polluted water to ""store"" cold, a single tile of 1000kg polluted water is *5000 times* better than a single tile of 5kg hydrogen..

And you wanted to use the hydrogen as a coolant, looping it around your base. That's also a mistake, because a full pipe of hydrogen contains 1kg, but a full pipe of polluted water contains 10kg, the specific heat capacity of hydrogen is 0.168, but 4.176 for water, which means you can move *250 times* as much heat around with a polluted water cooling loop, than with a hydrogen cooling loop.",1604189043

"BDSMAdvice","t5_3a545","&gt; *Do these woman know they are being brutalized?* 

Yes. Well, at least the ones relevant to this conversation. There's a big difference between BDSM and abuse that looks like BDSM. In fact how a scene plays out is almost always a reflection of what the sub is into, the Dom is using specific interests of the sub to get the sub into the 'headspace' that both parties are shooting for. Yes the interests of the dom matter too, but the dom is usually more interested in how the activity affects the mental state of the sub, and so they are doing things the sub has communicated prior will guide them into that space.

I would point out that the interest in this is not limited to women. There are plenty of men that are similarly interested. Also anything involving vomit is very rare and not something I've ever encountered, although I believe you about it being a thing.

I don't really know how to explain it other than to say that some people get tingles in their bits when they feel humiliated or degraded. I don't have a good explanation for how that works or why.

I'd also say that humiliation isn't a part of a lot of BDSM couples' play. When someone says they practice BDSM, they mean they practice one or a few of the many things that fall into BDSM, not all of it. For example, I mostly practice orgasm control (teasing, edging, denial, orgasm torture) related fetishes, which a little bit of bondage. I don't mind impact play, but I mostly only do it if my sub is into it.",1604189044

UK based and just canvassing opinions on Seat Mii S 15 vs Suzuki Celerio SZ2 66 plate category N (used to be D which means was in an sent but no structural damage occurred). 

The seat is selling for ¬£3400 (lowest price) and the Suzuki for ¬£3600 (but may go lower, yet to haggle) 

It's just for a school drop off second car. The Seat has 53400 miles, the Suzuki 25800. The category N on the Suzuki has photos and the damaged wing has been replaced by original parts. The Suzuki is much newer and has Dab radio, Bluetooth and electric windows, the Seat doesn't (but has AC). I just mention that as the seat seems solid but a bit old fashioned which will only get worse in future if we need to sell. Any thoughts on which way to go? Reliability and low costs are priority really.

Thanks for any thoughts!",1604189045

Dear /u/resumethrowaway12345!

Thank you for posting on /r/resumes. Please, let we mention some important information (probably you know it).

[Wiki Guidelines about Posting a Resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index#wiki_posting_a_resume)

Please, remember to add a **flair** to your post.

Due to the extremely increasing amount of spam/scam on the sub as posts, comments, in PM, and via GoogleAds on Reddit, we have to warn everyone about it. Unfortunately, such offers imply low-quality service - and actually, they are. Such scammers were banned, and there was some feedback on their work. So please, do not trust shady offers.  
One can find trusted professionals on the wiki - there is such a list.

We wish you get support from the sub in many ways, including reading it, top posts, wiki, and searching. There were many answered questions here, please, feel free to check that.

Besides, this subreddit is better looking in the old Reddit design on the desktop in the browser with adBlockers (FireFox/PaleMoon with uBlock Origin + uMatrix): https://old.reddit.com/r/resumes/

"NameThatSong","t5_2svj1","Your post was automatically removed - please post again with a more descriptive **title**:

1. **For identifying a song/artist/album** - include **at least one** of these details in your title:

`Era, Genre/Style, Artist Type or Artist, Source Name, Language, Lyrics, Music Video`

* Note that the safest way to make sure your post is accepted is to include at least one of the relevant keywords with a colon (Lyrics:, Source Name:, etc.)  
* If you know many of the details **don't overload the title** - only include the most important/unique details and put the rest inside the post.

`Examples of titles that will get accepted:`

    - 90's song by an alternative rock band (male singer/s)
    - Song by a female singer, possibly from the 80's
    - Upbeat Latin song
    - Song in Japanese, I think it's from an anime
    - Calm piano instrumental
    - Source name: [the name of a movie/TV show/YouTuber/etc. (if you have a link put it in a Link Post or in the body of a text post so it's clickable)]
    - Lyrics: [the lyrics]

`Titles that aren't descriptive enough:`

    - What's the background music called?
    - I forgot the name of this old popular song

2. **For identifying a genre** you should use a format like:

    - What's the genre of the song ""Title"" by Artist?
    - What's the sub-genre of this electronic background music?

2. **For locating an already identified song/album in a legal way** you should use a format like:

    - Help locate ""Song/Album Title"" by Artist
    - Where can I purchase/stream ""Song/Album Title"" by Artist?

##Make sure you've read the [guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/NameThatSong/comments/cu0x42) before posting, and good luck :)

Don't mistake red spiders for spider mites, spiders are helpful, and will eat bad pests! **[Scale insects](https://bugguide.net/index.php?q=search&amp;keys=scale+insect)** present as uniform shaped raised bumps, that can generally be picked off without damage to the plant. **[Fungus gnats](https://bugguide.net/index.php?q=search&amp;keys=fungus+gnat&amp;search=Search)** are small black flying insects.

"minnesota","t5_2qhxs","I understand the viewpoint of ""Screw Biden and Trump"", I really do. But one of those people is gonna hurt a lot more people than the other. That said.

The problem is a two-party system. Until you manage to get ranked choice voting nationwide, you're gonna have it come down to two options, and vote for the one you hate the least. Republicans are strongly opposed to it, because it would pry many more districts out of their grasp. Democrats are opposed to it because some of their districts would go further left, and they'd essentially be fighting on two fronts.

So, the only way to deal with it is to work for it from within their party structure. Start local, and work up the power chain. 

It sucks, and it is, honestly, years, maybe decades of work, but it's the only democratic way to break the stranglehold of the two party system.",1604189049

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","Had someone say that to me that if they liked the work I did, they would bump me up after 30 days. I put that shit in my calendar, you better fucking believe that on the 30th day, I was in his office. He bumped me - double my wage.

I think it was too see how aggressive I would be. Am I a weak person, or am I going to ask for what is mine.

Now, another person was hired the same day. 4 months later, she asked me if I asked for a raise, and I of course said that I did, right on the 30th day as he said. I asked if she went in to ask for the bump and she said no. She asked me how much and I said that the boss doubled my salary.

To me, that's why women are getting 70 cents of what men get (which I don't really accept that number, but whatever). There are countless studies of women who are not aggressive. And don't get me wrong, there's a lot of guys that would not ask on the 30th day as well, who are meek. Many people expect that they will be rewarded when the boss sees their hard work. Wrong. Ask. And give reasons why.

Now, for you women who think I'm being sexist (I also said men don't ask, too), what I am saying to you is don't be coy, don't try to give non-verbal signals. Don't expect equal pay for equal work. Make sure that you ASK. If you ask, then don't get equal pay, I agree with that. But if you're not aggressive, men and women equally, then don't expect to get paid more. And if more women than men just expect to be rewarded without asking for more money, then women overall won't be paid as much as men. You have to ask. You have to take initiative. You don't like to?

I'd also point out that despite it's great reputation it's not like DMR is impervious to error. However, they've done pretty well in the past couple election cycles.

2004 - DMR had Kerry +3, Bush won by 0.3.

Hi Everyone,

I also made a post about this, but I thought I'd try in here too since I'm getting kind of desperate because everything I'm trying isn't working.

I recently received the ymdk-ymd09 keyboard in the mail and I tried to flash it using QMK Toolbox and it failed. Now every time I try to flash it using QMK Toolbox (it recognizes it as a BootloadHID device), it disconnects it mid flash and it doesn't complete.

In the link of the seller, I realized that they have their own specific 'bootmapper' software, but that isn't recognizing the keyboard anymore since it's now a HID device.

The loss of stats on saving and reloading is because the game save only holds enough space for the normal stat values (ie. 0-15 for stats not HP and luck, 0-30 for luck, and 0-80 for HP). She must have base amounts that exceed that, but they usually don't exceed the class caps (which is just class base +15, or 30 lck/80HP), unlike enemies (shout outs to Reptor having 23 personal MAG to get 30 as a Baron). You could look at the RAM to see what her personal stats actually got set to. The lost stats is the same thing that happens with the Ced speed overflow glitch.

I personally think the point of revamping those zones is making them  an ever evolving endgame content, zones that are always relevant to the latest expansion gearing, mounts and daily/world quests making Azeroth lively and full again. This revamped Azeroth would be an instance mostly accessible only to 50 level characters and above. The zones of Azeroth would be slighlty updated afterwards to add new content relative to the expansion (mostly cosmetic rewards and/or expansion independant minor version of artifacts/heart of azeroth/soulbinds).",1604189056

I go to renumber the shirts, and get pissed off myself that I've forgotten he's ""Unavailable"" because the auto number gave him the 39 shirt.

"RocketLeague","t5_30cz1","It's not possible to win 4 games in a row, stay the same division, then lose 1 game and go down to the previous division where you started. It's more than likely that you just didn't notice you divisioned up to the next division and then lost the final game and moved back to the previous division.

The reason why it's not possible is because of the way MMR works. MMR goes up when you win and down when you lose. It is affected only by the rating of your opponents vs the rating of your team. You are matched with similarly rated players. On average, you gain and subtract the same amount of rating. And the vast majority of the time, the rating you gain and subtract is close to that average.

Let me make it clearer with an example. The average rating you gain and subtract is 9 rating. If you win 4 games in a row at 9 rating, you have gained 36 rating. If you lose one more game and subtract 9 rating, you are still up a total of 27 rating.

If we make the situation more extreme, and even improbable for a player in Silver/Gold/Plat/Diamond, you can gain a rating of 6 (3 rating below average) but subtract a rating of 12 (3 rating above average) and still end up higher. Four games at 6 rating each is 24 rating gained in total. Losing one game after that at 12 rating means you end up with 12 rating *more* than where you started.",1604189056

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined post &amp; comment karma

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

Its a standard action to use, it's limited by power level limits, you add 10 to rolls lower than 10 (to a minimum total of 11), the targets Parry/Dodge roll becomes that (vs non-perception, non-area attacks) and it requires you to make a hit roll against the target you're defending with penalties depending on how far away they are.

The real kicker is that you can apply the Reflect and Redirect modifiers to take any attack that misses and immediately use it. slap a bunch of the Split modifier on top and you can protect a maximum of 10 targets at the same time, boost a handful of weaker targets to PL defenses or use a civilian as bait to redirect attacks at other enemies.

This is the level of delusion we're dealing with.

I'll respond to just one part of this, because it's important:

&gt; &gt; Our allies no longer trust us and are setting up trade and defense organizations that exclude us.

&gt;If theyre setting up defenses against us they were never real allies to begin with. Could you give some examples of this happening?

On defense, Israel and NATO. Israel ended an intelligence sharing agreement after Trump revealed secret information to the Russians. The collapse of NATO is a stated goal of Russia, yet now Germany, France, and other NATO allies have publicly stated they no longer trust the US to live up to their responsibilities and security guarantees, and building separate defense alliances that exclude the US. The UK was ""never a real ally""? International polls show us having dropped from one of the most trustworthy countries in the world to highly distrusted. Our standing in the world has collapsed.

On trade, the Pacific free trade zone which was originally supposed to include the United States until Trump pulled us out. Now many of those countries are also signing trade agreements giving favored status to China. He's given away Asia to the CCP.",1604189062

"MilitaryPorn","t5_2sq9y","I don't think you can really compare them though. The QLZ-87 is meant to be carried around while the Mk19 is a more static weapon. The Mk19 also fires a larger grenade faster with longer effective range (1500m vs 600) and maximum range (2212 vs 1750).

Another comparison that could be made would be with the XM25 but this comparison would not be entirely fair either. The QLZ-87 might be made to be carried around easily, it remains a crew served weapon whereas the XM25 is a personal weapon like the M4 or the Minimi. And here the same comparison applies: more explosive and better range (although effective range is not too dissimilar) for the QLZ-87.

Overall, it's not really easy to say ""which is better"" without context as, being different weapons and concepts, comparison is meaningless. To give you an idea, you are not comparing the M2 with the Kord here. You are comparing it with the MAG. Sure the MAG is lighter and can be carried around easily. But in the end, if you need to engage at very long range, it is useless in comparison to an M2.

The increase in money supply is the main cause of inflation.

That increase doesn't instantly cause inflation either. The money that Is created need to first be spread in the economy to cause inflation. If it stays in bank accounts unspent it doesn't affect the value of the currency.

Instead of imagining that when government prints money everyone has 2 times more money, only a few investors got that money. It first needs to be spent by those investors before everyone has more money making money worth less.

As far as the pros and cons, the pros are that it's extremely cheap to operate (&lt; $5 to fill up), around 85 mpg, cheap to insure (about $10/month) and easy to get around, park, etc.  The cons would be not much storage, dangerous if you crash or are hit by a car, and the big one in my book is getting maintenance and repairs as there are not many scooter mechanics around and getting parts can be an issue.

I would definitely recommend buying a more established brand scooter such as a Yamaha or Suzuki.  Getting parts and maintenance done should probably be easier since most motorcycle shops work on these brands versus the Chinese/Taiwanese brands.",1604189067

At this point, if her fears keep her from enjoy a healthy full relation, it is more than justified that she goes to a therapist. But she must want to fix her problems and be able to change if necessary, otherwise the therapist couldn't help her. You can give her support and advice but the decission is up to her.",1604189067

"WeightLossAdvice","t5_31a4o","I feel this too! I‚Äôm recovering from a lifetime of disordered eating habits and am only recently learning to eat well and exercise without it becoming obsessive and spiralling into old patterns. The above comment is absolutely right, you should make this journey about building healthy lasting habits, and making yourself feel good physically and mentally. My advice would also be (if you haven‚Äôt already) put work into learning to love, or at least becoming neutral with your body as it is now, and adopt these new healthy habits BECAUSE you love it and want to take care of it. It shifts the focus from wanting to ‚Äúlook better‚Äù and also helps you learn not to beat yourself up when you fall off the wagon sometimes. 

It also really helps to ask a close friend or family member you trust to keep an eye on you, and gently pull you up if they notice you becoming obsessive, engaging in any negative self talk, or whatever your own early signs of relapse are. This is not shameful to do; acknowledging that you may not be able to do this alone is completely okay and shows massive courage. It‚Äôs important to keep yourself safe. 

Setbacks will happen- this is okay and normal, and they aren‚Äôt failures. Remember that if you feel yourself slipping, take some time off from whatever it is that‚Äôs triggering you; weight loss is not always a mentally healthy option for everybody and it‚Äôs okay if you can‚Äôt give 100% of yourself to it all the time- nobody can! This journey is yours and yours alone, and it‚Äôs a mental shift as much as a physical one. Good luck lovely ‚ù§Ô∏èüåª",1604189068

You are fantasizing about people who hurt you, what 10-15 years ago? They were kids and kids are fucking mean but I bet they are fighting their own demons now as well. Do you really want to spend your time (consciously, making an adult decision) attempting to make them feel how you felt? And also they're adults now, it'll never have the same effect. They shouldn't have done that, its traumatised you and there's no excuse but you shouldn't waste any more time on this. At 28 its keeping you awake at night and that's torture. You can't control other people's actions but you can make a difference to your own life.

Its just laying attention, not convoluted. Analizing information is something yiu just shoukd know

&gt;Haha. Didn't know it was an essay I was writing to a teacher instead of just talking about what I wanted to talk about in my first comment.

Writing clearly is just a common formality

&gt;Your hypocrisy is showing. Why claim to care when you don't? Oh, wait.. Yeah, you don't answer in a healthy way, nvm. You will probably shove another text based puzzle in my face.

I claimed I found environmentalism as a more appealing way to help nature and its species, I didnt pretend like Im the savior of this planet.

&gt;Of course you don't get it.

No, I dont, by now its redundant and you should know

&gt;Yeah, that's evident. It's something you can work on though, so that's at least a good thing!

Im too selfish to naturally do that, Itll take a while

&gt;I think that is the most simple answer you have ever given! I wasn't expecting that.


Using a very simplistic example that contrasts a lot with the complexity of the originak question is not a very fair, but sure.


&gt;You really are just a toxic unhealthy piece of shit, aren't you? Oops, there I go again, asking questions when I ""already should know the answers to that"".

Calling me toxic and flinging insults, interesting.

&gt;Oops, there I go again, asking questions when I ""already should know the answers to that"".

_""I got no real comeback, so Im just gonna deflect by ridiculing""_

&gt;You will probably shove another text based puzzle in my face.

So you like simplistic and shallow answers, nit sure hiw thats my fault.

&gt;I hope you ever work out the issues that you have and that you work on yourself in general. Maybe a therapist can help.

This is not a stock barrel. This is a 5.3‚Äù In Lead We Trust barrel with an integrated tri-lug mount. I‚Äôm using the shortest HBI handguard, yes.

I put the set up together before the micro came out. The micro has an even shorter barrel and will need to have a tri-lug adapter on the barrel (assuming you want to go tri-lug)‚Äîdepending on which adapter you get the can will likely be recessed under the handguard and while it will fit in, it would probably rub on the sides of the HBI handguard. 

I can‚Äôt say for sure if the standard scorpion (7.72‚Äù barrel) with stock handguard would work. Maybe would with a threaded on tri-lug adapter on the barrel I‚Äôm not sure about direct threading though‚Äîyou might not be able to thread it all the way on without hitting the bottom part of the handguard first.

Come on dude. Open your eyes. Devs can do what ever they want but as a player who knows this game really well from players perspective I should have a right to make a SUGGESTION. Thats what early access is for. You need to accept that this game is not half way there. It's already there. Not much is gonna change. Couple of maps is going to be added but if you really believe that it's going to be completly different from what we play right now...well...sorry to break it to ya but...nah dude.

"CruciblePlaybook","t5_37lup","I've mained this in PvP pretty much since Getaway Artist was released and I'd like to make a few extra suggestions.

I too like Grenade Launchers for this build. I currently use Truthteller with Autoloading Holster / Demolitionist to get grenade energy back sooner. But any weapon with Demolitionist is good, I currently have close to 3000 kills on The Epicurean with tap the trigger and demolitionist.

Landfall is not always great but definitely useful if you time it right. it can be used for an instant kill (I think) on full health guardians, or to do high damage against roaming supers followed by zapping them some more to shut them down. Doesn't always work but it does give you a fighting chance. It's easy to get carried away with trying to get kills with Landfall though, if you need to cross open space to get to the enemy, don't just jump towards them because they will mostly kill you before you get there and unleash it. If you do pull Landfall over enemies off, there's the danger of them surviving and scattering in all directions and you getting shot in the back. Don't get greedy, it's better to get one or two kills and survive than getting killed trying to wipe a team. 

If you stick with your homies and have high Recovery, your rift recharges fast enough
to have an Arc Soul up a lot of the time. Don't be afraid to throw a grenade rather than using it for an Arc Soul every now and then.

When using this build in 3v3 and you need to stick with a team mate, let the invisible hunter do his own thing. The Arc Soul will make them more visible, stick with the other one if there is one. 

I personally run 10-2-10 6-6-?. I don't know Strength because in all honesty, the melee is lackluster and I try to use armor that has high mobility/recovery/discipline/intellect. If you proc it that's fine but it's not much stronger than a regular uncharged melee and it's in my opinion more of a last resort tool than something you want to build around.",1604189069

I often have superpowers or its a game and nothing really bad ever happens. Like one time i got into a ghost hunting game in a vertical labyrinth in a water park. It was around 50m high and spanned a whole wall. Everything was made out of foam material you would know from water toys and indoor playgrounds and the side to the pool was made of colourful plexiglas. There were these rollers you could squeeze through and other fun stuff an traps.

The goal was to reach the exit at the bottom of the labyrinth. Every player had a nerf or water gun. If a ghost gets you you lose (or maybe we had multiple lives im not sure). The labyrinth was full of ghosts we had to pass by, we could shoot them but we only had so much ammo and they respawn after a while.

Anywayd i was like halfway down, get distracted by the people in the pool at the bottom, a ghost suddenly spawns behind me. I jump through two horizontal rollers (rolls? Idk I'm german, never had to describe indoor playground equipment in english before) but on the other side was a soapy incline so i slide down this soapy foam corridor full speed - straight into another ghost. Game over. 

I'm serious, i literally had a game over screen in this dream with the ""play again"" and ""leave"" options below it. 

And thats just one example of my weird chase dreams. Let's just say playground equipment is usually involved in some way. (Got superpowers from riding an old carousel once. Later New York got destroyed. Only partly my fault.)",1604189070

How about her making $600K a year and not saying one word about Julian Assange?

How about Cenk believing the lies of James Clapper, John Brennan, and selling their conspiracy that Russia interfered with the 2016 election over Hillary losing to a game show host because she failed to campaign in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, because she was a failed candidate?

How about Emma lying about Tulsi after she stated in 2017 that she was the future?

How about their lies about Libya and Venezuela where they bring on CIA people to talk about regime change?

Their $20 million from Jeff Katzenberg?

Their value failures to cover election fraud?

And to top that all off, they boosted the snake Warren when people knew that she was on team Hillary as far back as 2013 by being pin a secret letter from them?

What litmus test do I need them to be a part off where they failed everyone for years to sheepdog for the DNC as an extended part of the establishment narrative?

Though if Volcanica, Reid and Fulgel were friends with Satella could they of held back?  Subaru can 'kill' her, why can't they?  Maybe they didn't have the heart to?  Maybe Satella is hoping Subaru can pull off a mercy killing in the name of love?

"PeerTube","t5_ej4ep","Hey, I'm the creator of VidCommons, and that was definitely something that motivated me to start the project!

There are a few caveats, though. The first one is that YouTube (and other big providers) don't actually provide an accurate index of CC-licensed videos. In fact, the vast majority of search results for YouTube are in fact incorrectly licensed. I spent a good portion of last year trying to do research on what CC media is even out there...the situation is actually terrible.

* Big Content providers are flooded with poorly categorized, mislabeled videos, or indexes that are very difficult to meaningfully parse.
* Creative Commons as an organization is not doing a very good job at providing search
* Many CC-aligned organizations have died out, and their original content mirrors can no longer be found.

I've had some luck traipsing through [Archive.org](https://Archive.org) and various YouTube re-uploads, but it's an endless chore. My hope is that maybe we can align with some organizations that used to be about creating and promoting this content and finding a way to keep uploading new work.",1604189071

I again argue that it makes no sense for Sony to be tasking developers to make games for PlayStation VR when they are trying to have a launch library for the PlayStation five. Sony trying to launch the PlayStation five and PS VR two at the same time would be similar to Microsoft trying to launch Kinect 2 and the Xbox one at the same time. That was a huge mistake, not just because they were bundled.

Did NIntendo ever launch a game boy and a console at the same time? Of course not, it would be insane.

I just don‚Äôt see any reason to worry and I basically ONLY play VR games now. VR is in the future and it will be better than what currently exists.

Pros: It's covers a lot of topics such as accounting, cost/managerial accounting, corporate finance etc. I found the information to be interesting and challenging. The IMA is a great organization and their articles, newsletters, and studies are excellent. I think their dedication to the profession is second to none.

Cons: The certification is not well recognized. CPA is still king and will open more doors. Also, the exam fees and the study materials costs can add up.

I've been a CPA for 8 years but was furloughed earlier this year. I was fine financially especially with CARES act. I used my time to study and take the test. 

It won't lead to promotions or higher pay - that will depend mostly on your job performance lol. However, some companies really value the CMA and you will be paid accordingly. I recommend doing the CPA first then if you want, you can get the CMA.",1604189072

Anesthetists have to be ready to deal with whatever is thrown their way (unlike most other specialists, except trauma) so they best always be on their toes. 

The anesthetist dropped the ball with that guy. There‚Äôs just no two ways about it.

Oh, I forgot to mention - my friend (the CRNA) works at the local teaching hospital where most of the GSW and other gang / drug related traumas come in. He rarely knows what he‚Äôs walking into and yet he‚Äôs never had someone wake up in the middle of an OR like that. In 30+ years. Not a single one.",1604189072

"AvatarVsBattles","t5_k9uip","&gt;i don't believe Tenzin to be more powerful than Korra with airbending. 

If we count the TLOK video game, I don't either. Just look at [these](https://youtu.be/wqPsMIwFsO4?t=67) [feats](https://youtu.be/wqPsMIwFsO4?t=211).

&gt;The attacks that Tenzin landed on Zaheer Korra was able to perform  within the first few seconds of having airbending without any proper  training in bending the air itself.  

I'd chalk it up to inconsistency because Tenzin should have made bigger air blasts. [He demonstrated more powerful air blasts](https://gfycat.com/quarrelsomezanyanure) [time](https://gfycat.com/closedzealousindianhare) and [time again](https://gfycat.com/closedzealousindianhare).

&gt;Even though the entire group of airbenders were trying to push back Kuvira's mech, it didn't have any effect on it until Korra joined their effort and the impact of her airblast was what pushed the mech back, because it wasn't a gradual fall but a forceful push.

Two things to consider, [Korra had several seconds of charging her airblast and used the AS.](https://gfycat.com/grouchyevergreencat) Trust me, I rewatched this scene enough time to make sure if the airbenders charged up before the airblast and they didn't. [In her second air blast](https://gfycat.com/klutzysinfulhind), [Korra was still under the effects](https://gfycat.com/shabbytightkomododragon)[ of the AS](https://gfycat.com/shabbytightkomododragon). 

&gt;Furthermore, i think you interpreted this [scene](http://share.gifyoutube.com/yazebY.gif) incorrectly. Korra used airbending to enhance her jump, and crushed the rocks with earthbending. 

Trust me, I already considered this, but both [the guy who made Korra's RT](https://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/6qj6ij/respect_avatar_korra_the_legend_of_korra/?st=JS1MVXBD&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;sh=2d7853ca) and [the guy who wrote the transcript for Rebirth on the fan wiki](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Transcript:Rebirth#Main) believe it's purely an airbending move, so I'll stick to my stance.

&gt;based solely on what Tenzin can do and what an airbender of his rank  should be able to do, he potentially could've been able to put up a  decent fight, or may be even win that RL fight, even with P'li.  

That is... wow. Let's not open this can of worms now. However, you should make this post on this sub someday. It'll be a very interesting discussion.

&gt;I didn't use any actual physics terms because i don't know any

To your second question, I believe the primarily intent behind doing this is coopting the language of non-vegan foods to normalize veganism and make it seem more linguistically familiar to people. These foods, after all, are intended to imitate animal products and provide an alternative to them.

So yes, if you judge the reasoning behind magic actions based upon our own rationality, of course it‚Äôs false, it‚Äôs supposed to be. The point about magic and religion that most Anthropologists make is that, human groups that sustain this type of practice (some to this day) are not ‚Äúignorant‚Äù or some kind of proto-scientists (the uninformed, as the culturaly biased author of the review says), but that they operate on different rationalities, well suited to some things, and bad suited to others, as all epistemological and ontological systems are.
