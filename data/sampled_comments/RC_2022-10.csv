I own a store and manage the products for 2 others. Every store is going to be a little different based on their buying power, where they buy it etc.

Our 3 stores I'm projecting all disposables will have stickers by end of October or early Nov, all pods by November, and juice is 50/50. Any big provider like 12 monkeys is going to be fine until November. Smaller guys like Vaporus and 416 Vapes and people of that level are going to be any order past October 1st, basically. Thay said, if a store stocked up before, they will be good for a while.

They still took my money. Not one customer support person has helped or answered my questions. I am now refusing to pay 402 more dollars, as they act like I owe them, when this 500 was a simple transfer for ME TO USE TO BUY CRYPTO. How can I pay 400 more if you're going to take it and never give me my money back???? I don't know what to do as my credit is good. They are ruining my life at this point.

"worldwatch","t5_744jh9","&gt; The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its infection control and prevention page to recommend people no longer wear masks in healthcare settings. 

&gt; ‚ÄúThis guidance is applicable to all U.S. settings where healthcare is delivered (including nursing homes and home health),‚Äù said the CDC in a statement.

&gt; The statement went on to say high-risk people should continue to wear masks that fit them well. It said healthcare facilities can continue to offer well-fitting masks to visitors, but they should allow for freedom of choice. 

Wait, they claimed masks were to protect others and not yourself.  Now they're flipping to the masks will protect yourself.

&gt; Los Angeles County public health director Barbara Ferrer said on Tuesday she would continue to enforce masking in schools despite federal and state recommendations saying otherwise. 

&gt; ‚ÄúMasks do work,‚Äù said Ferrer. 

Figures some are going to want to continue to try to force masking.

&gt; This announcement comes after the CDC deleted its recommendation people wear masks to stop the spread of monkeypox in June.

&gt; The CDC said travellers should wear masks because of the risks of monkeypox. 

&gt; ‚ÄúWearing a mask can help protect you from many diseases, including monkeypox,‚Äù it said.

Second, our lodge meets once a month at a local restaurant where the public can go, meet up with freemasons in the area and ask any questions they might have, and make friends with the brothers. Third, we offer temple tours once a month.    
But the real reason I made the first step to meet with the brothers in my area was I had friends/coworkers that were freemasons and would talk about their fraternity openly. It is hard to make those first steps to go into a strange and unknown environment where it seems the parking lots are always empty, and the buildings are never lit up without knowing someone.

Coming across Numenoreans is a moot point. There‚Äôs no way for them to know that *anyone* is coming to their aid.

Their move to destroy the watchtower gave them a much greater chance of eliminating the orcs than fighting them hand to hand within a watchtower that had no room to fall back to.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","&gt;You are the one projecting, and also the one completely misreading the post if you think common criticisms of fraternities have nothing to do with OPs problem here. I never said anything about thinking lowly of the women,  I think pretty lowly of most of the men who look at frat culture and think  ""yeah, I want a piece of that"", but if I feel anything towards the women/teenage girls at these parties it's just concern, they are in a statistically dangerous environment after all. 

Which means you think lowly of these women (they're women, not girls). I don't see this same level of concern for the men at this party who are ALSO at a higher chance of being sexually assaulted by the men at this party. Why's that? Is it because you think women at risk are somehow less capable than the men at risk? 

You literally tried calling them teenage girls. Thats how lowly you think of them. You can barely get yourself to refer to them as women. Reflect on that. 


&gt;He's the DD because he is trying to suck up to the frat so he can become a full member, he isn't doing out of simple kindness, he literally says in the post that he feels obligated to do it, otherwise he will get kicked out 

Yeah, not seeing the asshole part here. He's doing something good that he was asked to do. 

&gt;At this point I don't even think you are engaging in this discussion with good faith tbh, you have to be self aware enough to know that the fact that it's a fraternity event had far more relevance than him being the DD. 

You're the one saying this post somehow has to do with sexual assault despite, you know, not being mentioned a single time in the OP. That's bad faith. The girlfriend didn't care about sexual assault. She cared that he was around scantily clad women. 

&gt;Also since when is safety a key concern of frat parties, give me a break.

Remember what I said about you PROJECTING your UNRESOLVED ISSUES with FRATERNITIES onto OP.

Perfect example right there. They wouldn't need a DD if they didn't care about safety. But since this doesn't jive with your unresolved issues with fraternities you have to ignore the reality of the situation and PROJECT your version onto it.",1664582403

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Wikipedia uses Scalable Vector Graphics files (.svg files) for its maps and diagrams. SVGs are, like the name says, ""vector graphics"". That means that, instead of a ""normal"" image that is stored as a list of pixels in order and what color each pixel is, a vector image is made from a series of mathematical ""commands"" - things like ""draw a line from 0,0 to 2,5"" or ""draw a circle centered at 2,5 with radius 3"". The nice thing about vector graphics is that you can zoom them in and they never get blurry - you just redraw the line with more accuracy. It's also easy to change things like ""which country is colored in"" - all you need to do is change the command for ""fill in &lt;region XYZ&gt; with green"" to fill in a different region.

Wikipedia uses a set of base maps that have no color filled in - someone probably drew these with a vector editor like Inkscape. Each page then adds additional data that specifies which country is colored in how.",1664582407

US Nuclear Ballistic Missile Submarines carriy over 950 nuclear warheads. The US has 18 of these in operation. US also has 53 fast attack subs each of which carries nukes. And that is just the subs. There are also 11 aircraft carriers and numerous surface vessels each packing a few. The US is estimated to have aprox. 5,428 total warheads of which aprox. 1,644 are deployed at any particular time.  
  
Any Russian nuclear attack is suicide for Russia, very simple. Even Putin is not going to destroy the entire world over Donbas. Putin has already proven he is megalomaniacal -- not suicidal. If Putin is not careful about making his wild threats too credible, he may force the West into a first strike to close the matter entirely.  
  
This constant Russian threatening and boasting is not helpful. Russians are fools to even play around with the thought, and it makes Russia look weak and desperate. Putin is most likely to: 1- eventually withdraw from Ukraine, 2-blame everybody but himself for the withdrawal, and 3- begin the biggest Russian purge since Stalinist times. Thus emerging richer and more powerful than ever - inside Russia. ""West Korea"" is born!",1664582407

"TheTryGuys","t5_m1ld2","Yes, that would still work. Even in a larger company where there are multiple people with the same job title, it shouldn't be a deciding factor.

Think about it this way: Let's say Kathy and Annie work in the same department; Kathy is a project coordinator and Annie is a data analyst. Kathy starts having an relationship with the boss, and during this time, Annie starts notices that the boss starts treating her differently. Kathy is put on better projects, has a more flexible schedule, is receiving more favorable performance evals, getting promoted faster, etc. Now even if Kathy is a now a manager and Annie is still an analyst, Annie could have a grounds for a suit if she can prove that Kathy was receiving preferential treatment due to her relationship. After all, the relationship might even be part of why Annie and Kathy have different titles.

That's why it's also not really possible to have a consensual workplace relationship when there is a unequal power dynamic. If Annie and her colleagues weren't able to sue for damages when Kathy receives preferential treatment, then their workplace could become a coercive environment that  makes others feel like they have to agree to relationships with superiors in order to get ahead.",1664582408

I'm fairly confident if Danny was playing right now they would not be doing that much better.

When Robbi calls, there is almost no way she can win. She has no draw to a straight or a flush. She has a high card hand with a jack, so obviously she loses to any better high card or better hand.

Nate displays a sense of external-validation seeking very early on, likely as a result of being bullied. The second he gets even a hint of accomplishment and praise, he becomes very grandiose and sadistic. He expects preferential treatment, becomes a bully to others, and believes all his ideas should be treated as gospel.

When he finally thinks his new idea won't work, it shatters his ego in that moment. Nate becomes a cautionary tale.

It becomes clear once he gets power and praise that Nate has narcissistic personality disorder. He is the perfect foil to Ted, who has always sought external validation through being a yes-man. Both desire to be liked, but Nate NEEDS it.",1664582409

Case in point, my Kyosho Turbo Optima re-re. The shock towers are 6061 aluminum, and I haven't run it that much - but the rear takes impacts enough that it's already bent. The other stuff, yeah, I'd say replace those with metal. A bearing kit, if it didn't come with ball bearings, will also go a long way for very little money. I think the FastEddy bearing kit for a DT-03 is like... sixteen bucks? Well worth it.

The other stuff you said you were going to replace with metal, absolutely that's a good investment.

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","Yep. It's the point of no return in the story for me.

It's quickly obvious that she's not that bright while talking to her sister and the Queen, but she doesn't need to be to be a decent commander and great warrior. The nepotism isn't surprising, just a sad fact of life and a political requirement to keep both the Temples and Paladins firmly on her side. As long as she's smart enough to listen to her lieutenant handlers.

Taking her frustrations out on Neia during their diplomatic trip isn't surprising, either. She has been thrust into a position far above her competency, far from the battlefield where she would be useful, trying to do a job she the other Paladins lack any training or experience in. It's annoying that she is dealing with the stress of her situation so badly, and it's becoming obvious that she's not really listening to what little competent guidance she has.

It when she's leading an assault, the one thing she should be vaguely competent at. After they've already started taking casualties and have just started to push the demihumans back, she brings the assault to a dead stop. Why? Because the demihumans are threatening a human child. A child they have already been threatening with death for who knows how long by capturing him and putting him in a camp to maybe eat him later. A child who will be among countless other deaths if they don't free them soon. 

Even after being shown that the hostages hold no value to the demihumans by killing the child and grabbing another, she prevents her team from doing the one thing that has a definite chance of preventing the eventual murder of all the humans in the camp. Why? Because allowing a single human to die by their actions will tarnish what the Queen stands for, as if doing nothing and allowing the demihumans to torture or eat the prisoners honors what she stood for.

That was the point where she proved she had been promoted so far above her competency that she was a dangerous threat to the safety and liberation of her own Kingdom. No one with a lick of sense should listen to her orders if they weren't faced with the immediate threat of lethal violence on her part.",1664582411

"UkraineRussiaReport","t5_613zyp","I wouldn't say months. Months ago would mean they went through summertime. A quick Google search revealed the following:

The time taken for a body to decompose depends on climatic conditions, like temperature and moisture, as well as the accessibility to insects. In summer, a human body in an exposed location can be reduced to bones alone in just nine days.

Remains can retain a fresh appearance for a considerable time in the winter, but the onset of marked decomposition is rapid in the summer months. Bloating of the body usually is present two to seven days following death. Following this, within structures, there is frequently rapid decomposition and skeletonization.",1664582411

Please reply to this comment with an [explanation](https://www.reddit.com/r/LeopardsAteMyFace/comments/lt8zlq) mentioning **who** is suffering from **which** consequences from **what** they voted for, supported or wanted to impose on other people.

Here's an easy format to get you started:

1. *Someone* voted for, supported or wanted to impose *something* on other people.  
  ^(Who's that *someone* and what's that *something*?)
2. That *something* has some *consequences*.  
  ^(What are the *consequences*?)
3. As a consequence, that *something* happened to that *someone*.  
  ^(What happened? Did the *something* really happened to that *someone*? If not, you should probably delete your post.)

Include the minimum amount of information necessary so your post can be understood by everyone, even if they don't live in the US or speak English as their native language. If you don't respect this format and moderators can't match your explanation with the format, your post will be removed under rule #3 and we'll ignore you even if you complain in modmail.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","If you have the urge to text them, give yourself 24 hours before hitting send. If at any point in the 24 hours you think ""I shouldn't text this"" then don't, and reset the clock 24 more hours. I almost broke NC and was given this advice and it honestly saved me from sending an apology text that I would have intensely regretted.

The reward/addiction system in your brain releases oxytocin whenever you make contact or see them. When you break contact, your brain gets thrown off and tries to make you do anything to bring that oxytocin level back up. You have to resist and give yourself time. It's hard but so worth it. They say it takes 3 weeks to break an addiction. I told myself I would be better 3 weeks after a breakup if I maintained NC and I feel so much better now. The pain is still there but it is minor and I am confident in my choice not to go back to my ex.

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

&gt;Ôº∏ What is the difference between „ÅÆ and „Åå ?

&gt;‚óØ I saw a book called Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫„ÅÆÁü•„Çâ„Å™„ÅÑÊó•Êú¨Ë™û , why is „ÅÆ used there instead of „Åå ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

&gt;Ôº∏ What does this mean?

&gt;‚óØ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

&gt;Ôº∏ What's the difference between ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè?

&gt;‚óØ Jisho says ‰∏ÄËá¥ ÂêåÊÑè Ë≥õÊàê Á¥çÂæó ÂêàÊÑè all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does ÂÖ®„ÅèÂêåÊÑü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between „ÅØ and „Åå ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"bluey","t5_2qioa","I think this is a very accurate take on the show. Your last two sentences especially are something we could all remember when dealing with the cognitive dissonance of seeing an american conservative evangelical christian liking something that we also like.

It's especially weird seeing a thread on here with people talking about how conservatives bag on Bandit for being a beta male with his actions towards his wife and kids. I am not sure what point they are making when we are discussing an article from a conservative with problematic LGBT views who seems to view Bandit and his actions towards his wife and kids as good and something to be emulated. All pointing that out seems to say to me is that conservatives are multifaceted but the tone of that thread and most of the comments in this whole thread seems to be more about how conservatives can not like bluey and the ones who do just do not understand bluey... which seems irrational. 

Maybe the dissonance is just stronger for me because when I was looking up this author to see what kind of other beliefs he has and I found his movie reviews.... and he has a lot of taste in common with me: ""The Tree of Life,"" ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Zodiac,"" ""Children of Men,"" and ""Lost in Translation"" all made his top of the last 20 years of film. It was just kind of a humanizing moment that cast a weird dissonant feeling on my reactions to the article.",1664582413

"PCOSloseit","t5_32t01","I have lost over 75 pounds and went from obese to a normal BMI. The only medication I'm on for PCOS is hormonal birth control. But it took 3 freaking years to acheive this weight loss. However, it worked for me because everything I've done is sustainable. It is almost all diet-related for me. I figured whatever ways I changed my eating was going to have to be for the rest of my life, so it had to be something I could stick with forever. So I literally only changed one thing at a time. Very first step was to stop eating cereal because I was eating ungodly amounts of cereal. After I could sustain that change for at least a month, then I worked on giving up bread. And so on and so forth. 

In general, I lost the most weight when I kept total carbs below 90-ish grams, with net carbs being below 70 or so. I also eventually tracked calories as well, and kept calories around 1400 on average to lose weight. Right now I'm eating a bit more as I'm trying to build some muscle and not actively lose weight. But in general, I do not eat bread, crackers, cookies, pasta, rice, oats, really any grains in general.  Of course, I have special occaisions that I will eat that stuff. But I never keep it at home.

If you take away 5% of the sale price from them then you hit their profit margin for development by much more than that and thus they are incentivized to go build property somewhere else.",1664582414

"doordash","t5_39cye","DoorDash will sometimes offer us an add-on order or a straight up stacked order. if the order is stacked then the Dasher cannot choose to separate them on acceptance. If the order is an add-on then DoorDash offers the driver an additional order to pick up, with additional pay, and it‚Äôs supposed to be going in the general direction or near the first offer the driver accepted. declining an add on order does affect our stats so if someone is going for top dasher/ high acceptance rate they will likely accept most add-ons. 

As a driver myself, I have never gotten a stack order or an add-on where either the second pick up or the second drop off was extremely far from the first and thus caused anyone‚Äôs food to be cold or extremely late. If I accept an add-on and the food at the second restaurant is taking too long, I will unassign so that the first person doesn‚Äôt get penalized for the other order not being ready.  Not all Dashers will do that but I believe most would.

As a customer, the app always alerts me if my driver has a second pick up or is dropping off another order before mine. If you don‚Äôt see this notification and your driver is driving far away from you or in the opposite direction, there is a possibility they are multi apping and not doing it well. Anyway I hope this answer helps in some way.",1664582414

To masterwork a crafted weapon you need to take it back to the Enclave and Reshape it, and on the left side, you can pick the masterwork under the Frame section. Your weapon needs to be at least level 7 before you can pick a masterwork though.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","When I turned up to his moms house to speak to him (we were going through a separation at the result of his interfering mother) and he shouted at me for not giving him space. Bear in mind at this point we had actually reconciled and he STILL wanted space from me, he then told me to ‚Äúfind someone else‚Äù and asked me to leave. 

I was leaving he turned around and walked away without saying goodbye. This was 5 weeks ago, he wasn‚Äôt my bf he was my husband. He blocked me straight after 

Im getting to a point now where yes it hurts because I wanted to be with him forever, but accepting that I‚Äôll probably never hear from him again. The ironic thing is he never actually signed the divorce papers just classed the separation as divorce and blocked me, still has our pics on his fb too. 

But I‚Äôm not going to chase I have more self respect than that. I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm not petty to be mad if he DOES reach out. But I‚Äôm also ok if I don‚Äôt hear from him again.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","#Solana Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by samuelshix which won 1st place in the Solana Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Enter the Solanaverse
&gt; In July we saw Solana moon from $24 to $197 in September, bringing it all the way from the backwaters of mid cap territory to the highly coveted Top 10 of cryptocurrencies. Why? On a fundamental basis, Solana shines when it comes to its **technology** and its **ecosystem**, the two most important aspects when evaluating the value of a network. Its website claims to have solved the Trilemma of scale, security, and decentralization, which we'll also dive in here.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Background
&gt; The Ethereum network has become extremely congested due to the explosion of DeFi activity on the blockchain. It's failure to scale to meet this activity has allowed the space to be filled by more scalable layer 1 solutions like Binance Smart Chain. But BSC still leaves a lot to be desired because of its centralization. This is where Solana comes in, a Proof of Stake layer-1 blockchain that has witnessed an explosion in interest because of its extremely fast speeds and low transaction costs, in addition to its relative decentralization. It now has over 350 projects built and counting, with one of the most active developer communities in the space.
&gt; 
&gt; ##  The Trilemma
&gt; Like many other protocols, Solana uses PoS to validate transactions, but what is unique to Solana is it use of Proof of History. In order to reach consensus on the network, validators use time to agree on the legitimacy of a transaction. This allows Solana to have fast and scalable transactions without sacrificing decentralization. There are other novel solutions that Solana introduces such as the first parallel smart contracts run-time (Sealevel), and Turbine, which is inspired by BitTorrent to allow Solana to help quickly ""propagate large amounts of data to a large number of peers."" These and five other innovations, which you can view yourself with a quick google search, allow Solana to have extremely low transaction costs and sub-second transaction times. It reached 50,000 Transactions per second on its testnet, and was able to prove its speed for the year or so that it's been live with 2000-3000 TPS, much faster than most others. This speed scales with internet speeds, so this will be even faster in the future, especially in conjunction with SpaceX's Starlink constellation providing unparalleled internet speeds in the future, which could theoretically lead to a 710k TPS based on a speed of just 1 Gigabyte/Second.
&gt; 
&gt; ### Counterpoints to decentralization and security
&gt; Lets start with decentralization. Many may point out that Solana isn't very decentralized, with 19 validators controlling 33% of the network. This is true. But Solana is still a lot better than competitors with similar speeds, like BSC, and as Solana expands with more validators, it will become more and more decentralized. Someone earlier posted a concern about Solana's centralization, but they mentioned 11 validators controlling 33% of the network, we've improved markedly since then.
&gt; 
&gt; Onto security. That 400k TPS attack we saw which shut down Solana's network for under a day is a huge problem. I agree, but I want to say that number one: problems like these are essential for the growth of the network as it reveals crucial problems to be solved; number two: Solana's hugely active development community will inevitably solve this security flaw and are working on it right now; and three, this is what the cost of fast development looks like. Cardano uses Peer Reviewed papers to inform its development, but that has caused development to be extremely slow. Solana development was much quicker, allowing it's Defi space to have longer to grow and mature.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Community
&gt; As mentioned earlier there are 350 projects built on Solana, one of the fastest growing communities in the space with a large number of active developers.
&gt; 
&gt; There is a growing interest in NFT videogames in the cryptocurrency space, with evidence that this segment will be the ""next big thing"" to happen to crypto, so to speak. There are a multitude of highly ambitious, highly anticipated games being developed on all kinds of networks, but I believe Solana provides the best environment for this. It's cheap, lightening fast transaction times are necessary and critical for a smooth, quick gaming experience.
&gt; 
&gt; The Solana ecosystem is backed by SBF Alameda, a high profile cryptocurrency figure and founder of FTX, one of the fastest growing exchanges in the world. The credibility of the man itself would be enough for many to hop on the SOL train.

And third is from a long time ago, when I read a population estimate from 1661-2, stating that there were around 440,000 people in the Kingdom of Denmark, compared to almost 900,000 in 1656 (ca. 200,000 lost with Scania, the rest died).",1664582415

Its 1 coco coir brick use 3/4 of the water to rehydrate it or its too wet.  8 quarts/liters bark, 4 quarts/liters chunky perlite,  4 quarts/liters horticultural charcoal. If you can find orchid mix that is bark, perlite, charcoal that would probably work, would need more perlite probably, there isn't much in those usually. Then I throw it a generous amount of worm castings while I'm potting.  You don't want to use too much because it can turn to mud.  Maybe a handful per pot, don't know how to measure that,   Fish emulsion makes a good fertilizer if you can stand the smell of fish once a month. you can also check roots and refresh worm castings every 3 months or so, I find it a good idea to know how your roots are doing.",1664582416

"answers","t5_2qkeh","As someone who just got certified for CPR a month ago:

Untrained people should do chest compressions only. It's better than nothing and the concept of mouth to mouth sometimes prevents people from helping. They should also send someone else to find a defibrillator, which will provide idiot-proof instructions on both CPR and using the defibrillator itself. 

Trained people (non-professionals) should do 30 chest compressions and two breaths mouth to mouth. First aid kits these days have a plastic shield with a valve that allows you to perform mouth to mouth without fluid contact.

Professionals have other tools available that can take the place of mouth to mouth, so they just do chest compressions with short gaps for using a valved mask to inflate the lungs.",1664582417

In the context of realistic combat reenactment though I don't think it matters that FMA doesn't historically have armor. Depending on the venue HEMA is often scored are though the opponents aren't wearing armor. The armor prevents injury but the fight is approached from a point fighting perspective which is much different than how actual armored combat would play out. This is what FMA needs. Actual weighted weapons, blunted steel. We should make our best effort to reconstruct what combat would look like with some of these great Filipino blades and follow a HEMA model.

* A link post is any post that isn't a text post. Reddit is doing a great job of ensuring new users have no idea how Reddit works with their app and site rewrite. We hate both.

* /r/guns is a sub for talking about guns. It's not a sub to dump gun photos for karma. That's what /r/gunporn is for. That's why we require a descriptive comment ‚Äì to start a conversation. If you're wondering what to write, picture yourself at a party. You're talking to someone *you just met* and you want to show them your post. What do you say to them as you get your phone out?

Thanks to another r/cigar member posting, I picked this up in Clayton, Mo JR Cigars about a month ago when we were in a temporary apartment waiting to move into our house. we designed and built this house back in 2006 and moved n in Feb 2007.  4yrs later, I took another position in my company.  As these things tend to do, 11 yrs passed quickly before we moved back a couple weeks ago. Now settled enough to take a break from unpacking boxes and enjoy a cigar on our deck. Ok, so I have 3 acres to mow, but it is of slice of heaven here on the Illinois side of the St. Louis meet area.

To the cigar. Fairly form fill on this Cameroon wrapped cigar, but an easy draw.  Sweet hay/cedar with a little spice on light up. Spice dies down quickly.   Interesting flavors more in a brighter range than I normally smoke. As I get closer to 1‚Äù in, I get some umami/earthy flavors.  Lots of cedar.  Slight Milk chocolate. Nice cigar that deserves more attention than I am giving it. Very complex and gaining in flavor as I smoke.  Letting the other two rest.",1664582420

"ARFID","t5_360ca","I drink Fortisips made by Nutricia in addition to whatever food I can manage to eat. They are complete meal replacement drinks meant to support medical treatment in conditions that cause malnutrition and have a high calorie and protein count. They are delicious which is a big plus. That way it takes the pressure off ""having"" to eat, because I know I have a substitute I can fall back on when nothing else is palatable or when ADHD executive dysfunction strikes. I also got an air fryer to make it easier to make my preferred foods at home better than getting takeout chips and nuggets. Takes 10mins and no issue of fresh food going bad cause they are all freezer foods, and I can just have what I need in stock always. Texture is soo much better too.

Having this safety net helps me to want and enjoy eating a bit more, since I'm only eating what I like. And from there I can start adding other foods to my list - air fried frozen vegetables are great since they don't become soggy! Also exploring the freezer section for similar but different foods to try air fried (ie. so similar texture but may be different tasting, or same food different brand). I also get all of my groceries delivered since I have a annual subscription to free delivery nexg day delivery with my supermarket which has helped with my hate of going to the store (ie. decreasing barriers to access). I paid the ADHD tax in advance to reduce my tendency to order takeout when I can't be arsed to go to the store.

I hope that helps, I've struggled a lot with the same issues you did - lots of takeaway costing large amounts of money and often food is pretty subpar, meal prepping is impossible due to executive dysfunction issues since I hated feeling like I ""have"" to be eating the same thing but making multiple dishes is too much work. Moving places always suck because now you have to figure out other ways to make things work! Hopefully you are able to access some of these things. With ADHD involved, try to find ways to reduce the number of steps and identify areas that are stopping you from completing something, if you can find an alternative to reduce overwhelm you will start to feel less burdened by the chore of eating (this made me resent food and eating and my diet got even more restricted). 

Just have easy access to all your safe foods for now and add a supplement/meal replacement drink. This can be your safe foundation you can fall back on during stressful times. You have pain from eating/not eating which is very traumatising and has caused negative associations. Eat what is pleasurable to you right now in larger quantities to get the calories you need to get through this period, then when you have more energy look at widening variety only when you are ready. Don't force it or think you ""have"" to eat different foods, it just starts the shame/trauma cycle again and will make you more avoidant.

We had to ban words or terms like ""No limit"", ""school"", ""young"", ""little"", ""anything"", due to ped0s using those to post about underage/illegal stuff. DO NOT post ""send me anything"" images, DO NOT use a work around for banned words like ""upv0te"" to make a upvote beggar trashpost, you WILL get an instant perma ban. If it's a banned word, it's for a reason. :)

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Considering more data drops are like $100-$300 ea it‚Äôs appropriate at times if you give management an informed answer: higher chance of problems local to switch, and higher chance of those problems propagating to the rest of the network.

STP and other loop prevention mechanisms do a great job handling this scenario. Mix in rate limiting as appropriate and other standard controls like DHCP snooping, arp protection, and IP source lockdown and you‚Äôll be golden. Still a higher risk than baseline but pretty safe.",1664582423

In the end Austria and the ottomans took most of the PLC while I was stuck waiting for AE to go down(with AE reductions) after every war and gave up because they both bordered me and I wasn‚Äôt nearly strong enough to stop them. I don‚Äôt think I quite got to space marine level but I wasn‚Äôt far off and the endless tide of Austrians was too much, I‚Äôd club 200k worth of armies only run out of manpower and allies.

I know the AI has to treat the player as threat #1 to be competitive but when austria already owns a 3rd of Europe and is actively annexing the HRE(they got kicked out or left at one point) there should be a coalition against them.",1664582423

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","- Choose a good clean massage parlor. Plenty of sketchy places but honestly they usually do a shit job and stink. 

- Know what you want before you go in. Me personally? I have a lower back injury and can't stand deep tissue there. A little bit of research goes a long way. 

- Set a budget and stick to it, make sure it includes a tip for your massuse. They'll always try to upsell you, but set yourself a budget ahead of time. 

- Be comfortable. You don't have to get naked, you should have a sheet covering you, and feel free to speak up if they push your comfort zones. 

- Be Relaxed. If you tense your muscles you're gonna basically be undoing any good they do you. 

And honestly this is just my personal preference

- Bring headphones and ask if it's okay if you listen to your music while they work. Personally I just listen to waterfall sounds, but you may like music. Either way, close your eyes and just feel.",1664582424

"CommunismMemes","t5_3jj6y","Even when criticsing capitalism or even praising socialism, you must never ever praise past or present socialist projects as net positive because it gives people actual examples of what can be realistically achievable. Instead you must keep the conversation of what's acceptable to some vague idealistic theoretical socialism achievable in the future. This is why the downfalls of socialist nations must always be highlighted and exaggerated and the positives distorted or brushed away. The only positive things allowed to be said is hypothetical, theoretical, anarchism, social democracy (and refer to it as socialism), market socialism, ""pure"" anti-Leninist Marxism, Trotskyism (which hadn't achieved anything meaningful), etc.. Claiming past and present socialist nations as ""not true socialism"" is a key tactic. Always provide hypothetical solutions to real problems.",1664582424

"cars","t5_2qhl2","I find this interesting.In the r129 with the soft top up you can hear a little more of the exhaust , and very little interior wind noise if you roll down the windows. This is a dead simple top as far as the materials are concerned and the windows are plastic. However it is a fully powered top, no manual latching/unlatching unless something goes horribly wrong(use the top at least once a month to avoid this during the winter). The standard hardtop doesn't allow for much noise to pass through , and handling wise the car has three completely different characters when it comes to acceleration depending on which form it's in.  In traditional roadster form (windows down), I've noticed that the car will accelerate significantly faster than if the soft top is up, bear in mind that scuttle shake does not exist for this chassis, handling in tight corners does suffer for it though. Now with the soft top up it's slightly more grippy in corners but about slightly slower to accelerate (barely noticeable). Both roadster and soft top up forms suffer from about 2mpg loss @ 60mph , reports back at 28 mpg in the slopes. The standard hardtop gives increased rear visibility in comparison to the soft top. City drives suffer significantly with the 90lb weight penalty it's lugging around, stay out of the city. The standard hardtop mode is most at home on a back country road @80mph it will report 29-30+ mpg , cornering is also improved with the top effectively acting as a removable wing(?, Not an aerodynamisit but it's something you notice). The only issue with the hardtops is having ample help to remove them for the summer/spring months. The panoramic roof is about even with the standard top + one passenger. However it offers the best closed rearward visibility this side of the SEC/CL class . Mpg suffers significantly more than with the standard hardtop equipped , reports about 23-26mpg in the slopes @60mph . Its just barely better than what you'd expect from the SL600 in town with the soft top equipped.  All in all I love the fact that the R129 , NA Miata , and Z4 all have the option of going ""full coupe"" or roadster.",1664582424

*****
&gt; SEOUL, Oct 1 - North Korea fired unspecified ballistic missiles toward the east coast on Saturday, South Korea&amp;#039;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said, marking Pyongyang&amp;#039;s fourth launch in a week as it ratchets up tension in the Korean peninsula.

&gt; The launch comes after the navies of South Korea, the United States and Japan staged trilateral anti-submarine exercises on Friday for the first time in five years, and follows U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris&amp;#039; visit to South Korea this week.

&gt; North Korea fired missiles before and after Harris&amp;#039; visit to South Korea, extending a record pace in weapons testing this year as it increases the threat of a credible nuclear power that can strike the United States and its allies.

Below is an argument written by jeff406 which won 2nd place in the Solana Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; As of May 2021, Solana's insider ownership is at 48% [\[source\]](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1394283802009145348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1394283802009145348%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.coincu.com%2F47293-as-the-solana-ecosystem-grows-the-co-founders-address-financial-criticisms%2F). Among the crypto community, [critics allege](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=Solana%20pump%20and%20dump&amp;src=typed_query) that Solana is a pump and dump scheme being orchestrated by wealthy venture capitalists. While we cannot confirm or deny these allegations with 100% certainty, the amount of insider ownership is surely worrying. By investing in SOL, you are exposing yourself to the risk that these insiders could dump their coins on you.
&gt; 
&gt; Solana also doesn't have a great track record; In September 2021, the network had a [17-hour outage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/solana-network-of-top-10-sol-token-applies-fixes-after-outage). According to Gavin Wood, co-founder of Ethereum, ""Solana‚Äôs 'exclusive and closed set of servers' may be fast, but its value is no match for well-secured decentralized networks."" [\[source\]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-16/solana-network-of-top-10-sol-token-applies-fixes-after-outage)
&gt; 
&gt; Additionally, in November 2021 [it was discovered](https://twitter.com/CryptoWhale/status/1457031472938893322) that Solana lied about their supply when an audit revealed an additional 12M coins.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite Solana's cheap fees and high transaction throughput, there are many events which bring the developers' credibility into question. For this reason, I intend to stay away from Solana.

She would take every joke the wrong way. And when we were together, she would just argue about us not being together enough. And I also stopped being fun or interesting. I gave short answers, took longer to reply, etc. Eventually we realized that we complained more than we laughed. The breakup was not mutual at the start but after a few months we talked and realized neither of us were happy. We were just together because we figured it was better than being single. I learned a lot about what I put into the relationship and what I hoped to receive back. Now I'm happily married to the love of my life and if I had stayed in that old relationship I know I wouldn't be happy now.

So yeah it's been a while-ish, and the reason for that is that I've been mega busy making a buttload of stuff for my **first ever NSFW Patreon!** You can read more details on my [**alt-18+ twitter account**](https://twitter.com/ZixzsRedlight), but the gist is that it will soon^tm exist and will involve copious amounts of unrealistic proportions and other fun things. You'll also get introduced to two OCs I made *literally* just for drawing spicy things, Len and Jenny. Ralsei and Susie NSFW will probably be my main content for a while, though. Through the Patreon, you can also access polls and votes to influence what I draw next, and Gold-tier members can even submit personal suggestions for me to pick from each week! 

The NSFW Patreon should be releasing on my birthday, October 2nd, probably during the early afternoon. I'll be opening a purely donation-oriented SFW Patreon on the same day; SFW content will not be getting stunted or otherwise more exclusive in any shape or form for the foreseeable future. While it might be more sparse with me drawing smut in place of it, Susei SFW work should and will still continue after both Patreons are up and running. 

In lighter news, I do have a few SFW drawing ideas in mind, but since I'm preoccupied it might be a bit until we get around to them. Stay safe, and have a good day!",1664582427

"LOTR_on_Prime","t5_wnoj8","&gt;Also none of them point strictly and uniquely to Sauron. they could apply to someone else, taken individually.

Why would you take them individually? 





&gt;what's happening in Eregion if Halbrand is Sauron?

Exactly what we've been told is happening. It seems many people have jumped to the conclusion that the events in Eregion are part of Sauron's manipulation, but the show hasn't actually said this. There's no evidence that a third party is manipulating events there. 

I think the showrunners might just be changing Mithril/the elves fading to add drama and stakes to the forging of the rings. We know that the elven rings of power preserved the old magic of Middle earth in the books, and that Galadriel's ring had Mithril. So the showrunners might have decided to give Mithril more importance to the function of the elven rings, and to speed up the timetable for the elves fading (hence the Spring deadline; although to be clear, the show doesn't exactly say the elves will all fade 100% before Spring, just that they need to act before then) to increase the stakes for the ring creation plot line. Instead of having the rings being Celebrimbor's side project and relying 100% on the dramatic irony of us knowing Sauron is deceiving him to create stakes, we have the added drama of a need for the rings to be forged, and a deadline by which they need to be completed. 

I can turn this question back on you as well: why would Sauron stand by and allow a traitor Adar to seize and maintain power in the Southlands? Furthermore, in the books, Sauron establishes himself in Mordor BEFORE donning the Annatar disguise and meeting Celebrimbor. Don't you think establishing a presence and base of operations in Mordor, as well as acquiring Mount Doom to forge the One ring, would be his priorities? He would kind of need the key to open Mount Doom to initiate the next steps of his plan, don't you think? Going to Eregion first doesn't make sense now that we know he isn't working with Adar.

&gt;why was Halbrand on that ship?

? Why does the fact that Halbrand was traveling to an undisclosed location make him less likely to be Sauron in any way? We don't know why Halbrand was on that ship regardless of whether he is Sauron or not. They deliberately didn't tell us. I don't see how this can be used as evidence for or against H=S theories. 



&gt;why is he so hesitant to go back to Middle Earth?

I think they are going with  the ""repentant"" Sauron that Tolkien alluded to in his letters. We see in the show that Sauron began trying to heal Middle earth and restore its order, just like in the letters. But unlike in the letters and Silmarillion, he ran into a dead end in his research, and was ""killed"" by Adar. I think Halbrand was honestly trying to turn over a new leaf in Numenor after his failures. And just as Gil Galad predicted, Galadriel will be the one that motivates him to seek power again. 

&gt;why did he keep the pouch that make him the true king, if he is leaving Middle Earth and does not want to return?

First of all, couldn't you ask this question regardless of if he's Sauron or not? 

Also, he says himself that he took the pouch from a dead man because he ""thought the pattern suited him"". He may not have known what the symbol meant (doubtful), and be going along with what Galadriel believes because it gives him a new opportunity to regain his power. Or, he may have believed the pattern suited him because deep down, he still thinks he has the divine right to rule over Middle-earth. The pouch and symbol, rather than being a call to accept his true birthright, could instead represent temptation for him to go back to his warlording ways. 


&gt;To me they all point to Halbrand being a true human, and absolutely not Sauron.

I am not convinced at all by your objections tbh. Most of them are things that can easily be explained.

Let me ask you this: why do you think Halbrand is still lying to Galadriel about his identity? He confirmed in episode 3 that ""Halbrand"" isn't his real name. If he is being truthful about his origin story, why the deception?",1664582428

"nba","t5_2qo4s","That made sense given the initial reports about the incident. But the consensus seems to be building that Woj was misled on that piece of information. I don't think we can have much confidence that the relationship was consensual at any point. 

It appears that team leadership THOUGHT it was consensual, which is not the same thing. 

Ime saying some inappropriate things in the context of a completely consensual relationship just wouldn't, in my opinion, bring down the cone of silence like this.  ""Hey, you and her can do what you want in private ,but you can't say shit like that around the office"" is not the sort of thing that creates year suspension/firing. Somebody says something inappropriate in the context of a consensual relationship and you have HR meetings and sensitivity training and shit like that, not ... ""You're not going to coach this team again."" 

The piece of the puzzle that this implies to me (rampant speculation alert!) is that he bullied her in some way, they began a relationship which appeared consensual, and then she complained about something that caused the investigation, and, whoops, maybe not so consensual after all.",1664582428
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It‚Äôs a tough sort of thing to say. 

You know how when people want to say ‚Äúhistory repeats itself‚Äù they‚Äôll shop around history for events that reinforce their belief, but will ignore events that contradict it? 

Maybe it‚Äôs not *impossible* to say that some behaviour is fundamentally human, but I think that 99% of the time the statement that ‚ÄúX is fundamentally human‚Äù has the same problems as saying ‚Äúhistory repeats itself‚Äù. We shop around for examples that confirm our existing opinions about what we‚Äôve decided are fundamental human attributes and ignore or explain away problems and contradictions.

If I had to suggest something, maybe I‚Äôd say that experiencing crises of meaning is fundamentally human. I‚Äôm not sure if animals have those. But then again not every human has those, either.

I think that at present we‚Äôre the only species who cooks food. But we know that other hominid species used fire to cook food as well, and not just our direct ancestors either (Neanderthals, *homo floresiensis*, etc. seem to have cooked their food), so that‚Äôs not a fundamental attribute of our species either.",1664582428

"FireEmblemHeroes","t5_3imv0","I was hit by him in early release and caught offguard once by how much his special hit. Issue was: I lived. Not by a lot, some follow-up unit killed me instead. Or maybe the follow-up didn't even kill me, I forgot. But I lived the Otr encounter. Which is not something I can say often for offensive units like, say, B!Eirika. Or the new B!Seliph. The fact I could live Otr at all means that even on release, he wasn't particularly the worst unit to just try to tank on player phase. And most of the time, I can easily shut him down with Elimine too, if there isn't some other special I want to stop. If there's two dangerous start-of-phase activators, most of the time Otr isn't even the worst one to stop.

His enemy phase is also non-existent. Whereas its hard to engage on, say, a front line 3mov cav with range=2, or a frontline 4mov cav with range=1 (looking at you Sigurd), its extremely easy to engage on a 3mov range=1 cav on the frontline. If he's on the backline... what is he even doing?

And for note, I'm someone who just limbos in and out of VoH (not a 31+ stay-er), and I find Otr to be extremely manageable. And I suck at AR. Given that I find Otr to be almost not-a-menace, he's got to have been the worst aging defense mythic.

As for his fodder.... eh. G Duel Cav is at least in a ""permanent"" legendary pool? Unlike some seasonal locked Duel 4s. But G Duel Cav doesn't really impact performance much other than fluffing stats +2 for the sake of Arena.

Atk/Def Menace? Really, I'd rather pull a Lif or Hrid for that fodder instead. Then it comes with a new sword/DC.",1664582429

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Sadly, I can't, I am pre-op, and also I am still figuring it out myself.

I can tell you that orgasms are more of a whole body experience rather than focused on your genitals (which is really cool and nice), and sexual attraction feels more like a ""hungry"" feeling down there than whatever it was before, and this hungry feeling is located more inwards and closer to the stomach than before.

It's also easier to lose interest some way through though, as a downside.

Overall, an improvement IMO. Closer to what it ""should"" be. And to have experiences closer to a cis woman's, to have more in common with other women, is always a plus.",1664582429

"CasualPH","t5_3jpbq","Nag-viral dati itong photo na ‚Äôto sa Twitter. May mga nabasa akong theories about different zodiac signs.

‚Ä¢ Walang Taureans (Taurus) sapagka‚Äôt tamad sila.

‚Ä¢ Obviously may mga Geminian (Gemini) dahil two-faced sila.

‚Ä¢ Walang Cancerians (Cancer) dahil sila raw ‚Äôyung mga taong nai-in love kay Ted Bundy. üò≠ (As a Cancerian myself, I feel attacked. Pero may pagka-legit din. üòÖ) But to be honest, may similarity ang traits ng Cancerians and Scorpions (Scorpio) since pareho silang water signs. At kapag sinearch mo rin ang negative traits ng Cancerians, madalas ‚Äúmanipulative, calculating, cunning, and spiteful‚Äù ang lumalabas, which are something I agree with. We love to play mind games, you see. üòè

‚Ä¢ Walang Leoneans (Leo) dahil mahahangin nga sila. Bakit sila papatay ng mga tao as their audience, kung gusto nga nilang ina-idolise sila?

May nabasa rin akong isa pa, nguni‚Äôt hindi na related sa serial killers. Kapag daw ang Cancerian, lalaki, mama‚Äôs boy raw. May pagka-motherly instinct at malapit sa mga babae (in a decent/good way) sapagka‚Äôt Cancer is the mother of all zodiacs. Kapag naman ang babae, Capricornian, daddy‚Äôs girl, since Capricorn is the father of all zodiacs.

Honestly, naniniwala ako minsan sa compatibility. Isa sa mga zodiac signs na compatible sa Cancer ay Taurus. Majority ng mga nagiging crush ko, Taureans. Kapag nalalaman ko ‚Äôyung birthday nila, napabubulong na lang ako sa sarili ko ng, ‚ÄúI knew it.‚Äù üòÇ",1664582430

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt; Capitalists inherently have more power in the labor market.

Not really. If I'm a Walmart greeter my power in the labor market is essentially none because my labor is nearly worthless. The company could replace me with nearly anyone off the street or even eliminate my position entirely and be mostly unaffected. If I'm a senior programmer at a small company my power in the labor market is high. I could leave and go find a high paying job at another company easily. But for the company things might not be so simple. I might be the only one who can maintain  the codebase properly. They might be willing to pay me well over market rate so they don't have to find and train someone. I'm not very replaceable and thus I'm incredibly valuable.

&gt; Capitalists use political power to control labor compensation.

They use political power to control the minimum wage. They have no control over the actual market price of labor in a free market.

&gt; monopolistic power employers have.

Most employers in the modern day United States don't have any monopolistic power.

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","I think there are many answers to this so I apologize for the lengthy response, but I think we need to look at each individual major public AI, given the fact that each AI art software works differently.

 If I give an extensive facial description to any of the AI systems, most likely I won't get what I want if I, say, want to describe myself. But if I ask for a mid eastern hero with a beard and red eyes with a roman weapon in a battefield, the AI will output that and, as you put it yourself, I will be self assured that it works. Like a confirmation bias. Many of the times this requires a lot of outputs and the best ones online are cherrypicked. It is not a magic box.

I have used Dall-e2, midjourney and stable diffusion. Midjourney is the one with a more specific cookie cutter style but people love it. It requires less technical descriptions and it requires a more ""poetic"" kind of wording. If you write onto it ""the most lonely woman in the world"", midjourney will give you a pretty picture of a lone lady in a very artistic and probably nostalgic scenario. The AI interprets certain words with certain moods, therefore it is considered the most ""creative one"", but because of this it lacks the most direct control of. Still because of these factors, it's easy to write randomly and get very pretty things. This is the one that won that AI art competition. If you enter royalroad.com/home, you will find a lot of covers made with it. This is the one I call digital kitsch the most.

 Dall-e 2 is my favorite for my self amusement. People think it sucks for digital art but I find that ironic because it does not, the outputs are rather more painterly and brushlike messy style. I think this happens because the untrained eye thinks that the more photorealistic a picture looks, the better it is. Dall-e is very specific in wording. If you put the same ""the most lonely woman in the world"", you will get a photo of a woman standing in a random place, or literally a woman standing on top of planet earth. Which is fun for sure. But if you specify the settings yourself it will give you the most accurate results. If anyone wants to prove himself as what they call ""prompt engineer/artist"" I definately suggest Dall-e 2 for that. It is also the one that makes less uncanny humans without touching up.

Now Stable diffusion is the can of worms. This is the one with the heaviest amount of training in a plethora of styles. The one with the heaviest ethical discussions. Stable diffusion can do photorealistic painting much better than Dall-e because it was trained on a ton of artstation artists. Such as Greg Rutkowski, which now the community hates because he disapproved of the use of living artists for the training of these tools. SD is popular because being open source it also lacks censorship and allows the use of any person's image, and porn.

 (Funny how people hate dall-e because it censors both of these, saying it undervalues art to be censored. But when we talk ethics on stable diffusion and the values of art everyone gets angry. )

Anyhow, being open source it can be used to build upon. That is how Img2img comes to life, allowing people to draw in paint and put it in there and receive a photorealistic painting in return. You can also train it in any style, even yours. A build called dreambooth just came out which allows you to put, say, 6 photos of you to train it, and you can now input ""my face in a still of the avengers as the hulk"", and the AI will accurately depict you as that, or in the simpsons style or as a pencil sketch. 

Now, this is why my reply has been so lengthy. Midjourney and dall-e and vanilla stable diffusion won't give you exactly what you want, but close enough for the average consumer to have a confirmation bias that it does paint what you want. And in many cases good enough is just the adequate for their needs. They cannot envision a hero properly like an artist, so if the AI gives them what they sorta imagined, they do make the assimilation that the AI drew literally what was on their mind as you pointed out.

Now, trained stable diffusion with different models does allow for a more precise style of workflow with these tools. If I want it to paint me as a cartoon hero, it can accurately do it because I can train it that way. That is the problem with this meme discussion - the process gets more advanced so quickly because AI developers want to cash in. So if I told you a few weeks ""no, it cannot visualize exactly what I want"", the stable diffusion new models would have proven me outdated in a matter of days. This is not because the AI is capable of comprehension though but rather more algorithmical trainings. There are already video and animation models that look so clunky but they can imitate a person running because the developer makes it able to decompose the information so much that the AI learns to rebuild it. It is not creating out of creativity, it evolves because new ways to feed it information to deconstruct and reconstruct and mix said reconstructions are constantly coming out.


That said, these advancements are still clunky no matter how hyped. Having used them, I don't see a major loss of careers coming soon. I think artists need to at least understand them. A lot of tech folks are selling comissions of art without making the disclaimer that it is AI made on instagram and fiverr and art contests which I think is rather disgusting. And some are vocal about it but don't care, like one youtube guy that teaches people how to do $5000 with midjourney art. (Clickbaity but surely he does have a client portfolio)

 If an artist is on the edge of knowledge, then at the very least you know how to compete with those kinds of people - and if you do choose to use AI in your workflow, as an artist you can stomp non-trained users.  (Which should not be the point, I am all in for people doing art for art sake. This last point is just in regards of fears of job losses and the actual current problems in that regard.)

That brilliant idea has 310 million people using it everyday. You can buy whatever the fuck you want from your couch and it will arrive in one day,how is that not a contribution? Jeff founded amazon, some years  later became one of the world larget companies valued atm at 1.15T. He currently owns little less than 10%. That 10%  is worth around 140B. How would you cap that? 

 A persons net worth is not what people think it is. He doesnt have billions in cash that he can use whenver he want, no one on earth does. Its just how much his stocks are worth and they flactuate signifcantly. Tommorow, if amazon goes under so will his networth. 

And seriously elon musk didnt contribute to humanity? Electric cars are now a reality and  replacing ICE cars solely thanks to tesla, Space x revolutinized space travel and significantly lowered its costs  (Some of their is straight up science fiction) his first success was paypal.

The recent video of that Russian tank kicking the snot out of a couple Ukrainian ones is a function of the Russians having a thermal sight (so they can see through the foliage) and the un-upgraded Ukrainian one being blind.

The T-80 and T-90 and T-14 are all real impressive. But despite ordering a thousand for last year they've made just enough to parade over the past decade. There are maybe 4000 T-80s and another 400 T-90s. In short, they have updated equipment. But they don't have *enough* of them to really outfit units with them. You could fit three divisions with T-90s, but then you'd be out of them and with the ability to replace maybe a dozen a year. It's not great. If Russia was fighting a smaller opponent than Ukraine (like Georgia) then they'd be able to send motivated, modern force to kick the snot out of them. But along a front as long as Ukraine's?

"chess","t5_2qhr7","So, Regan really did not catch anyone **in the wild** and so it makes sense he does not flag Niemann as suspicious.  
""If he runs his analysis on these 4 games Marzolo confessed to cheating, the z-score is above the threshold"" &lt;- This implies the information is known and so biases the analysis (post-hoc reasoning, i.e., reasoning after the facts are known).   
""His z-score is below the FIDE threshold, but he can adjust the threshold after the material evidence already confirms who is cheating."" &lt;- Again, this is reasoning after the facts are known. If we are condemning other methods for being biased, then so should we condemn this.  
If we start looking for something after we know it's there and where it is, we will also run into a self-confirmation bias and stop looking the minute we find it. This is important, because Regan makes researcher decisions (researcher degrees of freedom) related to his thresholds/bins for what to consider suspicious etc.  
  
I believe it is not useful to look at these ""first engine lines"" of some great engine and just match them to moves played. This is too simplistic. A player's playstyle should be considered fully (e.g., mapped out as a network of moves and responses to all sorts of positions and constraints) and any deviations from that pattern should be flagged. Then, the interesting question becomes how to tell if someone is e.g. drunk :-), which can be accomplished by checking whether a rating improvement was attained. Of course, this is easier said than done! Maybe this is what they are doing at chess.com?",1664582434

No. I'm not tolerant. I'm a very intolerant person. I'm tolerant of many things like differences appearance, culture, language, religion, country of origin, gender, and many many other things. My intolerance kicks in for those who are intolerant of any of the above mentioned things. I'm intolerant of bigots of all varieties. Very intolerant of them.
 
I, nor anybody else currently existing has infinite tolerance. It's impossible. I will not tolerate people who wish me, or my family/loved ones/people of any background ill-will.
 
So if you're a bigot, like u/tidho here, i'm just as intolerant, devisivie, and potentially destructive as your oath keepers, neo-nazis, q people, etc. Probably more so as I'm not a self-inflicted blind moron who finds pride in merely existing.

I want legislation for the following 4 things:

1) All algorithmic content curation must be open source so why we are being shown what we are being shown is entirely transparent. Yes this would fuck much of Google's business model, no I dont care because they are currently playing evil media overlord on a scale even Murdoch couldn't imagine in his wettest of dreams.

2) Content moderation systems must be sufficiently transparent to be externally scrutinized and peer reviewed in the same way that the safety of other engineered systems of public concern are, like the manufacture of medicines or the safety of aircraft. Not just for safety of minors but to prevent the denial of free speech, inhumane conditions for moderation workers, ect.

3) It should be a fineable offence for any media providers, social or otherwise, to allow content which is ""potentially harmful"" for minors (see next point) to appear without some form of content warning. I'm not even saying age restrict it, let alone take it down. JUST ensuring young people are warned that what they are about to look at might not be good for them, and stopping it showing up alongside cat videos (yes I'm from the 90s) without warning like it's totally normal, would prevent appalling ongoing harm.

4) The existsnce of some kind of abuse by power resistant system to decide what should be warnable content. I'm an engineer, not a law or political specialist, but whether it's a robustly selected citizens assembly resistant to bias or corruption, a well engineered and transparent crowd sourced system, or some kind of complicated UN style committee were there is prevention of extreme action by arguing

"matureplants","t5_w1zix","Explaining something that is my perspective or opinion isn't jumping all over someone. Not once did I insult you. You wrote nearly as much as me. We are talking about plants, so let's stick to them, please. Being passionate about plant discussion should not be a surprise to you here.

And I also used to work at a garden center and dealt with all kinds of wacky encounters. Go us! When someone comes in and asks for a Split Leaf Philodendron, they are using the correct common name for Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum. If you think the general public - let alone houseplant enthusiasts - are going to remember that name, then I am genuinely jealous of your expectations of most people to remember that name. Although you must be constantly disappointed. I've literally never used that name and I have one that's a decade or two old and sold dozens of them. I've never heard a single person ever refer to Split Leaf Philodendrons with their scientific name.

Please don't confuse my passion for jumping all over you. It's ok for us to have different perspectives and beliefs, and I hope that fact isn't upsetting to you.

And please never use the name Pothos to refer to any houseplant again if you want to be consistent. Those aren't Pothos.",1664582435

DO NOT post ""send me anything"" images, DO NOT use a work around for banned words like ""upv0te"" to make a upvote beggar trashpost, you WILL get an instant perma ban.

"newhampshire","t5_2rmnf","What? Where are you even getting this? There has been many ""fringe"" cases since the abortion crap has happened. Doctor's have come and outright said that they're delaying women's medical care if they're pregnant because of the abortion laws. So if the women die, exactly who is responsible for their deaths then?


 By the way, Joe Biden tried to sign an *executive order* to allow women to get abortions to save their life. You're saying that Congress would allow it? Because there's already proof that they wouldn't. [Texas for one.](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-sues-biden-administration-over-abortion-guidance-2022-07-14/)
 

Of course, there is another way to stop abortions. In fact, Democrats have been pointing it out for a while. It's got science behind it! Amazing, I know. Funny how the actual way to stop abortions isn't practiced by he same states that have abortion restrictions. It's almost as if it isn't about life at conception at all.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","actually the reason the restaurant overcharges, to stay with the metaphor lol, is that the restaurant is required to feed anyone that comes in regardless of if they can afford it or not. people need food, this is not bad in and of itself.

in other countries the restaurants are either owned and operated or at least entirely funded by the govt so no one actually pays the restaurant out of pocket and the govt tries to have as few resatuarants open as needed to feed everyone

in america the restaurant gets paid partially from people directly and partially from the companies those people hire to pay for food when they need it and for some people just directly but when someone without a food payment company or enough money to just buy food comes in they still get food but the restaurant has to recoup that by charging everyone else way more

we could follow other countries restaurant model and vastly reduce how much our restaurants charge for things while also feeding everyone but this is called scary words and somehow wont work for us even though it does everywhere else for reasons.",1664582436

Now onto your question.

This is the hardest thing I had to come to terms with but every single form of suffering can make you better if you allow it to. No suffering is pointless, as long as you breath it‚Äôs never HAS to be pointless, but it can be if a person chooses it to be. 

Maybe an example will help:

A person gets on a skateboard, and breaks their leg. 

Now they have a choice after their leg is broken,  let it heal and never touch a skate board again, or when it‚Äôs healed just enough get back on and try again.

There is poison in the former choice to me. If that person where to never go on a skateboard again people would say ‚ÄúBut of course! Being on that skateboard brought you not only pain but financial hardship!‚Äù 

People would agree totally with your decision to give up. The poison being their approval of the descision to give up.

Or you could defy all logic and odds and get back on that stupid skateboard in this meaningless universe and do a useless trick and try to perfect that kickflip. 

Tangent: even within victory or triumph there is a meaninglessness. When you perfect one skate boarding trick, there is always another to learn and conquer and within that there is also an inherent danger of being in pain and financial hardship. Yet people do it.

And her min raise on the turn, thats was hilarious but it clearly was a bluff, and take into account the fact min raises SCREAM strength.

I've got better luck cold calling companies and not bothering with HR or just managing to talk my way to someone high enough up the food chain.

I'm free to speak the truth because my point of view isn't a jealous derivative of Nazism like yours is.

Zionists are identical to the European far right in this respect.

"MrJoeNobody","t5_r59ex","To name a few reasons;

1. Loads of people didn't even know what was going on there, they didn't know any rescuing *needed* to be done.
2. Rationalising, downplaying, or flat out denying trauma are extremely common trauma responses. &gt;!It can be seen again in this chapter with the responses from former students.!&lt; Rescue would involve acknowledging or facing the reality of the abuse, which lots of victims unfortunately don't have the capacity to do.
3. Getting enough people together to actually pull off a rescue seems difficult. That'd involve finding enough people/equipment to do so, then successfully managing it. But then what? Many of the students will have been so traumatised by that point, they'd likely see the rescue as some kind of test Elan put them up to, and fear showing any kind of attempt to leave will make their lives even worse. Then what happens if they get all the kids out? Without the evidence to show what's going on, they'd likely all be returned to Elan, or put in other abusive programs. Rescue attempts without context of what's going on at Elan would likely look like a mass-kidnapping instead. Who would the authorities believe? A bunch of randos trying to suddenly shove loads of students into vans with claims of saving them from incredibly obscure abuse- or the bunch of adults who work at Elan, who could get every student to convincingly back them up on command?
4. Crime connections. I'm pretty sure there were authority figures who knew what was going on, but turned a blind eye due to the figures Elan was connected to. When I read the part about&gt;! journo's in particular in this chapter, I wondered hard if they remained silent for fear of essentially being disappeared.!&lt;",1664582438

"Animedubs","t5_2ur9o","For those that missed the announcement: Disney acquired the streaming rights to the entire franchise from Viz Media (which owns *all* of Bleach's rights outside of Japan - broadcast, streaming, home video, and merchandising) recently. This means Bleach will only be available to stream legally from Disney-owned sources such as Disney+ and apparently Hulu (as the origjnal series had been marked as ""expiring"" for the last couple weeks until a couple days ago). Likely what happened is that FuniRoll couldn't even be in the running on this one because they already blew their annual operating budget by snagging Chainsaw Man as well as buying up Right Stuf Anime.

Thankfully, because Disney only has the *streaming* rights, this in turn means they're not responsible for casting, dubbing, and home video releases. There is however the question about how frequently Disney will be releasing episodes as previously they've decided to wait for a series to be completely finished before launching it.",1664582440

"DotA2","t5_2s580","RTZ likes to play a very greedy pos 1, where he tends to try and leave lane and go jungle early, and let his mid and offlane open up the map. He tries to time his farming pattern so on the majority of carries he can take an ancient camp or stack, and then transition this into either a t1 mid or bottom, and then he opens his pattern into the enemy side of the map, depending on draft and overall farming safety. Once he‚Äôs farmed his second item, he hits his power tempo, and starts farming efficiently while helping the team.
It‚Äôs an extremely methodical play style, which relies heavily on map control and space creation via teamwork. 

What I mean by changing it is playing more aggressively, and with his teammates earlier/quickening his power spike. The majority of carries are hitting a power spike in their play style, when they get their first big item, while he‚Äôs hitting one on his second big item. This makes his play, and his teams play, look slow, or look like their getting stomped, in games that they didn‚Äôt crush their lanes. I don‚Äôt want to say he doesn‚Äôt know how to play from behind, but it‚Äôs more like his decision making revolves around having his hero at a baseline power of 2 items during team fights. Again, it‚Äôs not a bad play style, it‚Äôs just very easily readable by the top talents, and easily exploitable in both draft and itemization/play.

This completely contrasts how he played mid in his early days, in which he had a much better understanding of his heroes powerspikes with different items and levels, take his timbersaw on speedgaming for example, or even any of his qop or sf performances. Once moving to carry, he excelled on heroes like mirana, and PA, which had very early and easily acquired powerspikes.

Edit: this also is a drafting issue. Which is why in an edit above I brought up Bulba. EG relies heavily on RTZ getting farmed, when the only games they really win are when they take him out of his comfort zone and put him on an early stomping hero, bar the TB games where he gets out of control because RTZ TB

Edit2: though I guess now that I‚Äôm thinking about it, it really doesn‚Äôt matter if he quickens his pace, unless nightfall does the same. There have been a lot of early-mid game transitions where it looks like nightfall is feeling a bit awkward, so I cant, and won‚Äôt, say EGs entire issue is RTZ. My entire point to begin with was that RTZ plays a play style that originated in a past patch, and hasn‚Äôt really innovated it well for recent and current patches. His pub record aside, he‚Äôs always been a great carry, I just doubt he has the fire in him anymore after seeing what I believe is a hugely lacking performance since TI9.

Edit3: I said originated in edit 2, but I meant he created it in a past patch. There‚Äôs a reason he was known as A-God

Edit4: if you think I‚Äôm wrong respond with why. Downvotes mean nothing. I‚Äôd rather learn from another perspective.",1664582441

C) military vets should get a pay raise AND if they hit hard times should also get better welfare

The vast majority of the public and military would vote for C.

Now you could argue well why don't the Dems do that plan then?

That is a fair criticism of the Dems

But like I said of Crenshaw and MTG actually did care about it then they would write a skinny bill OR an amendment ADDING the increases wages

Personally I doubt your insinuation that the Republicans are the ones that care 

Because if they did care the could have passed a military pay increase in 2016 when they had the House and Presidency because there is no way none of the Dems would have crossed over on such a vote in the Senate

The stock might sell off another 50% or another 75% that's the kind of market it is but this company has a very solid business that is almost impossible to take away. 

They host walmart.com and the Walmart app, and work with a good number of fortune 500 companies. I'd say the stock is undervalued, but it's a tough market. Only invest what you can afford to lose, and this is a buy and hold, don't swing trade the stock.",1664582442

To learn is simply to comprehend a piece of information, this is your only job. I wholeheartedly believe that anyone can learn anything, there are just about infinite ways to learn, just as there are ways to convey information. Perhaps the information isn't being communicated well or in the way that unlocks the door to comprehension for you, or you need to use different methods to understanding the information. I personally love the use of analogy, it has helped me significantly, and I also employ analogy when teaching others. With analogy I am able to communicate (and comprehend if I am the listener) even subjective experiences that the listener has absolutely no experience with, in a way I can really bring them into my shoes with me and help them to develop sufficient understanding to initiate empathy.    
Anyway, I advise you experiment with all the ways the information can be interpreted, and see if you can bounce that information off any knowledge you already have. What can you liken this concept to? What does this remind you of? Etc. Conceptual thought is also a golden key to understanding.",1664582442

Coreopsis is lovely and will keep reblooming but you should take time to trim them if you want them to rebloom best. Otherwise low maintenance, but they also can flop over sometimes and look messy, especially after heavy rains. 

Black eyed susans are definitely low maintenance, will bloom for a long time, don't flop over, and I have never seen them suffer any diseases in my garden. I barely touch mine all season except to trim back in fall and occasional Neem oil spray for good luck. I would recommend these if you want truly long blooming low maintenance perennials. 

Bee balm is great and will spread but I fight powdery mildew with them every year. Even with diligent Neem oil/fungicide spraying.",1664582444

One, is that abstaining should be counted against the total. Having permanent members abstain is so damaging.  It shouldn't require an affirmative vote from all permanent members, it should require that all votes from permanent members be affirmative.  Abstaining should never prevent a resolution.

Two is the biggie though. I believe if you're the subject of the resolution, you should be abstained by default.  If the whole point of the UN is to prevent WW3, then the party starting WW3 shouldn't be able to prevent the UN.  Otherwise the UN can only prevent WW3 if it's not started by .. the 4-5 countries most likely to start WW3.

I believe you're right and I understand that the UN doesn't agree with me. The shit bit is it's far too late to change it now.  But this is the single thing that undermines the entire UN in my eyes.",1664582445

The 5-50r is a 50amp 120v line.

This is not a typical EV charging plug. 

You'll need an adapter. Something like this: https://www.homedepot.com/p/parkworld-1-5-ft-6-3-3-Wire-50-Amp-125-Volt-3-Prong-NEMA-5-50P-Plug-to-50-Amp-125-250-Volt-4-Prong-14-50R-Receptacle-Adapter-Cord-885811/317641470 

Even then, I'm not sure how well it'll work. You're only getting one hot line, and most L2 chargers want both hots.

"AskFrance","t5_2zkfk","Pour beaucoup d'hommes la diff√©rence entre ""flirt"" et ""amour"" est assez floue.

Je n'insinue pas que les femmes soient innond√©es de compliment, mais juste que c'est quelque chose de plus commun et naturel. Il y a eu plusieurs √©tudes l√† dessus, nottament une femme qui a d√©cid√© de se faire passer pour un homme pendant un an, et est rentr√©e en d√©pression il me semble (Norah Vincent).

En g√©n√©ral dans la culture occidentale actuelle les hommes ont tendance √† cacher leurs √©motions, autant √† eux m√™mes qu'aux autres, et ils parlent tr√®s rarement (voir jamais) de leurs √©motions entre eux, et par extension sont moins enclins √† exprimer cela √† travers des compliments ou autres attentions. Tout cela principalement car beaucoup d'hommes consid√®rent que √ßa les fait para√Ætre plus fort, et leur √©viter d'exposer certaines ""faiblesses"".

Je suis dans ce cas, enfin je l'ai √©t√© pendant la majeure partie de ma vie avant de r√©aliser le handicap que je m'infligeait.

Dans ce genre de vie, lorsqu'on recontre une femme qui nous fait des compliments, c'est quelque chose de pr√©cieux. N'√©tant pas tr√®s exp√©riment√© dans la compr√©hension et gestion de nos √©motions, on peux fa√ßilement commencer √† tomber amoureux d'une amie qui est juste sympathique et nous a fait deux ou trois compliments, sans vraiment comprendre ce qui nous arrive et pourquoi, et chercher des indices pour se convaincre que c'est peut-√™tre r√©ciproque.",1664582446

"AskAnthropology","t5_2wl4u","It's about patriarchy, which is *not* a simple emotional 'men above women' deal.

One part of it is, inheritance laws meant that by murdering your brothers or father, you were invoking the legal protections on the family property. Those of course were implemented by family fathers who had a vested interest in not getting murdered by their sons, or having them murder each other and lead to the lineage dying off. Both of those things lead to political instability and famines when farms aren't operated in a consistent manner.

The other aspect of this is the moral hazard of legislation solely consisting of men, who wanted to protect their ability to ""deal"" with infidelity by maintaining that legal slack to murder women. Or heads of families wanting to reserve their right to kill their daughters for having children out of wedlock, to disincentivize them going around being free and enabling gossip rather than being traded around like cattle in arranged marriages. Which, also served to bolster cohesion, farms being operated more consistently and so on.

Or only to do jobs good for society - by whose metric? 

But I do agree with you in that you have to be someone with SOMETHING, with privilege if you will -  of health, energy, wealth, drive, charisma - to even BE in a position to help others and effect good in the world. If I feel over-extended with part-time work and small children, living paycheck to paycheck in a low-level job, my influence is limited. I can do my meed of good by raising my children well, helping friends in small ways.... But I'm NOT giving money to charity, organizing anything in my community, volunteering. And if I'm a low-level employee, not a manager or org leader, then I have no internships or jobs to give, no capital to advocate with. If you have no influence you also have no platform....

I literally mentioned fortnite and Minecraft and that those are what 10yos play. And if I'm not mistaken, fortnite and Minecraft aren't an Elden Ring dlc neither are they souls like. 10yos play m rated games like gta and cod, not elden ring which is what I said before.

Gamepass costs 12$ a month. Unless you make 100k a year nobody is going to forget to cancel. A lot of people also buy with subscription cards that automatically cancel after 1,3,6 months etc.

Also there is still Stalker 2, starfield and Scorn. And like I said these are _some_ of the games. Like 5% of them. Here is the list for the near future:

"vinyl","t5_2qh7i","Seriously what the hell is wrong with you? Now you're just harassing and following me. Look at all my level-headed comments with other people, now look at the anger you're causing. I'm responding to you're  toxic behavior. And way to be ableist and turn mental illness into an insult. That's really fucked up. And still you've yet to respond appropriately to any of my major points because you just want someone to spew hatred at and have this weird childhood attachment to mofi.

You still can't say where I'm wrong because I'm not wrong. Mofi was unethical. Dsd is not superior to analog. It's close but it's not. Information is lost with every transfer dude. You should know that if you understand sonics so much to ridicule me. But per usual ignorant people who can't debate resort to cruelty and insults without a shred of support. You're not here in good faith because you're attacking me for things I never done, didn't argue a single point I made, and instead are being incredibly elitist and relishing in people being scammed. It's very odd. I'm glad your mom gave you a mofi from a defunct corporation that isn't modern mofi, but you don't need to be so extreme due to some odd childhood attachment to a fucking corporation. 

Dude you need to take your own advise about getting help. You're attacking me for 0 reason purposely. I didn't gatekeeper anything. Name one thing i gatekeeped? Why are you so personal? Sure I'm the gatekeeping audiophile even though I praised dsd256 and praised digital records. What gatekeeper states their favorite record is digital? This black and white tribalistic thinking is frightening. Like seriously dude you're honestly scaring me. Did an audiophile abuse you or some shit? Cuz I don't understand where this is coming from. 

You can't argue any of my points. Also judging from your history you have a clear bias towards mofi. Then add in you're from San Francisco. Wouldn't be surprised if you're affiliated in some way. Because you're angry at me for hating a company that deceived customers in a weird personal manner.  

I love digital. I buy flacs. But I want my digital digital. Not have a greedy multimillion dollar corporation scam me. They sold onesteps at 125 pretending they were superior to 40 sacds. When they're inferior. Digital files pressed to vinyl is pointless when you can have the sacd. I never once bashed digital at all. I bashed the fact that it's not perfected yet so their bullshit about it being an immaculate recreation DIRECTLY from the mastertapes is fucked. Sell me the hi res file for $20 not some snakeoil bullshit. 

I praised digital. I shit on a greedy corporation. Why are you so offended?

I touch grass every day. Those who say that touch grass shit are often redditors like yourself who never even seen grass. Youre the one getting so angry and accusing me of shit i never did. Becsuse youre a tribalist. Nothing about my comment was unhinged. I'm upset a company stole from me through false advertising. I didn't gatekeep anything. I praised digital records. It's obvious you didn't even read my comment yet have this weird attachment to mofi.

Way to relish in the fact that you're breaking the rules. You look forward to being reported? Dude you need to break out of this weird ass tribalism. Seriously I didn't hate on a single record. I praised my digital collection. I didn't have any temper or anger or say anything unhinged. I even said I'd mourn mofi when they close.

Dude honestly take your own advice. You're very hostile for 0 reason and now you're following and harassing me. Wanna know what's a symptom of mental illness? Black and white thinking. So you see me praising mofi records, praising dsd, calling 256 near archival, but because I think a company should pay for lying I'm somehow an unhinged audiophile? Just because i dont believe in lying to customers? You do realize most agree with me. Just look at mofis sales. 

Nothing I said was gatekeeping. You're continuously labeling me as something I'm not. Being personal and now you're stalking my posts. I praised mofi and would still support them if they were honest. I clearly stated all of that. Problem is you didn't actually read my comment and you're out for blood because of your weird attachment to mofi. That mofi your mom gave you was a totally different company than the modern mofi. Let it go. 

I said nothing negative about digital vinyl. I praised it. I praised multiple mofis. I'm against the disgusting breach of ethics and false advertising. Would you shit on someone sold gmo foods as organic? Would you shit on someone mad that they were sold plated gold? But it looks the same!!!

If they were honest I'd have bought the sacds. I buy flacs all the time. 

The point is you're black and white thinking is scary. You're treating me as some effigy as an audiophile as I praise digital records. You're calling me a gatekeeper because people I don't even know gatekeep.. you label me an audiophile out of this weird toxic tribalism because I criticized mofi.... 

All this anger and cruelty because i don't like a company lying. Holy shit dude. And then to make it personal? And insult me over and over? And to stalk my comments to other people? Talk about antisocial, tribalistic, and downright cruel. Follow your own advise dude, follow your own advice.",1664582448

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","YTA ‚Äî Something to consider, if your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù would drop you bc you didn‚Äôt go to parties sometimes that doesn‚Äôt sound like ‚Äúbrotherhood‚Äù to me. You don‚Äôt have ‚Äúobligations and responsibilities‚Äù, none of this is real, it‚Äôs all made up by young men desperate for the validation of others (as we all struggle with when we‚Äôre young don‚Äôt get me wrong) and pressured by false expectations of a very restrictive perception of masculinity setting up arbitrary rules to make a power structure that makes them feel important. Friendships are supposed to be fun and fulfilling, not conditional. Your gf is probably a lot more invested in / actually cares about who you are as a person and you don‚Äôt have to prove it to her.

Also, that *is* a sexist party and it gives me the ick. I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre still doing this in 2022. You could literally just have a sporty themed party or whatever, why is the theme explicitly ‚Äúif you‚Äôre a girl you‚Äôre a hoe, dress like one‚Äù ü§ÆYou know this, don‚Äôt try to tell your girlfriend she‚Äôs wrong here. Reality check: when you‚Äôre in these kind of identity groups, the group behavior reflects on you too, you don‚Äôt get to say ‚Äúwell it wasn‚Äôt me‚Äù. The social dynamic created in fraternities often promotes old fashioned, hyper masculine, sexually predatory and exclusionary group think culture. Male friendships are important and you can and should form healthy supportive ones but often these spaces don‚Äôt facilitate that. Maybe you could be part of the change by standing up to your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù, and if you can‚Äôt, they‚Äôre not your friends.

Edit ‚Äî this is coming from someone who‚Äôs in a LTR with a wonderful former frat boy, with many friends who were in Greek life and I actually did research on fraternities in college lol. That to say, yes there are fraternities that have a nicer culture but the social dynamics I explained above mean that they often are not and yours sounds pretty predictably undesirable.",1664582448

So after all that, this fixes nothing at all, but just creates a way to track which veteran is on food assistance through the state and then organize them by race.  Just what we need, another way to divide people through government intervention.

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

* Rudeness towards other Redditors,

* Spreading incorrect information,

* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.",1664582449

"Wonderlands","t5_3a4la3","Before talking about a second opus let's ask of them to finish the first one and see if they deliver lol.

We are in an era where most games can be heavely changed by updates. The ""we'll do better in the a sequel"" isn't good enough (never was imho), if the first opus didn't delivered what it was suppose to. A sequel is suppose to make a very good first opus even better,  more than half of Wonderlands is badly done (late game, loot, most classes) the other half well done being gameplay and story mode.

I'm mainly talking about lack of real/interesting content for late game, atrociously bad season pass and felt like cut content, very poor designed loot system (no securities, 7 layers of RGN with no real interactions possible on stats from the player, loot you seek never looting like class mods, rerolls on enchantments costing a fortune for actual no reason other than keeping us on the game) and some random yet very important stuff like the chaos level not being registered for the account, asking of us to grind 50 freaking levels, some spells still behind useless AF because of no damage and/or way to long cooldowns, same goes for a lot of weapons and their stats...

In my book this game isn't finished, at all... The only thing they delivered is a good story mode and 3 very good classes (the others are sooo behind it's depressing) + mostly good gameplay from weapons and spells but while the variety is present for these last two with the paid season pass, the poor balance of the majority of it really only let's you with very limited choiices for real late game efficient builds (not talking about one shots builds).",1664582449

Omg girl do you watch forged in fire? Cuz I want you to pick usable steel from this pile of scrap metal to use as the base for your blades. They must meet the following parameters, a length between 8-10 inches, a full tang with a length of 3-4 inches, and width from spine to cutting edge of at least 1 1/2 inch but no longer than 2 1/2 inches. In the next round, you will be attaching handles to your blades to turn them into fully functional weapons. And for the third round we will put it through a series of tests, such as, dummy stab for sharpness, chain chop for durability, and a sheet metal stab for edge retention. And the two winners of the third round will be sent to their home forges to recreate an iconic weapons from history. The winner of the final round will go home with the title of forged in fire champion and a check for $10,000. Your time starts, now!",1664582451

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","When the doc i see at the clinic says to go to er but the er triage nurse tells me to go to the clinic because its not an emergency. I know its not an emergency but i need to see a doctor but since i dont have a family doctor i cant get a proper appointment. So i go to er, the wait is 8 hours but since my case is not an emergency most new patients that come in in those 8 hours go in front of me. So now after 6 hours wait, the wait is still 8 hours. In that time i havent eaten because i dont want to go to the cafeteria in case they call me when im gone, im getting tired and id need to call in sick for a second day at work if im to stay. So now my choices are to camp out in the er in the hope that no one comes in at night so i finally get to see a doctor (who wont take me seriously) or go home and try again another day when my memory of how useless it is fades a bit.

Last time i was in the er i waited 11 hours for an anal cist the size of a golf ball that was about the burst. Imagine how long it would take for an stomach ulcer that seems to come and go. The answer is over 7 years now and still no doctor has been willing to have a look.

The problem is not patients at wits end with the current system, its the system.",1664582451

"literaciafinanceira","t5_2clhc5","Respondo-te com uma n√£o simples resposta: 

Qualquer banco digital depende da internet &gt;&gt; Internet √© gigante &gt;&gt; h√° uma infinidade ‚Äúcoisas‚Äù que podem ser feitas &gt;&gt; Essa infinidade √© constantemente estudada &gt;&gt; Todos os bancos digitais partilham os mesmos problemas devido a essa infinidade de ‚Äúcoisas‚Äù &gt;&gt; Depende do grupo de pessoas que lidam com esse tipo de ‚Äúcoisas‚Äù gerir da melhor maneira &gt;&gt; A Moey! para processo inicial teve melhores resultados em ciberseguran√ßa do que canais digitais de outros bancos j√° com uma idade mais avan√ßada. 

Problemas destes todos os dias ir√£o existir enquanto existirem pessoas que aderem a servi√ßos banc√°rios EM QUE N√ÉO SABEM SEQUER AO QUE EST√ÉO A ADERIR. 

Ex: Cota com 78 anos que adere √† ades√£o online de uma conta banc√°ria. Para ele est√° apenas a utilizar o multibanco em casa atrav√©s do computador. Agora imagina que ele escreve o nome do seu banco no Google. Entra no primeiro an√∫ncio que a Google lhe mostra. Esse an√∫ncio tem o nome do banco dele. Ele insere os seus dados pessoais como o n√∫mero de ades√£o dele e a sua palavra passe. Quando insere e tenta entrar, o site diz-lhe que est√° tudo incorreto. Ele sabe que est√° correto no entanto. Este cota obviamente vai ligar para o banco a expor a situa√ß√£o. No entanto ele n√£o sabe que se trata de um site Phishing. E quem criou esse site tem agora os dados de acesso desse cota (e de muitos mais). 

Isto obviamente conta para a contabiliza√ß√£o de casos de fraude referentes a um banco, fazendo com que o banco fique mal visto. No entanto a culpa foi do senhor coitado que n√£o percebe o que est√° a fazer, nem sabe ao que aderiu. E sem se aperceber deu os dados a algu√©m. Esse algu√©m consegue efetivamente efetuar um SIM SWAPPING (para quem n√£o sabe √© o mesmo que dizer clonagem de cart√£o de telem√≥vel) deste senhor. Recebe ent√£o os c√≥digos relativos ao 3D secure do cart√£o e faz pagamentos. Quem tem a culpa na realidade √© este senhor que efetivamente n√£o entende o que est√° a fazer, por√©m na teoria o BANCO √© classificado por este senhor como inseguro. Porque este n√£o entende novamente nada. 

Agora multipliquem este caso por um n√∫mero superior a 600 mil. 

√â √≥bvio que o banco vai ser visto como o mau e cheio de falhas de seguran√ßa.

Espero que me tenhas entendido. J√° estou com uma garrafa de vinho em cima, poderei me ter repetido demasiado nos exemplos. 

Isto tudo para dizer que a maioria das falhas de seguran√ßa prov√©m do utilizador (sem eles perceberem sequer) e n√£o do pr√≥prio banco.

I would have thought that companies facing higher interest rates would simply fire employees or even cut their wages.  Why do you believe that the opposite would happen?  This is counter-intuitive",1664582453
"slp","t5_2sjju","Child Directed Interactions and Verbal Directed Interactions! Two ‚Äústeps‚Äù in a model called Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Selective Mutism, PCIT-SM. Those are some key words you can use to dive deeper :) 

CDI is about following the child‚Äôs lead without pressure to speak as a ‚Äúwarm up‚Äù of sorts, to increase comfort. You play, interact, and acknowledge observed behaviors without interpreting (‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre stacking blocks‚Äù vs ‚ÄúI see you‚Äôre building a house.‚Äù). VDI then supports verbal responses using a hierarchy of prompts and supports to get to more audible and/or longer verbal responses.

I‚Äôve even used these strategies for kiddos who may not necessarily have SM but demonstrate some level of anxiety about speaking that‚Äôs impacting their communication.",1664582453

Perhaps she developed responsive desire, or maybe simply inviting her husband back into their bedroom would have helped with her self-image, re-igniting things.

The issue is she immediately dismissed sex and intimacy with her husband as unimportant. We can‚Äôt know how different things would have gone if she had the willingness for some introspection ‚Äî to actually put some thought towards what sex now meant to her.

She never owed her husband sex. She certainly did owe him the time and effort to consider his feelings and needs, and to truly determine how she felt about sex and intimacy.",1664582453

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Nothing is wrong with having many partners, you could have 100 and that wouldn't make you any less human or any less deserving of love. The problem however is, if you have the time to have sex with 30+ different people, then there is no fucking way you actually bond with every single one of them on a deeper level. What is the average duration of your relationships? I don't think you wait long enough to have sex with the guys you are having sex with to make sure that they actually care about you and not just the sex. There is no law that says they have to pleasure you and make you cum, that is something they choose to do for you. Them choosing not to do that just means that they don't care about you, something you should have been able to figure out before letting them hit. The faster you have sex the higher chance you have of just being a human masturbator. But that is on you for letting them, not them for just only caring about themselves when you don't actually matter to them and they have different ideas of what people are supposed to get out of sex.

Why don't you straight up tell your next sexual encounter that you will not let him penetrate you until he makes you cum? and if they say no you walk away. If you don't want to walk away the problem is you, not them.",1664582453

"UkraineAnxiety","t5_67xitm","1984 is probably one of the best but also most terrifying books I‚Äôve ever read. It‚Äôs shown to be accurate with authoritarian regimes. North Korea is the best example of this as they are practically a clone of the government in 1984.

In 1984, it is demonstrated often that authoritarians love to make empty threats to their people. Make their people think something will happen. Make them enraged, prideful, and excited. In fact, in 1984 there were two minutes everyday dedicated to making the people hate their enemies. The best way to distract people from an authoritarian government is to make them hate another enemy. In reality, the three authoritarian governments of the world were at war with each other, but it was a purposeful frozen conflict. The countries want to make their people scared, but they don‚Äôt actually want to destroy each other. They like their power, and they only keep their power through the peace. At peak authoritarian rule, there is actually peace. Scary propaganda really doesn‚Äôt mean much about what‚Äôs actually going to happen. Perhaps some reassurance for some people.

1984 is actually a really good book if you can avoid the possible triggers (of which there are probably many).",1664582454

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","It had been a long week. I was tired, just going through the motions of living. Work had gotten to me, my girlfriend had left me, and my life was starting to resemble an old country song. And now I had a two-hour flight booked at the last minute, because across the country one of my good friends was having emergency surgery. They needed someone with them and I was the first person they thought of. It wasn't their fault, and I was happy to help, but it was another thing on an already overloaded plate.   
All of this was weighing on my mind so much, that I nearly didn't register what the flight attendant said. I was already seated, the only consolation to my horrible life; that my friend had comped me for first class. He really was a good guy, I would have to thank him somehow.   
""You're going to be the only person on this flight."" She repeated herself, looking slightly aggravated. I took another moment to process.   
""Empty plane? Or a booking error?"" I asked, trying to act like this happened to me all the time. She shook her head.   
""No, I said you'd be the only *person* on this flight."" Before I could ask for clarification, we began moving, and she rushed out of first class. Well, thank goodness for cryptic flight attendants. Now I had a mystery to keep me away from much-needed sleep.   
As we rose into the air, and I frantically chewed my gum to try and get my ears to pop‚Äîplane travel was my least favourite, as it often led to ear pain from the pressure‚ÄîI resisted the urge to ignore the seatbelt light and wander out of first class. Whoever, or whatever was on this plane wasn't in this section. But they also weren't going anywhere, so I had time. Finally, the light turned off and I was up in an instant. Now I'd find an answer.  
But it was not to be. A different flight attendant came in, asking if I needed anything, if there was anything he could do, etcetera. Then, he sprayed me in the face with some kind of aerosol device and everything went black.   
When I woke up, I was back in my seat. There were low, growly voices all around me, so I kept my eyes shut. Until I knew more about the situation, I didn't want them aware I was awake.  
""What should we do, boss?""   
""Well, obviously we have a problem here.""  
""No one was supposed to be on this flight, why is there a person on this flight?""   
""Hey, we're people too.""  
""You know what I mean... A *human*."" I bit my tongue at that last one, trying to keep my eyes from fluttering. They weren't human, whatever they were. And all the context clues I had, were the growly voices and an odd smell. I couldn't quite place it, but I knew I'd smelt it before.   
My face must have changed, scrunched, or moved in some way. There were a few yelps of alarm, and the boss voice had to calm everyone down. When they'd regained order, the voice addressed me.  
""We know you're awake. When you open your eyes, I want you to remain calm. We mean you no harm, as long as you mean us no harm. You are not restrained, but I suggest you do not become violent.""  
I took a deep breath and opened my eyes. At first, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. After all, it was impossible. Completely, utterly, impossible. But I *could* finally place what I was smelling.  
The plane was full of dogs.  
Dogs of all shapes and sizes, from the equivalent of a chihuahua to a great dane. I say equivalent, because as I looked longer and harder, there were differences. The faces were odd, tending towards larger eyes, and taller foreheads. There was an obvious intelligence in all of them, a higher intelligence than most dogs. I could only think of one explanation.   
""Werewolves?"" My voice squeaked. From the seat across from me, a bulldog chuckled.   
""No."" It said. The boss voice seemed appropriate coming from it. ""No, definitely not. Perhaps the best way we can describe it to a human, is aliens. Though that is not quite accurate either."" The bulldog shook his head, spittle flying everywhere. It was comforting to know that these dogs still drooled.   
""You only know our lesser cousins. What you call dogs. We are... different."" As he said the word, another part of the previous conversation rose in my head.  
""What are you going to do to me?"" I asked. The bulldog cocked his head to the side, another familiar motion. He was confused.   
""Do to you?""  
""The situation,"" I prompted. ""I'm a human on this flight, and I'm not supposed to be here?"" I could see the headlines now. 'Man mauled by hundreds of dogs that say it was his own fault.' Or something like that. Laughter echoed around the plane.  I've got to say, it was disconcerting being laughed at by dogs. The boss bulldog quieted them down with a few sharp barks, that sounded a little like the words 'shut up.' But why wouldn't he just say‚Äî  
""You being here isn't the situation. Or isn't all of it. Fred gets worried easily."" He motioned with his head to a mournful-looking basset hound. ""No, it's more than you being here. The situation is stress. Yours in particular. You, in point of fact, reek of stress. It's a very offputting smell."" I stared at the dog, trying to figure out if I should be insulted. Then something heavy landed on my lap.  
I looked down, into a pair of deep brown eyes. It was a Newfoundland, or at least its equivalent in whatever species this was. The bulldog chuckled, shaking its head again, and spreading more drool.   
""As usual, though she is a woman of few words, Lenore is right. You understand your own concept of service dogs? Well, for the next,"" He paused, seeming to calculate in his head. ""Hour and a half, we are all, at your service. Prepare to be de-stressed."" I looked back at Lenore, raising a hand to pet her, before stopping just above her head.   
""Are you sure, I should‚Äî"" She stopped me by lifting her head just slightly and butting it into my hand. As I stroked her, I couldn't resist a smile.   
This was turning out to be a first-class flight after all.  
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî  
(Epilogue)  
When we landed, I thanked the dogs and walked off the plane a changed man. The stress was still there, it wasn't a miracle cure, but I felt better, more relaxed. And more able to help my friend recover from surgery. I smiled at the flight attendant, both of us party to a secret that we knew wouldn't be believed by anyone.   
""Have a nice flight sir?"" She asked. I nodded, brushing at pants that were covered in dog hair.  
""I had the best flight, thank you.""   
I floated on the feeling of that flight all the way to my friend's hospital room. He was surprised but listened to the entire story. Though he said he believed me, he *was* high on pain medicine and the aftereffects of the anesthesia. It didn't matter. I knew that as soon as I could, I was going to go down to a local shelter.  
After what those dogs did for me, it seems only fitting I should adopt one of their cousins, and give it a good home.

He also favors high quality wrestling over attraction/ spectacle matches Wardlow specializes in.

So what does all that mean? We have no singles programs because they want to keep him protected, and don't want to over expose him. Which leads to Tag or Trios matches being your only solution. 

Probably should have done a better job of booking him so they didn't run into this issue. This is the major challenge with giving acts like this titles.

This issue was also being amplified by the supercharger clutch being worn. This was only found out after the first repair was done.

"ImTheMainCharacter","t5_4c4j2u","Yeah, but you haven't made a political party your entire identity. One side does that disproportionately and you can tell by what merch you find for sale which it is.",1664582460
"ColleenBallingerSnark","t5_33f898","Exactly! 

And another very telling sign is the way that everyone who enters her orbit, becomes involved in *her* life, but never vice versa. First Josh, and now Erik, lost their individual identity after becoming part of her life. Rachel‚Äôs entire adult existence has been shaped by her relationship to Colleen. It‚Äôs only the past couple of years that Rachel has started exploring who she might be in her own right, and look at how that‚Äôs created a visible wedge between the once inseparable sisters? Now Kory fills that role, and who is Kory as an individual outside of the role he fills for Colleen? She even often refers to his dog as her dog, which is so weird to me? 

And her brother and his family, we all know how that story goes. Their life got uprooted and brought into the YouTube vlogging world so that he could be her ‚Äúwriting partner.‚Äù They got dragged up to Canada so that he could take part in her atrocious ‚Äúkids show‚Äù. They got dragged around to different cities to perform as unpaid performers in her ridiculous middle school talent show. It‚Äôs all about catering to the Colleen show. But when does she step outside of herself and her own interests for other people? Other than times like going ‚Äúcamping‚Äù for her husbands birthday, but even then she gets out her camera and complains the entire time about how it‚Äôs not the type of thing she enjoys doing. Imagine if Erik were to have vlogged backstage at waitress about how he didn‚Äôt really enjoy doing Broadway related stuff? 

She‚Äôs such a textbook narcissist and the damage she does to the personal lives of people she uses for limited amounts of time before dropping them, gets so infuriating to watch.",1664582460

2021 was a weaker year overall, which is why I think *Another Round* gets in. There's a four-way race for those last two spots between it, *Ma Rainey*, *One Night in Miami*, and *Soul*. Not to spoil my predictions, but *Another Round* was on an up-swing when voting was happening, as people were discovering and talking about it. *Ma Rainey* was a long-shot, since it was unlikely the Academy was going to nominate 3 Netflix movies in the same year.

I feel most fans would be happy with an new data pack and maybe a new 'patch' every season - like a FM 22 V23 update/pack for a fee.

Then SI could spend three/four years actually working on building a new 'game'. By game I mean a new match engine and graphics/game engine. This would allow for SI to have a beta period that is longer than two weeks (I mean seriously, a two week beta!!! What use is that!).

I know SI doesn't have a big team, but when you look at what small indy studios can do with less people and money this is really no excuse. I honestly believe SI's underwhelming updates come from this outdated motion of releasing a 'new' game every year. It just gives them no time to do anything of any real substance as it is basically impossible to do a 'new' game in 12 months.",1664582463

"haloinfinite","t5_k9v3x","Right :

Art direction, character designs, gameplay, sandbox, music, sound design, dialogues, animations, boss fights, banished AI. 

Wrong :

- campaign: lack of diversity, both visually and gameplay wise. It's one long silent cartographer/Halo mission from CE with some bosses. Open world side quests are very repetitive. No real epic fights or big set pieces, no real dynamic events in the open world, marines' AI not great and not driving. Still no co-op and mission replay, split-screen cancelled. 

- multiplayer: bad server performances and bugs (melees, lag compensation, desync, delayed kills, rubber banding, unstable ping etc). Game feel very different online versus local. Very little to do on day one (only 3 playlists at launch), content held back to make it look like a live service, no progression only BP, expensive shop, cosmetics not tied to achievements or skill, just money or BP grind, seasons being delayed with little content, still no Forge, custom browser, questionable matchmaking algorithm especially for ranked, lack of fun or original map design. The game tries to be very competitive but the online performance is too bad for it.


The game really needs 3 things at this point:

- technical fixes (better online performances, custom games and theatre, MnK/PC performances etc)

- community support (splitscreen, forge, custom game browser)

- meaningful updates (DLCs, maps, PvE, events, shorter seasons)",1664582463

They are going for story telling first.

The series isnt exclusively fighting. It has strong stories to tell.

Many times its for the best. Specially in cases like Hans the writter of the little mermaid.

Yeah a writter brought a way more interesting story that some big martial artists.

And he is easily one of the most fan favorite characters due to his inmense sarcasm and how he roast everything that breathes with his words.

There is no way a Martial artist or some random alchemist would have brought us interesting things like the relation between Hans and Kiara https://youtu.be/mtTSu-j_iA0",1664582465

The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; El organismo recaudador puso la lupa sobre aquellos monotributistas registrados bajo la categor√≠a A y B, que compraron tickets para viajar a Qatar a ver los partidos del equipo que dirige **Lionel Scaloni**. Encontr√≥ que **el 28 por ciento de ellos no cuentan con ingresos adicionales a las actividades adheridas en el citado r√©gimen impositivo.**
&gt; 
&gt; La comunicaci√≥n fue realizada mediante el domicilio Fiscal Electr√≥nico de cada uno de los ""**monotributistas mundialeros""**, y los **invit√≥ a reencuadrarse en una categor√≠a acorde al l√≠mite m√°ximo de sus ingresos brutos.**
&gt; 
&gt; Las intimaciones surgieron luego de los an√°lisis de las alertas originadas en la matriz de riesgo de la Direcci√≥n General de Recursos de la Seguridad Social (DGRSS) y de la Direcci√≥n General Impositiva (DGI).
&gt; 
&gt; El control se realiz√≥ luego de un cruzamiento de datos con las entidades crediticias y la base de datos de la AFIP y alcanz√≥ a un universo de **contribuyentes cuyo √∫nico ingreso declarado proviene de su actividad como monotributistas.**
&gt; 
&gt; En este sentido, **el organismo indic√≥ que continuar√° realizando controles, cruzando informaci√≥n con las agencias de turismo para detectar quienes compraron pasajes o paquetes para asistir al Mundial de Qatar 2022**; con la Direcci√≥n de Migraciones, para verificar qui√©nes viajaron a ese evento deportivo, y con las tarjetas de cr√©dito, para verificar los gastos realizados en Qatar en los d√≠as previos al inicio de la Copa del Mundo y durante el desarrollo de la competencia.

&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; El organismo recaudador puso la lupa sobre aquellos monotributistas registrados bajo la categor√≠a A y B, que compraron tickets para viajar a Qatar a ver los partidos del equipo que dirige **Lionel Scaloni**. Encontr√≥ que **el 28 por ciento de ellos no cuentan con ingresos adicionales a las actividades adheridas en el citado r√©gimen impositivo.**
&gt; 
&gt; La comunicaci√≥n fue realizada mediante el domicilio Fiscal Electr√≥nico de cada uno de los ""**monotributistas mundialeros""**, y los **invit√≥ a reencuadrarse en una categor√≠a acorde al l√≠mite m√°ximo de sus ingresos brutos.**
&gt; 
&gt; Las intimaciones surgieron luego de los an√°lisis de las alertas originadas en la matriz de riesgo de la Direcci√≥n General de Recursos de la Seguridad Social (DGRSS) y de la Direcci√≥n General Impositiva (DGI).
&gt; 
&gt; El control se realiz√≥ luego de un cruzamiento de datos con las entidades crediticias y la base de datos de la AFIP y alcanz√≥ a un universo de **contribuyentes cuyo √∫nico ingreso declarado proviene de su actividad como monotributistas.**
&gt; 
&gt; En este sentido, **el organismo indic√≥ que continuar√° realizando controles, cruzando informaci√≥n con las agencias de turismo para detectar quienes compraron pasajes o paquetes para asistir al Mundial de Qatar 2022**; con la Direcci√≥n de Migraciones, para verificar qui√©nes viajaron a ese evento deportivo, y con las tarjetas de cr√©dito, para verificar los gastos realizados en Qatar en los d√≠as previos al inicio de la Copa del Mundo y durante el desarrollo de la competencia.

BTW, re the goshawk alarm call:  do these species all live in the same location/ecosystem?  Because the inherent ability to hear and understand neighboring species' alarm calls has survival value.

You might enjoy Tim Friend's ""Animal Talk"" (book)-- he talks about the acoustics and the need for calls in rainforests among things, including hardwired priming for sounds like cracks of twigs, etc, as well as hisses of snakes and similar things.

This made me even more convinced that the clicks in clicker training are NOT ""neutral sounds"" as clicker trainers tend to believe.  And I'm not surprised ground animals would learn to mimic snakes, although that is an excellent warning system against falling buffaloes.  (Igor's uncle Igor died from buffaloes, didn't he, in the Discworld books?   ""We don't thpeak about it."")

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Exactly. This is a basic principle of Machiavelli (no, not the pop-culture, you-gotta-break-eggs-to-make-an-omelet, Machiavelli. The real Machiavelli who wrote *The Prince* and *Discourses on Livy*) that one of the most important assets a ruler can have is the *appearance* of honor. Honor itself is dispensable; the appearance thereof is not. 

The reason why Roose is able to wrangle his way into Robb's good graces, and the entire reason he is in a position to backstab the man, is because he presented himself as controlled, disciplined and loyal. Even if he was creepy and evil, he never once gave any indication that he had any plans to sue for a separate peace, nor did anything that gave even experienced political operators like Catelyn the slightest indication that he could or would break faith and attempt to hang separately. And that's key: however much he might give the impression of a stone-cold killer, what's important is that he appears to Robb to be a stone-cold killer that will serve Robb's interests, obey Robb's laws, and fight Robb's enemies. He makes himself look like Robb's Gregor Clegane, except where Clegane is all mad fury in combat, Roose is an icy, hardened executioner.

*No one* would *ever* trust Ramsay in that same way. And why would they; Ramsay goes out of his way to appear like he's absolutely feral. Which in turn means that even people who might find it in their interests to oppose a Stark restoration simply cannot work with him. He'll kill his allies on a whim; weirdly enough, he finds himself increasingly bereft of allies. It's astonishing how that works, especially when you don't have show-runners in your corner who have never read Machiavelli and are only too happy to spawn new supporters whenever they feel like you've lost some of your fearsomeness.",1664582467

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt; But why? Intelligence probably isn't purely genetic, so accepting that the measure of intelligence stratifies based on race just tells you that the average intelligence differs between races.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything like convincing evidence for that. Humans are incredibly homogenous for a species, genetically speaking. Unusually so. I haven‚Äôt seen any compelling evidence that *intelligence* genuinely varies by ‚Äúrace‚Äù (a social/cultural construction that in its modern form is more or less a 17th-18th century invention). When looking at genetic variance between populations, those variances (1) do not cohere to modern social concepts of ‚Äúrace‚Äù and (2) are much narrower than broad, detectable differences in cognitive function ‚Äî more like, susceptibility to certain genetic diseases.

The SAT or some state standardized test for middle schoolers is more likely to measure if you were taught certain vocabulary or kinds of math, that is, specific *knowledge*, than some kind of core ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù.

&gt; But importantly, this is a measure of academic merit, not ""intelligence"" broadly speaking. Nobody would deny that a student who does poorly in math might have a very developed aptitude for emotional intelligence, but that's simply not relevant to the present case.

&gt;The rest of your comment seems pretty irrelevant (brooo like what is intelligence anyway?), I don't know why you keep changing the subject from *academic merit and its measures*, which is the only relevant subject

I‚Äôm not changing the subject. You will note that my original comment was not a top level comment. I was not commenting on the overall story of the city changing its school admission policies. I was responding directly to someone saying that this was an attack on the concept of ‚Äúintelligence.‚Äù My point has consistently been that you can use tests to determine aptitude in certain academic subjects for placement in courses/tracks, without trying to stretch to say that those tests somehow measure so nebulous a concept as ‚Äúintelligence.‚Äù It is a very specific critique of that one poster‚Äôs comment.",1664582468

No definitely not, please put her in her own enclosure as soon as possible! Putting a male and a female together for even a short amount of time could result in breeding, which is the last thing she needs after 4 months without food.

^(By: Meryl Wilsner | 352 pages | Published: 2022 | Popular Shelves: romance, 2022-releases, lgbtq, sapphic, queer)

&gt;From the critically acclaimed author of Something To Talk About comes a sharp and sexy rom-com about a college senior who accidentally hooks up with her best friend‚Äôs mom.
&gt;
&gt;When Cassie Klein goes to an off-campus bar to escape her school‚Äôs Family Weekend, she isn‚Äôt looking for a hookup‚Äîit just happens. Buying a drink for a stranger turns into what should be an uncomplicated, amazing one-night stand. But then the next morning rolls around and her friend drags her along to meet her mom‚Äîthe hot, older woman Cassie slept with.
&gt;
&gt;Erin Bennett came to Family Weekend to get closer to her daughter, not have a one-night stand with a college senior. In her defense, she hadn‚Äôt known Cassie was a student when they'd met. To make things worse, Erin‚Äôs daughter brings Cassie to breakfast the next morning. And despite Erin's better judgement‚Äîhow could sleeping with your daughter‚Äôs friend be anything but bad?‚Äîshe and Cassie get along in the day just as well as they did last night.
&gt;
&gt;What should have been a one-time fling quickly proves impossible to ignore, and soon Cassie and Erin are sneaking around. Worst of all, they start to realize they have something real. But is being honest about the love between them worth the cost?

MMA and UFC champions historically go through waves of mostly grappling champs to mostly striking champs and back again. And this conversation keeps happening in both directions. 

Higher weight classes tend to favor strikers due to power and other factors (more opportunities for the bigger athlete elsewhere), but historically speaking grapplers, wrestlers especially, have a much higher success rate MMA than strikers. Just look at the all time greats of any division, mostly grapplers/wrestlers who learnt other things. Or strikers who relied heavily on wrestling to keep it standing. 

You can have a Khabib become a goat on basically wrestling alone, not the other way around. Even Silva had to lean on his wrestling and bjj at times to be what he was.

Controlling where a fight takes place is one of the most valuable skills.",1664582469

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Machines with Linux preinstalled are easily available if you go look for them.

Trust me, my mom is not going to go digging for Linux laptops when shopping for a new computer. Case in point: I just went to Dell's website. I pick ""Laptops"". I look through the filters. There's a filter for ""operating system"". What are the options?

W11 Home.

W11 Pro.

W10 Pro (""with W11 license"")

Chrome.

Yeah... Ouf... Much Linux. Very Wow!

Allright, next up: HP. Because, you know, DEV ONE right? Yeah NOPE. Same filter, same findings. You cannot even see that there is the option of Linux.

Now try going to a computer store. Find the Linux Laptop. I dare you.

I tried some of the online retailers. Laptops &gt; Filter &gt; by OS. The closest I could get to Linux as a searchable option was the ""No"" entry. (Which turned out to be a Windows ASUS machine that was incorrectly entered into the system... Yay...)

So, no, Linux laptops are NOT ""easily available"". They are available for people that already know they want a Linux machine, and know where to look. Which makes the ""Linux Preinstalled"" basically pointless, because those are the exact people that will be totally fine spending the 3 minutes running Archinstall or any Calamares.

As for work, my own job (a Fortune 500 global online business) offers the option of Macs and Dells. MacOS or Windows. They do also offer ""Linux"" as an option - in the form of that same Windows Dell, but unlocked so you can install Linux yourself.

Any irregularities in the finish due to brush strokes or variations in viscosity or the volume of paint applied can reduce the final effect, and a gloss surface is very hard to paint a uniform layer over with a brush, so it's probably more hassle than it's worth to do this without an airbrush.

I think maybe you need to take a step back from involving yourself in a conflict between your daughter and her mum. Your daughter doesn't need you to advocate for her to her mum. She just needs your support. It's her that needs to learn how to stand up to her mum, and you getting involved is doing nothing to help that. You can sympathise with her, you can discuss strategies of how she can approach talking to her mum about it. But don't create a triangle of conflict by involving yourself, that creates a whole mess of additional conflict that makes it worse for everyone including your daughter.",1664582471

"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","If you have the patience to build a VX, this would make for a fun project. This is the second in a series of tutorials from a fellow VX enthusiast. This is the first one: [Build a VX4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4CeQsM_zgI)

The main reason it's a good idea to build this is because it has some interesting features like:

- A super high-resolution color filter that can detect any wavelength. This means you can create a filter that allows the user to see, for example, the light of a UV-ray at any wavelength.
- The possibility to tune the light path in the filter to create a light source that can be used to power a VX.
- The possibility to add a photonic resonator, which allows the user to tune the light path in the filter to be able to generate a light source that is able to detect any wavelength.

What I found was that most people are not aware of these features. If you have the proper tools to build a VX, you can do pretty much anything. I mean, if you build one, it's pretty much the ultimate VX.",1664582471

"YanfeiMains","t5_4450u8","The main stat of the artifact is good (crit damage) but other than that the only thing useful in it is the 2 rolls on atk% (Assuming you\`re not running tankfei). Generally speaking, for main dps characters such as yanfei, a good artifact would have the ""correct"" main stat (crit dmg or rate for yanfei dps in the case of a circlet) and on top of that at least a couple of rolls into another crit or a good amount of atk% (not flat). A simple main crit stat circlet with 2 rolls on atk% is fine if you're low AR but it's nothing to write home about.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I dont think yanfei uses EoSF so it's an off-piece which makes it worse.

Short preview: [https://zeokku.com/e/rick-preview.html.br](https://zeokku.com/e/rick-preview.html.br)

After several days of working on implementations and optimizations, I'm excited to present an entire ""Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up"" rendered purely by CSS only - no divs, no images, no videos!

The full version may crash your browser because of lack of RAM

Full uncompressed version takes 100 MB of space, so I precompressed it with Brotli to reduce its size to 23.7 MB. The full animation turned out to be so huge, you may run out of RAM playing it, so I included a small 9 seconds preview version as well.

The core principle is rendering video frames as per pixel box-shadows of a unit size element (1px initially but then changed to 1.5px, more below)

v0 - Javascript runtime generation. Interestingly enough changing \`style.boxShadow\` proved to be very effective and fast, but the goal was to make it CSS only, nevertheless it's an interesting observation that JS is faster to change styles than CSS itself with animations

v1 - Putting each frame into a CSS keyframe (like Ben Evans did with pixel art animation), everything happens in \`&lt;body&gt;\` element. And... it didn't even run xd

v2 - Combining each frame into one supershadow (frames atlas) and animating element's \`translateY\`. Clip happens in \`&lt;html&gt;\`, scaling and animations in \`&lt;body&gt;\`. But this had black flickering (frames didn't render fully) with big amount of frames.

v3 - Scaling optimization by doing this in \`&lt;body&gt;\`, clipping moved to \`&lt;body&gt;\` too. Frame animation runs in \`body:after\`

v4 - Optimization of \`box-shadow\` rendering by splitting frame atlas and animation in two halves by utilizing both \`:before\` and \`:after\` and moving scaling to \`&lt;html&gt;\` effectively resulting in following structure:

\- \`:after/:before\` render first and second halves (one after another) of the video frame atlases

\- \`&lt;body&gt;\` performs frame clipping

\- \`&lt;html&gt;\` scales up the result

v5 - To further optimize \`box-shadow(s)\`, now frame atlas is split to multiple chunks (instead of two) and each chunk is applied by a separate animation which also does Y translation, the animations are orchestrated with delays to create a consistent play

v5.1 - Chunking introduced a lag (probably tied to next chunk shadow rendering) between chunks, so lowering chunking to 4 frames per chunk proved to be effective. Interestingly the final version is almost v1 except inverted.

v5.2 - Setting base element size to 1.5px x 1.5px to hide the pixel grid

v5.3 - File size optimizations:

\- converting color from rgb() to #hex

\- storing box shadows in variables to prevent duplicate declaration

\- precompressing into Brotli archive and caching on CDN

Removing whitespaces didn't introduce a significant size drop, so I decided to keep it for ease of readability for viewers

Final stats: 54px x 54px, 12 FPS",1664582475

Yes to get it to work without even gas changes it'd be barely cycling subs unsuppressed and way over gassed super suppressed, you appear to get this. However that can be minimized by minimizing the amount of gas needed to cycle in the first place by using a light carrier. 

My biggest trick is that I use a [Seekins Select Adjustable Gas Block](https://seekinsprecision.com/select-adjustable-gas-block-876.html). This makes gas adjustments between ammo really easily on the fly. 

While I almost never shoot without a can I want to be able to shoot subs without a can. I never would by choice but if I'm in a fight, only have subs, and the can goes pop or something I'd like it to keep cycling.",1664582475

Now it's pretty solid.  In the 100k I've owned it (mostly before the delete and tune), I didn't really have any problems with it.  I am expecting to need to replace the flywheel soon (those are a common fail point), and I'm concerned about the fuel pump problems - but I don't have any signs of fuel pump issues.  


I'd like to say that I expect to get to 400k out of it, but I might give up and go electric by then.

It is a LOT more fun to drive than my MKIV, and has a LOT more power.  My only real complaint is how important it thinks it is for me to know that it's 39 degrees F or colder.",1664582475

"cannabiscultivation","t5_2qt87","Thanks for stopping by and saying that, I appreciate it.

I've got a couple of pups growing right now. I figure I will select my favourite one when it's had a chance to reach an appropriate age/size, then give the rest away, and grow the-one-kept as a cannabonsai or cannahouseplant, or whatever. I still have to find a viable lighting solution so it isn't disruptive to my evenings, as I don't have the biggest space. Grow lights on all night do seem to affect my sleep cycle in a way. I like to have lights off by 10:30, and maintaining a veg cycle does require me to keep it on till at least 1am. I am considering another space in my home so I can give it an ""evening spot"" where the grow light can be on and where i don't see it.

The other thing I've got going is a Cannabis Terrarium. I've got 3 clones established right now in a big 3gallon+ jar, and they are growing slowly. I'm going to be getting springtails tomorrow to add, as mould is SLOWLY starting to set in. I can post about that and tag you in when I do. 

What ideas do you have for yours? Feel free to share the vision or thought-process.

For special stages. First off. The majority can agree that they're actually enjoyable, that definitely helps 'quite a bit'.

Second of all, ""fetch quest?"" As in exploration? Exploration has always been a thing in Sonic, no matter what was advertised or what some people may say.

"DFWcasualencounters","t5_30u6a","We had to remove your recent post on /r/dfwcasualencounters because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can review them in our subreddit's sidebar (on the right side of the screen).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 28/31 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please fix your title and resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdfwcasualencounters).

Finally, please make sure you read the complete Rules and Guidelines on the sidebar.

"WasabiWallet","t5_kbl6g","&gt;The gist is, we, admittedly advanced users, are now supposed to trust an algorithm to send the right coins at the right time. That‚Äôs not how advanced users work.

If you really are worried about some algorithms doing coin selection for you, you better worry about the algorithm that generates your keys, and the algorithm does the coinjoin for you, because if those are broken who cares if you can select coins manually or not.

The point is people are already trusting algorithms doing more dangerous things for them than coin selection and almost everyone never cared but now they seem to know what they are doing.

The whole premise of assassin‚Äôs creed is that you are RELIVING the lives of ancestor‚Äôs. That whole connection to your bloodline and ‚Äúsynchronizing‚Äù with your ancestor was so damn cool to me and I loved the idea of the animus. This trilogy introduced narrative choices and that just does not sit well with me because you cannot choose the outcomes or decisions of lives that have already been lived. I understand the devs were really leaning into the whole RPG aspect of the games, but those narrative decisions were too far for me personally. They are great games and fun to play.

1. You should get along with that person. Even if you were never able to have sex with them, would you still want to be around them? Do you value them as a person and friend? 
2. When you love someone, you have to make an active choice to love them. You have to wake up every day and go ""I still love this person."" Love is a verb. It means that you go out of your way to keep doing special things for them, it means you still take them out after the initial dating period, it means you do whatever weird weekend thing they like even if you don't understand it, and it means they should be doing these things for you as well. Love is a verb.
3. This all applies to the other person as well. I am assuming you are a woman, so think about how he would act if you guys couldn't have sex for a few months. Would he cheat on you? Would he pressure you? Or would he just go jack off in the shower? There will absolutely be times where ya'll won't be able to have sex for long stretches.

Do you notice something about all of those presidents that is not the same with Trump? They ALL made money creating phony wars and problems in the middle east. All of them were getting hand outs by the military industrial complex. Trump did not. But what you could have said was that he has been paid out by moderna. That's debatable.

Yes. The stock market of course. Why wouldn't I mention the stock market and the fact that there were all of a sudden jobs? I graduated from high school 2009 when the democrats also ran the country and your sacred leader obama was ruining the country. You could not get a job at McDonald's if you wrote a cover letter and arrived in a suit. The economy was shit. Obama was however bailing out banks and droning brown children in the middle east. All the while promising to wind down both Iraq and Afghanistan. Trump had a real plan and was the first to negotiate with the Taliban. Which eventually would get us out of that stupid war. But without abandoning Bagrum. This current president just needed to follow the darn plan. 

Trump also predicted that Europe would be at the mercy of Russia unless they stopped this environmental fascism (climate change) that is used as a tool to weaponizing government agencies against you.

"fizzmains","t5_34mwu","Ok, so i had a great conversation about it.

What is Fizz problem ? His kit is useless, unless you get ganks.

What does it mean ? If JG is gapoed, or ignores you, you as a player will end up like 40 to 100 CS into 90% of match ups.

How do we solve it ?

1. We buff Fizz base stats to survive poke and farm.

Cons: Tank Fizz might be back, or Fizz will become too good top laner with demonic and conqueror weird builds.

2. We buff Fizz base dmg, so people get punished for poking him.

Cons: Fizz is lane bully, unpunishable, stat check, no counterplay.

3. We buff his ap ratio's, so he can function with support like gold.

If he gets ganks, he gets too much dmg and snowballs too hard, ALSO he becomes too good late game.

Fizz, because of lack of safe farm tool and range spells is in limbo of being riot's worst balance nightmare in the game and it is sad, but that's the state of the champion, since his dmg is really hard to dodge except R, only solution would be to make him R bot and make it his only skill expression and not even Fizz mains want it. At least that is my view on it.",1664582478

"SFGiants","t5_2s5xr","The kanji (complex characters originating in China) are soooooo hard. I have like, a preschooler's reading comprehension of kanji. Each individual character has a meaning, but then combined with a second character it could mean something super different, AND the way you actually read/pronounce them could be different. (Example: Êúà can be read as ""tsuki"" or as ""gekkan"" both meaning ""month"" - just a matter of context which pronunciation.)

But the syllabularies are relatively easy and fun, if you're into that kinda thing. There's hiragana (used for particles, conjugations, and sometimes as a guide for the correct kanji readings/pronunciations), and then there's katakana (used for loan words).

So, ""Mary"" in katakana is „É°„Ç¢„É™„Éº (me ah ree). Olivia is „Ç™„É™„É¥„Ç£„Ç¢„ÄÄ(oh ree vee ah) or „Ç™„É™„Éì„Ç¢ (oh ree bee ah, if I preferred that-- the ""v"" sound doesn't really exist in Japanese so a lot of people will pronounce it as a ""b"" anyway).

/random nerdery

Korean writing is also kinda neat. It's an alphabet, but then you combine them into a single character to form syllables...like „Öé  is h, and „Öè is a, but you combine them into one character Ìïò to form the syllable ""ha,"" up to four letters. I don't have a very good grasp on the exact formations yet though, like if you were gonna type hangook you could make a ""han"" character and a ""gook"" character, or you might make a ""hang"" character and an ""ook"" character, and I don't know the rules for why one vs the other.

/even more random nerdery",1664582478

"KnowingBetter","t5_3gemk","Sorry for the thread necromancy, but when I read the ""Starship Troopers"" book back in November 2021, I came upon a bit that might interest you about this: Johnny Rico mentions offhand that the Terran Federation grew out of a set of veterans' councils in the aftermath of WWIII. These councils started enforcing their own order, even against other veterans.

Heinlein, writing in the context of the end of World War II, *must* have known about the [Freikorps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freikorps) \- the original German veterans' councils that sprung up in the German Reich at the end of the Empire, and which crushed the November Revolution of 1918. These were veterans' councils that really *did* enforce their own order, even against other veterans. Commanders in the Freikorps, such as Ernst R√∂hm, later organized the Sturmabteilung as part of the Nazi party.

When I read this back in November, I genuinely wasn't expecting this connection. But that's what came up when I realized that the veterans' councils were, essentially, Space Freikorps.",1664582479

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

Horner already said as much by responding that Red Bull submitted their financial reports to the FIA back in March and according to them they were under the cap. That means the FIA and Red Bull used different methods to calculate the costs, which will result in some courtcase over the interpretation of the rules that will take years before it sees an outcome, followed by appeals and even more appeals, ending in a settlement nobody gets to know the details about in about 5 or 6 years time.",1664582481

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","no, my recommendation is to get a bike and learn how to ride it without stalling. my advice was twin cylinder bikes are harder to stall than say 4 cylinder bikes.

if you like sportbikes and REALLY want to learn on one. most are single cylinder or twin when small engine capacity like up to 400 ish. the Yamaha R3 is a twin for example, with usually around 6second 0-60mph times and can break the legal speed limit in most countries (85-90mph)

its plenty fast and powerful enough, but not too powerful. itll get good economy especially if ridden chill.

&amp;#x200B;

if you are going to go automatic, any 250-300cc **scooter** from a known brand will be fine. ie: not from china, maybe avoid Italian brands just incase too.

scooter example: [https://gyazo.com/e6b6247cdfe5942fadb11418fc0fbbea](https://gyazo.com/e6b6247cdfe5942fadb11418fc0fbbea)

by scooter i mean something like this.

&amp;#x200B;

if it only took you a day or so riding a little to not stall, then get a manual bike. R3 or whatever competitor would be my vote.

&amp;#x200B;

when or if you move up into or progress to a bigger bike 500-700cc range, get a sports tourer, not a sportsbike/superbike. then after that get whatever you want.",1664582482

Pretty much anything that isn't SAED you can cancel the recovery of into a sidehop or a morph slash, which has a guardpoint at the very beginning of its animation that you can extend by using the Switch Skill, Counter Morph Slash. And, if you do block something, you can cancel that into SAED after the monster finishes attacking.

Stuff like SAED CB or Great Sword requires you to understand exactly when and how you can punish each monster's moves with your biggest attack, which isn't easy and can take a while to learn, especially with monsters you haven't fought before, or monsters that are extremely aggressive. Really, even something like Charge Blade ultimately isn't *so* complex that learning the weapon is the biggest issue.

It's a lot of fucking work and have they been what? Like not paying attention? It's so frustrating. I can't find a man who has any idea about who he is or what healthy boundaries or communication looks like. It's absolutely fucked.

Then you come to find out months later that they are completely fucked in the head or an actual sociopath or just completely dead inside and faking everything all along.

Again, this is what I think would be the reason for the ""hate"".


As for me, I wouldn't date a bi guy simply because I can't even consider the idea of sexualizing a woman, it just feels disgusting for me, and I think not being able to share this kind of interest with someone who's bi is a big deal. Like, one of the big things I do with my husband is talk about hot guys we saw during our day to day life. Yes, I can do it with a bi guy too, but he would end up feeling discouraged to talk about attractive women, and I don't want them to feel that way.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok so there is a broader picture here. And honestly lots of people may disagree with me or prove me wrong which is fine. The way i always comprehended it is that the people need arms in case the government ever became tyrannical. (Which is in the constitution ""Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness."") If we physically can't fight effectively with our government (if it ever comes to it) what stops them from breaking the constitution and doing stuff that purely benefits themselves. I know the government is already doing that, but their fear of public retaliation is something that I believe keeps them in reasonable terms. That's why I believe guns are important. It's not because me likey to shoot me gun for fun. But it's a preventative measure. I think a better way to look at this issue isn't by taking the guns away but it's to offer better mental support to people. Lots of things in this world suck the humanity out of us.                                Now I'm not an expert so if I'm wrong. I'm wrong. But that's how I've always viewed it.",1664582483

Ah of course, the lizard CIA are behind everything that isn't RT right?

&gt; When Ukrainians stop being Banderites maybe we will stop calling them nazis

Ah yes, calling Ukrainians nazis when less than 5% of their parliament is owned by nazis and far right people get less than 3% of the vote.

And this is coming from a fucking monarchist. Thought you'd be cheering on the far right.

&gt; Ill just post my comment from another sub. You can find evidence of Bandera and Nazi worship everywhere and the odd nazi symbol has slipped into photos published by Zelensky

Comment doesn't exist. Even your fellow rightwingers aren't putting up with your Putin worship apparently. At least they have standards.

By everywhere, I'm assuming you mean the few cherrypicked pictures which are edits half the time anyways? [Look at all those disgusting Nazi Ukrainians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group)... oh wait, this is Putin's private militia!

"ndp","t5_2qm8o","&gt;if this language isn't worth learning than none other than english because it's ranked 5th!!

It's literally only applicable in France basically and Quebec and Africa. People don't really immigrate to Quebec (great house prices( and the rate is tiny. African countries are the ones people are leaving and have no purpose to move to for basically any Canadian, people escape those countries to come here. You're obviously speaking from bias but better languages include 

-Spanish (far more international)
-Chinese (extremely large economy and great for intl business)
-potentially japanese, a last bastion of first world nations with cheap rent and good if you already have a job outside

French is basically only good for France and nowhere else being really applicable. The numbers mean nothing if it's in colonized nations being actively oppressed by France that steals money from them on a regular basis.

I don't expect congratulations I just ignored class and didn't care because the information doesn't matter, I'm fine. Made 200k last year and have no intention of learning forced french. I'm saying English people are forced to take like half a decade of forced french lessons (nearly useless) 

Switch the subject all you want. I didn't learn it DESPITE it being forced because I didn't care and that applies to other English students forced to learn a non useful language. Its about giving classes that merit care. Germany has an extremely good economy and working class rights and hence is useful but it's mostly just very easy to transition from English and interesting.

The reason we learn french is due to Quebec forcing billingualism on the entire country. Tbh I think you're going to make your own narrative again and I'm starting to question explaining anything at this point when this is obviously not going to change your mind. üòê

You're caught up on yourself being wrong about English students being forced to learn french only to transition to insults because I didn't care about a class that vast majority don't care for lmao

My whole point is that your original point is that billingualism is so Englishmen can force quebecors to speak English or some shit when it was mostly to appease french people. Hell the main act that really spread it in 1988 was to allow french people to preserve language and culture and to be less isolated. Its to help the french. Now they can go everywhere else in Canada and read the shit that vast majority of people who live there can't read at all.

"Greyhounds","t5_2sqf9","I work in rescue/rehab and also have my own grey with corns, personally I think that understanding the cause is a really key component of treatment. A lot of corns are due to uneven gait putting weight down through one foot more than others, so you can remove the corn but it will keep reoccurring without physio to address the underlying problem; others can be caused by grit but once you remove the grit you have scar tissue which always needs to be managed otherwise the hard spot will callous and corn. 

Our lad‚Äôs corn is caused by scar tissue. We excised it when it grew too large to manage, and now we use boots and daily application of bee propolis (this peels away the top layers of the corn and helps to stop it growing). This works perfectly for us and he walks totally pain free, no limping :)

I‚Äôm very wary about the flexor tenotomy surgery that is growing in popularity. Vets suggest it because it immediately removes the pressure on the effective area, but if the problem was a gait issue you‚Äôre just switching the issue to another toe. There‚Äôs also no long term studies on the impact to gait or other areas of the body, which makes me uncomfortable.",1664582486

Then I lucked out with the Reddit search and managed to find some comments that were indeed posted, about 381mm guns and comparisons to the Bismarck and all that. So it did happen, and for this you get an apology from my end.

Rule by law, in contrast, connotes the instrumental use of law as a tool of political power. It means that the state uses law to control its citizens but tries never to allow law to be used to control the state.

"unrealtournament","t5_2rqzh","UT 2003, specifically, holds a special place in my heart for the sole reason that it was the game which got me into the hobby of building PCs. 

My dad brought home an old computer from his office and had a family friend upgrade it for us. He decked it out with a 3dfx Voodoo 3 graphics card, 512MB of RAM, an AMD Athlon CPU (I forget which one), and a whopping 40GB hard drive. He loaded it up with a bunch of games as well; notably Quake, Delta Force Land Warrior, Time Commando, Diablo 2, StarCraft, Unreal Gold, and others.

Of course, I was too young to fully appreciate what I had at the time. All I knew is that I had this sick PC that could handle nearly everything I could throw at it, until UT2003 came along. 

I had played a shitload of UT99 around then and I remember watching the show Arena on G4, which was a cable channel dedicated to video game culture at the time. They featured live esports matches of UT2003 and I remember being floored by the graphics and decided to download the demo to try out‚Ä¶ only to find the game wouldn‚Äôt even launch. My computer was not good enough and I became obsessed with finding out why.

I tried everything, including an upgrade to WindowsXP, all the way to finding a website with some really sketchy 3rd party drivers for my poor Voodoo 3 until I found one that ‚Äúworked‚Äù. Then I discovered overclocking and‚Ä¶ I killed my GPU. I convinced by dad to buy a sweet new Nvidia GeForceFX 5200 GPU (it‚Äôs the way the game is meant to be played after all, right?) and even then, the game was almost too much even at 800x600 resolution. 

I dug into the engine .ini files after discovering Tweak Guides and got so into fine tuning the game to my specs that tweaking became a game in and of itself. I was never able to get it run as well as those sick Alienware PCs of the time, but the learning process was addictive. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant just figured I‚Äôd share. The game itself wasn‚Äôt amazing compared to what UT2004 offered, but if it wasn‚Äôt for this game I don‚Äôt think I would have turned into the bonafide geek I am today hahaha",1664582489

There isn't a pipeline that connects use to the rest of the nation east of the rockies, so we don't have the ability to easily import raw or refined fuels.

Police harass them to get the names of their clients so sex workers can be hesitant to interact with the police. Clients are more shady due to the legal status which makes it harder to keep track of dangerous clients between sex workers. Sex workers and clients are both forced into more clandestine and subsequently riskier situations in order to avoid the police which increases the risk of violence. Since sex work is still presented as morally wrong, the police keep their anti-sex work attitudes and treat the women as lesser - such as in the case in Sweden where a woman being a sex worker was [used an excuse to take her children away](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eva_Marree_Kullander_Smith) because ""she lacked insight and didn't realize sex work was a form of self-harm"". 

Overall the laws are not that good for sex workers which is why they generally don't want them. The phrase ""she lacked insight and didn't realize sex work was a form of self-harm"" is a good microcosm of how it comes across. A bunch of academics and moralists that think they know better than the silly sex workers, trying to force them out of business under the guise of protecting them while in fact making their lives more dangerous.

I value my sleep so i go to bed about 30 minutes after she does. I get roughly 7-8 hours a night, broken up in 2 blocks, usually my first block is 4-6 hours so i find as long as i get a good solid 4 hours in the night somewhere im good, I'm ok if the rest is broken up. That first 6-8 weeks was a marathon for sure and i was exhausted but my body found a way to manage and i think the mum instict kicks in that you don't care as much as long as baby is ok.

"AutismInWomen","t5_3yx96k","I also experience this, but it's something I'm trying to work on in myself. For me, it's that I understand what the autistic person is trying to say/do, I can see how the allistic people are misinterpreting it or not understanding, so I try to act as kind of a translator so everyone's on the same page and no one gets hurt.

This is exhausting, harmful to myself, harmful to the autistic person, and usually doesn't work. This behaviour is informed by my life experiences that acting ""normal"" prevents pain. Thing is, now I'm an adult, I can avoid people who dislike autistic behaviour much more easily than at school, so I need to learn not to cater to those allistics.

As for the other autistic person, my urge to explain them to others is really infantilising and is me subconsciously trying to get them to mask. I may think I know what they're trying to say, but I'm not a mindreader. I might attempt to integrate them into a group conversation bc thats what's socially expected, but they might not want to talk.

I think a lot of this comes from internalised autism-specific ableism and self hatred. So much of what I find ""cringe"" in others is something I've forced myself to suppress over time. It's painful to see in others and it's painful to see in myself. But the more I avoid it, the more I end up hating those parts of myself. They're a part of who I am, I can't get rid of them (bc if I could, 10yrs of trying would've worked by now), so I need to learn to be accepting of and compassionate towards those traits - in myself and in other autistics.",1664582491

"classicwow","t5_3eb8a","It's the quests, questie just helps finding locations.  The most recent example I can think of is the quest in grizzly hills where we take buddy(?) out to knock out a troll.  The quest just says to take him down there to knock out a troll, I did that but he wouldn't knock one out.  He also kept dying because he would just charge off and attack like he was on aggressive.  This meant I had to run back to the camp, sometimes wait for him to respawn, and run back to the quest area to try again.  After a while I realized he had a sap ability on his pet bar that wasn't mentioned and that was all that was needed.  The whole time I saw other players doing the same thing, so a lot of people apparently get stuck on this too.

That's the kind of stuff that bothers me with several of the northrend style quests.  They give you vague instructions, like go southwest and let bud knock out a troll, and have some jank to them, like bud running around aggressively, having a low health pool, getting himself killed, needing to run back to the camp to get him again, and him despawning for a bit after another player starts the quest.

They could improve this quest by capitalizing or parenthesizing sap in the description or something else to draw attention to it like it's an ability.  They could also have buddy called by a whistle or something that removes the need to run back to camp or wait with other players for his respawn.

I'm more of a fan of the old prewrath or post cata style quests.  Prewrath it's mostly just kill/collect which I enjoy for letting me just play my class without weird gimmicks and post cata I enjoy for having more polished gimmicks that don't needlessly take up time.",1664582491

It smells like cotton candy on me, so therefore I was not a fan. The really cheap cotton candy perfume by Body Fantasies is what it always reminded me of when I would wear it.

"vajrayana","t5_2uaj7","&gt;When and how do I make offerings

Generally this will be done *after* the empowerment. In the empowerments I've participated in a line typically forms and people will set their offerings near the empowering-lama (not hand it to them directly, but do as others do). After quickly setting the offering in its envelope down you then offer the kata (folded lengthwise/""hotdog style"") with the ""seam"" of the fold towards the lama which they'll then drape back over you. Depending on the situation they may embrace you or not, they may place their hand on the crown of your head and confer a blessing or they may not. It will vary by teacher, situation, environment, and frankly how many people are present.

&gt;if this means the Lama (as a result of empowerment) has become my Guru,

Yes, this person becomes one of your gurus and you both have mutual responsibilities to each other. Depending on the class of tantra and whether it's a *wang* or *jenang* will determine if or what samaya is made by the empowerment. If samaya isn't a subject you're very familiar with then I'd read about it on [studybuddhism.com](https://studybuddhism.com).

You very much may end up with a veritable laundry-list of gurus. It's not a problem per se, so long as you're clear on samaya and you're able to keep up your side of it.",1664582494

Also, throwing knives being tied to the dagger allowed you to throw a knife and launch into an attack. The throwing knives in AC2 are on their own weapon slot and you're weaponless as a result.

"Arcimoto","t5_3avk3","A subscription model would be ideal for me.  I own a FUV, and I have rented FUVs prior.  Subscription would be superior and preferrable to both for me.  Got that email that was sent out - put my thoughts in there, but for the record, this is what I assume is the situation:

&amp;#x200B;

* Arcimoto is clearly in the research phase of this idea.
* The insurance in subscription model would probably be born by the subscriber, similar to a lease.
* The rates would necessarily be far superior to a rental rate - but profitable for Arcimoto long-term.
* The maintenance in a subscription model would probably be born by Arcimoto.
* Flexibility for the user is a key advantage over a lease.  For instance, I plan to move twice in the next 12 months - once to a state that also supports Arcimoto vehicles, and once to another country that definitely does not.  Subscription would give me the flexibility to do that without waste.  It \*might\* also be coupled with a buy-back program that allows me to sell my lightly used vehicle to Arcimoto, if they want it, in exchange for subscription credits.
* The already large fleet of rental and demo vehicles would be ideal for use in a trial of the subscription model - and some of the rental staff might be well-suited to this work as well.
* Fleet subscription vehicles might be popular as well.
* The opportunity for better customer experience is there - the challenge is to find the profitable mix for Arcimoto as well.
* I totally support experimenting with this, at as low cost as possible.  

Keep the ideas and surveys flowing Arcimoto - now is a great time to see how the largest samples you can access react to new models.",1664582496

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Agreed, at least for early dates. I think the hatred for ghosting is partially a generational gap: pretty much all of my 20-something friends are used to ghosting and being ghosted and just see it as the normal way of things for the first few dates. Having someone just stop texting you after a date early on feels effectively the same as ""Sorry, I just wasn't feeling it."" The sentiment, as you say, is clear.  

I think ghosting only becomes unjustifiable (and unclear) several dates in, once there's an emotional connection (obviously, though, this is a grey area, and it's hard to pin down when, exactly, it becomes unacceptable). It's only after you have a real thing going and are really getting along that sudden radio silence leaves you like, ""What happened? What did I do?"" 

I think I and the young people I know are just accustomed to going into first/early dates with the understanding that communication is opt-in and not opt-out.",1664582497

3. Raiding villages gives barely any loot or roguery Xp but gives you big diplomacy losses and negative personality traits.
4. 90% of your roguery xp needs to comes from prison breaks.
5. Unless you're going to be a vassal (which defaeats the purpose of a bandit run?) you have no home unless you start your own faction so be prepared for frequent big siege defences (possibly a pro...)

also, sadly, few people care about trans girls and women who are abused. celebrities quarreling is more interesting to the masses.

remember the Kristen Stewart/Rupert Sanders cheating scandal? people are always asking why Kristen took the brunt, and misogyny did play a part‚Ä¶ but honestly I think the bigger element was that she was mega famous and in an extremely high profile relationship with Robert Pattinson, while Rupert Sanders was (and remains) pretty much a nobody. I always have to Google him because I can never remember his name.

anyway, I would like to take this opportunity to remind y‚Äôall that the goal of feminism is not for white women to get away with the bad behavior that white men get away with.

DOR should face social and legal consequences for his actions. that he hasn‚Äôt faced consequences doesn‚Äôt meant that people shouldn‚Äôt also criticize Olivia for her actions. her drama is on a totally different scale, obviously ‚Äî but she‚Äôs not above reproach just because somebody else did something worse.",1664582499

"MySoCalledLife","t5_2svdd","I love that they made sharon, the ""good girl"" the one who is actually having tons of the hottest sex, instead of rayanne. And that both are so sex positive was really progressive for the time. But it certainly makes it all the more curious when we learn rayanne isnt really having the whole sex experience. There is obviously more going on underneath.

When i was that age, i was so needy to be desired (well, i still am, but i was then too) and it meant that i usually was more focused on what the boy was experiencing, and would be too worried of not being desireable that i wouldnt really be paying enough attention to what *i* desired. I wonder if that happens to rayanne because she also uses sex sort of transactionally, in return for attention.

Or, and this is the most out-there wild and unsubstantiated theory, and i never ever considered this until recently and i highly doubt winnie holzman intended it, but what if rayanne is ace?  So the constant sex is like, overcompensating. Like how someone who is homosexual might test out sex a with the opposite gender out of obligation, confusion, a sense of fomo or pressure to fit in. She is trying and trying to have that thing media portrays, the intimacy, the pleasure, but for her those things just arent happening.",1664582500

Wheel: It is the round disc located on the external aspect of the machine. Axle: It is the rounded cylinder or rod-like part placed on the inside of the machine that is attached to the wheel and helps to promote movement.  


Treads require axles to turn wheels to move the treads which make contact with the ground but most definitely are under the device.  


Any machine using rotational motion to move either directly like the wheels in a mouse droid or to move the tracks/treads on a sand crawler are by definition, wheels.  


But even without our pedantic definitions perfect wheel examples are:

Last weekend, I met a guy (43) that has texted me everyday this week, and we are meeting for dinner and drinks Tuesday. In August, I met two guys in the same evening, both asked for my number. One guy was my age, while the other was only 38. What worked to my advantage‚Ä¶ I am lucky enough to be outgoing and can start a conversation easily. Pay attention to what they are eating or drinking, or what they are wearing. For example, the guy last week was wearing a college football jersey. I asked if he was a fan and it suddenly turned into a full blown conversation. 

My point here is to not worry about your age. Practice flirting and talking to strangers when out. You never know who you will end up talking to. Age is just a number, and not all men are out looking for Malibu Barbie.",1664582501

I remember thinking, ""Have you seriously not been listening this entire time?! Do you not remember the HOURS of discussion we've had over the past year?!""

Moving forward, however, I want you to consider what will you want. People in the older generation had been drilled with homophobia for a long time. They are slowly unlearning and relearning in the new era. All I hope that their only true object is to reconcile.


On the other hand, I don't want your true family to be hurt like you were. I don't want you to be a doormat. 


Maybe talk to a neutral third party like a therapist. Try to let go of your traumas slowly.

"Abortiondebate","t5_2trti","I'm in anthropology, so I'm probably not any closer than you :)

After reading it though, here are my thoughts:
- they've explicitly acknowledged that fetal pain, if it exists, is not going to be a relatable, self-reflective, sentient experience as we experience it. So your interlocutor is straight up wrong for deriving it - they explicitly state otherwise right in the abstract. 

They're unfortunately lacking a separate word for ""non-sentient experience"", so some of their speech is confusing. But essentially, what I gather is theyre trying to make the case that some type of non-sentient experience occurs after the ""wiring"" is complete, and that this non-sentient experience should be considered morally significant on its own. 

Which is frankly nonsense to me, because the activity in ""fetal pain"" is pretty much the same as the activity found in ""plant pain"". There's no apparent reason to me why that should be given more significance than what the pregnant person goes through.",1664582505

i never did try it when i *was* making them though. i'd usually just spritz some lime/lemon on top, and call it a day

for the few years that i was doing a paleo diet, it was pretty hard getting enough calories to just stay alive, let alone power me through my semi labor intensive job. so to start with: i'd chop up some protein, usually chicken, and tons of lettuce/leafy greens. 

then i'd just start adding stuff. i'd toss in walnuts, radishes, cucumber, fresh figs, raisins/craisins, raw broccoli crowns, diced fuji apple, fresh salsa, roasted salsa, green onion, celery, carrot shavings, diced avocado or guacamole, and fresh peppers.

i suppose i could've left some of those things out if i had just added a bit of oil, but i was pretty fixated on only eating whole foods, nothing processed, and no grains at the time. eventually i had to stop eating like that though, as it got really expensive. 

for example 450 grams of rice packs something like 1600-1800 kcals for like 1 usd. i'd have to spend a lot more on produce, to match the same amount of energy. my wallet just couldn't handle it. (i miss it though, it's the best i felt in my entire life.)",1664582506

"betterCallSaul","t5_2u05j","Chuck had an irrational and obsessive need to be in control of all situations constantly. He was such an ego-maniac that his obsession to control things manifested into a delusional allergy to electricity. Chuck‚Äôs measure of self worth wasn‚Äôt the good he did in the legal field, or the philanthropy his company engaged in. When his brother succeeded and his wife grew apart from him, Chuck‚Äôs narcissism and supply depleted and he turned, subconsciously, to controlling electricity. I believe Chuck‚Äôs EHS was a deep-seated rage that he couldn‚Äôt keep his wife, brother, or company under his yolk anymore. Case in point, his selfishness cost everyone around him dearly with the insurance debacle, and when the bad taste the left in everyone‚Äôs mouth got him shown the door, Chuck threw a suicidal pity party over it. The more of a loser chuck became, the more people who got tired of him, the worse his made-up condition got.

My head canon is that Jimmy took a couple grand at most, and Chuck‚Äôs older brother narcissist complex lied and slandered Jimmy to everybody to keep him subservient.",1664582507

"CNC","t5_2ralu","Well, I am generalizing and I should have been clear about that when I mad the post.  What I am starting to believe is the technology is so capable that it does seem like there is no area that is safe.  

About 5 years ago the company I was working for was testing a system for finance - I am not sure what functions of that team this system took care of (accounts payable, sales, inventory dollars, etc...) but from what I was told it basically could do the work of an entire department (about 50 people) with no mistakes, with amazing speed, waaaay lower cost, etc... 

So I started paying much more attention to the technology.   I found one instance of AI being used to design an automobile and the results were stunning.  We know that it is getting used in medicine, for example it is now used to detect certain kinds of cancers and beats the best doctors by a large margin!  

In another example it was being deployed in a sort of ""high end"" kitchen to work as a chef.  The thing that made it special from what I remember were the sensors - it could weigh, see, hear of course but it could also taste and smell!!!  And apparently this thing could cook up dishes that 5 star chefs from around the world were making with perfect accuracy.

And look at what AI has done to the artworld!  AI is now writing songs, movies, making videos, making still pictures of all sorts of mind-blowing stuff...  really trippy stuff in many occasions.

So then I was thinking what are the jobs that are most safe?  I might guess the ones that do require actual handling of things that are non standard in size, shape, location, or working on old legacy equipment where again the equipment would not be designed for robotic service, stuff like that.  

There is the saying ""do you see the glass as half empty or glass half full"" I see the glass is half full... full of piss!!!  So when I look towards the future I don't see a happy, safe, productive society I see a massive divide coming, one worse than any ever before as the technology that we now have is a great way to keep all of us under surveillance and/or control.  And why not, that just seems to be what humans do.  We had a good run though!  Had a middle class for the better part of a century.  

What are your thoughts?  What have you seen or read about?  Or do you think it is overblown?  

I just don't trust humanity, people love power and comfort and once they get it they only want more.  I think people can be good and that many do want to be good but I also think just as many are not so good and I don't think that it takes too many evil doers in power to fuk everything up for all of us - I mean look at wtf is happening in Europe right now!!!  And look at the effect on Germany, one of the most advanced countries in the world   
 \- they might be facing a winter without energy to heat their homes... or if they do have it I have heard that it will cost them 3 to 5 times more than last year!  WTF!",1664582508

Narrated Salim's father:

The Prophet (Ô∑∫) sent Khalid bin Al-Walid to the tribe of Jadhima and Khalid invited them to Islam but they could not express themselves by saying, ""Aslamna (i.e. we have embraced Islam),"" but they started saying ""Saba'na! Saba'na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another)."" Khalid kept on killing (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive. When there came the day then Khalid ordered that each man (i.e. Muslim soldier) should kill his captive, I said, ""By Allah, I will not kill my captive, and none of my companions will kill his captive."" When we reached the Prophet, we mentioned to him the whole story. On that, the Prophet (Ô∑∫) raised both his hands and said twice, ""O Allah! I am free from what Khalid has done.""",1664582508

It is also mostly about romance and relationships, especially the first book, so if he doesn't like romance I don't think he'll get very far.

For other vampire book recommendations, The Saga of Darren Shan is about a young boy who becomes a half-vampire so he might like that. It does have some graphic violence, and I haven't actually read all the books so I can't entirely vouch for the series.

There's also the Night World series by L. J. Smith. Not all of them are about vampires, and most of them are about romance, but I liked them a lot and don't remember anything that would be particularly inappropriate for a child who has already seen some violence and sexuality.",1664582509

They effectively fought as mercenary or private armies, regardless of their own nationality. In German-speaking countries, the first so-called Freikorps (""free regiments"", Freie Regimenter) were formed in the 18th century from native volunteers, enemy renegades, and deserters.

"MakeNewFriendsHere","t5_2vfcm","I did my Bachelor Degree in Commerce. This wasn't exactly the course I wanted to but somehow had to make a decision.

Ofcourse this things are not gonna give me any return in kind anytime sooner but foundation is the fundamental requirement. Further  I definitely have a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction doing so. You can say that am living a dream   I once thought of. 

I would say, do not choose a course because you want to get job as soon as you complete your college.

"EDF","t5_2sm2c","I'd say it's worth grabbing for 20$ or so. Never felt it deserved a mixed overall score, it's a solid game that seems to suffer from not being like other EDFs. In some ways I'd call that a good thing in having tighter gunplay and great enemy design. In others a bad thing, having less weapon variety, shorter missions, and putting many things like vehicles and most of your HP regen behind consumables. But I definitely enjoyed my time with it and want to do another playthrough later.

I think my biggest criticism would be that most weapons are extremely niche options. You want a general use pump shotgun? Best I can do is one that fires pellets in a vertical line and has a two shot mag. How about a rocket launcher for some splash? Either you get peanuts for damage or spend years reloading it. Sniper rifle to shoot down air targets? You either get a light DMR with a decent mag size or a single shot mag and twenty second backpack/passive reload. There's almost zero weapons that I could classify as 'moderate' or 'generalist' options, and with only two weapon slots that means I feel forced to ignore most of them.",1664582512

"driving","t5_2qpsr","Generally, I would be very skeptical of any business that forces you to pay large sums of money in cash and upfront. It creates all kinds of problems and can easily lead to theft should the person either just take the money and not provide anything, or provide extremely substandard services for that price.

Seeing as how this is a California-based driving education school, I would highly recommend you look around for some more options within your area. I took a look at some of the prices and they look very pricey. When I was learning to drive, I paid for a $650 driving package that included; a 5-hour pre-licensing course, two 2-hour lessons, one 1-hour lessons before the test, car rental for the test, and all fees and scheduling paid for by the school.

The website also has some red flags, at least for me. When a company feels the need to show you positive reviews from other ""customers"" first, it definitely feels like they're trying to hide something.

I say this to everyone that is looking to learn how to drive. There are a lot of driving schools out there and some of them will have a package consisting of ""unlimited lessons and car rental"". **Never buy this package. You do not know how many classes you need until you get behind the wheel.** Get a smaller package and test the waters with how you feel behind the wheel. If you need more lessons, then pay for more, but paying some $3,000 for ""unlimited lessons"" is just begging for you to get ripped off when you pass your test after only have 2-3 lessons. Always go for a smaller package that is within your price range and go from there.",1664582512

"LoveNikki","t5_3l0ds","Well said, that's mostly accurate!   


We got the lore of how Neva got free from the Lord in the hell event (Sea of Trees I think?) that gave us the Daybreak Oath suit.  Basically, she was shackled to the Lord's faction through some form of vampirism she was infected with.  She has been hiding it the entire time but apparently she had (at least when younger) a percent chance to go 100% feral during the right part of the moon cycle.  She was controlled through that and also through emotional manipulation (I believe she was a homeless child when the Lord found her).

Unbeknownst to her, Royce had figured out what was going on and because he's both much smarter and more compassionate than the front he's been putting up, he figured out how to free her from the vampirism so it would be her own choice how she treated him.  The Lord had suspected something going on though and had sent other people along with Neva in case Neva didn't go through with it, so there was still a fight and Royce got wounded, but he didn't really care because Neva was finally free.  

So basically the event now is her dealing with the emotional aftermath of all of that and deciding that she wants to stay.  I'm really happy they explored those emotions and that there is hope for her to finally be happy. 

As for who the Lord is, I think the lore from the most recent hell contradicts that theory because apparently Nanari was possessed by a totally different character we haven't seen before?? But I'm upset about that because I thought the idea of Nanari being the Lord would have been a really excellent plot twist.",1664582512

"lotrmemes","t5_2v0i1","You're absolutely right that there isn't a lot of text about the Shire's politics, but I disagree about land ownership/class issues; the Gamgee's are clearly tenants on Baggin's land. And there is definitely a social caste structure, with the various Bagginses and Tooks and Brandybucks all holding significantly higher social class than ""working"" hobbits.

Bilbo is reading and writing and learning Elvish; Sam and the Old Gaffer are planting potatoes and trimming the verge. That's certainly a society with classes (even though its portrayed as a much more equitable, fair, and enjoyable society than any real-world analogue, including Tolkien's imagined ideal Oxford countryside!)

But as to your last point, you can absolutely read all sort of political allegories into the operation of the Shire if you want!

If you were using an IC-based, THX-like amp without suitable power (\~2W or better) you probably weren't driving them well enough - not from a *quantity* of power output aspect, but from a *quality* of power aspect.

The Quebec Conservatives get ~15% of the vote and only 1 seat (Bernier's old riding). The QS and PQ each get ~10% of the vote with the QS getting ~10 seats and the PQ getting 1 seat. 

Quebec then needs to suffer another 4 years of Legault as he mismanages the economy, takes on even more debt despite being handed a balanced budget in 2018, and causes Quebec to be more divided than we have been in decades.

"WoWs_Legends","t5_ogkyd","Okay I will break down the example for you. 

First up are commander archetypes. Each class of ships have two base game archetype commanders for them. For BBs that is typical a dispersion archetype who have skills that influence accuracy and brawler/survivability archetypes who help in close quarters engagements and damage mitigation. 

For IJN BBs the dispersion archetypes are Takagi who is a base game commander and ARP Kirishima who was a commander from the Arpeggio of Blue Steel crossover event. Typically these crossover event commanders are clones of an archetype commander with an unique skill. 

An additional note ARP is typically used to denote that a commander came from Arpeggio of Blue Steel and AL is used to denote the commanders from Azure Lane. In the Azure Lane event this is important as these commanders have the same name as ships so it helps denote which you are specifically talking about. 

Inspirations are additional skills you can take. Kondo specifically helps reduce surface detection on BBs. Thus with Kondo inspirations to the commander the ships they are on are stealthier from his effect. 

There are also groups of different commanders who often show up on a style of build. Using a BB example are accuracy impacting commanders. There are two types to this AL Scharnhorst influences dispersion. This means that she reduces the overall area in which the shells can land. There are also grouping influence commanders. What they do is keep shells more tightly packed together. Think of it like a choke on a shotgun as when you fire a turret in a ship you are launching multiple projectiles. A grouping influence will help tighten that spread up. 

Concealment and Aiming Systems are both modules. These are things that can be equipped to a ship that have can change certain properties of the ship. There are currently a maximum of four different mod slots each with their own unique pool of modules to choose from. Different slots become available at different tiers. For tech tree ship it goes by the following mod slot 1 at T3&amp;3, mod slot 2 at T5, mod slot 3 at T6 and all 4 mod slots at T7 and higher. This can change when premiums are factored I  as some gain all 4 mod slots at T3. 

Camo works similarly to WoT. Here though there are different effects. There are -4.5% varieties for surface detection range, incoming fire dispersion that reduce the chance of shells to hit the ship and a combination of the pair. In addition to that there are also a variety of -3% combination camo. These are all consumable items. 

You can also craft permanent camo out of these camos. To do this you need paint. You gain paint by trading consumable camos for it. These camos have four grades that go from lesser concealment and incoming fire dispersion values to a maximum of -4.5%. So while a permanent camo might start off weaker after they reach grade IV they are the same value as the best possible consumable camo without requiring the expenditure of said consumable. The game throws out a lot of camos so I wouldn't worry too much about running out of camos but I'd also suggest not creating a permanent camo for every ship at the start. Save it for favourites as for newer players resources are tighter and you might want to not have as much tied up in one ship if you aren't going to be playing it. 

Finally there are dispersion formulas. Each nation has a special dispersion formula that impacts the size of area that shells can land in. In the case of IJN BBs their formula allows for them to have a tighter area that their shells can land in at longer ranges when compared to that of other nations. 

Hopefully this stuff helps. There are countless guides that you can also look up on this sub that can go into more detail. I'd also recommend Ask the Turtle Wednesday threads as you can get a lot of helpful information. I will also drop you a link to the [Discord](https://discord.gg/wowslegends) as there is a lot of helpful information found there. Finally I'd recommend checking out www.wowsbuilds.com as this has a lot of ship info and community builds that can be quite valuable to know of.",1664582515

**Post Title**: Looking for a change in pace from historical dramas

**Post Body**:

Looking for a change of pace for now.

The last 4 dramas I watched were ‚Ä¶ Kingdom, Mr Sunshine, The Red Sleeve and just finished Mr Queen 

They were all excellent but I think it‚Äôs time to be a bit more current 

Was thinking of taking a go to slice of life for a bit‚Ä¶. Was looking at the Reply series .. i understand it‚Äôs 3 ‚Äúseasons‚Äù so what would be the best way to watch them?

Or if there‚Äôs other good slice of life recommendations I‚Äôm open.

"Pathfinder_Kingmaker","t5_idyrj","You don't have to respec your character. At the end of the day Wizard is still a plenty powerful class if built well. In fact, I'd argue that it's better than Sorcerer for a newer player because you don't have to know ahead of time what spells are useful in the context of this game. You can get new spells very easily after a certain point in progression, experiment, and figure out what works. Or just ask us if you prefer. Abjurer wouldn't have been my first choice of specialization school, but Dispel Magic/Greater can be very valuable in this game - many of the tougher enemies come pre-buffed, and become a lot easier to deal with if you can strip some of their buffs off them.

A lot of utility spells from tabletop aren't here because they just don't work in this setting. Coming up with creative solutions to problems is hard to implement in a computer game. It's just the nature of the format, for better or worse.

Most of the enemies have significantly inflated base stats compared to tabletop pathfinder. This means their saves will be high and their spell resistance will be high. Expect to spend most of your early feats boosting your spell DCs and your spell penetration if you want your spells to land reliably.

Most enemies who aren't cultists (translation: most of the enemies that pose an actual threat to you past Act 1) will have resistance to all types of energy damage and immunity to poison and electricity. Keep this in mind. You'll eventually have the option to take a special ability to override resistance and immunity for a single element. This is basically a requirement if you want to be an effective blaster. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about the poison immunity.

The number of encounters you're expected to get through between rests is *dramatically* higher than tabletop. You'll have to be very stingy with your spell slots early on, which makes ""linear fighters quadratic wizards"" even more pronounced than normal. But if you hang in there, you can still become a wrecking ball by high levels. There are also special abilities you'll gain access to that can give you a lot more spell slots, which are highly recommended for full casters.",1664582517

If Carlsen funded with millions of his own money research of chess cheating, I could take him seriously about his concern for sanctity of chess more seriously. But without that research, without that investment, 99% of all cheating cases (except for meme cases like Rausis-caught-in-the-bathroom) will basically be based on dubious evidence that would probably get thrown out of any courtroom.",1664582518

You misunderstand. I see no evidence that they could have done better -- since January 2021 -- with the hand that they were dealt. I do believe that we can deal them *a better hand* in the future by electing more Democrats (specifically, to the US Senate).

&gt;...we‚Äôll have to seek alternatives right?

By all means!

I'm always open to alternatives...as long as it isn't this half-baked bullshit:

&gt;...[1.] more aggressive policies to help the working class, [2.] stop listening to ‚Äúmoderates,‚Äù [3.] zero capitulation with republicans, and [4.] reduce reliance on corporate donors 

&gt;Prove to the American working class that democrats are on their side and make their lives better.

...because:

1. Claiming that they should do more with the power that they have *when there is zero evidence that they could have* is absurd.
2. Attempting to gain or exercise political power, in a democracy, by shrinking your coalition is absurd.
3. (You never explained what you mean by this. I assume it is just empty rhetoric.)
4. Democrats unilaterally turning down campaign donations while Republicans don't, as a strategy for gaining and exercising political power, is absurd.

An attorney will probably advise him to take a deal of giving up his paternal rights in order to avoid having to deal with the late child support, having to pay the current child support, and having to pay additional fees before going before a judge and getting utterly fucked. A judge can't force him to give up his paternal rights unless abandonment can be proven. I'm not sure what the requirements of that would be since he has maintained some contact despite it being inconsistent, so he might not fall in line. If he hasn't ""abandoned"" him though, he'll owe more than he can ever afford to pay.

So this dude will either go into spiraling debt to be spiteful and hope someone takes pity on him and it pays off in the end or immediately take the deal and try to come back into ""his son's"" life when he gets older and spit poison in his ear, like saying mom and dad threatened to ruin OOP's life to give up custody and forced him away.

"knifemaking","t5_2to7v","Yes some reinforcing pins would be very good idea, but I don't know how to drill them so they match perfectly and that's why I didn't proposed it as an idea. 

Another way would be to weld or braze a threaded rod to the tang , drill the wooden piece, put it on and fix it with a nut, then hide the hole where the nut lies with a wooden plug.

**All posts must include your age in the title** before we can post them on r/Selfies.  This post we didn't see your age in the title so we removed it. The bad news, on Reddit **you can't edit the title of a post** so this post can't be saved.  You can however **make a new post that includes your age** in the title.  If you are over 18, and don't want to put that exact number, don't worry, ""Over 18"" is just fine, but you have to have some age in there before your post will go up on our wall.  

Now if you think this is a pain and why do you have to do this, it's because you aren't verified here at r/Selfie.  When a user verifies with us, we set the Over or Under 18 flair for them, and they never have to put their age in a title again.  This could be your life if you're interested. Just see our Wiki on Verification and you'll have spiffy new flair in no time!  https://www.reddit.com/r/selfie/wiki/verification

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","I never had an actual plan.

I moved out twice. First when I was 15, my father kicked me out and I started living on the streets. I used a gym shower and spent a sizable amount of time in the library. After a while I broke into my deceased grandma's house and started living there for a couple of months, since there were light and running water. Economically I didn't do so good but it was enough to scrape by, and when I didn't have money for food my friends would bring leftovers or buy me a little bit. Eventually my family (father included) moved in with me, and that's all.

Then I moved out when I was 20. I moved to a different region I never visited before, I spent the first month in an inn and then moved with some people I met in the new city shortly after. 
Since I was sharing a flat with other students the rent was pretty cheap. I survived using my savings and then doing odd jobs, but I ended up coming back home after a year or so.

Overall, I never had an actual problem. Nowadays I'm saving again and the moment my brother becomes a legal adult I'll probably move to a different city with him so he can go college, but I don't really planned anything in advance. I'm currently the GC, so I guess I'll probably would have help in case anything happens.

Overall I'd say moving out isn't something to worry over too much, at least short/mid-term.",1664582520

Bought a treadmill. Did 30 min walk/jog on it monday-friday before work. Then busted out my old elliptical and started doing 15 mins on it after work mon-fri. At the same time i started eating only a cereal bar for breakfast. A slimfast shake with added banana slices for lunch, and then a sensible 500-700 cal dinner, and only eat 10a-6p (not to fast; but to stop me from snacking at all gd hours). I went from fast food 3-4 times a week to maybe once (i have kids). Got down to 260 by May. 
Then I got a rowing machine in June. I do that 30 mins a day at lunch m-f. That rower changed my entire body. It builds everything stronger, full recommend. Also I try to do a 10 mile bike ride or 6 mile walk once every other weekend just to get outside. I do have some hiccups. Some pizza, some burgers, wings, beer, hey i like food, but ive cut it waaaay down. Normally ive been burning 1500-3000 cals a day while eating 800-1200 a day. Goal was 240 by my 45th bday in August. Now down to 233 and still losing. New goal is 215. 

Oh yea, Also i weigh myself on my digital scale daily (it auto tracks my weight on an app), but i only look every saturday morning, so I can see real change and not get discouraged by some stupid 2 lb gain.

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Where can I find the solution to AP Computer Science A lab questions?

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

"askdentists","t5_38bow","NAD 

I've also got killer toothaches at the moment as I've got huge cavities and here's some things that help me 

Sleep sitting mostly up! I normally make sure my body and head is propped up, that helps reduce the pain when trying to sleep 

Take pain meds like paracetamol and ibuprofen. If those don't work, paramol is good! And if paramol doesn't work then the strongest you can get above that is co-codamol but that's only for short term use, no more than 3 days in a row. I usually take 400mg ibuprofen and 2 paramols when i feel a toothache starting to get painful to try and tackle it fast 

Orajel max strength can help. Put a small lump of the gel on your finger and put it on the cavity and the gums and toofh around it, it doesn't take all the pain away but it helps reduce it until painkillers kick in 

Brush your teeth with sensodyne toothpaste as soon as you feel the pain coming on. Brush that particular tooth gently

Avoid sugar and sugary foods until Wednesday, those will trigger the pain. Avoid eating on that side to make sure you don't get food stuck in there

And if it gets awful then call an emergency dentist and beg them for an appointment if you can.",1664582522

I may not have as much as experience because my little one is only 3 1/2 months old but I definitely leave him in his bassinet, activity gym, or rocker chair when I need to take care of things. I also think this helps him build up independence, self soothing, and probably other benefits. I‚Äôll talk to him or sing him a song if I‚Äôm doing dishes or play nursery rhymes or classical music to keep him entertained. I don‚Äôt let him do this more than 20 minutes in one sitting though because I know it‚Äôs not good for his body/growth. Also, If I shower and he‚Äôs 10 feet away crying , I just let him cry but rush through the task so he‚Äôs not crying for too long. If that makes me a terrible parent, so be it.

The Justice Department on Thursday accused an Army doctor and a Johns Hopkins anesthesiologist of conspiring to provide the Russian government with medical information about U.S. soldiers and their relatives.  
  
The indictment names Jamie Lee Henry, an Army major at Fort Bragg who had a secret security clearance, and Henry‚Äôs spouse, Anna Gabrielian, a Russian-speaker who is affiliated with Johns Hopkins, according to a Hopkins webpage.  
  
They are charged with offering sensitive information to an undercover FBI agent who was posing as a representative of the Russian Embassy.  
  
The indictment says the FBI learned that Gabrielian had volunteered assistance to Russia through its embassy in Washington.   
  
  
During an Aug. 17 meeting in a Baltimore hotel room, Gabrielian told the undercover FBI agent ‚Äúshe was motivated by patriotism toward Russia to provide any assistance she could to Russia, even if it meant being fired or going to jail,‚Äù the indictment alleges.  
  
Gabrielian told the agent that she had reached out to the Russian Embassy by email and phone, offering Russia assistance from both her and her spouse, Henry, the indictment says.  
  
She told the agent that although Henry knew she was reaching out to the Russian Embassy on both their behalf, she did not mention Henry‚Äôs name in her interactions with the Russian Embassy, and so Henry could claim lack of awareness.  
  
The indictment refers to Henry as male, but Henry in 2015 went public as the first openly transgender Army officer. Marcia Murphy, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney‚Äôs office in Baltimore, said Henry referred to himself as a male in interactions with the undercover FBI agent.  
  
Later on Aug. 17, Gabrielian and Henry met with the undercover agent, the indictment says. According to the indictment, Henry described a commitment to assisting Russia and had looked into volunteering to join the Russian army after the conflict in Ukraine began, but Russia wanted people with combat experience and Henry did not have any. The indictment says Henry added, ‚Äúthe way I am viewing what is going on in Ukraine now, is that the United States is using Ukrainians as a proxy for their own hatred toward Russia.‚Äù   
  
On Aug. 31, according to the indictment, the FBI agent met Gabrielian and Henry at a hotel in Gaithersburg, Maryland, near Washington, D.C.  
  
Gabrielian gave the agent medical information about the spouse of a person employed by the Office of Naval Intelligence ‚Äî and highlighted a medical issue that Russia could exploit, the indictment says.  
  
Henry allegedly provided information on at least five individuals who were patients at Fort Bragg, including a retired Army officer, a current Department of Defense employee, the spouse of a U.S. Army veteran, and two spouses of deceased U.S. Army veterans.  
  
Court records say Gabrielian and Henry have been arrested ‚Äî it was unclear whether they have lawyers.  
  
The defendants face a maximum sentence of five years in federal prison on the conspiracy charge and a maximum of 10 years in federal prison for each count of disclosing health information.  
  
In a statement, a spokesperson for Johns Hopkins Medicine said, ‚ÄúWe were shocked to learn about this news this morning and intend to fully cooperate with investigators.‚Äù

"WarhammerFantasy","t5_2rv4g","Of course! Other folks have named some specific people, but let's zoom out a bit. 

For humans -- and for the moment we will focus exclusively on humans -- [Chaos](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos) is dangerous because it presents a *moral temptation* using *universal emotions*. Whether you live in the [Empire](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/The_Empire), [Bretonnia](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Bretonnia), or [Kislev](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kislev), you cannot escape [hate](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Khorne), [hope](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Tzeentch), [fear](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Nurgle), or [desire](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Slaanesh). Everyone can be a prisoner of their own vices.

It would be dishonest to ignore the geographical component, of course. Kislev, being closer to the [Chaos Wastes](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Wastes), faces a greater danger from direct exposure than the southern kingdoms of the [Old World](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Old_World), such as [Tilea](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Tilea) or [Estalia](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Estalia). Kislev has to deal with invasions of [Chaos Warriors](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Warrior) and [Marauders](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Marauder), as well the ever-present danger of [Warpstone](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Warpstone) dust carried on the winds. So Kislev faces a different set of dangers than their southern neighbors, but the people of Tilea and Estalia are not immune to the moral danger of Chaos. Kislev is a harsh land, while Tilea is a rich and comfortable one, but though the form of indulgence may vary between them, the nature of Slaanesh is consistent. Tilean [merchant-princes](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Merchant_Prince) may desire silks and wines while Kislevite [Boyars](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Boyar) dream of furs and [vodka](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Kislevian_Vodka), but both are equal prey to the Dark Prince.

Bretonnia has a built-in security mechanism thanks to the Grail Quest. The social, cultural, and religious structure of Bretonnia commits the ruling class to certain standards of behavior. No [Questing Knight](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Questing_Knight) becomes a [Grail Knight](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Grail_Knight) without the approval of the [Lady of the Lake](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake). However, this does not guarantee moral behavior on the part of [Knights Errant](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_Errant) or [Knights of the Realm](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Knights_of_the_Realm). Additionally, knightly rank and noble rank are not intrinsically linked, and thus [powerful individuals](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Bretonnian_Lord) can rule over the various regions of Bretonnia without having drunk from the [Grail](https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Holy_Grail). As such, even a Bretonnian Knight can fall -- being a young Errant gone astray, a powerful noble of the Realm caught up in the secular joys of rulership, or a Questing Knight who, despite a lifetime of lip-service to chivalry and honor, is just not worthy of the Grail and the Lady. 

So yes! Humans across the Old World and beyond can become Chaos Warriors, because humans across the Old World and beyond are all vulnerable to Chaos. It is probably easier for an Imperial or Kislevite convert to make it to the Chaos Wastes than a Bretonnian, Tilean, or Estalian, but who knows how many forgotten shrines lurk in dark places?",1664582524

"NDE","t5_2sapp","I've read quite a few NDE accounts in which experiencers ask the being who appears to them as Jesus why there are so many different religions. And I recall one answer as being along the lines that different people need different things, and at the end of the day it doesn't matter that much. What matters is love. But then some NDE experiencers experience hellish NDEs. I've read also that this separation from God is by choice. I can't recall any NDEs in which an experiencer talks about anyone being cast into eternal damnation by God. Even though the Bible contains such stories. So my take is that the Bible is a collection of books written in a certain context, for a certain time and place. People try to find relevance and wisdom and guidance in it now. But every day there are fewer people who feel like they want to do that, which is probably for the best. For me it's a sign of the spiritual evolution of people. I feel like NDEs and the wisdom gained from them are a steady presence in the human psyche, feeding in to our understanding of what reality is really like. It's all good that people disagree, as long as they don't commit harm. Conflict is inevitable in this reality. I just have to bring my best every day, dust myself off, and then continue on trying to understand life and do what I think is the right thing.",1664582525

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Her move is wrong because in GTO, you can fold in certain spots without being exploited. In this case J4 off is a pure fold, because she could have much better hands here. Garrett don‚Äôt know what she has, which means she could have a range of hands which is much more profitable than J4 here to call.

For example, if she has any Ax of clubs or hearts which is still a no pair hand, is a much much better hand to call with than J4. The math problem becomes how many hands should she call with, and for those hands what % should she call. She could fold 100% of J4 here because chance of J4 winning in this spot is basically 3%, as she doesn‚Äôt know Garrett‚Äôs hand. Note that even if she does know Garrett‚Äôs exact hand, she is still more likely to lose than to win, because more than half the remaining deck would give garrett a better hand than her‚Äôs. This spot becomes a call if she knows the exact hand, only because there are money in it in the previous street, which means she need to call off 100k to win 260k, giving her minimal 38% equity to call off profitably.

Let‚Äôs say if instead of J4 she has hands like JJ, J9 or even QJ, she could easily call and crush Garrett with much higher equity, resulting in Garrett losing.

So for this spot to be profitable, she literally need to know Garrett‚Äôs exact hand, which is why there is so much suspicion of cheating.

I am not saying she if cheated or not. I am trying to explain the mathematics behind why this is considered a bad move. This is regardless of ‚Äúmeta‚Äù, as literary no meta would have a call here. It is like in Pok√©mon, you shouldn‚Äôt bring 6 under levelled Magicarp to fight against 6 legendary, well balanced team. Is it possible for magicarp to win? Yes theoretically it is possible. But regardless of meta, bring magicarp is not a winning strategy. Therefore you can assume opponent not have 6 magicarp without fearing of being exploited.

There are things that are just bad.

Sure you might be able to find one or two videos of magicarp troll but they can never have more than 1% win rate. A bad strategy doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt win, it just mean that the expectation value is so negative you can safely ignore it. Sure it is funny to see the trolls, but they only troll other bad Pok√©mon players.

Back to poker, calling here is like bringing 6 magicarp who knows frail. It happened that opponent only brought Kyogre, lowered the magicarps to 1% with surf then magicarp frail critical hit, killing the Kyogre. Is it funny? Yes. Is it entertaining? Yes. Is it a viable strategy to winning long term? Absolutely not. Regardless of what teams you are up against.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;	Firstly, most of these claims are either lies or misattribution of evidence.

No they‚Äôre not.

&gt;	Secondly the bible containing some correct historical information does not make the whole thing true. The whole thing would need to be proven. If you use this line of reasoning you would have to believe that harry potter is real because it includes real places, or that spiderman is real because that includes real places.

What do you mean by ‚Äúproven‚Äù? What standard would the Bible have to meet to earn your approval?

Also: the authors of Harry Potter and Spider-Man make no claim their stories are ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

&gt;	Thirdly, the bible contradicts itself in certain places. If your claim is that the whole book is true, how could that happen?

Where are the contradictions?

&gt;	Morals are part evolved behaviour and part cultural.

Part evolved? ""Man descended from apes, therefore we must love one another."" (Vladimir Solovjev)

Part cultural? Does that culture include religion?

&gt;	If you believe that your morals come from the god described in the christian bible, then does that mean all actions not prohibited by the god in the christian bible are moral?

No. The prohibitions in the Bible are extrapolations of the greatest law, which is a *positive* obligation. 

‚ÄúTeacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?‚Äù Jesus declared, ‚Äú‚ÄòLove the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.‚Äô This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô

For example: pirating movies isn‚Äôt prohibited by the Bible, but it isn‚Äôt loving to copy another person‚Äôs work without permission. Hence pirating is morally wrong.",1664582525

"morbidquestions","t5_37wph","You want answers so that's what im going to give you or at least my point of view, before anyone says anything to me I want to clarify I have never hurt a child and never will, I hate being this and believe anyone who acts upon it deserves the full penalty, if you still hate me anyway I understand but at least try and see my point of view, also sorry I theres any spelling mistakes im terrible at grammar and am very tired but here's my comment:

To begin with to my knowlege I didn't become a pedo, some people think you get made a pedo by things like sexual abuse, I did grow up with a fucked up family tho and wasn't  taught anything properly so mybe, but all the evidence shows that your born as one, there's a video about it but apparently it's due to a crosswiring in the brain that causes the sexual instinct to activate when you see a child instead of the parental one, i do suffer from a number of mental problems so ultimately it is due to a messed up brain weather your born with one or if it gets made that way. 

For me it started of course with puberty when I first started getting attracted to people, as I got older tho i realised I was still attracted to younger people aswell, I am attracted to adults too luckily, there are some people who are exclusively attracted to kids, tho even if I do get with someone having kids is probably out of the question. As I grew up I had no way of knowing it wasn't normal until I found out what a pedo was, for a long time I denied it, the longer I did the worse my already bad mental health got, eventually tho i had to accept it and I fucking hated myself for it, if I wasn't depressed before I was know, I even came up with an elaborate suicide plot over the summer because my life wasn't going anywhere and I figured i had nothing left to live for I really believed the world would be a better place without me mybe it would be but the thing I hated the most was how easily i gave up, I really don't remember how, I didn't get any therapy or support or anything from anyone about what was going on and I certainly couldn't tell them but somehow someway I managed to get myself out of the pit, i dont what it was or if it was something I did but my mental health started getting better, I still wouldn't call it good now I have many other problems along with being a pedo but it's like to say its been on a steady increase, iv noticed myself getting better slowly but surely, the intrusive thoughts have got better and I stopped self harming afew months ago, I don't how iv done it all by myself, anybody going through this I highly advice you get a therapist I'm getting one soon hopefully it would be worth it, I know alot of people are worried that they might have to report you but if you think your a serious danger then please do whatever you have too. Sorry if iv strayed away from the question but I think this is important to be shared if anyone will even read it, iv barely sratched the surface of my experiences not that I think anybody would be interested in them. 

My message to any other pedos if your reading this is helping yourself is truly the best thing you can do yourself and others around you, it hasn't been easy for me but if you have the intent to get better and be a good person don't give up i believe in you, to the ones who do it and don't care your weak for giving into this evil disorder all the hate towards you is justified what you do can never be justified, if you know what your doing and what it'll cause but don't care your not a human anymore your just a creature, any consequences for it are your problem nobody will ever support you and you deserve all the guilt and shame you fee from it if you even have emotions anymore and mark my words you will be punished, you've slowed us from being properly treated because your actions fuel hate for us if we've done anything wrong or not, now I won't be like some people and go tell you to die but just think how much better things would be if you would've just been a little bit better and a little bit stronger. And my message to just anyone in genral reading this I'm sorry that this is a problem, please do not blindly hate because that never solved anything, if we worked toghethet to figure this out and treat it things would be so better, I know some people think it'd just be better to get rid of people us but that would be solving one problem not the problem, from what iv heard there is no cure but you never know what the future holds and mybe thinking like that is close minded, as a pedo my only wish for pedophilia is that one day no matter how long it takes we can figure this evil out and rid ourselves of it leaving it behind for good.",1664582527

"masseffect","t5_2rc19","Well, I gotta redress som presumptions here.  I‚Äôve been gaming for over 20 years, including FPS games, I just am not good at them. But I enjoy a lot of them. Halo I enjoyed the combat, Fallout, ME: Andromeda, Tom Clancy games of all flavors, Half-Life, etc. I‚Äôve played and enjoyed all these games combat. I never used explosive rounds in ME1, nor did I use powers other than the shield-breaking one. I played an infiltrator, sniper rifle with tungsten rounds and pistol with shredder rounds. So I wouldn‚Äôt say I was inexperienced with shooters, I‚Äôm just not good at them. I don‚Äôt have the reaction time and coordination for it. But that doesn‚Äôt usually stop me from enjoying it. With ME2 the combat feels like getting getting jostled and bumped into. Like the game is getting in my way. In ME1 the combat didn‚Äôt feel like that. 

For example, the cover mechanics feel super clunky. Especially when you try to run toward cover. The game half the time acknowledges that I pressed the button to get into cover and half the time it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôll run through gunfire to get to cover just to have Shepard stand up again as soon as he reaches it.  Then if I try to run backwards to get away from some swarming enemies he runs down out of the screen and I can‚Äôt even see him to know he‚Äôs running in place against some terrain feature. It feels like I‚Äôm trying to play paintball while someone runs along with me smacking me with a pool noodle the whole time.",1664582527

If you have insurance, find a therapist who specializes in relationships or sex therapy. If you have really good insurance, you might even be able to get a surrogate.

If you don't have insurance or your insurance won'tcover sex/relationship therapy, go to a cam site and find someone in the age group and social sphere you're interested in. Message them and ask if you can do a private session. Make it clear that you aren't looking for a show, you just want to talk and get some dating advice and maybe roleplay to build your confidence. You'd be amazed at how many cam models are up for that kind of work. And they usually have a lot of relevant experience. You might have to message a few before you find the right one, but they're out there. And BE RESPECTFUL.

Once you establish your rapport and figure out what you're looking for, try role-playing a date. Depending on how much you need to do this, expect to pay a few hundred dollars over the course of multiple sessions.

If you're too broke to go the cam girl route, feel free to message me and I will give you advice for free. I don't have any qualifications, but I'm neurodivergent and had a really hard time with Girls when I was younger. If incels had been a thing, I probably would have been one. After lots of trial and error, I met someone and I've been happily married for 10 years. Everyone's situation is different, but I will at least try to help you find out what is really preventing you from finding love.

So I have to say I am very excited for you. My 30s were way better than my 20s. I had more money. I was much more secure in my job. And I did a lot of traveling!

I hope that your 30s is twice as awesome as your 20s and that later your 40s is twice as awesome as that.

If they insist on phone call, *as soon as you hang up the phone* send them an email ""just to confirm the details from our phone conversation today [date] at [time] [list eeeeeverything you talked about]"".

Any interaction without a written record might as well not have happened- say you have to go to tribunal or they try to make shonky deductions from your bond about smth... where is your proof?! That is *exactly why* they call all the time.

I've been renting for like 12 years and to protect yourself you gotta go into every interaction with the assumption that rea see their client as the landlord only. Tenants are just a hassle to them and they will throw you under the bus to make their life easier because *they work for the landlord*. This is a best case scenario. Others have friends and relatives as their ""preferred cleaners""- they will take your bond, give the money to their friend with an abn. The friend can whip up invoices, doesn't even do the job, and now you have lost your bond and it's the next tenants problem. They make it a hassle for you in the hopes you will just say ""fuck it"" and not contest anything. If you cover your arse and make it obvious to them (no phone calls!!!) that you are cluey, that will act as a deterrent to them basically scamming you.",1664582530

The damage conservatives deal to the country is felt *every day by everyone.*  

It's even more pronounced for the people they victimize. That would be conservative social policy. Do you think a single day goes by for a trans kid in Texas without the mental torture of knowing a substantial portion of the people around you have voted to demonize you, to try to jail your parents, to erase you from existence?

"ZodiacKiller","t5_2r4t6","Hi Gary,

You've been a longtime champion of Michelle McNamara's work and have even effusively applauded my own work in the past, so I'm puzzled as to why you'd come up with the most cynical‚Äîand wrong‚Äîinterpretation of my motives, and then preclude any sort of reply with:

*""That's the reality of the matter. Naturally Haynes will scoff and deny, citing yada dada.*

*Pay no attention to that.""*

This is insidious stuff, man.

And the ""reality of the matter"" is something you can't possibly know.

I've spoken often ‚Äî privately and publicly ‚Äî about ethics in the true crime arena, and I've been conscientious in this respect throughout the years I've worked in this space. You portraying me as some kind of opportunist looking for the next bandwagon to mount so as to maintain my profile is specious and personally offensive.

I read Kobek's books before ever interacting with him. We were connected by a mutual friend and anything I've tweeted or posted, and even my agreeing to the AMA tomorrow (about which I was approached and said yes; I never reached out and volunteered myself), I've checked in with Kobek first to run it by him, because I specifically do *not* want to parasitically affix myself to, or appropriate, someone else's work or ideas.

I've been signal-boosting Kobek, his books, and Doerr because I believe in them, and I was frustrated they'd been flying under the radar for the last six months. I wanted Doerr paid attention to, with the end goal of him being either concretely eliminated or confirmed to have been Zodiac. I'll accept either outcome.

What you've written here and in other threads is just nasty ‚Äî and totally uncalled for.",1664582531

That's part of the problem right there. I understand wanting to leave money for your relatives/offspring to ensure they are taken care of after you are gone, but amassing the amount some of these elite do up to their inevitable deaths has several issues. For one, having so much money left behind is worse for loved ones in the long run than simply leaving just enough. We see time and again the issues affluenza causes with those who never have to work or contribute in any way, both in overall life satisfaction, and more importantly, mental health. Some of these rich fucks are plain sociopathic when they grow up with never having had to deal with any real world concerns or consequences. Add to that the increased influence these same people wield, it has an negative effect on society as well.

2. They are easy to please. They chose what they wanted and their preferences are stable over time, so they didn't grow apart from their partner. Even if their relationship isn't perfect, the compromises they have to make don't make either party miserable.

"2westerneurope4u","t5_66zq15","The best economic moment in modern Catalonia was after the Spanish succession war, which was just a civil war inside the peninsula after which the new king started to made a number of reforms needed to centralise the bureaucracy of a difficult to rule dinastic union. And that centralization of power was done in most of the nation's of Europe, as was the union of the new administration under a single language. The situation before the complete union was also bad, but nobody talks about it because Catalonia had a lot of autonomy even if it only benefit the local nobility, though that is always forgotten.

 During the 18th century Catalonia and specially Barcelona prospered and was involved in the colonial market as never before, specially after its industry started to emerge. Since the 16th century Barcelona was declining, Valencia was the main Mediterranean city of Spain. In the 18th century Catalonia managed not only to enter in the top 3 biggest cities of Spain, but it managed to be the second biggest city of the country BY FAR, just behind Madrid, when in 1700 it was stimated to be the fifth biggest. The 18th century was a lot of things except decadent for Catalonia, and the integration into a bigger unified state meant many benefits. 
 
 In 1600, according to modern estimations, Barcelona had 32.000 inhabitants (two centuries before it had around 38 k). In that same period Valencia had 65 K, Toledo 80 K, Valladolid 41 K, Madrid 65 K, Sevilla 135 K and Granada 69 K. Barcelona was not even in the top 5 biggest cities, it was big? Yes, but not as big as others which, today, are towns compared to the metropolis the capital of Catalonia has become.
 
 What examples do you see of Spain ""fucking"" Catalonia in those 164 years? A good of example of a country fucking one of its regions would be the UK with Ireland, an island which has not recover from a famine the UK helped to made in any way, specially demographic. The example of Ireland is many times used by catalanists as a comparison between their movement and theirs, as if a colony that suffered a genocide could be compared with Catalonia.

 Of course Spain had interest to maintain Catalonia, that's why the protectionists policies were done, to protect Catalonian and therefore Spanish economy. No Catalonia inside Spain, no Spanish easy market. I said it because it's many times forgotten how the Spanish government helped Catalonia to developed, and probably without the rest of Spain Catalonia would have being unable to develop an industry as it did. Though this is pure conjecture. 

 In stead of flexing everytime the fact that you are richer maybe it's time to ask WHY you are rich, and why other regions with the same potential inside Spain, aren't.

 Catalonia is one of the most economically benefited autonomous communities of this country, that is a [fact](https://www.eldebate.com/espana/20220821/espana-no-roba-a-cataluna_55206.html). Spain is not stealing from Catalonia in any way. 

 That the system needs a reform? YES. But is should be based in equality, as you said, and as much fraternity between communities as possible. A good chunk of autonomy in several aspects like the economic, in my opinion, is something that could benefit all of us, that is something I agree with you.",1664582534

I don't think that's going to be our present situation for quite some time after the Singularity. We're going to have a lot of space stations and interplanetary colonies in operation, as well as interstellar communication hubs. And that's just the start.

The Singularity will just come and go and we'll be living in a virtual reality that exists solely for the purposes of entertainment.

That's what I'd call the ""Aesthetics of the Future""

In my opinion, the Singularity will come and go and our lives will be entirely the same regardless of where or when it happens. Our consciousness will remain the same, but the content of our lives will change. And I think that might be the case for a lot of people who have lived through or have read sci-fi. 

I'm more inclined towards *The Fourth Industrial Revolution* and *The Fourth Age of the Universe*, both of which have a lot of parallels with the Singularity.

I've long felt that in order for human civilization to persist past the Singularity, we're going to need a new kind of technology. Something that's far more generalized than the sort of things we already have. Something that would allow us to do much more without sacrificing our individual abilities or even our bodies, and that we'd also be able to transfer onto future generations. Something that would allow us to create more efficient and stable economies at the same time. Something that would allow us to keep up with the times, without having to constantly reinvent ourselves.",1664582534

dacs these days are all so good you would have to have a high-dollar, high-perf dac and listening training to maybe be able to tell a difference.
i have an lg v50 phone with selectable high-quad dac and a normal dac. why, i dont know. but in this case, there is a real noticeable improvement with the high-quad.
but, it requires being wired in to my preamp by 3.5mm to 2 rca cable. or wired in to aux in my car, which i do. it sounds better to me than bluetooth.
on the other hand, with the cca i had and the wiim i use now, using optical out to my pre was the best. i have a jbl sdp3 pre/surround processor.
my pre's dac is superb. it is definitely lush in comparison to my schiit modi dac.
and that modi is transparent.
the only reason i bought the modi is because i bought a used schiit saga+ preamp to use while my pre is being restored. the cost of both was less than what i could pay for anything i could  buy to replace my pre. it was 5k brand new. 32 years ago. i got it for 250 3 years ago.
best deal.ive made so far.
all that to say, it depends on what youre after.
an external one isnt always needed as any  sound-producing equipment has a dac.
the question is what do you need.
i was happy with my jbl pre. i only bought an external as a stopgap.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. Your post should contain more than 50 words.**

Have you checked that battery? It is likely 7.2 or 7.4 volts nominal. That will be the red and black leads. The other two are most likely for balancing the charge, so measuring between one of those and the black (gnd) should show around 3.5 to 4.0 volts. Thats an easy place to start.",1664582536

"asexuality","t5_2qv0q","I've never gone to a gyno before, but I did have a external examination at my family doctor, who was a woman (which was important to me, I would have been too uncomfortable if it was a me dr), and I was visibly nervous. She was very kind and caring, and she explained to me that I needed to undress, and then when I'm done, to lay on the table, cover myself with the blanket (which stayed on my the whole time), and she'd be back in a few minutes. Before she came back, she knocked and asked if it was okay to come in. She explained that she was going to sit by my feet, and explained that all she needed to do was have a look. She said she needed me to separate my knees once I felt comfortable, and she asked if it was okay for her to feel down there, but she said she wouldn't feel anything internal. I told her that was okay, and she walked me through everything, and was very careful and gentle the whole time, explaining what she was doing. Once she was done, she told me I could put my legs together again if I wanted to, and she said she was going to step out once again so I could get dressed. Also, this entire time, not only was the door closed, but the curtain was also drawn, which I appreciated. She came back and explained the results (which were fine btw), and we wrapped up the appt. 

This was all just shortly after I turned 19, and I had been putting it off for a while. I was still nervous and uncomfortable the whole time, but that had nothing to do with the doctor. This doctor wasn't always my favourite, but I love her now. I was nervous about how she'd go about doing the exam, but she was beyond gentle and talked me through everything. The fact she could see I was nervous may have made her be a little more cautious, but I didn't have to explain myself at all. What you experienced was in no way okay. You shouldn't have to explain everything in order for a doctor to be gentle and explain what they're doing. They are supposed to ask questions, be gentle and careful, and talk you through everything. Unfortunately not every doctor is like that, so you might have to really explain yourself before they start anything, and make sure that they know why you are nervous and uncomfortable, etc. What happened was in no way your fault; you were in the hands of professionals, and they should know better. But to make sure it never happens again, we need to advocate for ourselves.",1664582536

"LOTR_on_Prime","t5_wnoj8","I disagree with this, I think everything they have shown has suggested a deep love for Tolkien's wider lore and the books specifically. The references to specific events and passages (like the echoes of the battle of bywater in the fight at the village). My point about Adar was that it is a possible interpretation of his name not that it was explicitly true. Though I think Adar could easily be a disguise used by Sauron when he realizes the orcs are ready to mutiny because of his experiments along with the realization he needs Elvish assistance to achieve his ultimate goal.

I will have to rewatch it but I thought it was fairly clear that the seal was hidden away then fell out and that was when Galadriel noticed it. Would make sense to hide if he's on a boat with other Southlanders who may recognise it and therefore him.

I somewhat agree, but I think he is a means to an end at first. Her sole focus, until he begins to crack her facade, is on her quest for vengeance against Sauron. It is only when this starts to slip that we see signs of her true wisdom. Also given her concerns about her own backstory I can believe her not asking him to tell his if he is not willing. I think their shared pain is why they so readily trust each other. I may even make the argument (given what we know if Galadriel's clear sight regarding Feanor and Annatar) that her trusting him, even in the state we see her in at the show's beginning, would suggest he is not evil.

As I have said elsewhere I need some big explanations and plot hole filling in before I accept Halbrand as Sauron (and even then I doubt I will agree with the decision form a storytelling point of view)",1664582537

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","UPDATE: The lower intake manifold/fuel rail was damaged by a previous owners mechanic. This was replaced and resolved the limp mode issue. The sensor was also replaced as a precaution. This part is easily damaged when installed due to the metal flaps need to sit partially inside the engine and if a vacuum isn‚Äôt applied during install the flaps get squashed between the engine and fuel rail.

This issue was also being amplified by the supercharger clutch being worn. This was only found out after the first repair was done. The super charger clutch is part of the water pump assembly and when the clutch is worn there is less boost during 0-3000rpm as this is when the supercharger supplies boost when accelerating. I am currently waiting on this to be replaced and hopefully will resolve the boost issue.",1664582537

"CoronavirusUS","t5_2f86o2","I haven't read further than these comments (and I read the original article in PLOS One), but here are my thoughts as a psychologist and parent: 

While personality researchers tend to believe traits are immutable, we actually do know (and personality researchers acknowledge) that they change over time. For example, we know that people become lower in neuroticism as they age. 

Why is that important?

It's because we don't know a ton, empirically, about how these traits shift during exceptionally impactful events that are long in duration, like the pandemic, affect personality - and more importantly, we know very little about whether/how/to what extent our personalities ""rebound"" from said circumstances. 

So, maybe children and young adults have been irreparably changed by the pandemic. Honestly, they probably have, although I genuinely don't think their Big 5 personality traits are what we should give a fuck about. But, we don't know the extent to which young people will be psychologically resilient to the pandemic conditions, or what predicts that resilience, or what that looks like. 

We also don't know which components of the actual pandemic contributed to changes in personality among younger people - was it the threat of getting sick, the lockdowns, the stress of seeing other people disregard pandemic control guidelines, losing their family members, changes in schooling, actually getting COVID . . . I could go on. 

So there's not a conclusion you can actually draw from this one study. It's incredible overconfidence (and a bit of Dunning Kreuger) to think there is.",1664582537

Worked as stock broker in another country for a few years and totally got disgusted of the experience. Came back and became an IT guy, much happier.

BTW do you mind telling reddit what to look at when inspecting houses? I just bought one and got a few:

* Beware of those non-rectangle windows, gonna cost a shit and worse no one willing to do that;
* Better just tell previous owner to get EVERYTHING out unless you fancy to grab a few vintage items here and there;
* Check if there is plank wood under carpet;
* Check EVERY light switch and do NOT underestimate the cost (apparently could be VERY costly if the wire is bad);
* Get some knowledge about heat pumps and such, know good brands from bad ones. I was fortunate enough to get a good one;

-	Funtimes in Babylon - it adds a good drum beat that‚Äôs missing from the album version
-	Holy Shit - the manic orchestral breakdown gives a way better climax
-	Teepees 1-12 - if you know, you know üòâ
-	Nancy From Now On - the maracas and drums make it feel like an entirely new song and Josh adds some good color of his own
-	Ballad of the Dying Man - the last few bars are very grand in a way you don‚Äôt get on the album
-	Please Don‚Äôt Die - the breakdown to acoustic guitar and vocals to build back up to the chorus again is great and the added bars take it home
-	Date Night - some extra lyrics tossed around make the song way more fun and unhinged
-	Ideal Husband - it‚Äôs way over-the-top unhinged
-	I‚Äôm Writing a Novel - Josh takes a few melodic liberties and it‚Äôs way boppier
-	Only Son of the Ladiesman - another one where Josh takes some melodic alternatives
-	The Memo - hits harder, but I actually think Josh could do even more with this one
-	Magic Mountain - the ding dongs at the end are more fun and last forever
-	Strange Encounter - pretty sure they play this in a different key and it adds interest
-	When You‚Äôre Smiling and Astride Me - gets more intimate
-	The Next 20th Century - the guitar solo rips
-	Thirsty Crow - the cat and mouse hit makes the live song way more fun like a saloon

Ones I actually like less live:

-	Hollywood Cemetery Forever Sings - sorry, just doesn‚Äôt do anything for me!
-	Disappointing Diamonds - I think he needs to change the key for live because the high notes don‚Äôt hit the same as the album recording
-	The Palace - mood killer and basically the same as the album unless he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs just me and Jefffffff‚Äù",1664582538

Step 1:  Find a country you think is better.           
Step 2:  Look up the rules for moving there.           
Step 3:  Meet the requirements and move.            

There's about 193 or so countries in the world.  
If things are so terrible in the US, then you won't have any problem finding countries to meet Step 1.   
If you just look up the requirements of one nation per day, you'll know them all in about 6 months.   So, Step 2 will be done.  

Then it's just on you to meet step 3 and go.


Here's some easy ones:

That `{cmd}` has its own range attached (`.,+/^$/-`) which breaks down as the current line (`.`, the line found by the `:g/` match) through (`,`) starting on the next line (`+`, the blank line after the recipe name), search forward for a blank line (`/^$/`, the line between recipes) and go back one line (`-` we want to leave the newline on the blank line that separates recipes).  With that relative-range established based on each ""#"" line, over that range, perform the substitute

    s/\n/XXXXX/

which replaces the newline with some unique token. So this process finds the range that covers each of those recipes, and turns the newlines into a token `XXXXX`. With them all on one line, you can then sort them, and then restore the tokens back to newlines.

But the reason I'm disappointed is just how it's pretty painful obvious watching how he's embarrassed about how his viewers perceive him and his channel's brand just for talking about the series.

Most girl groups usually wear some kind of combat boots and not those kind of heels, at least I for one can't recall many girl groups wearing heels, so not fitting considering they probably have intricate choreos and they wouldn't be able to dance nicely in those. Could have worked for a female solo artist but not a group. Also if they wanted to make a kpop group imo they should have made at least 4 dolls, as most groups are at least 5 people (usually more), with 3 beeing extremely unusual, more unusual than 4 even. Especially if they modelled them after BlackPink I think 4 would have made more sense.",1664582540

We ""fix"" this issue by writing a disclaimer in our reddit rules: ""sources/links may contain nsfw souces/links. Viewer discretion is advised."" Boom bang, problem solved, we're legally outta the clear! 

If anything, we just gotta put a subreddit warning for new redditors, we would need some sort of, ""are you sure you really want the view the content on this subreddit checkbox,"" and then we dont have to worry about this ""legal stuff.""

"rutgers","t5_2risk","&gt; The door dash cost less than a meal plan so you would be asking the university to tell athletes to buy their own food which would be a competitive disadvantage for us because we can‚Äôt make sure all the athletes are eating healthy

I wasn't really talking so much about DoorDash in particular as I was about college athletics in general. In general, Rutgers spends way too much money on athletics, money that would be better directed towards other underfunded areas. I updated the text of the OP to clarify.

&gt; Also a good idea as long as we allow some routes for people to go in/out of the parking garages

You could close College Ave without having to close either of the garage entrances, since you can enter via either George or Senior Sts.

&gt; Rutgers parking permits are already very strict, it‚Äôs 1 parking lot per person essentially making it impossible to travel between campus on car before 6, if you make it even harder commuters might end up finding out that they no longer have a place to park on campus meaning they can‚Äôt attend the university unless they park at a local store and walk over which seems unfair

Then why not just, uh, prioritize parking permits for the people who actually *need* to park on campus, like commuters?

&gt; Would put a lot of stress on scheduling and people may not be able to get into classes they need to for graduation

There are many classes, and many recitations, that can be easily taken at different campuses. At least that was my general observation when I was undergoing the scheduling process last month. And for those courses that currently can't, why not make it easier for that to be the case?

In general, the policy should be something along the lines of ""try to assign students to campuses based on their academic areas, and try to assign classes to students based on their campuses.""

&gt; A light rail system would be great if we could actually get that built without breaking the budget

The main thing about clarkson if you read between the lines in all the players books and things you hear is that in his ‚Äúown mind‚Äù he had the best wishes of the player at heart. For the players they knew he wanted them to be successful, but he‚Äôs not always depicted warmly.  Which says a bit considering at that time he was basically coaching Jesus. 

The other side of his ‚Äúgood intent‚Äù is that clearly he had issues with the line between work and personal, and sometimes the path to hell is paved with ‚Äúgood intentions‚Äù. 

Many internal stakeholders at the hawks were required to moderate him. As they left for new roles it became harder and harder and that is why he got moved on in the end. 

I think you will find many other coaches have similar problems. Malthouse told Dane swan to move ‚Äútwo suburbs, because your mates are rats but rats only travel one suburb‚Äù. 

Ross lyon was known for being invasive in his early days (was moderated over time). 

Clarkson, other coaches and the industry need to have a look about how they function moving forward. But also players dictate that. The stuff that happened in the 80‚Äôs couldn‚Äôt happen in 2000. The stuff from the 00‚Äôs can‚Äôt happen now. 

Each day teams not only need to get better at how they play. But how they care for the individual. The coaches that so this will be successful long term. The others will end up unemployed.",1664582541

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Exactly! the show portrays him more like a spurned lover than as a person who's lost everything that made him worthy (in his own eyes).  And I think there's the same problem with him killing Joffrey and finding Alicent in the end when he's about to kill himself. They could have highlighted the idea of her being a saviour and a figure of salvation and even redemption for him- by serving her he can repair his honor. Instead in the next episode it just seems like they both just really hate Rhaenyra and that's how they banded together.",1664582541

If you know that you can still choose not to hurt anyone, I would like to elevate that idea and encourage you to use your agency to make the right choice! It will feel good to overcome this feeling and when you exercise your agency it can only get stronger.

I would also like to validate how you're feeling in the sense that it's normal to have thoughts about hurting people sometimes. They can be very distressing. However, we can push through them and be stronger for having done so.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Two things, first was that when I was younger I very much tried to be the contrarian and special, and honestly just a prick. I was a skeptic (political and religious), I listened to old music not the new dubstep, and i actually trained myself to be left handed, thats how badly i wanted to be different. Now I wish I had just gone with the flow, following the dominant ideology of my peers, following popular trends, and just following the easier path. Although i still have some of that skepticism and need to feel special, i now try to ignore that. If you need to construct a way in which you are special, you may not be all to special.

Another thing that is very different from when I was younger is relationships. When I was younger, like high school through college, I wanted a long term, committed relationship. Never had much luck dating, but that was the goal when I was younger. Now I don't really want that. I'm 23 now, and I recognize that I don't have much experience dating, so I would rather be able to date around and meet people than be fully committed to one person. This isn't like ""oh I just want to sleep around"" type thing, I still want emotional relationships, but I'd much rather focus on seeing who work well with me instead of holding onto the first person who shows any interest, i want short term stuff no. Most people were able to do that in high school and college, but just because I'm older doesn't mean I shouldn't still be able to do that you know.",1664582543

# SOLD 

I will see you at the No Fun! This is fuckin awesome!

EDIT: If you don't see the Portland show on the No Fun Bar calendars, it looks like it didn't make it onto a majority of their calendar sites they use. I did find it though: they have it on Facebook but not on their other calendars, was kinda buried. Sorry for the FB link:

https://m.facebook.com/events/585258323244976

If you don't/can't/won't login to FB, basically all you need to know is that the **show starts at 7 PM, tickets are $8 (cash only), the venue is 21 and older only**, and the second musical guest that night was still TBA at time of the event's posting.

Hope that clears things up. I'll see about contacting No Fun to make sure this event gets to the other calendars. u/Steel-Beans, you may want to contact them as well to ask them what's up with the missing event dates/times.

We'll see ya there!

EDIT 2: Apparently it isn't posted elsewhere as No Fun Bar is awaiting the rest of the lineup playing that night. Hopefully, they'll get someone and the show will go as planned.",1664582544

I use Google Lens every day. Browsing foreign language books -- Japanese, Korean or Chinese.

Translations are ever better.

Speaking of magic, if you look at ""Magic Eraser"" in Google Photos, you get most of the functionality of Photoshop's Content Aware Fill -- free. Google revolutionized computational photography, even if it looks like Apple has regained the lead . . . but it's definitely a horse race.

&gt;Why does Google management believe in overnight successes in the business world?

Laughing. They've put fortunes of money into DeepMind, losing buckets of money over many years (bought it in 2014) because they understand it is a huge, long term bet.  They have pole position in what is arguably the most important information technology of the 21st century.

By contrast, Stadia was a technologically undifferentiated distributed gaming platform where Google had not particular technical advantages. In many cases, the best way to do market research -- if you've got the money -- is to launch a product and see what the users do. Some products are mind boggling successes, that drown the sellers in demand. Others are ""meh"". Stadia was the latter, as with Google Wave, Google+  . . . lots of logic to the model ""iterate variations, then cull what doesn't work""",1664582544

I‚Äôm an SA victim and I wouldn‚Äôt say that I *hate* the scene. Obviously, I found it uncomfortable and didn‚Äôt like it, but that‚Äôs also the point of the scene. It‚Äôs supposed to be showing how Walter has clearly lost sight of who he is and is being ‚Äútaken over‚Äù by the power he‚Äôs enjoying (from the meth, to be clear), imo at least

I brought up that scene as the turning point in which I officially did not like Walter‚Äôs character anymore, because that was OPs question, I wasn‚Äôt commenting on hating the scene so I don‚Äôt even know why they mentioned that. I think anyone who actually likes Walter and supports him based on everything he‚Äôs done, not just the rape scene, is a bit icky to me.

I say all that because it seems as though many are thinking the first potential concussion compounded to the point that lead to the gruesome sight last night, when it is very plausible that Tua was free of concussion symptoms and experienced that injury due to the nature of the hit itself.

That would put everyone in fights whenever they want, or you get a significant benefit of some kind.  

It‚Äôs basically the exact same thing as OPR, but on a large scale, and done organically instead of little 20 minute matches.  Miniature wars would pop up constantly.

As I sit down on my toilet,  I open up your post.  Within a minute,  I hear her walking upstairs, when she comes in she's clutching her bottom (wearing shorts), confessing that she'd had an accident.  She'd been holding it so long,  when I tried to flush it,  the toilet became clogged.  We're about 6 months in. 

I'm so sorry that you/ yours are having difficulty too.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Many of us have taken some time to learn:  
* What Bitcoin actually is  
* The basics of how Bitcoin works  
* Why Bitcoin was invented, the problems it solves  

Bitcoin is a new kind of money, similar to money you already use, but with some very important differences which make it the best form of money ever used.  

To fully appreciate Bitcoin, you end up finally learning the truth about ""money"" and, in particular, the existing fiat currency based fractional reserve system -- the ""money"" you've been using all your life without even understanding where it comes from.  You see, ""money"" is not taught in schools, for some reason, not even in college.  You'll never learn the truth about ""money"" from TV.  But you can easily learn the truth, if that's what you want to know.  

You are probably thinking something to the effect of, ""Money?  I've used money almost all my life.  I earn it, I spend it, I try to save some... what's there to know about money?""  Once you find out, you're likely to say, ""WHY didn't anybody teach me this before??  This is so important to understand!!""  Well, here we are, ready to help you begin the journey, if you're interested.  

Are you ready to expose yourself to the truth about money and the banking system?  Just the basic facts.  If so, here are some good places to start:  

Intro: The Trust Machine (22 min):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwqNgG-Sv4  

Book: ""The Bitcoin Standard,"" by S. Ammous.  He will give you a solid, basic understanding of what money is, has been, and why Bitcoin is the best.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","The insurance companies will tell you that you have to pay a shitton to insure that property.  Double shitton after Ian.  FL property insurance market was already collapsing because they can't get greater fools to ""reinsure"" (insurance companies are mostly marketing agencies that try to get other people to take on the actual payment risk) under same business model that caused subprime mortgage crisis.  It was collapsing because FL property market is way too high, and if it is way too high, then insurance for current market value becomes overinsurance, which is vulnerable to fraud, but also bigger losses if mass damage (like from a hurricane) makes people realize FL is a shithole.

A problem with high interest rates, high insurance rates, and high property tax (not a FL problem) rates is that the costs of ownership become super high such that the financial value of homes has to go down to maintain the same affordability as lower rates do. 

So FL, under the surface, was already getting bad before this storm.  You need insurance to get a mortgage.",1664582547

I started having cold sores that lasted months and spread over my upper body. The first thing that really helped was taking trace minerals called ""Concentrace"" and lyposomal vitamin C but the trace minerals seemed to make the difference. I can't say that will help you but you have to find out what your system is deficient in that causes your immune system to be weak.

Familial attachment is great for ensuring the spread of genes.  Letting go of familial attachment is believed by Buddhists to be a great way to find peace of mind.

There simply is no contradiction, which is what the phrase ""flying in the face of"" means.

The truth is that her mental state is very different than yours and most people in general. She has been beaten down and conditioned to be subservient. Her POS ex is someone who knows how to attack her and get her to bow down. You have to remember this. You also have to remember that if you want to be better than her ex, you need to take steps to deal with the frustration. She needs support, not blame. She also needs the tools to deal with these circumstances in particular.  She needs a game plan for when he reaches out to her. She needs to have key words in her vocabulary that shut him down before he gets started. She needs to practice these words so that they are automatic (just like the apologies). Speak to her therapist, if she has one, and if she doesn‚Äôt, she should. Reach out to support groups. You need to be her cheerleader. Good luck.",1664582550
"retrogaming","t5_2qk6v","It's expensive, but you might look into the Mister FPGA emulator. (misterfpga.org).  It more or less re-creates the circuitry in a real NES, but displays on an HDMI monitor.  It can potentially drive a CRT with extremely low lag if you can source one that will do 60Hz, and you can buy adapters to use real NES controllers.  

It will also emulate pretty much all the old consoles and a ton of old computers, using that same method.... recreating workalike circuits.  Combined with a low-latency output device (like a CRT or a high speed flat monitor), it can feel damn near identical to the originals.

You can buy premades or build one yourself; doing it yourself is cheaper.  Minimum expense to run every core is somewhere around $325 or so.  You can spend more on additional features, depending on what you want to do.",1664582550

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Polysaccharides from certain funguses. In my area the ""gold gilled bolete"" is a cancer eviscerator. See all cancer eats all sugar.

However this immortal dumbass only eats one thing and without discretion. Sugar. The cure to cancer is a certain molecular SHAPE of a polysachride... Cancer will eat ANYTHING that the body identifies as sugar. So give it some poisonous sugar 

As a preventative, do a parasite cleanse about once a month. I recommend astringent herbal teas. For instance any herbs that use to keep away mosquitoes, or if you're feeling really brown and down a spoonful of turpentine and SUGAR (there's that sugar again...)

World of Warcraft‚Ä¶..*sigh*

And ironically Batman Arkham City. But for a totally different reason than the other two.

Basically like you said I could be listening to a podcast or even doing business calls and something about gliding around the city as Batman while doing it was so relaxing.

The values you noted are both well over 1, which means their contributions are still highly relevant to their field. Which is the real insight it gives.

It does not measure the quality of the publishing journal, and it does somewhat penalize joint authorship. It focuses on rate of cutation pretty exclusively.

Jesus is not himself God, but ""The Father and I (Jesus) are one."" This union with the Father makes us daughters and sons of God, this is what Jesus calls for, conversion to God. The parable of the prodigal son who goes away from his father and then repents, returns home. Otherwise he never tires of emphasizing that he is the Son of Man. Most Christian communities are riddled with false teachings that one need only believe in Jesus to be saved. According to Jesus' teaching, this is not the case, only turning back to God.

Zavas is something, but barely. It's a mediocre tempo play on 2 if it's the only 2-drop you drew. But if it doesn't come down then, it's probably just a 2/2 you play on turn 14 when you're starting to run out of gas.

Majordomo can be a blank card, but it also has by far the most potential to be impactful. It's an incredibly large body that plays well off the top in the late game. It's unplayable when there's a lot of board tension, as you're likely to just die. But many arena games are going to get to a point where resources become thinned out. If you play him when he's not DOB, and the opponent only has 2-3 cards, it's unlikely that killing him and dealing 8 damage to you is an immediate path to victory for them. While he's certainly not guaranteed to win in a topdeck war, he's going to push the needle 10x further than Zavas will in these games.

All told, I'm relatively certain that Domo is not only the right pick, but that it's significantly better (\~ +0.20 more expected wins) than the other options.",1664582553

Its really hard having to live with people who like it or not are important to you and yet they constantly misgender you (and in my case my casually transphobic comments constantly) but its better than being out and having to face it directly. I like to think of it more as, if i dont tell them then i can argue theyre only doing it because they dont know (even if i know thats mot true) vs if i do tell them and they continue to do it then its worse because they know and it‚Äôs intentional. In my opinion j would say try your best to last until you can move out to tell your dad, maybe even until you actively have the means to move out or already have.

"canada","t5_2qh68","This is some of the dumbest shit I've read. You understand business needs counterparties to their transactions, also known as customers. The best environment for business is a stable, growing economy where you can scale your business without worrying about huge fluctuations up and down where you have to expand too fast to control cost or risk your business when there's a big downturn. Cheap rates and a dramatic increase in the supply of money created this over time. Governments write cheques to people for the pandemic. Lots of money sloshing around and less economic activity. It's so obvious I can't believe all these anti business, anti-worker, and conspiracy theory level analyses exist. 

I'm stunned you doubled down on dumb by saying you think people in real estate want higher interest rates and unemployment? Ridiculous. Rising rates mean their assets are worth less. Billions less. It's such a capital intensive business that is mostly funded through financing. Higher rates are hugely damaging. Lower income means lower potential rents, lower sales prices. Cap rates will rise in them. Nothing good about this.

Hello readers, welcome to OCpoetry. This subreddit is a writing workshop community -- a place where poets of all skill levels can share, enjoy, and talk about each other's poetry. Every person who's shared, including the OP above, has given some feedback (those are the links in the post) and hopes to receive some in return (from you, the readers).

If you really enjoyed this poem and just want to drop a quick comment, to show some appreciation or give kudos, things like ""great job!"" or ""made me cry"", or ""loved it"" or ""so relateable"", please do. Everyone loves a compliment. Thanks for taking the time to read and enjoy.

If you want to share your own poem, you'll need to give this writer some detailed feedback. Good feedback explains from your point of view what it was like to read the poem, and then tries to explain how the poem made you feel like that. If you're not sure what that means, check out our [feedback guide](https://new.reddit.com/r/ocpoetry/wiki/feedbackcritiques), or look through the comment sections of any other post here, or click the links to the author's feedback above. If you're not sure whether your comments are feedback, or you have any other questions, please send us a modmail.

"LockdownSkepticism","t5_2iokxd","I know universities have lost their collective mind but this seems extra insane.  Preventing someone from leaving their dorm room sounds illegal to me (false imprisonment.)  Have any lawyers in your family?  I'd ask them if this is even enforceable.  The security guys may be ""asking"" students to return to their room but not actually doing anything if they don't.  How are you supposed to comply with their rule (getting a booster) if you can't leave?

The concept of false imprisonment in connection with covid rules has been raised before, but usually in the context of a short-term quarantine for someone who tested positive (e.g. nursing homes keeping a resident locked in their room, a condo association deactivating a resident's key to the elevator and parking garage after they revealed a positive test result.)  This situation is even worse since it is a ""quarantine"" of healthy individuals with no endpoint.

Is your school accepting religious exemptions for the booster?

Can you organize a group of like-minded students to write to the administration with an argument about how boosters do not prevent transmission and therefore mandating them serves no public health benefit? (probably wouldn't work but maybe worth a try, especially if you threaten to transfer if the rule is not rescinded ... they don't want enrollment to drop)

Can you move off-campus?  Does this rule apply to non-residential students?  They say ""will be denied access to campus,"" but that would seem even harder to enforce than forbidding someone from leaving a dorm.",1664582555

The abstract seems to dismiss out of hand all of the modern synthesis apart from ‚Äúsurvival of the fittest,‚Äù which inclines me to answer your question as *probably not*. This is a similar tactic used by Michael Behee of the Discovery Institute. I‚Äôm not convinced by the abstract that the authors actually understand what they are talking about. Which is fine since it‚Äôs outside of their speciality, but I‚Äôd need to see more of their work to get a better read. 

This seems like they are working from a version of the ‚Äúwaiting time problem.‚Äù Which I don‚Äôt find compelling. If they want to  assert a ‚Äúfifth‚Äù force of nature they would need to evidence it. As things stand there isn‚Äôt much that they have brought up that hasn‚Äôt already been addressed in evolutionary biology. There are of course open questions and room for improvement, but my read is that the authors of the paper seem to be overstating some things. Also their appeal to ‚Äúprobabilities‚Äù doesn‚Äôt bode well for them.

If I had to guess, I suspect that something along the lines of I.D. is what is ultimately going to be pushed from this.",1664582555

 &gt;Porgy and Bess () is an English-language opera by American composer George Gershwin, with a libretto written by author DuBose Heyward and lyricist Ira Gershwin. It was adapted from Dorothy Heyward and DuBose Heyward's play Porgy, itself an adaptation of DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel of the same name. Porgy and Bess was first performed in Boston on September 30, 1935, before it moved to Broadway in New York City. It featured a cast of classically trained African-American singers‚Äîa daring artistic choice at the time.

"VaushV","t5_10to4u","I dunno if they count necessarily as critisms against anti-racism and egalitarianism, they mainly just come from me own little head. But I'll put them out there and see what you make of them.

Anti-racism. Where I live the native population is a minority, I'm not necessarily moaning that they dare be here, but I'm the majority whilst also being a minority. I rarely hear my own language spoken when out and about in my own communities. If I had final say over everything in the world I'd limit things to 90% native population and 10% others, it is good to have other voices in the mix so you're not completely isolated, but at the same time it is worrying seeing what's happening.

Egalitarianism. Much harder for me to argue because I try my best to fight any sexism. I feel like sexism is often forgotten in ""the culture wars"" (best term I can think of for it), there's so much fight for racism but at the end of the day if we just sorted out sexism first all the black women would be doing a lot better, plus all the white women I know who can't even go out at night. There are problems though that I find with trying to make men and women closer together, I reckon if we could just be accepting of men and women for what they are that there wouldn't be this push to combine the two together. For instance professional women end up dressing a lot like men, and from the conversations I've had with different women there's a huge problem. I know that isn't a critism against egalitarianism, I don't actually have one. I'm a bit drunk at the moment so my last message was sent a bit hastily, which is my bad.

One note I will make about TERFs though is that I know a lot of them, but they seem totally fine with women-men transgenders, but it's when men become women that they take an issue. I'm not a TERF though and when I pretended to come out as trans today to two ""TERFs"" (in quotes cos they don't consider themselves TERFs they probably have never even heard the term) they had their eyes opened quite a lot to the struggles trans people have.

edit: got women to men and men to women mixed up which affects my point quite a bit.",1664582557

"ibroadcast","t5_2tnqhf","Thanks. I know I should use Feedback, but I feel like I do it a lot, and was hoping someone else had experience that might help me.

BTW, I should've been more explicit:  I have ""one queue"" enabled and was hoping for it to function, but when one of the devices is an Echo device (and the previous one was not) progress through the queue is NOT synching.

Example:  I listen to a few songs on the Echo (or not), then go for a drive and listen from my device.  The phone picks up where the Echo left off in the queue.  When I return home (even giving it an hour or more to synch up via wifi in case I didn't have signal where I went), any playing through an Echo starts up where I left off... the last time I played from that Echo, not the more recent spot in the queue from the phone, despite One Queue being enabled.  The exact same sequence of songs I just listened to in the car will then play.

"ClassicRock","t5_2r3kh","Ah! You‚Äôve got me by about a couple decades. I was born in the early 1980s and I got into The Beatles after watching their *Anthology* on tv with my Dad when I was in middle school. Several years later in High School, I got into Pink Floyd after listening to *Dark Side of the Moon* while high. And that led to *The Wall* and *Wish You Were Here*. 

When I left for college I dove deeper into Pink Floyd‚Äôs discography with *Piper at the Gates of Dawn* &amp; *Meddle* (my personal favorite!!). I also really got into film. I even minored in Film Studies and was briefly a Screenwriting MFA student, before high healthcare costs associated with Preexisting Conditions from a brain tumor forced me to focus on my work for people with disabilities.

(FYI: I was having to pay $1,203 per month for refills of my narcolepsy medication until I reached a $5,000 deductible. Then the Affordable Care Act took full effect. Since then, I‚Äôve saved $75,000 over 8 years thanks to the Patient Protections for Preexisting Conditions 

One of the movies that got me interested in film was *Clockwork Orange*. Kubrick was one of the best directors ever. In my opinion, *Clockwork Orange* has possibly the best production values of any film. The sets, the costumes, the props, the lighting, the cinematography, the acting, and the music all perfectly serve Kubrick‚Äôs storytelling.",1664582558

Or let's say relic mammal populations exist but they're highly derived, like marine mammals. They might think ah yes, humans must've had smooth skin. Aquatic ape theory 2.0?

Their best bet would be finding a fossilized ""mummy"" like those hadrosaurs that show the scales and soft tissues.

I think the scrub and body washes are also really popular, because they're cheap and they don't last as long as they should.

"mildlyinfuriating","t5_2ubgg","As a USPS mail carrier I‚Äôd suggest not returning the favor through USPS. Think about it like this. Carriers are overwhelmed since the pandemic and basically almost everyone is doing their shopping online now. Our routes have not been adjusted accordingly since 2019. Carriers right now are overworked and underpaid thanks to the pandemic and online shopping. Before 2020 my route got maybe 40 packages a day. Now I average a little over 200 a day. Carriers are given a 30 second per package credit. Well, the volume has not been credited since 2019. Basically I‚Äôm still paid for only 40 packages when in reality I have over 200 a day. That also does not count towards the extra trips I have to make back out onto my route once I finish delivering due to oversized packages and not being able to fit them all into my vehicle. 1,000 boxes to one residence would require 2 or more special trips for a carrier that just wants to get home to their family after a long day.

On the other hand, if we assume the stuff with Elsie also is related to this ""true enemy"", then it probably couldn't be.

In the first place, whoever took over Ziggy would somehow have come to know about his past, since Ziggy himself doesn't remember... which might more so speak to the true enemy being someone related to the Edens Zero, since that's the only other object from the future that could have information on what's going on. And also the timing of when Pino was made and the memories of the Shining Stars playing into it... yeah, the more I think about it, I think it's someone deeply connected to the EZ, or more specifically, I feel it might be 3173, Etherion, the remaining spirit of the future Rebecca. Ziggy describing the sound of the exploding ship as a ""grand bell"" could also play into this, of course it's a giant hunk of metal, but it still shouldn't make bell-like sounds when exploding... and with the form of it, I could see the ship itself being taken over and being like a giant monster that they need to take down.

If it's not that though, Nox feels like the only option due to possibly also having time-shenanigans that'd allow her to see Ziggys past/the future.",1664582562

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","I'm gonna get hate for this, but I personally feel that AC1 has aged better than AC2. AC2 is still an awesome game. The story, protagonist, and gameplay mechanics are also better in the sequel. Graphically though, after replaying AC1 on the 360 and AC2 on the Xone Ezio collection, AC1 looks better. The faces look much better and the game overall feels more cinematic. I suck at articulating my thoughts. It's really hard to describe. 

Another thing is that AC2 feels a bit too easy. It's probably the easiest in the franchise. I like the challenge during the assassination missions in AC1. 

That being said, the other Ezio games felt more challenging. Maybe it's because of the optional challenges. As much as I love AC2, I think AC1, Brotherhood, and Revelations are better because of the difficulty. 

Anyways, good luck on your playthroughs! The series only gets better from there.",1664582562

She said something along those lines, I'm paraphrasing, ""I don't play on what I have, I play on what you have and I knew you didn't have jackshit""

Meaning she was betting that he wouldn't complete his hand and that she would win with her Jack alone, because I'm 100% she wasn't expecting *that* to happen.

She called her bluff. She saw he wouldn't back down. So she went all in to scare him to avoid the risk posed by the remaining to be turned card.

He didn't back down, the card didn't came up, and, as she said it ""you keep doing that to yourself"". His bluff was called, he should have fold, but he didn't.

When I play the odds like he did, I'd never let someone force me to put more than half my bank if I don't have my hand ready. 

If I do it, it's because I wanted to do it, not because someone is calling my bluff, that's how you get plucked like him lmao.

Because with 87cc, shoving gets the fold equity but is still +EV if your opponent calls (unless your opponent happens to have a blocker like Jc). With KQcc or QJo, you're -EV if your opponent calls.

&gt; It's incredibly rare to be able to narrow an opponent down to a specific hand.

Sure, but I'd argue that this can reasonably be one of those rare situations.

&gt; What about if he shoved with a 10x hand repping the semi bluff.

What would he get called by? Bluffcatchers which would also call on the river, or better hands. Shoving pushes out all the simple draws which are his main value if he has 10x.",1664582563

[I've set up a GitHub sponsorship.](https://github.com/sponsors/HexDecimal)
A few times I've asked if I could be supported financially but I've never had anything to respond with until now.  I kind of worry that this is an admission that I'm only going to work on libtcod, tutorials, and engines forever without ever making a game, but I'm hoping I'll at least expand into other topics in the community.

Working on that was causing me a lot of anxiety and was really draining. I don't feel happy with it's current state but there is no effective way to ask for advice on this without making it public, plus leaving it as a draft was distracting me from working on other things.  My expectations for this are low, but I want advice what I should be doing for anyone signing up for this.

&gt;. If u didn't argue against the fact that a lot of white ppl had slaves why are u arguing with me then? Didn't say anything wrong, u just don't personally like it.

You did say something wrong, I don't even need the screenshot anymore you literally just said it again. Which is ""Most if not all white people did have slaves in America"".

&gt;And yes 1 in every 3 ppl owning a slave. Everyone owned a slave at that point. Comparing 30% of the population having a slave does not equal a test score, unless one in every 3 ppl had that grade but u said urself in a singular way. Stop making shit comparisons.

You're huffing way too much copium. ""Everyone owned a slave at that point"" then you immediately follow it up with saying it was 30% of white people. Give me a source saying everyone owned slaves, you can't. You're saying most if not all white people in America had slaves, that is not true at all. It was 30% in 11 states. Idk if you realized you're wrong so you're just messing with me or you're on drugs or something.

&gt;If it's not comparable then why are u asking me if I have clothes made in sweatshops then? U asked me this like it was ""gotcha moment "" bcs u and ur ancestors profited off of blk ppl. And yes if I did buy stuff from their, I would criticize myself for buying such products. Ross is basically a thrift store. Most of shirts there don't even have a brand. I would hope the store doesn't sell products like that.

I'm saying it's not as severe, not that it isn't comparable. You've once again misinterpreted what I'm saying due to your lack of reading comprehension skills.

I don't see why you think it not having a brand would mean it's not from a sweatshop, if anything that would increase its likelihood of being from one since you'd need to find specific brands that don't source their products from sweatshops. And you don't even seem to understand how common clothing brands are from sweatshops. And same goes for the large majority of electronics, including your phone.

&gt;Your counterargument is literally that. If it wasn't then u wouldn't have asked me that question in the first place. And my counter argument is that they're incomparableü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not that.

No your counterargument is that slavery is more severe than sweatshops, which for some reason makes you think you can't compare the situations.

&gt;No but I do run to places I need to go. Also how has it gotten cheaper? The inflation is awful rn. None of the stuff I've down in society benefits from wat the U.S. has done in the Middle East. Foods at my store have gone up way higher in price, and I don't own a carü§¶üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Holy shit you're actually this dumb. It would take so many paragraphs for me to explain to you on why the US invaded Middle East and how that.

Like your counterargument to something that is pretty common knowledge at this point, which is the US invaded the Middle East for oil, is ""Oh yeah?? Then why inflation raise food price at store??"" bro what in the fuck does inflation have to do with the US invading the Middle East for oil??? Like you just have no clue what you're talking about at all.

&gt;Yeah, Obama is mixed so he would be part white stillü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

No he wouldn't because he's not white, and is your argument here that white people are genetically racist or some shit? If so then what are you trying to say with Obama being partially white.

&gt;If 57% of the population is white then that means the rest of the 43% is poc which is divided up even more bcs of different races. And yeah it would be to insult white ppl considering they commit the overwhelming majority of war crimes.

Source for it being overwhemingly white people specifically committing war crimes? 57% is not overwhelming, war crimes are rarely done by a singular person, it's done by a whole group, and the group is only statistically 57% white. And what's your point here is extremely racist btw.

&gt;It's the same way ppl consider the USA white despite white people only take up only 57.8%.

LOOOL theres no fucking way someone is this dumb. America is literally called the melting pot ü§£ü§£ü§£ holy shit am I talking to an 8th grader right now? Or a 6th grader because even they know America is called a melting pot üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄwho tf considers the US white üíÄüíÄ

&gt;That does not sound like a system put in place but moreso greedy companies abusing shit.And no, gas was atrocious this year. In some towns, it goes up to like $5 and in others like $4. On the other hand though, I'm born into a racist system that values people with white skin and has made that very apparent with their past actions. Also Canada is the country we get most of our fuel from, with it being over 50%. ""Is this a serious question? How tf do you think the food gets to the store? You think they have a magical wand that makes it appear? Do you think transportation is free???""

Gas prices rising this year have absolutely nothing at all to do with the US invading the Middle East largely due to oil. The fact you think those two things have any correlation at all is mind blowing. The US invaded the Middle East decades ago at this point, you do know that right???? And the US getting oil mainly from Canada doesn't matter at all Saudi Arabia is out 2nd biggest contributor, do you think Saudi Arabias prices doesn't have MAJOR influence over the market??? And the US also invaded due to parts of Iraq changing from selling oil in USD to the Euro for international sales. The US wants international sales in USD so they can make more loans for international sales, which is another way you benefit, since that helps imports greatly which includes food, clothing, electronics, etc.

The US invaded the Middle East for loads of reasons, but oil was a huge part of those reasons.

&gt;No bcs they aren't the same. It'll be easier transport. Not easier to buy. Obviously they're not gonna lower prices just bcs it's easy to transport. And yeah, inflation just says no.

I can't believe someone can think this one-dimensionally. Just because inflation raises the prices doesn't mean the US lowering the prices through invading and exploiting the Middle East doesn't happen or influence the prices. Without the invasion and explotation, the prices would be higher.

&gt;It's not really a privilege to live in america if I'm scared of dying here bcs of the color of my skin

Are you joking? It's an insane privilege to live in any developed country, especially America. You are privileged to be able to comment right now and reply to me on reddit. You are privileged to have running water. You are privileged to have a strong military that doesn't allow countries like the US to bomb your school with a drone strike. I could go on with literally thousands of other examples the fact you think it's not a privilege to live is insane.

&gt;Being poor doesn't make u oppressed, that just a flaw of capitalism.Also doesn't help that the reason most of the blk community is poor is bcs of shit like the war on drugs and just major funding spendings elsewhere. These reasons are bcs systematic racism. It most definitely isn't a privilege to live here, especially during times like Jim Crow, which is what my Grandma lived to and im not even 20 yet. I don't think understand how stupid u sound telling a blk dude that he should be happy he lives in this racist country. I should actually be worried if this is the best we got bcs unfortunately other continents like Asia, Europe, and South America are racism hasn't even remotely been checked unlike U.S.A. Nothing u said made me happy at all and just moreso depressed.

Don't know why you're bringing up Jim Crow that is in the past and being poor makes you oppressed. That's literally the reason so many black people are oppressed, because old racist laws like not allowing them to buy a house hurt their generational wealth and put white people ahead. Oppression against poor people is literally one of the biggest contributors to systemic racism, it's literally the reason why black people commit crime more, because the system doesn't have the proper resources to help poor people so they resort to crime.

^(By: Hugh Laurie | 340 pages | Published: 1996 | Popular Shelves: fiction, humor, mystery, thriller, owned)

&gt;When Thomas Lang, a hired gunman with a soft heart, is contracted to assassinate an American industrialist, he opts instead to warn the intended victim - a good deed that doesn't go unpunished. Within hours Lang is butting heads with a Buddha statue, matching wits with evil billionaires, and putting his life (among other things) in the hands of a bevy of femmes fatales, whilst trying to save a beautiful lady ...and prevent an international bloodbath to boot.

"NarcoFootage","t5_2gl708","Skinning and burning alive still happened.  Just out of respect for the victim's families the news would just say they were killed.  Sort of like when someone commits suicide, the news often says they ""died suddenly"" because they don't want to say ""John shot himself in the mouth on Saturday.  Co-workers said he was depressed.""  So they will say ""John died suddenly on Saturday after battling with health issues for many months.""

Pablo Escobar is probably the first person to refer to drug gangs as ""cartels"" in the first place.  The idea was to show some type of organizational legitimacy.  The governments ran with it though and found ways to illustrate organized crime in a fresh way by calling them ""drug cartels.""  In reality, these organizations are just gangs.  A collection of punks and thugs who kill each other over who controls the protection racket that oversees smuggling or drugs, people, and other industries.

People in this sub continue to get it wrong and think that every drug gang has this vertical silo they operate in.  The truth is, like any other gang, a gang controls criminal activity in an area.  If you operate within this area, you pay protection money to that gang.  Rival gangs will fight that gang over who collects protection from you.

So if you're a smuggler and you pay CDS, are you a CDS member?  Or do you just operate under CDS extortion?  DOJ will say you're a member so they can get higher sentencing when they send you to prison.  But the reality is you'll work under whoever keeps your operation going.",1664582565

"Healthygamergg","t5_26y265","I've had a few romantic relationships, and two true relationships, during my short 22 years long lifetime. 

Every time that I was not romantically involved with someone, I was always longing for another relationship. I am fine with being a virgin (as I am waiting fo rmarriage due to personal beliefs that have nothing to do with faith). 

It's been more than a year that I'm single. And frankly, ever since then, I've been in love with only one person, but decided to not pursue that relationship due to multiple reasons that would make the relationship difficult. 

That one event made me long for another relationship. But, after I realized that it would be a sinking ship, I decided to not pursue any relationship.

*I just sort of stopped giving a fuck about dating and finding a partner.*

There is so much more to life that just finding a stable relationship. I am now more focused on making music, learning guitar, writing a book I wanted to write for a long time, working out, working, and other things. 

Once I realized that I don't need a partner to have a fulfilling life, I stopped feeling the need to have that sort of a relationship with someone. It doesn't bother me anymore.

A couple of my friends told me their opinions on this. Some of them said that people like me have a big trouble in terms of love, because I don't dive into relationships head-first, and consider other aspects of a relationship with their potential partner, rather than just romantic love and sexual attraction. Others said that they know what I'm trying to do, as they believe that one finds love only when they stop seeking for it.

But honestly, I'm not doing that. I don't expect that I'll ever have a romantic partner or fall in love with literally anyone ever again. I expect that I'll be alone for the rest of my life. 

And I am okay with that. I am now more happier than I ever was.

However, at the same time, I miss that feeling of being in love. Not that much, but, you know, it'd be nice. To put it more simply, sure, I'd have a burger right now, but I don't really need it to make me happy right now, as I am not hungry.",1664582566

I don't watch too many regular season NFL games, but am I right in thinking that each conference is split into groups of teams, so like AFC east, west and so on? Maybe confusing my sports there haha!

In response to your other comment, the World Cup match between you guys and us should be interesting - we're having a pretty terrible run of draws/losses, and the USMNT seems to have improved massively in the last 20 years, so I suspect itll be a closer contest than people think!

I was shocked, and destroyed at the time because this was how I supported my wife and our newborn and I feared that not only would I lose my job but could also get into trouble for hearsay. 

Luckily for me, my supervisor had my back. Pulled me off installs and had me doing pole work to keep me out of customers homes. Come to find out she was calling customer care 5-6 times a day to see what the status of my investigation was, turns out she admitted on the phone with one of the care reps that she just wanted to try and get free cable and internet for life‚Ä¶.

"diabetes_t1","t5_2vzrv","Yeah- but it was a pain-in-the-ass to get it done! That said, I do highly recommend if something isn‚Äôt working for you supply-wise to consider appealing whatever bad decision the insurance people try to force on you (you‚Äôd be surprised how often it happens).

"law","t5_2qh9k","I'm a lawyer but this isn't an area I'm particularly familiar with. My initial reaction is that, Constitutionally, this could implicate the full faith and credit clause, and (much more tenuously) the dormant commerce clause. I believe the current reading of full faith &amp; credit is that it primarily applies to final judgments, so probably a good argument it doesn't apply here, but I believe there's also a counter argument that it could/should. It also seems like a state insisting federal subpoenas comply with state laws would be a Supremacy clause issue. 

To clarify, I think CA probably is okay, but since the question was ""legal pitfalls,"" that's what I'd likely issue spot to delve into. Maybe someone with more subject matter expertise has more insight.",1664582568

"science","t5_mouw","I was a little disappointed to not see interaction terms between husband's employment and share of housework; purely anecdotal, but among couples I know (and in my own experience), a common trigger for divorce is that the husband becomes unemployed or underemployed, but doesn't increase the share of housework he does, as well as being home most of the day, generating more housework to do. Therefore I would expect to see a synergistic interaction between husband unemployment and share of housework.",1664582568
"196","t5_2v92f","It looks like if bones could get teratomas",1664582568
"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","Practical advice:

1. Stop writing. Don‚Äôt force yourself to write and assume good pages will magically land on the page. 

2. Outline what you‚Äôve got. 

3. Apply your outline to a simple structure. Inciting incident. What happens by page ten. End of act one. Start of act two. Midpoint. End of act two. Start of act three. How does it end?

4. Then finish the simple outline. Probably easiest to figure out the ending first.

5. Then finish drafting. You might have to rewrite parts of act one / two. 

That‚Äôs your fastest route to a finished, congruent story.",1664582568

But anyway, I FINALLY got someone with 1900 and several of the same 60 plebs I also started with. I felt bad for him as all I get are uber teams BUT at least I did a mistake tackle 1 minute in and got a direct red LOL .. so it evened out as I was 10 man. match was exciting as hell, we both attackeda as mad, great stuff and was inally an even, nice exciting match.. I pulled off a 0-1 but he had quite a few shots .. to be fair on him, if he even had my 3 star sadiq or something he'd put 3-4... his plebs kept blasting over lol. Well, back to getting 2700 stupid crap and jut having a miserable introduction to the game.. sstill, an even, win christ.

The math equations themselves provide no other benefit other than allowing the crypto to exist. All of that computing power and electricity and fossil fuels creating the electricity could be used to perform work that actually provided some tangible benefit.

I'd recommend Honda HART Advanced 1 as it deals with low speed manuevering, emergency braking and swerving to avoid danger and I got to ride some 650's which was fun, I'll probably schedule in to do their Advance 2 courses some time.

Stay Upright has a course called Roadsmart 1 which I think is suitable for people who are getting confident on the road It's does have some low speed maneuvering and emergency braking but also cornering technique's at decent speeds 

You use your own bike though and the environment is sort of like a closed off track like a normal road width so the speeds are much faster than Honda courses.

I've also done Roadsmart 2 which is more for intermediate skilled riders I would only recommend this one once you're more experienced its more about being fast but still being safe.",1664582571

"LowSodiumCyberpunk","t5_3jhabn","What is the source on this ""originally planned 2nd expansion"" claim I keep seeing people make?

As far as I remember they merely said that the DLC was going to be as LARGE as Witcher 3's DLC not that there would be 'AS MANY'. [\[SOURCE\]](https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-will-get-at-least-two-dlc-expansions-which-will-be-announced-before-launch) 

and quote

&gt;Kici≈Ñski revealed that players can ‚Äúexpect [expansion size] no less than Witcher 3.‚Äù 

They may have more content in this 1 expansion than in both of the Witcher 3's. 

So if you could please source where they said they originally planed to do 2 expansions I would be grateful. Because I keep seeing it brough up but have yet to find any source stating as much. 

The only claims I recall them making are these: 

1.) At least one large expansion the size of the Witcher's 3's expansions.

2.) An entirely separate and standalone multiplayer mode, 

3.) Multiple Small Free DLC throughout the life of the game (i.e. Apartments, Edgerunners stuff, potentially more)


I think that people interpreted the claims of my 1st and 2nd points as meaning they are aiming for 2 expansions. 

Which is still true if you want to consider the multiplayer an ""expansion"" even though they don't. 

I'm just going to leave a link to a comment I put in another thread with sources to their roadmaps and a bit more of my take on the issue.

But after listening to him today, Ronaldo was in a bad place in his life and he sought some mental counseling (prolly related to his child's death and turmoil in his career in a way). Now my question is how was he wrong in any way at all?  JP mentioned that Ronaldo was in a bad place and Ronaldo's friend suggested him JP's books/philosophy which helped him get through the tough times. 

The amount of hate he received here on this subreddit for posting a pic with JP or after JP's quote was actually insane. 

And then there is basically the entire Brazilian team who supports this dangerous fascist Bolsonaro and they still get less hate combined compared to Ronaldo who sought counseling after the death of his child. For me what Ronaldo did isn't even comparable to anyone supporting Bolsonaro. Those two things aren't even comparable yet the hate on Ronaldo is so much more even on platforms like Reddit which I consider to be progressive, educated, and empathetic.

"OverwatchLeague","t5_34k05","Ig. But surely smurf or Hanbin would still be WAY more valuable to them.


Also Hadi is not the best Rein in the league imo, he's just got the most practice and playtime on rein in OW2. 

In a hard Rein meta, Fearless, Smurf, Reiner and Gator could all go toe to toe with him.

Although tbf maybe I'm under rating Hadi, because the last time we saw Gator and Fearless ( and Super and Jjangu) on rein was when Hadi was on a terrible team and on ping so maybe I'm not being fair.

I honestly feel like even at Hadi's specific role could still be done better by other players who have demonstrated that they are the best reins in Rein meta's. 

But ig what Hadi did is more than just be a good rein, since him and London essentially invented the Rein brawl playstyle and that requires a lot of intelligence and skill.

So maybe, you have a point idk.",1664582573

With a centrally controlled economy, industry and government are one and the same, and therefore beholden to nobody but those in power.

"Evernote","t5_2s9r5","I just can't imagine staying with Evernote that long if what you wanted was a good text editor.  Most of the Evernote complaint threads seem to be by people who'd be better served by using something else, like Keep or Apple Notes or better yet, Obsidian or one of the other connected writing apps.  If you don't care about the web clipping, OCR, email forwarding, etc why on earth would someone stick to it?  The search across images or PDF etc doesn't do you much good for text, any lightweight editor could handle that simple task.

This isn't about you specifically, I guess I pay attention to software more.  There certainly was a time when Evernote was slow, bloated and obsessed with dumb shit like merch, but they seemed to have course corrected a little while ago.  I have thousands of notes of various media, etc. and I never see the slowdowns that are part of this template.

It's possible the influx was just those missed views catching up! But I also feel like it's possible Redbubble messed up and just drops a bunch of views sometimes and it just seems like an influx later. Redbubble's response was that ""once it has refreshed, the view count should be accurate.""

"1022","t5_2v7cn","My personal opinion is that ‚Äúhome defense‚Äù and in a moment of truly needing to ‚Äúdefend your home‚Äù with a firearm, it is going to be an extremely quick decision and action. Unless you have a rifle loaded sitting on your nightstand or leaning against your bed, anything more than a handgun is not really a PRACTICAL home defense weapon‚Ä¶ in real life scenario. (I mean, unless your home satellite picked up a disturbance and rang the red phone on your nightstand with 10 minutes notice) - its going to be kind of dif√≠cil y in a timely manner to unzip your rifle out of its case, load it, and get moving for close combat in your home. 

And as background reference, my absolute favorite firearm that I own are my 22 LR variations. We have 223 AR rifles and shot guns in our home as well. However, in my nightstand sits my Glock 9mm for GOD FORBID, and I mean GOD FORBID I am ever in a situation where I need to defend my home.",1664582577

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","I‚Äôm the mom of 3 boys with a wonderful husband. We‚Äôre not the best housekeepers but as he does help me out a lot. I‚Äôm just overwhelmed and not great at organizing my thoughts let alone my possessions and the possessions of 3 small humans who seem dead set on undoing any progress I make. But I digress‚Ä¶

My husband is the ‚Äústrange‚Äù one in his family. He‚Äôs the only one who left Miami, raised by conservative parents in a very traditional Hispanic home where his mom does everything for everyone. He doesn‚Äôt have a relationship with his mother now for 7 years because she has a hard time respecting his boundaries. 

I‚Äôd say he we changed each other a lot. Maybe it‚Äôs better to say we grew together. I was always a feminist, he was not but after years of constructive discussions (sometimes very heated) he‚Äôs a feminist. He‚Äôs an upper level manager and I‚Äôm very proud of the work he does to advance diversity and inclusion in his workplace. 

We are purposely raising our sons to be feminists. We support their expressions of emotions, whatever they might be feeling. We‚Äôve started young trying to teach them bodily autonomy for themselves and others. To do their parts around the house. I also have a very close relationship with them, especially my oldest who is 11. He feels comfortable to talk to me about anything. We‚Äôve used gentle parenting techniques, so we believe in natural consequences instead of punishments and I think that has made my kids very trusting in us. I‚Äôd never hit my children or allow them to hit each other. 

I think a big impact on my kids will be the way my husband and I treat one another. Luckily for us we are very much in love even after 15 years together but I think for people who are not together anymore you can still teach great lessons by being respectful to each other but also by you not allowing men to treat you badly. Set a good example in your relationships. If you had a daughter and you wouldn‚Äôt like her boyfriend or spouse treating her that way, don‚Äôt allow anyone to treat you that way either. 

I obviously have a lot of thoughts and opinions on this subject.",1664582577

Fairly or not, the effects we attribute to the drug are often claimed by medical professionals to be due to psychosis, so it's worth considering whether you might be dealing with a post-psychosis syndrome as well or instead.

"MandJTV","t5_3hh9j","Honestly, I didn't really want dp remakes in general. I honestly felt like they aged well enough to not really ""need"" a remake. With Firered/Leafgreen, and HGSS, it made sence, since you weren't able to transfer pokemon from the original games, and they worked to flesh out the worlds a bit. Oras also made sence, since it helped to flesh out the lore a bit more, and introduced the hoenn region to the dual screen, which allowed them to do a lot more than they could have on the gba(more of a sort of spinnoff mainseries in the same region than a direct remake). With Diamond/Pearl however, the world was already pretty fleshed out, and didn't really feel outdated enough to need it. I feel like the same also applies to BW, and B2W2. Neither game really feels outdated enough to actually need a sequel. They felt like they were packed with content, the animation and artstyle still looks amazing, and the story and region are incredibly fleshed out.",1664582577

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Years ago when I was in China, many (most?) drivers regarded wearing a seatbelt as some sort of shameful statement that told everyone that you weren't a very good driver.    I'll say that again - they believed that wearing a seat belt meant you were a bad driver, because they think only bad drivers are unable to avoid a crash.

And because of that, the first 3-4 minutes of *every* trip consisted of continuous beeping from the car until it eventually timed out and gave up.

When I questioned it, I was told by everyone else in the car that the noise would stop soon.  I was the only one wearing a seatbelt.

Don't even @ me about the fact ur grandparents came here when segregation was still kicking and contributed to the system. The reason that middle eastern example doesn't work is bcs that isn't a system put in place to oppress middle easterners. But more so to profit off the land they live on while not enslaving the natives, unlike European colonization.

My ancestors had nothing to do with oppression in America, my grandparents came here and had no contribution at all to segragation. And how did my Ancestors try to profit off of African people? The Polish government did, and I'm just taking your word for that. Like said this is like me saying you tried to profit off of less privileged people in the Middle East just because of the US goverments actions. Your critical thinking skills are terrible.

&gt;No, I just genuinely have nothing to do with thatüíÄ. Those are war crimes done by racists bcs they don't like middle easterners

If you think we invaded the Middle East simply because we thought ""Middle Easterners bad!"" you're unbelievably uneducated on the subject.

&gt;. That also isn't a system so it wouldn't be comparable since America doesn't set up a system in the middle east where they oppress the middle easterners for the color of their skin. Shit comparison.

The American system is oppressing them, this is literally apart of our system. The funding to our military is one of the most expensive government expenses. Youre so dumb lol. And my comparsin has nothing to do with Skin Color, it has to do with not blaming innocent civilians for corrupt government actions. You've once again misinterpreted what I said, lol.

&gt;Ur ancestors weren't born in the same spot as me, especially if they weren't oppressed for their skin color. We're only similar bcs we're in shit systems. That's literally it.

Yes you are both similar in the way you have governments that did shitty things you didn't contribute to. Only issue is you're saying my ancestors contributed to it simply for being born there.

&gt;Wat happened to u saying u wouldn't reply anymoreüòπ?

Good point, now that I just shit on you and exposed you for having literally no knowledge about the Middle East or really anything I'm gonna go.

"Salamanders40k","t5_vso3f","I'm not the biggest of fan of Tactical Marines, they're probably best to sit on a objective, but if that happens there's no point of having a Soecial Weapon upgrade (as it not only probably won't be in range but it pushes them at the regular Intercessor points cost. Not to mention Intercessors built in AP and better range. I don't really see them as skirmishers in the mid field either, though it could work

As far as HQs go it seems decent, I'm a bit iffy on the Librarian, Salamanders Psychic powers are great defensively, but I prefer the offensive capabilities of Vulkan to buff up some Eradicators. 

I like the addition of the Redemptor, it's great Anti-Elite Infantry and Anti-tank with that Plasma of his.
Not sure about those Assault Marines, by the looks of things they're kinda just there. 

Overall I could see it working out, if your willing you could spend a Cp to give the Chapter Master Captain a second Warlord Trait, my personal favorite is +2 Toughness. There are some changes I'd make (like dropping the Bladeguard and Assault Marines in favor of more Aggressors. Potentially dropping the Tactical Marines for more points in other directions, possibly some Helblasters) but it can do work, decently mobile with the VanVets and Outriders. For secondary choices Promethium Creed is great for Eradicators to sit on and delete things every turn. I've found Codex Warfare to not be that bad either, hardest part is securing the kill with the weapon you want, but a combination of Heavy Melta Rifles/Multi Meltas/Dreadnoughts can usually get at least one kill, preferably two. The third one has been difficult for me personally to get, though with your Mobility afforded by VanVets and the Outriders you have a good chance of stealing objectives from non-objec units and potentially just gunning down actual obsec units for Shock Tactics.",1664582579

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","&gt;Waking up in a different world is a call to adventure?

Yes. Dorothy is literally transported into a new world as a way to get her to accept a journey. She does have ""options"", btw. She could accept her journey or she could have literally said to the Major of Munchkin Land, ""Wow! I'm a hero! That's amazing! Since my house and all my stuff are here, I think I'll live here in Munchin Land."" I mean she was like 10 and hated her farm, it's not like not wanting to go back was outside the realm of possibilities. 

&gt;That seems kind of like a cheat

I mean so is killing a character's entire family and destroying their home, so that they have no choice but to leave their ""normal"" life. A trope used in both Star Wars and Eragon. 

&gt;the only way it wouldn‚Äôt be a call to adventure then is if the character continued to just lay on the ground and do nothing but breathe

I mean.... Luke could have totally just been like, ""Nah, I'm good. I'm gonna stay here and rebuild my farm and bury my Aunt and Uncle."" 

It's that way with any call to adventure. They are all major life events that reveal a new world of possibilities to the main character. 

&gt;Is Alice in Wonderland one?

Yes. For the record, though, Alice's call to adventure is following the white rabbit instead of studying like she's supposed to be doing. 

There are a million and 1 Hero's Journeys in literature and media. Google it and you'll come up with 2 or 3 dozen lists each with 100 different examples. 

&gt; I think comic book superheroes are a little too cut and dry with the hero‚Äôs journey

I think you're confusing the Hero's Journey with the villain archetype. This is the [Hero's Journey](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-FWHmbLutkKg/Xr1LKRGXKbI/AAAAAAAAgl8/dmmsqQiJOPgF0zYzVPjCxXKHL5GWSWjpACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Heros%2BJourney%2BGraphic.jpg).

Basically, we have prioritized our child's well-being &amp; the joy of being fully present in her life, seeing her grow &amp; thrive. So maybe present it to him as such.

"GrowBuddy","t5_6azqlx","That light isn‚Äôt what you want. It will destroy your eyes, tell all your neighbors you‚Äôre growing, and it won‚Äôt produce high quality flower.

If you‚Äôre going budget Amazon lights just stick with the mainstream mars hydro/SpiderFarmer lights. For lights there are far better markets than Amazon. 

I‚Äôm willing to bet that light says something like ‚Äú1000watt led grow light!‚Äú 

That‚Äôs a total lie. They have, say, 500 2 watt led diodes installed. This allows them to claim ‚Äú1000 watt led‚Äù since that‚Äôs the maximum amount those diodes could take. HOWEVER! The driver (power supply) will only be rated somewhere 100-300 ACTUAL watts. So it‚Äôs actually a way weaker light than they advertise it as. 

1000 1 watt diodes, 100 10 watt diodes, 2 500 watt diodes. All those could be marketed as the same title ‚Äú1000 watt light‚Äù. Yet then they are wired up to and powered by say a 50 watt power supply; it doesn‚Äôt matter what the total possible diode power is as the most I can ever supply them with that power supply is 50 watts. 



So when buying a light my thoughts are:

1) light spectrum. I don‚Äôt want a blurple light (like you have) as they emit a painful to look at intense purple light. Also this color of light is like shooting a bat signal in the sky except instead of calling Batman you‚Äôre asking for burglars and cops. ‚ÄúFull spectrum‚Äù ‚Äúdaylight‚Äù or ‚Äúsun like‚Äù are terms you‚Äôd like to see describing your lights spectrum. These will be referring to the mix of colors your light diodes emit, high blues help veg and high reds help flowering. Watch a video on spectrum I can‚Äôt explain it well.

2) ‚ÄúActual watts‚Äù or ‚Äúpower draw from wall‚Äù are terms you want to see when they describe the power usage, as these refer to the actual amount of power the power supply feeds to the diodes. Lots of Amazon lights will be posted as ‚Äú3000 watt grow light!‚Äù And even in the beginning of the description it repeats ‚Äú3000 watt grow light!‚Äù  But then all the sudden further down kinda hidden somewhere it will finally say something like ‚Äúlight actual draw 300 watts‚Äù. Ignore the ‚Äú3000‚Äù part they are trying to trick people with that. 

3) Lifespan/efficiency 
So when looking at lights you‚Äôll notice some have the diodes running near max power draw, while others have them way ‚Äòunder powered‚Äô. 
Example: light A says: 100 watt light 110 diodes. light B says: 100 watt 500 diodes. 

Given they use the same diodes, light A would be using almost 100% of its total capability, while light B is using 20% capacity. Light A I would expect to wear down/burn out much sooner as it is working each diode much harder. 

This then leads into efficiency, which is kinda two parted in my mind. There is efficiency of ‚Äúpower used -&gt; amount of light emitted‚Äù and also the efficiency of ‚Äúpower used -&gt; heat produced‚Äù.
The reason to care about the efficiency of power-&gt;light is that will determine your running costs. Please try to consider your yearly running cost just as much if not more than the initial buying price of the unit. If you pay 10 bucks more upfront but have a light that uses half as much power for the same light output, well you will have half the power bill for years which adds up to way more than that difference in initial purchase. 

The reason to consider the efficiency of power-&gt;heat produced is due to the fact that some lights you‚Äôll be able to run without the need for much cooling, while other lights may run so hot you‚Äôd have to invest more in the climate control, and that money could of just gone to a more efficient light rather than to extra fans and venting.



I haven‚Äôt checked in a minute but MIgrow use to have some nice comparison charts available for common grow lights. They are their own light company so double check anything they claim but it‚Äôs a good reference to give you an idea of what‚Äôs up in the market.

"canadahousing","t5_425dri","The grocery store isn't imposed price controls so the increases are gradual instead of sudden.

I get what you mean that there are awful landlords but nobody raises prices of anything by 40% unless the market can bear it.

This also cuts both ways, Rents are often WAY under market price and so that is basically the landlord paying a part of the renters living accomodation.

The actual real reason for rent increases btw isn't to pocket as much rent revenue as possible, it's to increase the property values as in rental real estate the price of properties is directly proportional to the revenues it generates.",1664582580

Also, from shopping there myself, it's very difficult to get a sure affirmative that an item you want is in stock, like I've gone with some assurance from the website that something is available and then it's not there.

* **Model of your computer** - For example: *""HP Spectre X360 14-EA0023DX""*
* **Your Windows and device specifications** - You can find them by going to go to Settings &gt; *""System""* &gt; *""About""*
* **What troubleshooting steps you have performed** - Even sharing little things you tried (like rebooting) can help us find a better solution!

I (40 f) used to manage a team of 15 multimedia producers to create video content for an online outlet run by a large media corporation. They were giving this outlet one last shot to turn around engagement and impact so I was brought it. No funds for promotion, no ads, etc (important later). They wanted me to improve results organically which I did. One of my staff (33m) was very entitled. He was a good cameraman, but needed direction. We would be producing a video on for example a mass grave  of war victims and he would use a suspence movie soundtrack. I would very professionally recommend changing it and he would feel offended. Small incidents like this would happen frequently. After 3 years and getting the results needed I resigned (health reasons) but take pride in having prevented the outlet from retiring. Now in full operation mode they have a budget for promotion and ads, and nominated some video content to awards etc. They recently received a silver award from a film festival for a video this male employee produced. We're a small ethnic community in our state and often run into eachother. Last time I saw him, he didn't say hi but only gestured his eyebrows as saying he acknowledged my presence lol. He then started talking about the award and I congratulated him. He said ""you always put me down and it's great satisfaction rubbing this award in your face. We're getting higher views  since you left"". I calmly responded ""higher views from paying for promotions are normal. As for your reward, silver is rewarded to every participant, and the only way to participate is by paying $1500 per entry. I could have shot something with my phone and still got silver. The award is useless "". He said I was lying and I told him to look it up. I wasn't lying and other friends nearby knew. He slammed the table next to him and left. I think he was rude and needed grounding but some former colleagues say I'm an AH for crushing his happiness. AITA?

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","See the comment below yours, you actually have to factor accuracy into these calculations. Otherwise archery fighting style does nothing, -5/+10 is stronger than ever before and against every single AC, etc. Rogues have a reliable method of advantage that bumps up their DPR. The value of advantage is also going to change depending on your target AC as well.

A better comparison might be a CL point buy rogue and CL PAM point buy Barbarian, who is attacking recklessly. Assume they both increase the main ability score at level 4. At level 5 the rogue will do 1d8+3d6+5, the Barbarian does 2d10+1d4+18(4x3+2x3), they will both be attacking with advantage, 20 vs 31.5. Against AC 16 you can apply the accuracy difference to get 20x0.878=17.56 for the rogue and 31.5x0.84=26.46 for the Barbarian. A difference of 8.9, or about 33% of the rogue‚Äôs DPD. This is simplifying the math by ignoring the fact the Barbarian makes multiple attacks, numbers will probably vary a little once that‚Äôs accounted for.

At some point the Barbarian will take GWM but that‚Äôs a lengthy discussion since its value depends on your target AC.

Except rogues are gonna be out of the way of danger in fights more often, their advantage doesn‚Äôt have the drawback of making them risk more incoming damage, level 5 is cherry picked since the difference is at its greatest between the classes here, and they can actually contribute out of combat.

None of that means a rogue should be so far behind an optimised Barbarian or fighter, but the difference comes from the optimisation tools available to those classes and not to rogue. Rogue can‚Äôt benefit from optimisation feats as much as other classes can. But in a world without feats they‚Äôre not really far behind. As illustrated by another commenter below advantage keeps their DPR up with the party‚Äôs ranger in this world.",1664582584

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Haha this. I read an article about criminals in my city doing this when some where In prison. They rang their friends on the outside to do home invasion of the family of this person who owed them money on the inside. When the guys turned up to the house no one was in it.( The police already went there and informed the owners) then they just waited till the people broke in and jumped the neighbours fence (where they were hiding)and pulled up to catch the guys inside the house red handed and armed with weapons. 

If they caught them before they went in the house then they couldn't charge them with home invasion plus attempted assault etc.. as the breaking in the house while armed showed pre meditated intentions of attempted assault or armed robbery on top of ahome invasion at the very least. They didn't want to catch them earlier as that would've been a lesser sentence so they waited till they broke into the house. I think in America your not allowed to do this as it's ""baiting criminals"" and that's not allowed but in Australia police can do that or well they did anyway. 

Also in Australia we have CIA and FBI operating with our Feds honing and staying up to date with techniques that are illegal in America, but legal In Australia so they keep doing I guess because maybe one day the laws will change in America and when they do the 3 letter companies will be at the top of their game with knowledge and experience when it comes to illegal techniques in America which would then be legal",1664582585

2. We started to get tons of request to extend it.
3. This change lets us extend the feature and we think long term people will really like it. Pat and Boz run VNR so they were able to make each program better as well as add PDFs for each one (Sample: [https://btwb.media/programs/vnr/Sample\_PDFs/First\_Strict\_Pull-up\_SamplePDF.pdf](https://btwb.media/programs/vnr/Sample_PDFs/First_Strict_Pull-up_SamplePDF.pdf)) . They already added two new programs and are working on many more.
4. We are already working on adding more programs from some of the best coaches. Should be up the end of the month and then on going.

We added more flexibility on how to plan the programs as well as letting users create their own(coming soon). We had to decide to either leave the feature alone and let it get stale or figure out a way to extend it. We decided on the latter.",1664582585

The only way your theory would make sense is if she had some sort of psychotic break or something like that and given her age, if she had a history of severe mental illness, it would have likely manifested decades ago.

"france","t5_2qhjz","Puis ce que je suis attaqu√©, je vais me justifier.   

Je ne vote plus depuis le referundum sur la constitution europ√©enne bafou√©. J'ai arr√™t√© de croire que la conviction politique existait encore dans les girouettes opportunistes sans vergogne qui font cari√®re sur les promesse qu'ils laissent au gr√© du vent.   
Selon moi, ils ne gouvernent plus pour le peuple, ils veulent gouverner le peuple. Le dresser le contraindre, le museler, le rendre docile et l'√©craser de leur toute puissance pour l'exploiter tel une ressource.

Depuis plus d'une decenie j'essaie d'attirer l'attention de mon entourage sur les d√©rive autoritaires et leurs mont√©es en puissance, coincidant avec la reduction des droit des citoyens.     

Je ne suis pas vaccin√©, j'ai choisit cette solution par d√©sob√©issance, j'√©t√© sur le point de me faire vacciner pour le bien comun, avant que macron ne rende le vaccin obligatoire pour circuler. Sa d√©cision √† exacerb√© ma d√©fiance √† son encontre. J'ai continuer √† porter un masque sans me plaindre car c'√©tait mon choix. J'en portait d√©ja un √† l'usine depuis le premier confinement, ce qui attisait les moqueries de ceux qui se sentaient sup√©rieurs en se pensant rebelles.
Je me suis pris des le√ßon de morale de tous ceux qui se sont fait vacciner pour pouvoir continuer √† jouir de leurs droits plus que pour proteger les autres.   
Au final je suis content que macron dise qu'il m'enmerde, je m'en r√©jouis m√™me, son m√©pris est moins sale que son respect.
 
De mes proches, j'ai re√ßu de la culpabilisation et un m√©pris gentillet.   
Triste de voir que tu aplique les m√™me m√©thodes, te sentant sup√©rieur aux autres par l'anciennet√© de ta prise de conscience.

"Rings_Of_Power","t5_5paxfb","For folks saying Cate is 5'8"" which is also much shorter than Tokien's 6'4"" Galadriel, this my recent post:  
**TLDR: CATE HAD NO ACTION SCENES UNLIKE CLARK!!**  
  
Clark is simply too short for the role.  
6ft 4in - Tolkien  
5ft 8in - Cate Blanchett  
5ft 4in - Morfydd Clark  
So, I know getting a 6ft 4in, super beautiful, good actress is almost impossible.
But, it is a lot harder filming a 5ft 4in actor around other actors who are taller on average.  
And with Cate, she had **ZERO** action scenes so it was easier to film Cate in a ""tall"" way.  
Not so with Clark, who is a fighter and her height is very obvious. Like, when she walked on the ship in ultra-dramatic slo-mo and all the soldiers were taller than her. There was no way to film that without showing her small stature.  
Contrast Clark's casting with Jackson's 5 Hobbit actors who were 5ft 5in - 5ft 7in, below average male height. Jackson didn't cast 6ft actors since it would be harder to shoot forced perspective.",1664582589

&gt;  
&gt;Maybe Ariel decided the hate was worth it because she and Ned were trying to shop the project around. We don‚Äôt know that.  
&gt;  
&gt;Zach was 100% in the wrong there. When you are 1/4 of a company you cannot make decisions without consulting the other 3/4. And that‚Äôs what boils down to.

"webflow","t5_30h5p","I'd say ~90% of our clients use the CMS. As you get better at Webflow, you realize how flexible it can make your sites, far more-so than you'd ever expected. 

Yes, they would only have to pay for the site plan. I'm not sure what those plans look like in terms of price anymore though with the recent price hike. No Workspace plan unless they want multiple team members to have their own Admin accounts. 

I haven't tested the Netlify approach because our clients don't tend to care about saving a few bucks - and I don't want to spend hours making the transition each time we launch. Really, it's just very marginal cost savings in exchange for creating a huge nuisance if the client ever changes their mind and wants to update the site. I have enough headaches as it is, but if we had a super frugal client, I may pitch the idea. 

Having said that, we're lucky enough to have found a customer base that doesn't fret over anything that's in the range of hundreds of dollars. For those starting out, it may be a bit more of a concern, so don't take my words above at face value.",1664582591

It appears you are trying to ask a question / requesting community feedback. This community tries to prevent questions from filling the subreddit feed. Please ask your questions in the pinned questions megathread (linked above).

More specifically, the automod has detected that your post is below 250 words in length, this generally means that your post is either a question or not substantial enough to be a post of its own. As usual, contact the moderators if you believe this isn't the case. However understand that if your post is in any way a question it will not be approved, as questions are limited only to the megathread. There are no exceptions.

If you are on mobile and cannot easily identify the dedicated megathread then search for the term ""Bi-Weekly Questions Thread"" in the subreddit search. The most recent post (linked above) is the megathread. On desktop this post is pinned to the top for ease of access. Not being able to find this designated megathread before posting is not grounds for posting questions to the subreddit proper.

Lastly, you are free to believe that not allowing questions to the subreddit proper is a bad idea than you are entitled to that opinion, however harassing the mods over this is not tolerated.

Man I slogged through the burpees today. This was easily the pissiest I‚Äôve been all month about doing them.

Knocked out 80 this morning in a Burpee Ski pyramid, or Skyramid, 5-10-15-20-15-10-5 cals and burpees. 11:54 to beat my buddy who had just bested my old PR. In his face!

After that I was just done. Grinded out 203 to go over 8000 for the month and end this. 8004 just too be sure.

With a mostly now unfucked wrist, I could think of no better way to finish the last few reps than with a flourish of [burpee curls](https://youtu.be/-IUUf7R7HEA) a la u/aks5311.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","So, I'll probably get roasted for this, and I'll probably deserve it, but... I still feel this way.  I'm actually a Lions fan. I love ARSB. Him listing the 20+ receivers drafted before him was my absolute favorite part of Hard Knocks.  If I was going to drop $150 on a football jersey, it would either be him or Hutch or Sewell. 

But... I think he's overhyped at this point for fantasy. His game log is 

1. 8/64/1
2. 9/116/2 (+ 68 rushing yards)
3. 6/73/0

That is one Amazing game sandwiched in between two nice games. I think there is a little bit of a perfect storm from a) the 8-straight games with 8 catches narrative, b) hard knocks love, and c) starting the season with 17 catches, 3 TDs and 230 total yards in the first 2 games that flew in the ""he's going to regress"" narrative. I think there will be more W3s of 60-80 yards, no TDs, and by EOY I predict him to look more like WR 20 than WR 8. 

I wouldn't pay top-10 WR to acquire him.  In a re-draft league I'd sell him for that price. (I happen to only own him in a keeper league where I can keep him for $5 next year - in that case while I would bet on him not being quite as good as his current value, I'm not willing to risk me being wrong and him actually being Kupp 2.0 so I'm actually not selling.)",1664582594

I think Joel, given his credentials and desire to bring the best out of the younger players would be a great appointment if was to take over the Two's.

There would be no doubt that our second tier side would be galvanised by having Joel walking tall with them.

A call this a win,win,win!",1664582595

Will MLB make the games start at the same time?  Will the front offices have a host of contingencies reviewed daily?  It's nuts that the plan will change daily if until someone clinches WC1.

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","Sure looks like a nice laptop! I can‚Äôt tell you too much about that specific one, but I can tell you some important considerations that I took when I bought an HP Spectre 13 few years back.

Test it in person. Do you like how it feels? Does it feel like a quality product? Is it too plastic? 

How is the screen? If you are playing outside, it might be nice to have a brighter screen. My screen is not as bright as I‚Äôd like, and something to consider.

Battery! I used to have a gaming PC with no battery life. Now I have a ultraportable with awesome battery life. I can now run a DJ controller for a portable wireless set up for about 2-3 hours which is fun!

Portability. Does that matter for you? Do you want something easy to throw in any bag? Or are you okay with something heavier? 

USBs. I messed up and my laptop only came with 1 USB A and 2 USBc. My partner broke one of my USBcs. Now, I barely have any room for USBs.

From the specs, it looks solid. But again, really see if you can try it in person to feel like you could be happy with it.

Edit: another good Q: does it need a GPU? GPUs can be power hungry, and if you got a gaming PC or console you‚Äôd mostly use, it might not be worth having that GPU in your music production laptop. They add weight &amp; energy consumption!",1664582596

The poster explained that I was wrong.   My research indicated they were correct.

Apparently (and maybe this varies from state to state) when you enter an off-leash dog park, you assume all risk since you know the dogs in the park will be off-leash.  In contrast, if you are walking your dog on-leash in in an leash controlled area and a loose dogs attacks your dog, the owner WOULD be liable.

"quityourbullshit","t5_2y8xf","Not sure if it's *by far* the best, though.

I think the choice between a Rivian and a Ford Lightning is mostly just a matter of taste ... they're quite evenly matched.

- Rivian's better if you want a futuristic, minimalist interior; Ford's better if you want a more traditional 'normal car' interior with physical buttons for stuff.

- Rivian's better if you want a slightly more compact truck; Ford's better if you want a full-size truck.

- Rivian's better if you want innovations like the gear tunnel; Ford's better if you want a more traditional truck that's compatible with all kinds of traditional truck accessories. (If you want a topper for the cargo area, for example, that will be very simple to get for the Ford. But your options are probably very limited for the Rivian.)

- Rivian's better if you want to get attention and want people to start conversations about your truck; Ford's better if you don't want attention and don't want to be talking to strangers about your truck all the time.

- Rivian seems to be better off-road, but most users won't need that capability.

- Both have excellent electronic systems and screens and such, but the Ford has a *much* better camera system.

- Rivian gets more praise for its handling and suspension feel; the Ford drives more like a traditional truck (which makes me think the Ford will probably handle better when towing).

- Rivian will likely have higher maintenance costs with an uncertain future for repair work and parts availability; Ford already has a huge dealer network for repairs, normal car shops will likely be able to do a lot of the work, and replacement parts are likely to be as affordable as any other Ford parts.

- While top trim examples of each are very close in pricing, a base model Ford can be (allegedly) bought for *much* cheaper than the base model Rivian. (From what I've seen, though, dealer markups right now are *insane* on the Fords. Not sure about the Rivian situation, but I think you can't get one *at all* right now unless you've preordered years ago.)

The way I see it, there's advantages and disadvantages to each. And which one is 'the best' will come down to a matter of personal taste.",1664582598

The fact he is a child does not negate the mistake, or the nastiness behind that comment. He should take from this experience an important lesson about prejudice and disrespect, and put it to use in that new school. What he said was undeniably prejudiced, what that had to do with his classmate's race is a secondary matter. Debate is a space for political discussion, not religious crusading. 

You and your son should learn: you are both respected and given equal rights; equal regard when you voice your opinions. You are also respected when you speak in regards to spiritual belief. Your son's classmate gets that same respect. Your son put down her religion and expected no consequences. Those consequences, as it turns out, are both real and very severe. Stop defending him, live and learn. 

His classmate deserves an apology for your son's nastiness, from your son.

Only other little things that come to mind are

1. LVP floors in the bathroom- I just had some installed in my house, and they seem waterproof, but I‚Äôd personally do a plank tile for the hardwood look in the bathroom. Probably not a big deal either way. 

2. I‚Äôd try to put my washing machine and dryer as far from the bedroom as possible for noise reasons. Not sure if you have wiggle room there. 

3. I‚Äôd want to be able to enter the walk in closet from the bedroom, but that‚Äôs just me. I also would make it a little deeper because I like some cabinets/ cubbies in a walk in closet.

Now that speaks more about them than it does about him! But of course you wont see it that way because Men bad right?

You are framing it dishonestly by saying he crept in and felt her up! She was black out drunk, unconscious and couldn't be brought round, not just sleeping, her friends were around her but Slick just walks in and thinks I'll cop a feel of her arm and neck? Or does he see her unconscious with her friends trying to wake her up and he says we better check her pulse, they say nothing to him, he leaves the room comes back in 5 to see if she's woke up yet! He only tries to take her pulse once, but comes back to check on her. 

Every girl he lives with said he was a good guy and never tried anything on them, he talks to them, listens to their problems, was always there for them, a good guy, you know a good guy that would check on you if you were drunk?

"bullcity","t5_2sv0n","Eno State Park just posted very strict leash requirements, even saying a that a first offense was a felony. This sounds ridiculous. From what I know of the Eno State Park and the Rangers there is that they have no desire to be Leash Nazis. What I see that is really  happening is people are taking their dogs off leash to swim primarily.  There's some dogs immediately to proceed to act like dry drunks given a quart of shine . They charge another dog they bite people. Then the Rangers get called out . Rangers sad. Some Rangers mad.

 I love to give dogs freedom and I love it for 
myself. I love to work with dogs untethered and unenclosed.  So if anyone reading this has a dog that they would like to take out and let Run free but feel uncertain that that dog may run away or it may bite somebody or it may attack another dog that's the kind of stuff I work with. I can help you get to the point with your companion where  you build a relationship built on trust.

"kollywood","t5_2qhqm","Saw the movie.

For context: I loved Bahubali, liked RRR, couldn‚Äôt watch 10 min of KGF. Big Mani Ratnam fanboy. I‚Äôve read the book years ago.

PS-1 blew my mind. After seeing Aishwarya in promos I was worried but she was so beautiful on screen. Trisha was stunning - I can guarantee you that you wont see them this beautiful in any other movie apart from PS-2 maybe. It is full paisa vasool just seeing those two.

Music album was good. But in movie except Ponni nadhi, all other songs were chopped. BGM with chants were goosebumps.

In Mani Ratnam movie, if 2 people talk - they won‚Äôt just talk, they‚Äôll be doing something in the background while they talk. You can see that here as well and it keeps the scene fresh. Cinematography is different - lots of closeups and war scenes were chaotic- as if you were running in the battlefield. No complaints.

Scene transition felt a bit weird. The beginning of the scene should take its time with some buildup, reach the main point and end on a high. that buildup is missing, most scenes they hit the high point at the start. So the movie feels long and rushed at the same time. It felt like the makers were conscious of time and wanted to say as much as possible within 3 hrs. But no, you cannot remove any scenes from the movie - it cannot be any shorter.

No elevation. No item songs. No duet songs. No hero intro songs. No slow motion walks. No one is screaming one-liners. BGM only helps the buildup to an extent. These are positives.

This is worth a watch or two.",1664582603

Yes it's nice to share things, WHEN EVERYONE IS FINE WITH IT. But this is very much an opt-in deal. If they want to keep their things to themselves, that is their right. The only thing I'd say you might as well share is dish soap and toilet paper. But when it comes to food, if they're cooking only for themselves, they have the right to keep their own ingredients separate. They are adults, and so are you. They aren't responsible for your food, and you aren't responsible for theirs. And just because you're okay with sharing everything doesn't mean they have to be.

I see how you can feel this is an anomaly and that you got premo genetics without any inconsistencies. But, this is a happening that you sometimes have to learn from the hard way. My first ever seed purchase was from ILGM. My first successful, germinated seed ended up appearing stunted because of the way it was growing. Even though it was supposed to be photo genetics, it was growing like an auto and I thought I did something wrong and scrapped my plant. I did some research the next day and it turns out, ILGM seeds have a high possibility of having an auto seed in a photo bag at 1:10 per 10 pack. Just saying, this is a possibility that can happen with any seed bank/breeder and to not rule out this being an auto. FastBudz420 breeds autos with genetics that yield in as quick as 80-90 days which is extremely fast from my understanding(just doing my first auto grow now). But, as for a photo? 10 days is entirely too impossible. I'm not saying you didn't buy a pack of photoperiods, but it's a possibility you accidentally got a bean with ruderalis genes which makes it an auto. Ruderalis genes are where autos get their grow quick tendencies from and I Imagine the more ruderalis in the mix, is what could make them grow faster.",1664582604

You're only going to carry four starters. Kikuchi and White should be left off. Add in 8 relievers (Romano, Garcia, Cimber, Bass, Mayza, Pop, Richards, Phelps). 

That leaves 15 spots. Assuming everyone is healthy you are probably running:

* 2B: Merrifield
* 3B: Chapman

"composer","t5_2sjib","Rhythm.

It sounds like the piece doesn't know whether it's in 3/4 or 4/4, or that you're trying to ""force"" a 3/4 meter on something that's 4/4 or vice versa.

Part of this is due to the accompaniment figure.

It sounds like it's going to be a typical 2 or 4 beat alternating bass from root to 5th.

it's very ""backwards"" and has lots of ""hiccups"" because of this.

How many of the pieces you modeled this on have an accompaniment figure like this?

I think ""fixing"" the LH pattern could help the RH not seem so out of place.

It doesn't help that you have 7 measure phrases and other odd groupings though.

But you also keep ending on weak beats. Like look at m. 13 - ending on beat 3 makes that sound like the downbeat and that run of 16th notes is 4 beats. In fact there's not a whole lot of reason m. 13 should be 2/4 like m. 12 is.

I mean, I'd almost guess that your 2/4 measure is actually not intentional, but instead because you were like ""it doesn't sound right, this needs to be on 1"" so you changed it there to ""fix"" the problems inherent in the rhythm overall.

_____

Now, I need to say something - and you need to be honest with yourself here - if this were ""The Jester"" or ""The Juggling Clown"" the rhythmic ""backwardsness"" would sound intentional and even charming. But without any hint of that, it just sounds like someone who doesn't know rhythm. So your rhythmic ""hiccups"" could be intentional, but it doesn't *sound like that to a listener* - because it starts of  with setting up expectations that it's going to be more ""normal"", but isn't.

So if you MEANT it that way, I would then say you can do better by changing the Title.

But if you didn't mean it that way, don't take the cheat way out by changing the title now. Learn to fix the rhythm. Do a survey of 50 other pieces in 3/4 with similar accompaniments and do what they do.

For me, a ""Juggler"" would have F# - A#/C# - C# - A#/C# - F# - A/C# as the accompaniment - root-5th-root on the beats, and the rest of the chord on the upbeats.

_____

This could be a charming piece for younger students. Market it to them.

Change it to F Major. Or G Major, or a more beginner-friendly key. There's not really any need to put it in F# - heck Gb would be better - and you introduce the Fx issue.

There's nothing wrong with it being in G, or A or E. But F# - unnecessary (now, again, a caveat: if this were in a book with pieces in each key, and your intent was to introduce double sharps by having a piece in a sharp key with an opportunity to add double sharps, it could work fine in the current key - but (intentionally - not accidentally :-)

Same with the triplet at the end. Why make it harder? Just make it some 8th notes or a dotted figure or an 8th and 2 16ths like one of the earlier figures in the piece.

It's like you're suddenly bringing in this new idea for no good reason.

You said that the left was violent, and I offered examples of how the right is equally violent‚Äî and I was looking at the long view. This is why I was incredulous, asking if you thought the right isn‚Äôt violent.

So no, the modern right in America is not full blown Nazi‚Äî they do have some, pretty openly‚Äî but they haven‚Äôt gone full blown Nazi. 

A comparison between the modern (specifically Christian) right in the US and the ‚ÄúMuslim right‚Äù in places like Saudi Arabia and Iran is pretty apt, not in scale but in spirit, including the terrorism.

Sage ‚ÄúBe devoted and committed‚Äù and 
Wailing Tree ‚Äúreconciliations.‚Äù 

Be willing to go the entire road- no matter how difficult or easy it is. Often times we commit ourselves to a decision but then go back and fourth on wether it is the right choice, the right time, the right angle. These cards are letting us know that there is no such thing as a perfect opportunity- being committed to our own growth and higher self is something we either need to revisit or strengthen. 

Moving forward with faith, strength and non-judgment is necessary. We are all invited to explore our own uniqueness and find our own destiny. Once we master this skill of non-judgment we are then able to let yesterday‚Äôs burdens go and welcome the present.

Okay so take Wrath out of the occasion because he was made from a Human, same as Greed. Sloth is just a big dumb muscular creature and since Males typically have larger muscles that makes sense but he wasn't written to be 'male"". Gluttony is the same, the design around him il
sn't anything to do woth being male rather just a fat thing. Pride being the Furher's son, I suppose Pride could have been a Girl, dunno if that matters. Envy however, Envy is very ambiguous. Some thing Envy is a girl, other say male other say non-binary. As a shape shifter it makes sense. But to call Envy ""male"" is potentially inaccurate. Lust is supposed to be alluring and attract people woth her charms like Havok. Since most the main characters are Guys, there are few targets for this to work on and to be honest, guys are historically more likely to fall for a flirting woman rather than the other way around.  Think of Sirens, how many times are they seen as Men?

Sure, I guess Lust could have been male but I don't think the story would have worked as well to be honest. Do you propose they change Lust to a muscular hot guy to attract.... Who? Hawkeye? She isn't the type that would fall for that as far as I see it. Who else?  Sure, they potentially could have made some of the other Homunculi seem more feminine but like, do we need Gluttony to be female, or Sloth? I guess Pride is the only one I see working but equally it seems likely for the Furher to want to adopt a son to carry on his legacy (as far as the public would be aware).",1664582608

You're likely to encounter some unsavory individuals on reddit. In particular, beware users who:

* are significantly older than you
* are seeking sexual favors/relationships
* are lying about their personal details
* are trying to scam you

Though we attempt to keep such users at bay: the reality is that many users will slip detection, or will actively avoid it.

"socialskills","t5_2r275","I understand you want people to talk to you and like you more. But in order for people to do that, they have to have a strong reason to do so. That comes from the quality of interactions you have had with them in person in the past. Do you talk to these people in person ? How have your interactions been with them ? Do you ask them questions and listen to what they say ? Do you answer their questions and do so confidently ? Do you bring positive vibes to your social interactions and do you leave people with positive impressions of yourself ? People notice the way you act and carry yourself around them. They take into account your self confidence and the vibes you give off.

There are verbal and nonverbal cues that signal to people you lack confidence and give off negative vibes. These are some of the tell tale signs. One is you text people way more than they text you. You probably text them everyday (or some high frequency), when they don‚Äôt even do the same to you. You‚Äôre probably sending them paragraphs, while they are sending you one word answers or sentences. Or you‚Äôre that person that emotionally reacts and confronts people when they don‚Äôt respond to you for whatever reason. People know when you are attached to them. Remember that friendships are not codependent relationships. You need to be living a separate life outside of your friends and not be depending so much on your friends for their time, attention, validation, reassurance, or approval. The truth is people are hardwired to be repulsed by neediness, clinginess, and desperation.

People also subconsciously attach you to the value you bring. Do you have skills, talents, or hobbies that can impact people ? Offer to help people in some aspect of life. People respect those kinds of things. Even if you can‚Äôt directly impact people, they will still respect you because you are actively doing something in life besides just socialization.

The detergent is what my PI told me to use, and I was more inclined to follow their instructions than this protocol. My PI was doing this with me bc I was being trained to do it. 

I've been running the supernatant I remove after incubating bears each time and i still do see the proteins expressed in the supernatant, which was why I thought it was a bread binding issue. I'm going to repeat this without detergent again.

"runescape","t5_2qwxl","A lot of the (rather ironic) complaints about people on this sub being complainy seemingly boil down to misinterpreting feedback that isn't explicitly positive as complaining.

Feedback does not necessarily come in the form of long-winded explanations or easily digestible bullet points. Sometimes, especially on social media like Reddit, it's easier to let your voice be heard in the form of a brief comment expressing the core of your view, which others can then up- or downvote to show their support for the sentiment being expressed. This can also take the shape of memes, which some people seem to misinterpret as ridicule or mockery of Jagex, rather than the more light hearted or satirical piece of feedback it really is.

It should also be noted that enjoying something, e.g. a game like RS, does not mean you cannot be critical of its flaws. If anything, it means you ought to be a harder critical than otherwise, as you have chosen to enjoy it in spite of its flaws. A fan who blindly ignores any and all flaws and exclusively focuses on the positive is, if anything, more damaging to the thing in question, as they will allow flaws to go ignored.

&gt; Do I care what a new cape that‚Äôs for 0.001 percent of players looks like? No. Do I care about the hardest boss not dropping enough bow parts to sell irl and buy a car? Absolutely not.

But you do care about people making posts on social media, otherwise you wouldn't have made this post in the first place.

And is the message of your post not also valid to yourself? Maybe not in the case of the game, but this very subreddit. After all, your message appears to be that one ought to simply leave rather than complain, so shouldn't that not apply to you and this subreddit? Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to attack you or anything of the sort, but shouldn't your message also apply to yourself?",1664582610

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Generals are nominated by congress and their ranks are as follows.

1.  Brigadier General
2.  Major General
3.  Lieutenant General
4.  General

The navy has a similar system, except they are called admirals.  Each additional star means you're at a higher level of command.

Generally, bases are either commanded by either a Colonel (one rank below a Brigadier General) or a Brigadier General.  A group of bases in the Air Force is under the command of a [Numbered Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbered_Air_Force) which are usually organized on a geographical basis, sometimes they are grouped by their function, those are commanded by Major Generals.  A [Major Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_commands_of_the_United_States_Air_Force) organizes all of the a branch's function under one command which is commanded by a Lieutenant General e.g. all of the bombers and the ICBMs in the Air Force fall under Global Strike Command, all of it's fighters state side fall under Air Combat Command, most of it's training units fall under Air Education and Training Command.  Overseas they are organized on a geographical basis.  The commander of the entire branch is a 4 star.

There are also Generals that are in charge of special programs that don't run a base, but those are generally the exception.",1664582611

"ftm","t5_2t9mw","I'm not on T yet, but I have to remember to use my inhaler twice a day. I used to be awful at it and would go literal months at a time without remembering to use it. Now I use 2 things:

1) Schedule: I take my inhaler before I get dressed and before I brush my teeth in the evening. Repeating this a *lot* of times may not have helped me get into a routine (that never happens for me) but it has built up an association between taking my meds and those 2 other actions (which I do every day), so when I'm doing/about to do one of those things, it makes me think of my inhaler and then remember to take it.

2) A sticker chart: this one is a little weird, but I basically just used square paper and small, plain circle stickers. The chart itself I keep somewhere obvious so it acts as a visual reminder (the stickers are coloured so it stands out in my field of vision). Putting the sticker on the chart also acts as another action to tie to taking my meds to help me remember it and, worst case scenario, I can see how much I'm missing (this helps if my symptoms get worse and I'm trying to figure out why).

No, COVID deaths and infections did not decline because the most at risk people died. That's an absolutely absurd statement. It's not like 30% of the world population died.  It's also not like people dying stops the rest from catching it, yet here we are with massively reduced transmission rates worldwide thanks to the vaccine. It's almost like this mystical science of ""vaccination"" has existed for over a century, and eradicated some of the worst diseases in human history. But hey, let's all turn on it because some orange cartoon man on TV told us to.

People who believe in everything Trump spews and his uneducated takes is actually way less than 30%. I'm not talking about Republican voters, many of which vote that way because of gay marriage, gender identity, abortion, etc. even when they actually detest Trump.

It is a challenging build to prog new fights with (less spammy meter generation helps a lot after first few pulls to get consistent heals, but other than that it is hard), that gets to properly shine in any content that's ran fully in farm mode, with everyone knowing what to do, when you want to make fight as short as possible.
