The challenge with demodex mites is that the mite is a common inhabitant of normal skin, with up to 80 to 90 percent of humans having it. So even if you get your skin scraped and there are demodex mites, it doesn't mean that they are causing your symptoms. 

What is more helpful is trying treatments aimed at demodex and seeing if symptoms improve. Better studied treatments for demodex include topical permethrin, oral ivermectin, topical sulfur, and oral metronidazole.

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","I gotchu. In order:

1. Rotations 
2. Off angles
3. Cover 

#Rotations
You find yourself immediately having to disengage the moment you move up. This is because you are rotating late. This leaves several periods where you are all of a sudden out of the fight because you take too long to rotate. It’s obvious you can aim so let’s try and maximize that uptime by constantly being a part of the fight. 

#Off angles
You sometimes use off angles but I want to see you use it more. You seem to always start in the main angle and this is hurting your uptime since you are either 

1. Just shooting the tank 
2. Taking too much damage making it dangerous for you to peek

By the time you realize you should’ve been in an off angle to begin with, you make crazy long rotations which is taking you out of the fight. Prioritize the angle first, your team doesn’t need you in main. 

#Cover 
Careful exposing yourself to multiple angles. I know you want to be on top of walls to see better but since you are standing on main the entire enemy team doesn’t need to try so hard to shoot at you. 

Good luck 👍",1722470401.0

I immediately terminated the remote session when I realized what was going on and proceeded to change all of the passwords in my browser password manager. However, I realized at that point, that the tech already got hold of the data on my browser password manager and personal documents stored locally on my PC. He then proceeded to change passwords to the accounts he could gain access to. I managed to recover most of the accounts by changing the passwords to stronger unique forms and added 2FA with my phone and also made sure to delete any odd devices present in accounts that had a device list (Just in-case you were wondering, yes there was an odd device on my Amazon account).

"movies","t5_2qh3s","2005 Bewitched is metafiction.

Metafiction is a term that describes texts that are self-conscious or ""aware"" that they are fiction:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafiction

This awareness is typically expressed in a playful or joyful recognition of literary rules or conceits within the text itself. 

One way that creatives create metafiction is by alluding to the falsity of a fictional world. This is sometimes called ""breaking the 4th wall"" (where multi-camera tv shows often featured sets with 3 walls that faced an area where the audience or creative team sat):

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall

There was a popular, long running tv show about a witch named Samantha Stephens who pretended to be a normal woman. Samantha was married to a normal man named Darrin Stephens. Their personal life was inflected by a series of relationships with other characters. Some of these characters were also witches and wizards. The show found comedy by situating the Stephens in normal, everyday frustrations in one act, having Samantha over-complicate things with magic in a second act, and then resolving things in a 3rd act.

A joke that you might have missed is that the Bewitched tv show was a remake of a movie called I married a witch:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Married_a_Witch

which was adapted from an unfinished novel that played with an enormous number of tropes from fiction. 

Ok?

The film images that a creative team takes this thread and decides to remake Bewitched (which is a remake) as a movie and accidentally casts an actual witch to play Samatha. The actress playing Samantha falls in love with the actor playing Darrin. They proceed to recreate the central conceit of the show in a way that blends or plays with the audience's awareness of the show's central elements, the characters' awareness of the show's central elements, and the actors' native timing and chemistry. A lot of very talented people appeared in this movie because they were excited about getting a paycheck and because the layering effect made for something a little bit different. 

This movie had two problems, though. 1 - they produced it for $85 million, which was way too expensive. 2 - it came too late. Bewitched went off air in 1972, which meant they missed their moment. 

>Are we supposed to understand that Hollywood writers have long been witches and they wrote their own families and situation into the show?

No.

I think we're meant to understand that a team of Hollywood creatives attempting to remake a show about witches inadvertently attracted the attention of actual witches and cast them in their remake of a famous show about witches. 

>I'm thinking about the bumbling Aunt Clara

Aunt Clara was a character from the tv show.

This is an example of the self-conscious or referential quality of metafiction at play: the real life writers were almost certainly patting themselves on the back for giving their actual witch character a witch aunt with the same name as a character in the show and then having her play the same role in their story that the character she was named after played in the original show.",1722470402.0

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","There is no magic formula here because it depends on your overall routine, age, body, and overall goals just for a few factors.

In general, heavier weights and fewer reps per set for bulking and building muscle size, but you have to be creative and tune things to your unique self and different muscle groups for your body might require different sets/reps so you don’t get injured/re-injured.

When I was in my prime some days I’d do 2 sets of 3 and 1 set of 2 really close to my max where I was struggling like crazy on the last rep on bench, just as an example, but would never do that with say a leg press machine with my knees.  Other times I might do 3 sets of 8, other times would start where I could do 1 set of 25 - 30 before burning out and then drop the weight by 10 - 20 lbs and do another set of as many reps as I could do, drop the weight by another 10 - 20 lbs and repeat until you are so messed up you are struggling with just the bar on bench or with tiny 5 lbs barbells, no pin in at all on the universal.

Gotta keep things interesting and keep challenging your body in new ways IMO.  Also helps you find out what works best for you to experiment within reason and without injuring yourself given your unique body.",1722470404.0

"BestofRedditorUpdates","t5_2ea6kj",">just dont bring her trauma, every person I know had shit to happen to them, that you would think how they even function as a human being

Not everybody reacts the same way to trauma and brushing off that kind of graphic violence while acting like it should have no bearing on a person's psyche is both short-sighted and delusional. Her past doesn't excuse her actions but they sure as hell inform them and it's extremely obvious OOP's ex-partner is looking for ways to self-sabotage because her sense of self-worth is so obscenely fucked from what she's gone through. I don't get why people on this sub pretend they care about mental health when they can't muster the barest level of understanding after seeing how messy mental health issues can be in real life. 

>She had a man who was so in love with her, he tossed away an opportunity to have children just to be with her

That's the point einstein, she thinks OOP deserves someone that can actually give him children so she fucked off to be with someone shittier because in her mind that's what she deserves. Also, it's not ""tossing away an opportunity to have children"" if OOP knowingly made an informed decision to be with someone he was told from the get go couldn't bear him biological offspring.",1722470404.0

I can’t believe many speak as if it is certainty that Daniel would out perform Checo. Additionally, why Daniel is even being considered over Yuki/Lawson. Checo has had poor runs of form over the past couple seasons, but he has started and finished strong. Versus Daniel having a almost season long poor run of form against Lando and is worse than Yuki by the numbers at the moment. Yes, Checo not doing well, but only teammate who has stuck it to Max in his current run of form in a few Qualis and Races. Yes Daniel and Max we near each other when they drove alongside, but Max is only better than that period, and Daniel far below that form. 
In my opinion, you keep Checo through the current regs, and replace with Lawson. Max is young enough where he doesn’t need another aspiring talent next to him, he just needs someone alongside him that doesn’t bother him and obeys team orders.
Things I’d like to see from Checo is especially return to form of being known as “the minister of defence” and a decent tire whisperer. I don’t think the value is in if he is on the podium if Max isn’t. I think the Value is in how he can get Max the driver’s championship. The constructors is often overlooked and actually hinders on track performance the following season. The driver’s championship generates all the hype, adverts, and sponsors.
Red Bull are a marketing company essentially, not a mass automotive company. They don’t need the “prestige” of winning the constructors that the other teams get if they win.

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","What an absurd comment. Not surprised it got this many upvotes on this subreddit, though. 

> Its so funny how this is viewed as ""just natural language spreading bro"" (blah blah Spanish Germans Europeans blah blah)

It's so funny how people always defend, downplay, justify, support, etc. Europe's imperialism but never any other society they view as non-European. Case in point: this comment section, and frankly most comment sections on this subreddit and website. As an American it's actually amazing just how brainwashed Europeans are. They constantly need to post examples of non-European societies doing things that are clearly nowhere near as bad as European actions to make themselves irrelevantly feel better about their monstrously vile history and culture lmao. I can't wait to comment some shit like ""wow, and people try to criticize us for invading Iraq! Smh"" on a post about the Mongol Empire or some shit. Pure strawmans and whataboutisms.

> The lense of history and critical history is on europeans right now

Lmao according to what? I've literally only ever seen people, especially on Reddit and this subreddit, go on and on about how evil and inferior non-Europeans are, such as the Japanese but especially for some reason the Americans (who inarguably perpetrated nowhere near as many atrocities or caused as much damage as the Europeans), and European imperialism often being praised, promoted, or at very last downplayed/deflected from/apologized for (case in point: this comment).

> First historical atrocities commited by other cultures and nations go unnoticed

No historical society/culture/nation committed as anywhere near the level of atrocities Europe has. Europe started the #1 largest war and #1 largest genocide in all of human history. Europe gave us states like Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Congo Free State.

> History right now is (not by actual historians but on social media mostly) as evil europeans that took over other parts of the world for selfish gains and that they were thiefs. 

This is literally what happened though. Like you just posted an objective, inarguable historical fact and acted like it was ridiculous. It's an inarguable fact of history like 1 + 1 = 2 is an objective, inarguable fact of math. The Europeans absolutely were and are selfish, evil thieves. Don't believe me? Google Nazism, the Holocaust, WWII, Hitler, Scramble for Africa, etc. Contrast this to things like the Marshall Plan, Berlin Airlift, United Nations, etc.

>  The irony is that this perpetuates a european superiority myth because it negates the significant role advanced native societies had on those relations.

No it doesn't, European apologists are usually those talking about how superior Europeans are.

It's equal parts concerning and amusing as an American seeing just how brainwashed and propagandized Europeans are. While we constantly criticize our own history and foreign policy, reviling people like Kissinger and often self-flaggelating, Europeans consistently downplay/defend or even worse, support their MUCH worse history.

Imagine how much Redditors would lose their shit if someone posted this about Japan. The Marshall Plan was a mistake, we should have done to you in 1945 what you did to Africa, Asia, Latin America, and Europe itself.",1722470405.0

"oxio_ca_internet","t5_35qv9r","I recently moved to Vancouver and subletted an apartment with Novus internet. For people who know, Novus is amazing but only offer services to specific buildings. The new building I moved to did not offer Novus so I done a lot of research on the different providrs available to me. I WFH and I game pretty heavily online so good internet is a must for me but I also needed a good price. Since the big two, Telus and Shaw, prices are outrageous, I stumbled upon Oxio. I wasn't too sure about the reviews because everyone is suggesting referral codes so I guessed people just wanted a free month.

I can say Oxio is definitely a good choice for the price. If you want 5 star customer service with high speed internet and price is not a problem, then I wouldn't suggest Oxio to you, but if you need quick internet and not looking to spend half your paycheck on it then Oxio is definitely for you. Super easy setup, activated remotely and did not need a technician to come to my apartment.

Please do not let all 5 star reviews and referral codes put you off this service, I was skeptical at first but I just used a random referral code found here and got my first month free. Since there is no contract I used this as a sort of""test"". If it was terrible I could simply cancel and look elsewhere but the first month was good so I stayed with them and no problems so far.

I hope this helps someone make up their mind and if you do decide to go with Oxio, please use my referral code to get yourself the first month free and test it out for yourself. ( I also get a free month:) )

Even if social services in the Nordic countries and Central Europe have been under strain lately, largely due to US misadventures and foreign policy catastrophes in the Middle East, triggering the massive exodus of refugees from Syria and elsewhere, they largely have held on to their values, whereas in the US, we only get lip-service, and far-right loonies that only care about the unborn, but could give a rats ass about the living.

"Ratschlag","t5_4cv0iv","Moin, gerne!   
Ich war erst bei so einer kostenlosen Suchtberatung bei mir in der Nähe. Gab da Regelmäßige Zeiten wo man einfach ohne Termin aufschlagen kann. Dachte ""das reicht"".   
Nach noch 1-2 Abstürzen bin ich dann zum Hausarzt und die haben mich auch erstmal durchgecheckt (Blutwerte, Leber, Neuropathie usw. was man nicht alles bekommen kann, so weit wars bei mir aber zum Glück noch nicht). Hab da auch eine Überweisung zum Psychologen bekommen. Auch da Zuspruch dass keinen Alkohol mehr trinken ne richtig feine Idee ist.   
Hatte danach noch einen Absturz bei dem ich auf der offenen gelandet bin, da wurde mir aber auch geraten mir einen Therapeuten zu suchen. Die Station war für mich eher wenig zielführend weils bei mir immer so Schubweise kam und ich, wenn ich erstmal dort war, nach 1-2 Tagen wieder einigermaßen Fit war und das Thema Alkohol für \~6 Monate Ruhe hatte. Hab dann direkt nachdem ich raus war die Therapeuten in meiner Nähe abgeklappert (Mail, Telefonisch) und da auch gesagt dass ich grad quasi aus dem Krankenhaus komme und dringend Hilfe brauche.   
Hatte dann recht schnell jemanden der nach 3 Wochen Zeit für mich hatte und bei dem bin ich auch bisher in der kogniviten Verhaltenstherapie (ca. alle 2 Wochen in Gruppe). Hilft schon extrem. Auch dass meine Freunde das alle verstehen und respektieren, dass ich nichts mehr trinke. Allein beim Gedanken nochmal was zu trinken bekomme ich milde Magenkrämpfe :D",1722470407.0

"WeightLossAdvice","t5_31a4o","If you just want optimal health, cutting back just a bit on the chocolates and eating a bit more fruits, veggies, lean meats, and whole grains will do the trick. 

You can be like “hey mom and dad, I wanna eat more healthily. Can I come do groceries with you guys next time we go on a run so I can pick some stuff up?”

If you wanna be not skinny fat, the above applies also but you’ll have to start increasing physical activity and eating high protein. 

My recommendation is to train the whole body with weights at the gym (although at home stuff like push ups or even picking up a sport can help). 

There’s more in detail stuff you can do like a cut and bulk, or calorie counting (all very effective), but if you prefer the simple route, just generally eating higher protein and lifting weights will help.

I think fans over value trades a lot.  Most times players are traded its not a massive haul.  2 picks and a young player get CLB out of that contract for a guy who doesn't want to be there.  And not many other teams have the cap space to make the deal.

Not counting last season, 2 seasons before he had 52 and 56 points with 22 and 26 goals in 55 and 56 games.

So even if he plays 100 games over the remainder of the contract and score 40 goals and get 98 points I would take that.  if he is healthy he could put up close to 30+ and probably 70+ points.  Worth the risk.",1722470408.0

"ExperiencedDevs","t5_e0gez","From a business perspective, why is this project worth investing in? Is it fixing some well-known pain points articulated by users, some foundational tech debt that makes it hard to add new features, something else? Is this tool primarily internal, or do your customers use it directly? Is it (or what it does) a competitive differentiator for your company, or otherwise essential? How many of the 300 employees at the company actually use this tool? Is it a small enough group (or a small enough number of teams) that you could just sit down with each one, and work out individually how they'll migrate to the new schema from what they're doing?

To me, this project reads as something ripe for some strategic descoping. The questions above are some of what I'd ask to try to identify opportunities for that descoping (your idea of fixing forward is a good place to start, there).

(Honestly, my first reaction on reading this was to wonder why a 300 person startup is investing engineering effort into building/maintaining an internal document/directory management tool. There's not enough info given to really know either way, and that ends up being a pretty awkward/risky question to bring up as a new hire, but I've seen enough poorly made build vs. buy decisions over the years to be suspicious of things like this by default in smaller companies. Quite often they contribute no/negligible value over an off the shelf vendor tool, and just serve as a distraction to the team)",1722470408.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","In the 1930s, during the height of the Great Depression, the Supreme Court issued a bunch of *bizarre* rulings that hemmed in any attempt at enacting FDR's agenda. He threatened to pack the court, and a couple of justices flipped. The decisions that they passed during the *Lochner* Era are now considered to be pretty terrible law. The threat was effective at stopping an activist court. The threat must be realistic in order to be effective. If nobody changes their vote, then it has to be followed through with in order to be effective again in the future. Our system is one of checks and balances. Court packing is one of the checks against the Supreme Court. It's not supposed to be an unstoppable force.

As a bonus, take a look at some of the weird rulings that they made. For instance, they ruled that, because the Constitution guarantees the rights of people to enter into contracts, a New York law regulating work week hours was unconstitutional. They said that employees could negotiate a better work week if they wished, and that *any* restraints *at all* on contracts were unconstitutional.",1722470408.0

Hello [CordeliaTheRedQueen](https://www.reddit.com/user/CordeliaTheRedQueen/),  


You’ve articulated an important and nuanced perspective on forgiveness in the context of childhood abuse and neglect. It's true that the process involves two separate components: dealing with our emotions and deciding on the nature of any ongoing relationship with our abusers.

I absolutely agree, allowing oneself to feel and process anger is a vital step in healing. It's not about holding onto anger but rather acknowledging and validating those feelings as part of the healing journey.  It's essential to prioritize one's own mental and emotional health in these decisions. Thank you for your insightful perspective",1722470408.0

My process to learning is: try solve the problem. Check Symbolabs if I got it right. If I didn't, I write down and follow their logic step by step. Then, I turn to a new page and try solve it again on my own. Then go back to Symbolabs and see if I got it right. Doing that over and over again is how you learn math.",1722470409.0

"ProstateCancer","t5_2s1qy","Good questions.  Here’s how it worked at the cancer center I went to.  They tell everyone starting IMRT to drink 36 to 40 ounces of water 1 hour before the simulation session. That’s where they take a cat scan then an MRI of your pelvis to plan the treatment.  When I went in for that first CT scan for planning purposes they told me that my bladder wasn’t quite full enough after doing the first CT scan. So I just lay there in the CT scanner for 10 minutes until enough urine built up in my bladder. Then they did another CT scan to confirm that my bladder was nice and full. They then told me to drink at least 38 oz’s of water within 5 minutes at exactly 1 hour before each treatment because that’s what it took to fill my bladder during planning. So then once I started my sessions I would drink about 38 ounces exactly 1 hour before my appointment.  My routine each day was to set an alarm on my iPhone that would go off exactly 1 hour before my appointment.  I would quickly drink 38 ounces of water in about 5 minutes. Then I would use the bathroom and urinate and try to further empty my bowel.  That urine right after drinking the water has nothing to do with the water you just drank. I would drive to the center and check in about 10 minutes early for each appointment.  If they were running late, I might go to the bathroom and let a little urine out to keep myself comfortable.  They would call me in and I would give them my birthdate, then empty my pockets, take off my shoes and hop up on the table. They put a warm sheet over me and I would pull my pants and underwear down past my butt. They would make a few adjustments then leave the room. The machine makes a quick CT scan that’s used for alignment. The table then moves a bit. Then the linear accelerator starts and rotates around me 3 times. Then I’m down. 7 minutes in and out.",1722470409.0

The image appears to be 14 layers deep. Each layer has roughly 32 strips (very rough estimate there) totaling 448 strips.

448 / 96  = 4.66 orders from michaels \* $57.48/order = $268.24 for the strips.

Mas no primeiro mes eu tive a oportunidade de explorar alguns lugares turisticos basicos como o maior shopping com o burj em cima ne. Visitei Abu Dhabi e fui e pousei um Hotel em Liwa que tinha uma piscina com o deserto no fundo (mt lindo). 

Pra min o mais legal era coisas simples como ir em um supermercado que ficava no térreo de um apartamento depois de uma garagem (sempre parecia que eu tava invadindo o AP da galera para entrar kk) ver um monte de marcas que eu nunca tinha provado e testar o gosto. 

Ir no KFC, ou Mc Donalds e ver os trabalhadores Indianos, Paquistaneses e etc de boa tomando uma coca cola depois do trabalho e jogando papo fora. 

E a minha maior saudades de todas éra comer aquele lanche que vai em um baguete que a franquia do Talhwuk (nao lembro como escreve) vendia, pqp aquilo era bom de mais kkk

Eu tenho bastante vontade de voltar para lá, mas com minhas ""própias pernas"", porque eu fui a trabalho e fiquei na mão do meu empregador, então eu tenho uma revoltinha de poder voltar e morar lá de novo, mas sem ficar na mão de ninguém e conhecer mais de lá, pois eu não vi quase nada praticamente , só fui em uma praia uma vez e nem cheguei a ir pra parte q todo mundo falava q era a mais top que é a Marina ne",1722470410.0

You’d be implementing the machine learning CART algorithms and the ensemble methods (decision tree, random decision forest, bootstrap aggregating) and a Q-learning (traditional and Dyna algorithms) reinforcement learning but of course with the finance aspect. I’d rather take a more interesting course like deep learning (or even reinforcement learning if you’re into the niche topics).

ML4T lectures are dated using Python 2. They were taught by Professor Tucker Balch and alumna Devpriya Dave with bonus videos by David Byrd. David Joyner’s part is probably the usual exam format you’d see in HCI and his other courses. The TAs ran the Ed Discussion forum and most often times, you’d learn that certain cherry-picked replies aren’t that all helpful. Not saying the ED wasn’t helpful but you’ll get used to it real quick that there’s no black and white answer that you’d expect. Try it out and see for yourself. Codes had to be updated to Python 3 and the private local grading script would scream deprecated warnings). Overall, an okay course but I didn’t appreciate the Joyner exam format and constant deadlines each week in the shortened session. Full semester would be easily doable but why would you waste a semester when you can take more interesting courses?

"RPClipsGTA","t5_3onkg","""to literal real world civil rights is wildly inappropriate..""

I'm not conflating them, I'm using an analogy to show why the logic is flawed, and how that is not the definition of ""Stifling"". Equal treatment doesn't mean harming the people that were already not being discriminated against. Its really simple, and an obvious real world parallel is in the matter of rights.

""equate the civs with underprivileged people""

Lol. Yeh sure. What exactly in the legal system in No Pixel makes Civs underprivileged? I'll wait. Oh right, it doesn't exist.

""something that exists solely for their equal representation""  
Huh? Ah the classic ""equal"" = have more representation/privileges. Holy fck you civ viewers are blind with your devotion to promoting civs, so much so that you have twisted logic into a pretzel to justify your prejudice. And that is ultimately what it is, no matter what type of spin is put on it. There is only 1 ""Defense"" for your stance, and its solely an OOC balance discussion to give Civs some extra privilege. That however opens it up to being defeated if the forces of OOC against it are more powerful, so don't cry when that happens.

""Also, we do limit the rights of felons irl""  
Yeh I am aware. Things like owning legal firearms. Exactly how it is in NP with gun licenses. Again the whole owning a business thing is not one of the restrictions, which helps shed a light on how there isn't an iota of logic behind the prohibition in game, especially as a game/rp world where the majority of players are criminals.. So just don't try to use logic explaining an illogical restriction, its futile.

""Being a serial felon HAS to have consequences""  
Ah very nice, so you are trying to make the claim that being a criminal needs an additional punishment besides for the fines and jail time.. So the answer is to restrict their rp and ability to own businesses.. A brilliant take, one that Lord Kebun has lambasted numerous times. Thankfully the majority see it his way, both in terms of players, and the new real Mayor Nino, and the tides will continue to shift away from that of trying to find new punishments for criminals, since this is a rp/content server.

""but also because civilians need server mechanics..""  
Yeh you came to it. The only type of defense in favor of your position. So Andy and her ilk need to make it clear their only leg to stand on is an OOC balance one. If/when the tides shift, don't complain because you guys by necessity went OOC with your stance since that is the only possible justification for it. If it gets fully reversed it will also be OOC.

""the server has next to nothing for civilian roleplay""  
Then go to ONX or PurpleRP or wherever you Civs are most fond of. NP has been and will always be one that caters to content creators and crims/cops. Civs still have government roles/doj/medical and the like that only they can do. Being the only ones that can own businesses won't be one of their privileges. 

""they deserve to have mechanics that are just for them.""  
They don't ""Deserve"" anything. The ones that will make the decision on what they ""Deserve"" is the owners and Lord Kebun.

“my behavior shouldn’t have continued this long..”  
Even I think the PP Arc lasted too long (a couple days would have been fine) and should have stayed focus on getting the revenge for Demarco's murder/perma.  He got approval for the serial killer arc, there was nothing rule breaking about it, no one went ooc against the victims or whatever, no one was maliciously targeted.

"SuperMorbidlyObese","t5_j779r","Yes, it's worth trying. I wish I had the tools that I have now, when I was your age (38F).

When I was 17, I was upper end of normal weight for my height, around 80kg. At 18, I lost a lot - a combination of poverty and a highly stressful family situation. I dropped two dress sizes and my ribs were clearly visible all the time. I put a little back on at 19, but at \~20 I tipped over 100kg and by 22 I was 120kg. My weight yoyo-ed the entire time, I was trying to exercise and ""fix"" my diet, but I couldn't sustain it. I'd go on to gain up to 5kg a year from there, and end up over 156kg last year (I didn't weigh at my highest). 

I don't say all this to make it all about me, or to dishearten you. I want to give you hope, and a shortcut to what took me almost 20 years to find on my own. Almost 20 years of trying to do some version of the same thing, over and over and over - I tried to starve myself through some form of restriction, my body fought back and packed on more weight. I tried to force myself to exercise, but I did what I thought I ""should"" be able to do, and didn't meet my body where it was at. Within days, I'd crash. 

I considered trying to get Mounjaro or similar, and was willing - but the cost put it out of reach. In hindsight, I'm glad - not because there's anything wrong with taking these meds, but because I needed to go another path first, and ended up (so far at least) not needing it. 

Around January, I decided to do something different, and I'm down 19kg from September last year. It has been challenging, but not torture. Slow, steady and it's working. 

So what's changed? I paused from ""trying to lose weight"". I didn't give up, I decided to dedicate my energy to working on my underlying issues instead. I didn't give myself a time limit, ended up needing 6 months. The guiding principles for this were kindness and curiosity, not punishment. 

This is what helped:

* Learning to cook. I've done a couple of cooking classes - once a week over 5 & 8 weeks. It gave me more confidence in the kitchen, helped me try new food. I now do things like bulk prep and freeze meals so that we have a healthy choice ready to go, and that's made a difference too. 
* Understanding mouth-hunger vs tummy-hunger. When I felt hungry, I'd check in with myself:
   * Have I eaten in the last 2-3 hours? yes => might be mouth-hunger
   * Am I willing to eat almost anything palatable, or am I craving a specific food or element (salt, grease, chips, chocolate) yes => likely mouth-hunger
   * Do I have physical sensations of hunger? (I had no sense of this at all, improved a bit, then new meds wiped it out - it's worth doing, but the first two questions work well enough while you work it out.) 
   * Once I understood tummy vs mouth-hunger, I worked on my binge/overeating. I started by observing it, like a scientist would. Why am I feeling bingey now? What's happened? Can I do anything to help myself feel better/what does my body need? If there was something (like have a drink, go for a walk) then I'd do that. And if I still wanted to eat, I'd let myself, but usually much smaller portions. Instead of demolishing a 150g bag of chips, I'd weigh out 25g and put the rest back in the cupboard. Break chocolate bars into 4 squares, eat 1.  
   * This process took a lot of mental effort, but it really did help curb the sense of urgency and lack of control that I felt all the time around food. 
* Practiced ""calorie awareness"" - I didn't record, wasn't aiming for a calorie target. I just worked out how many calories were in the things I ate, and got a sense of portions. I've been doing CICO for \~6 weeks now, and doing this made it much easier to transition. It hasn't been stressful the way it was in the past. 
* Worked on my underlying health issues. I won't go into it here, but I had a lot of other things going on with my health. Getting a handle on these helped immensely, and one of the medications has almost eliminated food noise. 

Good luck :)",1722470411.0

I also only give out shares to critical employees that make huge impact on the business and if they left, would cause us major issues.

Accordingly, society just doesn't seem set up for Fives in some ways. So often, I've received advice, been subjected to rules, or been given expectations that were clearly (in my view) meant for somebody wired differently. That isn't to say I didn't need advice or rules, but in hindsight, what I needed was usually not what I received. Making movies and books for 5 kids would be amazing.

I also think with Tatum specifically, the fact that he and JB had 5 years of knocking at the door and being shoved down everyone’s throats before they lost to a well-liked but aging dynasty in the finals, and then had a pathetic ECF last year, has caused a lot of their advocates in the media to turn their backs on them, like Colin Cowherd who gave one of the worst takes of his career this week regarding Tatums DNP.

"snakes","t5_2ryfw","Banded Watersnakes *Nerodia fasciata* are medium (90-110 cm record 158.8 cm) natricine snakes with keeled scales often found in and around water. They are commonly encountered fish and amphibian eating snakes across much of eastern North America.

*Nerodia* watersnakes may puff up or flatten out defensively and bite. They secrete a foul smelling substance from the cloaca called musk and can deliver a weak anticoagulant venom used in prey handling from the back of the mouth, but are not considered medically significant to humans - bites just need soap and water.

Found throughout southeastern North America, it is replaced in the North by, and likely exchanges genes with, the Common Watersnake *Nerodia sipedon*. Banded Watersnakes have even, connecting bands across the top of the snake all the way down the body. In Common Watersnakes *N. sipdeon*, bands typically break up or become mismatched after the first third of the body. The ""confluens"" color pattern is somewhat of an exception to the even banding rule, but isn't often confused with other species as it is rather distinctive.

*Nerodia fasciata* along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts in the Southeastern US also exchange genes along environmental ecotones with Saltmarsh Snakes *Nerodia clarkii*.

[Range Map](http://snakeevolution.org/rangemaps/Nerodia_fasciata.jpg) | [Relevant/Recent Phylogeography - Unpublished](http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3823&context=etd)

This genus, as well as this species specifically, are in need of revision using modern molecular methods. Unfortunately what we know about this species is unpublished, but it's likely that it is composed of three species - a peninsular Florida species, a species west of the Mississippi River, and a continental eastern North American species.




--------------------------------------------------------

Like many other animals with mouths and teeth, many non-venomous snakes bite in self defense. These animals are referred to as 'not medically significant' or traditionally, 'harmless'. Bites from these snakes benefit from being washed and kept clean like any other skin damage, but aren't often cause for anything other than basic first aid treatment. Here's where it get slightly complicated - some snakes use venom from front or rear fangs as part of prey capture and defense. This venom is not always produced or administered  by the snake in ways dangerous to human health, so many species are venomous in that they produce and use venom, but considered harmless to humans in most cases because the venom is of low potency, and/or otherwise administered through grooved rear teeth or simply oozed from ducts at the rear of the mouth. Species like Ringneck Snakes *Diadophis* are a good example of mildly venomous rear fanged dipsadine snakes that are traditionally considered harmless or not medically significant. Many rear-fanged snake species are harmless as long as they do not have a chance to secrete a medically significant amount of venom into a bite; [severe envenomation can occur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23800999) if some species are [allowed to chew on a human](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S004101011831016X) for as little as 30-60 seconds. It is best not to fear snakes, but use common sense and do not let any animals chew on exposed parts of your body. Similarly, but without specialized rear fangs, gartersnakes *Thamnophis* ooze low pressure venom from the rear of their mouth that helps in prey handling, and are also [considered harmless](https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/theres-no-need-to-fear-that-garter-snake/). [Check out this book on the subject](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/venomous-bites-from-non-venomous-snakes/weinstein/978-0-12-822786-2). Even large species like Reticulated Pythons *Malayopython reticulatus* [rarely obtain a size large enough to endanger humans](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/108/52/E1470.full.pdf) so are usually categorized as harmless.

He’s looking into my info and will call me tomorrow to talk about the best path forward into 58.

Its the matter that i have significantly more knowledge than any of the green apprentices joining in.  Also, no money lost now will not be outweighed by money gained later. 

Money lost for 5 years means i’d lose out on 4 years of at least 52 an hour more for foreman and more possibly negotiated on later dates.

I get you. I'm a big Lego fan (though, I haven't gotten any in well over a decade since I already had a bajillion of them from the 90s and 2000s). If you like spreading your projects out then larger girls like the ones you listed (or any of the other big ones) will be perfect for you. 

So when it comes to kits and adhesives, they're generally designed in such a way that nothing HAS to be bonded, but sometimes it's best to make the personal call to do so anyways. Sometimes there'll be a loose part that's supposed to stay on permanently but the connection is too loose, so it falls off. You'd cement things like that into place. You're never going to realistically remove certain types of parts anyways, so permanently attaching them has no down sides and only saves you the frustration of having to pop them back on all the time. Cement can accomplish this most of the time and is the preferred adhesive since it creates a permanent bond (melts the plastic together) and it usually doesn't cause aesthetic issues, but sometimes it's not the ideal solution. Cement only works well when there's sufficient surface area to bond things together, and every once in a while, due to weird engineering decisions, parts don't always have that luxury. So sometimes you take the hammer approach and just use super glue. The situations are few and far between, but you'll inherently notice them when one occurs. And yeah, cement also has the secondary use of seam line removal (some cements are better at this than others due to different plastic types and cements having differing strengths. The Mr. Cement SP I mentioned is a good general workhorse in this regard as it takes care of basically anything typical Japanese kits will throw your way). 

The sanding thing is something ALL new builders encounter issues with. Typically they don't know about it at all and end up snapping their girl's shoulder or knee in half (of which there's no fix for outside of buying new parts/kits). Some will oversand and screw things up that way. Though, luckily that's stupidly easy to fix (thicken the peg/ball back up with super glue, epoxy putty, sprue goo, etc, and then sand it back into shape to repeat the process). But yeah, overall just keep in mind the general rule that ""a kit's joints should be able to resist gravity but not you"".

Yup, no particularly crazy specific issues. Most of the top-tier lines rarely ever have kit-specific issues. Every once in a while a particularly one will, but it's usually nothing major. Joint tightness really is the only thing that you always need to worry about since that's a hobby-wide issue to one degree or another. But yeah, while Elena has a lot of parts she's a pretty easy build just because there's so many large bits and no decals. She's also EXCEPTIONALLY unique, and a 10/10 experience as far as Girlpla go, so this knight encourages anybody interested in girlpla to give her a go. I put up a review of her when she came out if you want to go check that post of mine out. Absolutely great kit.",1722470414.0

Let me elaborate.  We are a single income family, wife is a homemaker (by her choice).  Our family income is a bit more than your, but it has to support a family of four people.  We drive older cars (both cars about roughly 150K miles at the moment), and we rarely go out to party.  However, we did go out to eat a couple weeks ago to celebrate our anniversary (it was a couple hundred dollars).  

So we are couple A) went out for a nice dinner.

My brother, also a single income family (his wife does not work for medical reasons), makes a little less than you.  He just got a brand new truck from work, but forgets to mention that when he posts on social media.

Couple B) new vehicle

One of my co-workers (single), went out last week partying to celebrate a friend's birthday.  But does not go out unless it is a special occasion.

Person C) went partying


Now all three of the above post on Reddit on the same day.  It is natural for somebody like you to start associating this with a single person, and to think that this is normal.  Really it is people go out OR people but a new car OR people go partying.  That is what I meant by looking at the collective, not the individual.  In reality, on your income, unless you live in a very high cost of living area, you should be able to afford an occasional night out to dinner, or a ball game or something, and if you don't once a month, and always post about it the once a month it happens, other people might think you are always going out as well.",1722470414.0

"Columbus","t5_2r373","Spent my first 30 years in Southern California (between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara). Husband's job move is to Austin, TX and we were there for 13 years. Just moved to the Columbus area in May.

His whole family is here, so I've been visiting for literally decades. 

What surprised me just since we moved here in May is how *green* everything is here! Every road is lined in green growth.

At this point of the summer in both SoCal and TX, everything is brown and crispy. 

It rains a LOT here!

Now, I have been here in winter so I know it's all going to be brown and bare in the next few months. But it's so nice to look out and see green naturally (and not because I watered).

Traffic is not much compared to what we had in California *and* what we had in Austin- if you spent any time on the 101 or the 405 you will be pleased at how short any traffic jam is in the Columbus area.",1722470414.0

"FundieSnarkUncensored","t5_2z8fuj","#These people vote in every election- do you? Are you registered to vote?  [You can check your voter registration here!](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote)  

#Also, there's a few things to remember as far as rules go:

- You can view the content- you cannot interact with it. This includes (but is not limited to) commenting, answering poll questions, emailing them, etc. ***Anyone found to be engaging with the fundies will be met with a permanent ban with no eligibility for appeal.It does not matter if you did so before you joined the sub.***

- Speculating on the sexuality of literally anyone is prohibited. ***Anyone found to be doing so will be met with a permanent ban with no eligibility for appeal.***

- Appearance snark: What's allowed? You're allowed to make comparisons. (Bethy looks like Grandpa Munster, for example.) You are allowed to say you find them attractive or repulsive looking. Saying Kelly Havens has dry skin that could benefit from sunscreen and a moisturizer is fine. You are allowed to snark on the appearance of children *as it relates to their parents choices for them.*. Examples: Janessa looks malnourished and sickly while Shrek has clearly never missed a meal. If you feel it is crossing the line report it, but if the content falls within the parameters above, leave it alone.

- Don't gatekeep. This means no comments such as ""I don't think we should snark on...."" or any iteration of that. If you don't like it, scroll past. Don't report it or comment how you don't like the content. Along the same vein, don't backseat mod. Leave that up to us.

"Equestrian","t5_2r4or","There’s clearly a ghost in his stall!!👻

But in all seriousness, could it be flies or other bugs on his legs or belly? Has he been scoped for ulcers? Could he be seeing the shadow of his tail and thinking there’s something there? Those are the main things that came to mind for me. (I’m not a vet but have a lot of experience with vet stuff)

Does he do it in turnout or only stalled? And in that case, is it only in *this* stall? Because then I’d think it has something to do with the lighting - horses eyes can work weird with light and shadow sometimes. Maybe try lights off or a different light source (let his eyes adjust first!) and see if it continues?

If he does it everywhere, I’d think it’s something internal or could even be neurological (I don’t think it’s neuro at this point with the little info I have though). If it’s in a select few locations, then it could be bugs or a stress reaction, and if it’s just in his stall, then there’s something in there that’s bothering him.

"Exvangelical","t5_dltoa","Yes. My particular flavor also valued sanctification almost to the same level. So you needed to have a date you prayed the sinner's prayer (preferably as a young child), and need to work towards the bigger sanctification. Bonus points if you went through a ""rebelious stage"" as a teen and came back. Only the sinner's prayer and sanctification were explicitly talked about. The other stuff was all implied with all of the ""share your testimony"" services.

The issue with your argument is it's obviously not the case that houseless people who feel they are in a position to refuse temporary shelter (and who want to continue camping in public places indefinitely, like the houseless person in the article) are people who experienced an ""unanticipated traumatic incident"" and simply need sympathy and support while they try to get back on their feet. If someone makes a conscious decision to live their lives camping out in public when they have access to resources and programs that are designed to try and help them improve their circumstances, then I'm not sure why I or anyone else should be concerned if they end up going to jail until they can sort out their lives.

That's the whole point I and many others are trying to make. There are plenty of houseless people who have great intentions and are making efforts to get back on their feet. They absolutely deserve sympathy and support. People like the man in this article who was arrested do not.",1722470417.0

I feel like it's not quite that she's specifically designed to work with Firefly the same way JQ was for Acheron, it's that right now, if you want to create a premium break support/sustain, they either need to be fire to work with Firefly, be physical to work with Boothill, or be able to implant their own weakness.  Now I don't have Boothill and won't pretend to have experience using him, but from everything I've seen of him, since his implant is single target, tied to his ult and he tends to burst down toughness bars, making Lingsha physical wouldn't have worked that well unless her kit was something completely different.

However, I realized at that point, that the tech already got hold of the data on my browser password manager and personal documents stored locally on my PC. He then proceeded to change passwords to the accounts he could gain access to. I managed to recover most of the accounts by changing the passwords to stronger unique forms and added 2FA with my phone and also made sure to delete any odd devices present in accounts that had a device list (Just in-case you were wondering, yes there was an odd device on my Amazon account).

And if they don’t feel up for sharing that toy, we decide together that it’s probably best we leave that toy at home, or in the car. Because they absolutely don’t have to share, but it could cause problems. 

However in the same vein, if kids at the park have toys, I’ve also taught my children they can’t assume they get to play with it. But that they can always ask. 

I don’t think assuming that toys are communal is the right approach. You’ve got to help YOUR child understand how to share, and how to not share, if they don’t want to. And the consequences that go with both those actions. You also have to help them understand that if it’s not theirs, they don’t automatically have rights to it.",1722470419.0

Leda is loyal too miquella spell or not and truly believes In miquella so you must always fight her

Uncle dane I mean dryleaf dane will remain loyal to miquella possibly out of honor or ideologically and will always fight you

Now here's where things get fun

When the spell breaks the rest may falter if certain things happen 

Ansbach will always remember that miquella used the light on him and used it on mohg as well and will join your fight against the others and then in the promised consort boss for the sake of mohgwyn 

Similarly thiollier will go back to st trina and if you defeat the putriscent knight and do some convoluted stuff with st trinas sleep juice he will fight with you against the others and then the promised consort at st trinas request to stop miquella from becoming a god because it would be a prison for him.

Moore is depressed if you tell him to wollow in sadness or nothing at all he won't join leda but if you tell him to perk up he will so watch out

And freyja normally will join leda if you complete her quest by giving ansbachs letter to her which likely tells her the truth which will instead of causing her to falter it emboldened her and leads to her join leda but if you don't give it too her she will remain in the keep until after burning the shadow bud and be dead in the same room she was in and drop her drip and weapons

Finally if you tell leda to kill hornsent recruit him for the messmer fight and then defeat him in the ruins of ruah befor the romina boss fight he'll die and can't help leda

In short

Leda and dane vs you, ansbach and thiollier while Moore, hornsent and freyja will be dead

Much easier fight and it will make the final boss easier however if you want them to live and thrive sadly all but ansbach and thiollier will be dead by the leda fight or die in the fight.

Hope this helps",1722470419.0

The first time I finished setting up my wireless car play years ago had me super stoked with how well everything worked together and the developer support for multi-product integration. Not having to change voice clients when moving from my house to my car and visa versa has been super nice. You can definitely get it done with google or Alexa and I know people who do and are happy 😊 I don’t prefer the freeware data collecting add delivering google model though so I stay away from most of their services. Being able to have the freedom to carry that experience to other cars and different brands is liberating. I like GM EVs, I think they have a good product. Their decision to block even the “option” of having car play has removed me as a perspective buyer and I know a few other people who feel the same way. I think GM will regret it and allow it in the near future again.

Shootings that involve adults are drug/personal greivences. So the question that needs to be asked is….
Do you hang out with children? 
Do you do drugs that might lead you into a violent situations?

I think most conservatives don’t give a shit about legalization. They would probably be more apt to keep harder drugs illegal. Look at Oregon as a perfect example of how legalizing drug use turned out to be a complete disaster. When it comes to kids, conservatives become very protective. Books about trans and gay people being readily available to kids without parental consent and control is problematic.

You obviously have a bone to pick with this neighbor and you're looking for more reasons.

Even if you're legitimately concerned about this child, you're not thinking it through and it's not your place. Do not under any circumstances ever give anybody unsolicited parenting advice. Parents shouldn't do it, but non parents absolutely shouldn't - the receiver won't listen to you and they'll resent you for implying they don't know how to parent their kids.

But on top of that, what do you really think is going to happen here? Some creeper's going to stealthily go into their front yard and start jerking it to window baby? Or they're going to go ""aha! I know there's a frequently-nude child in this house, that's easy pickins!""

You're just being absurd. Kids are naked all the time, and there's nothing wrong with it. The fact that you included ""in diapers"" is just incredible to me, as if you truly think that's unacceptable attire for somebody of diaper-wearing age.",1722470421.0

Or look for upcoming coral expos in your area.  Corals from the fish store are usually extremely highly priced. . . 

100$ is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.  My local fish store has a mid sized rock of GSP for 299.99$...... ridiculous, and nobody will ever buy it. 

If you are newer to the hobby, try to keep that new rock in the sand bed not touching any other rocks.  Once the GSP moves to a new rock it'll eventually take over the other rock and make it to where you can't put corals on it.... That being said, a GSP dominated tank looks awesome.   If the tank was just gsp it would have nice movement and the vibrant green is nice.  

I guess you could ask for your money back but if you like the coral I'd just chalk it up as a learning moment to do your research on your purchases if money is a concern.",1722470421.0

Taste differs and even within Italy there’s probably different styles and all that. But:

There’s a balance to things, and it should be kept. Some people like thicker crust (not me), some people like thinner crust and bottom (meeee!) and some like many toppings and some less. 

But American Pizza always seems to be MORE. Just more of everything. More crust, more tomato sauce, more cheese and more toppings. 

But for me, to stay a delicacy, you have to respect the delicacy of the balance. If you have a massive crust and bottom, you’ll be eating mostly bread. My mouth is not an endless cave. Only so much can get in. 

I like Pizza because I like those ingredients, combine in that way, prepared that way, with that texture. If I can’t taste the ingredients because of the sea of tomato sauce or the mountain of bread, then I won’t like it.",1722470422.0

SPOILERS FOR THE ORIGINAL SCRAPPED ELIMINATION INCLUDING THE 2ND PLACE!!!!!

>!Tess!< was supposed to be the 2nd place wich makes me think that she had a long arc in store wich was scrapped due to someone taking her place, i still think they couldve used that scrapped arc and made her reach top 7 instead of aiden in order to give time for that arc, but this is just an example and i honestly really think aiden had alot of potential like you know being independent, maybe getting back at riya start a rivalry etc etc. but no pre merge he was just a toy for the love triangle and in the merge he just had beef with jake and later became his friend wich sure was interesting but this couldve been a side plot alone and i mean its obvious the creators love aiden and i just dont get why they didnt do anything with him, like sure they gave him tons of screentime either complaining or saying something about jake but an interesting arc hell nah. like they either shouldve given him an interesting arc or made him an early boot like heck lakes monolouge in episode 11 made us learn almost as much as we learned from aiden all season.",1722470422.0

"Advice","t5_2qjdm",">I come frim a very ""reactively"" angry fanil where we yell and snap at eachother, and when I'm upset at someone i just want them to feel it

CLEARLY he does feel it, that's why he's apologizing and trying to make things better profusely. To be frank, to me (and this is just my opinion) you feel like the worse person and get more upset because you know this. You know he cares about you and is taking what you're expressing to heart and wants to make things better but you want him to get angry at you, you want him to snap at you, to get mad at you, to reactively dismiss your feelings like your family did because that could justify your doing the same to him. 

You aren't angry at him, you're angry at yourself, because it feels like you're hurting him and part of you wants him to hurt you back to make it fair because that's the dynamic you're used to and you see it as normal when it REALLY isn't. Maybe you see yourself in him, a younger self confused why your family treated you the way they did that because they are removed from that dynamic can't rationalize it further. How do you take out your anger? By understanding where it comes from. Why are you so angry?  
  
A bigger question I have is how often and why do you two even get into arguments? Does he usually start them or do you? What are they usually about? How do they usually end? And when they come up is your anger even really directed at him? I ask because if he's as apologetic and considerate as you paint him to be it's hard to imagine him as someone who initiates a lot of arguments.",1722470423.0

"fnv","t5_2rzr5","Correct but unless I misunderstood something, it’s just a blanket annexation of the Mojave that they’re going for.

The NCR isn’t going to separate the Mojave from the “mother country” with any sort of legal distinction, it’s just going to be more NCR. The Mojave residents will become full NCR legal citizens, won’t they? (It’s been a while since I’ve played all the way through, so I could be wrong but this is how I remember it.)

Think about it like this: when America annexed the republic of Texas, Texas just became another fully fledged state. They were never an American colony. It was just more America. But when they took the Philippines in the Spanish-American, the Filipinos were not granted the same kind of legal or political representation that the people and governments on continental America had.

It’s still annexation and conquest, which is certainly immoral. But “colonialism” is very politically charged word, so I thought it was important to point out.",1722470423.0

Not saying that Boxing can’t be effective because any effective striker has a chance but the more weapons you have the better your chances are.

MMA employs dirty Boxing and pretty much all forms of striking from hands and elbows to kicks and knees. Then there’s the grappling aspect which unlike wrestling includes multiple finish moves or submissions.

A knife might help but only if you have the skill to position in a clinch, pull it and stab someone without the opponent being able to see it first but if they see it you’re probably going to get a free “The next thing I knew story” and a rock in your hand will end with the same story.

Your GP will refer you to a GIC, with multiple year long waits. 

The can provided a bridging prescription, where they prescribe, this is as likely as the moon falling out the sky at this point. 

They shouldn’t ask questions (they probably will) and you don’t need to answer them. Just know they must refer you. If you are in England — you have a choice of GIC. *Tell the GP the clinic you want referred to*. You may want to look at GenderKits waiting times to make a decision on that.

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","Practice makes progress. My advice is to throw slower speed discs. Play the short tees. Putters and mids. Once you see improvement, move on to fairways. Also, get you a cheap practice basket or make one, and get good at putting. It's amazing the difference you'll see in your score once you find your putt. 

Some good advice I've gotten over the years:
For drives: Keep your thumb on top of it. This means to keep pressure on the top in order to keep the nose down. Nose up throws will stop you from getting distance. There are times, like for upshots, you'll need to purposely throw nose up... but you can figure that out later. 

For upshots: Aim bigger than the target. Aim for an area about 30' around the bucket. Not the bucket itself. This was given to me by the great sage Jay ""Yeti"" Redding. 

For putts: square your shoulder to your target and keep your arm on a straight plane. This makes you miss more up and down and not left and right. 

If you find you like the competitive side, get involved in your local club. Local pros are such an asset to beginners. They will more than likely give you great advice and the best thing...IT'S FREE!

Most importantly, have fun! Sometimes, the pressure of doing better will just make you stagnant or even worse.",1722470424.0

As a student you're probably not spending $30,000 a year, so Amex cards and Aeroplan cards don't make a lot of sense (also they can be inconvenient for various reasons). 

Avoid student branded cards, I think they're useless. A normal travel card is way better and the fees aren't much more. What you're paying for in annual fees you almost always get back in rewards (or lack of interest, but that shouldn't matter if you're following rule 1).",1722470425.0

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","Exactly. Thank you for adding that. The timing of the home burning down when he know time was running out AKA he agreed to call the police as the worker expressed she was very concerned. If I recall correctly he met the worker sometime in the afternoon on the 11th. The fire was reported at 4am on the 12th. That’s Just 12-14 hours after he agreed to call the police on the 12th. 

The 4am time also makes sense as it was before dawn which matches the odd and uncharacteristic late night hours of the coming and goings of her car on the days she was unaccounted for that her neighbor noticed. 

It’s very plausible for him to assume she was simply not answering his calls but nobody had been in contact with her since the 4th including Joey’s mother (they talked frequently by phone) and the Medicaid workers calls and card left at the door went unanswered. Not to mention the mail piling up. He never called Joeys mother to raise the alarm or ask if she even spoke with her. She had his newborn son after all. If he truly believed she was very depressed and needed medication while in caring for his newborn and had zero contact with anyone in almost a week with mail piling up, you’d think he would’ve raised the alarm much sooner. 

If Joey snapped or had a breakdown due to something happening to the baby her state of mind would be far from composed and logical which would be needed to run away and never be found or seen again. She already needed a lot of emotional and financial support from her mother all her adult life. It’s extremely difficult to go undetected especially for 16 years in the digital age. The very few that have been able to do so meticulously and logically planned it out. It’s just as unlikely she committed suicide and hid her body so well no trace has ever been found in 16 years despite extensive searches from where her car was found.

My thought is that Fitbit should be the testing ground for pixel. Sense 3 could introduce newer sensors and tech like blood pressure monitoring. Let the die hards purchase it and test it and find any bugs or issues and the following year pixel 4 can then implement the features to the masses. 

If the hardware doesn't work or something then its not out to the masses and only the hardcore fans who really want these new features. 

Google basically has a real world testing platform for new sensors and tech. 

Similar to sense 2 having the cEDA sensor and then the pixel 2 got that feature. I'm sure they could see how the sense 2 performed and ways to maybe make it better or more accurate",1722470425.0

"USWNT","t5_2wc2u","The skill is NOT baseline for any central midfielders. That's just poor bias. It is most definitely a strength. It confirms a high soccer IQ; not just technical ability. Albert has spent her development as an attacking central midfielder, and had tremendous success in her 2 years at Notre Dame and in the YNT system. ND plays a full schedule of top quality opponents every year. Albert's success has come from exactly what she displayed today; quick progressive passing and a knack for goal from distance with either foot. Her shots are also very quick; meaning she converts her thoughts to a powerful shot much quicker than most.

She's playing back at PSG because she plays with one of the best CMs in the game today, Grace Geyoro. 

Neither Albert nor Coffey played DM in college, and Coffey played 5 years. After August, I'd consider the 6 position open again. Also, it wasn't until Netherlands overloaded the midfield last summer and beat USA with only one 6. Poor coaching tactics cost Sullivan her job. Every game since, it's played with 2. IMO Andi is still the best.

When you name the qualities of a DM, the first one better be defense; defensive game management. Neither Coffey nor Albert have that prominantly on their resume.

The US has played a 4-3-3 forever with one DM. Playing with 2 now limits the opportunity for anybody to start over Macario at attacking MF.",1722470425.0

If you're mostly working with samples/synths, I'd get a MIDI keyboard next to make working with /auditioning / recording your samplers/synths easier. Even if you can't play, having something to bang on can be a godsend.

Our whole universe was in a hot, dense state
Then nearly fourteen billion years ago expansion started, wait
The earth began to cool, the autotrophs began to drool
Neanderthals developed tools
We built a wall (we built the pyramids)
Math, science, history, unraveling the mysteries
That all started with the big bang (bang)
Since the dawn of man is really not that long
As every galaxy was formed in less time than it takes to sing this song
A fraction of a second and the elements were made
The bipeds stood up straight, the dinosaurs all met their fate
They tried to leap but they were late
And they all died (they froze their asses off)
The oceans and Pangea, see ya wouldn't wanna be ya
Set in motion by the same big bang
It all started with the big bang
It's expanding ever outward but one day
It will pause and start to go the other way
Collapsing ever inward, we won't be here, it won't be heard
Our best and brightest figure that it'll make an even bigger bang
Australopithecus would really have been sick of us
Debating how we're here, they're catching deer (we're catching viruses)
Religion or astronomy (Descartes or Deuteronomy)

Music and mythology, Einstein and astrology

"Helldivers","t5_2ya0t","I'd design instead the system in a way where the durable stat doesn't exist anymore and any weapon can damage any armor. The difference Is that of a weapon has light pen it will do 100% damage against the armor plate itself, 50% against medium armor plates and 25/33% against heavy armor plates. I'm specifying armor plates because from now the enemies' armor is going to be composed of various plates with their own hp pool. The player can shoot straight to the plate until it runs out of hp and cracks open, leaving an opening to an exposed body part that will deplete the enemy hp pool when hit. This way any weapon can be effective, especially if the team coordinates (so there is some teamplay involved in this) by focusing fire with their primaries or support weapons they can take down an armor plate and start taking down the bigger enemies, even with the primaries themselves. Explosives will do always 100% armor damage or even higher on larger areas, taking down multiple plates, but based on the explosive power it will determine how much of that damage will be taken by the enemy's own hp pool while stuff like the Railgun is specialized in destroying a single heavy plate in a couple of unsafe shots while also dealing damage to the hp pool with augmented weakspot damage, which will make it both powerful again and capable of having its place in the weapon sandbox.

I'm sure that this system will make a weapon's dps instead of single shot damage and penetration far more relevant while making every gun able to even take down a Titan with enough precision and ammo (and no, it won't make the damn game too easy, even with this system go try and mag dump multiple mags on a chasing titan with at least 3 chargers around, multiple hunters and maybe another titan, you need better weapons and a team backup). Also balancing will become easier since all that needs to be taken in consideration is how long it takes with how many resources spent to destroy armor and deplete the hp pool of an enemy without any of those absurd % multipliers that change between every single weapon and if the weapon can even penetrate the armor in question",1722470427.0

Maybe it was due to injury, or the infamous “sophomore slump,” but he has a *long* way to go offensively before he can be called a great offensive player. It’s still very much an open question whether he can or will address his offensive deficits—as you say yourself, he has work to do on the discipline side. I could be wrong, of course, but nothing I’ve seen from him so far suggests he will turn the corner in some significant way.

"singularity","t5_2qh8m","Even if you don't believe that raping and murdering your human neighbor is any different ethically from stepping on a blade of grass, as you're saying... the meat industry ***still*** results in more worldwide death, because it kills far more plants to raise and slaughter billions of animals annually than it would to just raise the plants needed to feed humanity directly with equivalent calories... *and* it kills all the animals in cruel ways. So you're doubling (or more) up on the death.

I'm not saying that there is any absolute truth to the universe...we all ultimately choose our own values and ethics (by way of the influences on our life and outlook). Still, relativism only goes so far - ethical frameworks should still at least be internally consistent. I'm not out to tell anyone they're evil for eating a cheeseburger. This line of argument, though, regarding the minimization of death/suffering, isn't supportive of the conclusion that the current meat industry practices are 'ethical', no matter how one spins it.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","3 nights? Get the kids to arrange sleepovers with friends. 

Honestly, sit them down and ask them what they want to do while mum is away. Is there an activity you can do together? Make a deal with them to make this time with you special.

Kids this age don't want baby siblings hanging around. Why did you decide to have a little one, and were the older ones on board with this? I know most people think it's an adult only decision but ffs it should be a family thing if it means the older kids feel displaced.

"videography","t5_2qwgz","I actually came across this when looking for a monitor, and for the price, i was hesitant because i thought it was too good to be true, so i didnt include it in my decision making, but now looking at your comment, i might just get that one. Great brightness, is bigger than other rec from other people. And has touch screen.

Also the price i was looking on was 310 dollars, so right on budget too.

My only concern is with extenral monitors there can be some input delay, have you experienced any of these delays in video, so you cant monitor good enough.

I mostly record myself in general, thats why i wanted a 6 or 7 inch display

During the first 48 hours after posting each submission is accepting user ratings. After that period a final score will be calculated and a corresponding flair assigned to the post.

To vote you have to add a comment with your rating on a scale of 1 to 10.

A valid vote must include a numeric rate in the following format: **X/10** \- where X is a number between 1 and 10 (you can use one decimal place for partials).

*You can have other text in the comment too - just make sure to include the rating.*

Here are some examples:

    VALID: Gorgeous tits 9/10
    VALID: 8.5/10
    VALID: You are a dream come true 3/10

    NOT VALID: Perfect tits
    NOT VALID: 100/10

It's not that you can't use a D-pad with solely rotation, it's that you haven't learned how. If you can use an analog stick you're capable of learning to use a D-pad properly.

Beating Absrad for the first time isn't necessarily even that many hours depending on the player. People switch up inputs in Rocket League at 8000+ hours all the time, it just comes down to desire.

Like I said, play games however you want, but if someone is considering learning to use a better input device - my advice is - it's cool you found a game you like enough to learn the better way, and it will improve future game experiences because it's the input device the metroidvania genre was built around.",1722470431.0

I told him I was done and started moving forward with divorce.  He literally begged for another chance. I said 1 year, and he had to be 100% honest.  About 9 months in I find out he was living with another woman, I filed that day.

Some states allow a blood relative to sue for a portion of the estate if they are not named in the will, BUT this is on the grounds that the individual was unintentionally forgotten. In the states that allow this lawsuit, you lose the right to contest the will if the will explicitly states that you were not to inherit anything by intentional choice. Not all states allow this, and even then, the suit does not grant full ownership of the estate to the person that sues. The estate is typically divided into equal shares if the lawsuit is successful. 

Next of kin only matters if the deceased passes without a will. If there is a legally recognized will, then next of kin has no legal standing generally speaking. 

Anything inherited from the will is subject to inheritance tax. 

By law, you may will your estate to anyone of your choice, blood relation or not. You may even forego relatives and will your estate to charities if you so choose. There are no US laws that require your estate to be given to your children or a blood relative.",1722470431.0

With this strong capital base, you'll flip cosmetics or something to earn ""spending money."" Every once in a wihle, your ""spending money"" will be enough to buy the bis equipment. that meseta has been effectively deleted from your account, because it won't be earning you any more profits.

Suddenly I have all the answers about everything, every thought/wonder I ever had. Everything is so clear, and wow, even though the truth/reality is hard, in a way it's beautiful too. I think, learning about bpd really is the first step. Becoming aware. Self-love/self-care. Aside from learning about bpd you have to be willing to face yourself, face your own fears.

The circle hooks are best for kids number one because it lowers incidental self hooking, And number two because it massively lowers gut hooking/killing/bleeding a fish which often times upsets kids and turns them off to fishing.


If you do want to go the lure route instead, then a fluoro sabiki with size 6 hooks and a 1/2 oz weight should get them fish as well.  If you go that route, be sure to get or make a de-hooker and learn how to properly use it.",1722470432.0

"criminalminds","t5_2sv0q","So, I think the confession makes total sense, but only if JJ is lying, including to herself.

JJ and Spencer match each other's attractiveness levels and look good to each other at first glance, but not after seeing them interact. JJ isn't book smart, but she's emotionally and socially intelligent, and Spencers the opposite. From the beginning, she's treated Spence like a child, and because his brain works differently, he actually WAS the emotionally, socially immature, and even physically immature ""nerd"" from the beginning. 

Unlike Hotch, Gideon, Morgan, Elle, and even Prentiss and Garcia, she never saw potential. He was willing to learn from everybody. Morgan especially forced him out of his comfort zone and made him physically fit. Obviously, Morgan's not gay, but he loved Reid more than JJ did. He truly understood him and knew how to push. 

And that is where JJ is the opposite of in love with him - she didn't even respect him as a man enough to go on a few dates with him in the beginning, for fun. After 3 PhDs, she only thought of him as sexy Rainman and couldn't ""take advantage"" of him. She thinks he can't even handle a few dates. Once again, Elle (and Layla and Cat Adams and random prostitutes) flirted with him because she respected him. Prentiss speaks to him as an equal. Garcia finds common ground with him. JJ's no different from all the horny ""fangirls"" who make fun of his autistic traits while having a poster up of him. She only tolerates his personality. She is the corn-fed size zero social climbing mean girl Spencer describes her as. He awknowleges her beauty, but she's so conceited she resents *herself* for her conflicting feelings. He'll never love her like Meave, but his love for her isn't condescending or covering up harsher truths. ""Older sister"" energy is strange when they're the same age, and I don't see him express misogyny despite her looking tiny next to him. 

So she always had feelings. None of them were pure. She probably would've broken up with him anyway and reserved pure love for Will. Will is the traditionally masculine successful man she wants. Instead, she regrets suppressing her feelings in the beginning and leads him on a decade later, after being repeatedly humbled for a decade straight.",1722470433.0

"KingdomHearts","t5_2s3jo","one thing i think thats noted with the bequeathment is that its never guarenteed riku would get one, terra only passed on the potential for riku to claim it given he had the qualities to do so.  infact if anything he failed the ""test"" by not having the makings to wield it initially with it jumping to sora.

Only later did he regain it, and by that point Sora had made the one initially meant to go to riku's his own. With riku presumably manifesting another one later.

Its rather unclear but my best assumption of that situation.  Riku had been intentionally avoiding the recomplete sora throughout kh2 until after he obtained master form where he actually appears but only uses soul eater (might have been WayttDawn, not sure).  Even demanding mickey not tell sora where he is.

My guess of the reason for this is because if he did too early, there is a chance that he would reclaim the keyblade from sora like in kh1. By the time Sora obtained master form, he had literally mastered the keyblade and made it his own completely. Meaning riku no longer had to worry about taking it from him.

Though honestly i doubt it fully explains everything. At this point, what fully explains anything in this series.",1722470433.0

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Not sure if this means anything or not, but very often when I find someone who likes RimWorld, they describe their playthrough the same way one might write a book.

I kind of compare it to D&D. For a lot of people who try it and don't like it, their experience was ""I want to attack x"", ""ok, roll the dice"", *rolls* ""I got a 18"", ""ok, you did 8 damage... Wait, didn't your mace have +2 on it?""... Etc. for the ones that seem to enjoy it, their experience goes""I lunge forward and attack with my mace, bringing it up over my head before it comes crashing down with a mighty blow crushing the goblins skull"".

Basically they seem to be people who are able to take the basic mechanics we actually see in front of us and, in their head, develop a convincing and fleshed out scenario around it. For people like me who just see some dice, paper and maybe figurines, it often falls short of the same experience.

Now, I've never actually played RimWorld, so take that with a huge grain of salt, I just happened to notice that when I see people gush over it I often see these elaborate stories along with them that I highly doubt the game is playing out in exactly the detail that they provide.",1722470433.0

You have to get dog vaccinated and dewormed.  If you are planning to get a puppy you'll have to understand that puppies dont have bladder control they will pee in 20 places sometimes you clean up one spot only to see a puddle in another place. .  You will have to be very patient and understanding. You will have to decide whether you want a indoor dog or an outdoor dog you cant get indoor dogs like Labrador and tie them outside your house. You will have dog fur everywhere. 
Dogs need to be trained and socialized properly which is a big task takes lot of time and again patience from your side. Each dog is unique so has to be handled according to their personality. 
Puppies need to chew you have to provide them with chews otherwise you can say goodbye to your furniture. 
Food please understand dog is not an omnivore its a facultative carnivore needs meat... They'll survive without meat but they will thrive and have better quality of life with meat based diet. 
It is not easy to raise a dog. But it is very rewarding to raise one .
And breed doesn't matter a dog is a dog choose whichever you feel you can do best with. Please do research on breed specific requirements and choose which dog fits your lifestyle

Witnessed a lot of stage-craft, and a lot of beautiful gift shops, and even scored two Blanton's for $63 each at BT, but the absolute highlight was meeting David and staff at Glenn's Creek. A $15 tour revealed a veritable distillation of truth, knowledge of whiskey distillation, and common sense, and a tasting of available expressions that resulted in my wife landing on Cafe Ole and myself homing in on the O.C.D. #5 ,which I had hoped would live up to expectation. Suffice to say, I held off from some Whiskey Row gift shop offerings because I knew I would be swinging by Glenn's Creek on the way home for another 750 of OCD. Mine were both barrel #145, and I look forward to running out so I can justify the three hour trip back to sample future barrels. Not an off-profile bourbon offering, but my new go to. In a market full of $30 bourbon with $50 stories, this is a virtuoso practicing centuries old processes for an undeserving clientele.

There's a lot of free pieces of art to do this with but there's also pieces of art that you have to pay money for. And anyone who's able to get through the process of making files that pass the technical requirements can have art in the paid section.

They can also be re-sold after purchase; some of them go for absolutely absurd amounts of money, most of them do not. Sometimes the artist and Reddit get a cut of the resales. Sometimes they don't. At its peak, before that cut of the resale became optional, I paid my rent off of my share of resales alone. It was a *very* nice side gig when the program began, it's a lot less attractive now.

"Enneagram","t5_2sdjj","It is to me. First, enneagram has helped me figure out why I do ~~stupid~~ things which enables me to fix things. MBTI is the how I perceive and rationalize the world.

Also helps to see it in other people and, wow. Fi can be super evil. 

I wish people knew more about both because it helps to strengthen the weak spots, but also understand others better. Knowing someone is a 2 helps to consider how and why doing something like praising them for their help is important. Understanding Fe helps to know that it's (mostly) just a facet of who they are when around others and not fake.

Alles auf einmal oder in Tranchen?

Alles sofort, Stichwort ""Time in the market"", oder zumindest relativ rasch. Maximal 6-10 Monate.

Cost-Averaging hat nur dann wirklich einen Vorteil, wenn der Markt hohe Volatilität hat und stagniert. Der Gral ist langfristig eher stabil wachsend, also ungeeignet.


Alles in den Gral oder etwas diversifizieren?

Der Gral ist eigentlich schon weit genug gestreut, maximal noch etwas Emerging Markets dazu, dann passt das schon.
Als Spielerei vielleicht noch ein paar Prozent in Unternehmen, die dich persönlich interessieren, als Motivationsbooster.


Und bezüglich dem Hausbauthema: 4-10 Jahre sind schon unterste Grenze, ob es sich überhaupt auszahlt, das Geld in den Aktienmarkt zu geben, da würde ich fast noch auf gutes Festgeld setzen. Interessant wird's so ab 8-15 Jahren.

"UserExperienceDesign","t5_2ug9m"," I studied UX and UI online out of BrainStation's Florida office in Spring 2024.  My time in their program was fraught with challenges, and I believe it’s important to outline what went wrong:

**1. Conveyor Belt Approach:** It increasingly felt like BrainStation operates more like a factory, churning out students without genuine regard for their learning process or success. The focus appeared to be on maximizing enrollment and revenue rather than providing a meaningful educational experience. This approach was demoralizing and made it seem like students were just another number to be processed.

**2. Double Standards and Punctuality Problems:** Students are required to maintain 90% attendance, yet instructors frequently showed up 5-15 minutes late or ran over their lecture times. This inconsistency was frustrating and undermined the integrity of the program.

**3. Rushed Lectures and Unreliable Sessions:** Lectures were often extremely rushed, with little opportunity for interactive discussion. Sessions were also unreliable due to missed or delayed lectures and technical issues that affected the delivery.

**4. Lack of Encouragement for Creative and Critical Thinking:** The program does not foster a creative approach or encourage critical thinking. Instead, it often emphasizes rote learning and strict adherence to predetermined methods, which stifles innovation and personal growth.

**5. Discrepancies in Professionalism:** Instructors frequently failed to meet the standards they set for students. Their preparation for lectures was often inadequate, leading to disruptions and delays, which felt disrespectful to our time.

**6. Negative Impact on Student Experience:** The overall environment felt passive-aggressive, and the promises of support often fell short. Many students, including myself, felt that the program did not live up to its claims of providing a supportive learning experience.

**Conclusion:** The program is massively overpriced, and my experience has convinced me that prospective students should consider other, more reputable institutions or alternative learning methods. BrainStation's focus on profit over quality and support undermines the value of their educational offerings and does not encourage a creative or critical approach to learning.

If you’re considering BrainStation, please take these factors into account. My hope is that sharing my experience will help others make a more informed decision.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to ask if you have any questions about my experience.",1722470438.0

"devsarg","t5_2yucqq","Con respecto a eso la verdad depende mucho tu caso y como percibas al recruiter o la persona con la que hayas contactado. 

Te cuento como fue mi caso en ambas posiciones: 

En el primero (live coding) me hablo un recruiter para trabajar con Node - Express - React me ofrecio 800 USD por mes, por mi experiencia y porque ni siquiera me esmere en buscar algo mejor, le clave el visto y no me intereso mas la propuesta por esa paga. 

Me volvio a hablar, me dice que el pago es charlable. Le dije que mi rango eran 2000 - 2500, y se estiró a 1800. Conforme más hablaba con este vago se notaba que necesitaban a alguien urgente para meter al proyecto y eso es justamente con lo que especulé para negociar mi sueldo y otras condiciones de la posición.

  
En el segundo caso, era un trabajo para acá, con duración de 4 meses y ya con muy buena paga, asumí que iban a haber muchisimas mas postulaciones (siendo un trabajo local) y en ese caso daría bastante igual pedir más, porque van a agarrar a alguien que lo necesite por menos plata inclusive.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","> -Does God REALLY prefer sexual frustration in a marriage

God REALLY prefers we learn to love and accept each other in our totality, including our fertility, and to learn to discipline our physical expression of that love around the way He created us. If we intentionally sterilize sexual intimacy, then it seems to me that even the unitive aspect is compromised because of the rejection of the procreative nature of the other person: I love you mostly...just not the fact that you might conceive a child with me in this act.

Yes, it is often frustrating, just like waiting for marriage is frustrating, but not because God wants us to be frustrated, but because we are fallen creatures. Original sin broke the alignment of our will to God's, and even the alignment of the desires of our flesh to our own wills. It's not God's will that is actually the frustrating part, but rather our concupiscence.

And believe me, from practicing NFP rigorously due to struggling with my job and struggling with the duties of being an adequate father even to the children I do have, I know it's ridiculously frustrating. But it is a difficulty my wife and I struggle against together, and I think that joint struggle has its own unitive effect, even if one very different in nature.

> over a couple being able to enjoy the freedom of unity?

Our concupiscence makes it hard to see it this way, but freedom does not mean always being able to follow the desires of our bodies. The sense that our desires are insurmountable is, in fact, the opposite of freedom. It is slavery. Learning discipline and patience is part of how we overcome this slavery and become holier, more ready to be with God in heaven, where we will experience even greater joy than any earthly experience.

> Or would he rather I risk myself to having way more children that I can't support?

This question really is subordinate to the others, as the others give us the answer to how to maritally live within our means.

> If NFP is the correct way, then why would God create women to desire sex the most when they can't have it?

I suppose in part because due to our naturally self-centered nature, we need extra prompting to accept the calling to be fruitful and multiply, and then to dedicate ourselves to our families and learn greater love through raising children.

All the best in your discernment. Again, I know how challenging this is. It's a challenge many of us also face.",1722470439.0

Anyway, through a combo of me not noticing certain context clues, and the videos basically being presented as real found footage, I believed for years that I had watched the actual stalking and murder of a young woman, documented by a killer with a camera.

That might be why he is a picky eater because he knows the food is making him sick. Switch to a sensitive stomach dry food and see if that helps. I get Purina because I can pick it up at the grocery, but there are many sensitive stomach brands at the pet store that you can try. You can give him some canned food like Science Diet, but don’t give him too much of a lesser brand like Friskies. Also don’t give him milk. Chicken and rice will help harden his stool so try that as a treat. Like I said, I’ve had 3 flamepoints and the only similar trait is they all have big personalities and make their presence known. They are also affectionate and love their person. 

Your poor baby needs to have a diet that is healthy for him, and you’ll be surprised at the change. But if his stool stays loose, take him to the vet because it is nut normal and he could get dehydrated.",1722470441.0

I could only see the back of him, but from what I saw, the first thing that popped into my head was “Oh that’s my ex Tim”. I quickly remembered it couldn’t be him since he had already passed. Who knows why I even thought that, since I couldn’t even see this guys face, but for whatever reason my first initial thought was that it was him. About a half a mile up the road, not even a minute later, Tim’s mom pulled out in front of me driving.

I fully get why they did it, the first couple of games were so bad that without piggybacking of off Bokujo Monogatari it would have died the same way Hometown Story did and that game is significantly better then the first Natsume Moon game (it's like a solid 4/10).

On the otherhand if it wasn't for SoS1 and SoS: 3oT being so fantastic and selling well despite the name change who knows if the series could have died in the west. Which was one of the biggest fears in the community especially when you consider the announced Bokumono game hadn't received a western release date but the first bootleg was already coming out.

Personally I would never buy a Natsume game regardless of quality since they are the biggest scumbags in the AA space and the actual HM series has like 50 games (counting spin offs) so there's literally no reason to ever get them when I have that and indie titles.",1722470442.0

People keep putting words in my mouth and attacking a strawman version of what I said.

* Try to force or pressure people to transition, especially along a specific timetable or path.

I didn't say, *and never said*, that trans folks shouldn't mention or talk about trans topics with other people. . .which SO many people here seem to think the prime directive advocates (or that I advocated for). 

There's a **world** of difference between:

""Have you ever thought about your gender identity?  If you're interested I can point out some things you can read for more information or talk about my own transition."" (Good!  This is to be encouraged.)

""You're obviously trans, you're just in denial!

"ProstateCancer","t5_2s1qy","I have a Gleason 8 and just went through surgery last Friday. I am 56 and in great health otherwise. I can tell you that it was a whirlwind especially finding out late April when I had the PSA test a second time at 9.5. My first PSA was in 2022 at 7, but I didn’t know anything about what it was and so I simply did not go back until two years later for an annual physical. In any case, went through the mri, found a lesion, went through biopsy found cancer and switch surgeons immediately( I needed the best possible surgeon for this).. very important.. then got a PET CT scan that showed cancer was contained in the prostate.
Went through the surgery, my surgeon was able to spare my nerves and am waiting to get the catheter removed on Friday. Do not have the final pathology report yet, but am hoping the cancer is completely out.  I remain optimistic as I do not believe radiation is absolutely a foregone conclusion after surgery every time. Perhaps others can shed a light on this. Things will look up after surgery, be supportive of your husband, he is going to go through a major procedure. My wife told me this is a comma in life, not a period!

Don't ever compare their situations to yours though--not everyone's relationship or marriage is sunshine & rainbows, and be happy no one is currently stressing you out the way some partners do one another daily lol. Take some needed time to get your last man out of your system then try to put yourself back out there, you may be surprised by what you reel in. Also, understand that while you're single, this is your time to build yourself up to be the woman for the very man/men you wanna attract. You can find good single men at the gym, shopping, on leisure trips, or even running errands out and about. Be intentional and have your eyes open for solid candidates. Be open-minded if you can for what quirks they come with. Don't feel pressured to rush commitment, but clearly communicate what you're looking for. Have options if possible just in case one is non-committal or doesn't align with you. I'm sure some years from now you'll be telling a different story, with a new man who's all about you.

Even before facial recognition was a thing, people were doxxed, if they became big enough.  If I want to be successful with this, I know that I have to assume I will be ""discovered"" and anything less would be great.

However, after spending a lot of time on Reddit sites, I find that there are so many posts with a similar theme, and one can truly spiral out with ""should I get this VPN"" or ""am I removing enough metadata"" and I think it's anxiety-inducing.  If you are doing this, I think one of the most important things to process, is that you can't control what is going to happen, and the most important thing is guarding your mental health and stability.  Because you could adhere to every precaution that the best cybersecurity experts recommend, but we all know that nothing is a guarantee.

  
I am not discouraging anyone from taking precautions, I think I just like to remind people I know, that shit can/will happen and but if you are obsessing over how to make it not happen, are you truly focusing on how profitable you can be?

"EldenRingLoreTalk","t5_66m6fk","I think the order of operations here is important for intent, but perhaps not outcomes. I think Miquella had Radahn as his promised consort a long time ago, but maybe Radahn wasn't fully on board, and so Miquella send Malenia to get him - maybe kill him, but rotting him wasn't part of the plan. Now... that's a stretch, because Radahn revered Godfrey, so he was probably on board to be an Elden Lord t some point in his past. So maybe Radahn stopped the stars simply to save his town, and not to stop the Empyreans from following their fates, and he prioritized that over Miquella's plans.

I think Miquella embedding himself in the Haligtree was part of his plan, and by abandoning his flesh in the tree, he would be able to create a second/replacement Erdtree (and thus save all the Albuneric cocoons there). But the journey to the land of shadow as we saw it (abandoning his flesh in parts) was necessitated through his abduction by Mogh (that Mogh did on his own, or he was accidentally influenced by Miquella at a prior time). He then used his influence over Mogh for the rest. This is in support of your timeline.

Miquella had a lot of irons in the fire, or just had a lot of time to try a lot of things. I don't know the deal with Castle Sol. Who was the soulless comrade he was trying to revive there? Was it a blueprint for what he intended to do with Radahn? Was it Melina's body, possibly (in the mausoleum nerby)? Maybe some other demigod entirely. Godwyn was souless with a body that wouldn't die, so initially I thought it was about hims, but Miquella seemed intent on giving him a true death, not a revival - and Radahn was Miquella's promised consort, not Golden Order Golden Boy Godwyn.

How did Miquella know what was going on in Caelid? Well, we find a lot to do with St. Trina in Caelid - it could just be from one of her monks, but St.Trina, a part of Miquella, may have travelled to Caelid to observe the conflict (or the fallout), so then decided to enact the Mogh plan - it's possible the Mogh plan involved luring him to the Haligtree, or it's possible Miquella's cocoon was already abducted. We know Miquella tried to use his blood to fertilize the tree, and this gave Mogh a way in, that may not have been an accident.

Some things there is no way of knowing with the info given.",1722470444.0
"LSAT","t5_2qsf8","There's actually a bit more to answer choice (C) that's worth noting -- in fact I'd be a bit uneasy about disqualifying an answer choice on that sort of technicality: weakeners don't have to be ""complete"". Showing that there's a plausible ""alternative"" way to understand the evidence that doesn't lead to the conclusion is very often enough.

But the deeper issue with (C) is that it wouldn't really do much to explain why office workers are doing ***worse*** than the physical laborers. (C) basically shows that physical laborers have ways to ***mitigate*** the heavy stresses to their lower back (and even then, not necessarily eliminate). But that wouldn't explain why they're doing ***better*** compared to office workers: office workers don't have those heavy stresses in the first place. So shouldn't they still be coming out ahead?

This is actually a pattern that comes up semi-frequently in paradox questions, enough that it's worth getting used to. They'll set up a paradox whereby ""one group"" that has some inherent problems, as it turns out, is actually doing ""better"" than ""another group"" that doesn't have those problems. And one of the answers will touch on how the ""one group"" mitigates the damage with the inherent problem to some degree. But often that doesn't do all that much: that only explains why they're not doing ***as bad as they could be***, but not why they're doing ***better***.

So as an example, you might have a paradox question that goes something like, ""Long-distance running is known to cause stresses on knee joints that causes arthritis, but statistics show that long-distance runners have much lower rates of arthritis than other people do.""

And an answer choice might say something like, ""Long-distance runners overwhelmingly avoid running on hard concrete, which is known to create much harsher stresses on knee joints than does running on softer surfaces.""

Which can be tempting -- that shows how they ***limit*** the damage. But the problem is the same one: even if the damage is limited, these are still stresses that other people wouldn't be subject to at all. So why are they coming out ***ahead*** of other people in terms of arthritis rates?

Hope that helps!",1722470444.0

"FriendsofthePod","t5_3joru","**synopsis:** Donald Trump suggests that Kamala Harris isn’t actually Black, claims that nobody died on January 6, and belittles his interviewers before his campaign yanks him off the stage at the National Association of Black Journalists convention. Jon Lovett and guest host Stacey Abrams react to the train wreck in real time. Stacey describes the scene at Kamala Harris’s big rally in Atlanta on Tuesday and offers her takes on the JD Vance disaster and how Harris should defend herself from right-wing attacks. Then, Jon and Stacey preview her new podcast for Crooked Media!

The secret nexus of the plot was supposedly the international Bilderberger meetings on banking policy. The anti-Semitic Noontide Press distributed Pawns in the Game for many years.[12]""

Most people couldn't afford the writing equipment neither the reading skill, so why would they?

So, marrying your cousins was reserved for nobility. Fucking your family isn't. We can't say they did, but we can't say they didn't, and I suspect they did because people still do. It's kind of a thing for some people.

- People did fuck outside of their wedding a lot

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

"PHbuildapc","t5_495kd9","It's a combination of branding + minor QOL features tulad ng better spacing for cable management, better material na mas matibay/mas magaan, compatibility for niche features such as yung new ASUS A21 na may cutout para sa new motherboards for ""wireless"" builds na nasa likod na yung saksakan ng cables.  

You could take a budget Tecware case and compare it with a more expensive case pero majority ng makikita mo parehas lang sa dimensions at general design. Pero makikita mo mas convenient yung hinge ng glass panel ng mas mahal, yung front panel na mesh filter magnetic na madali buksan-isara kesa sa hard plastic na matigas na hatak at hampas pabalik need. Rubber grommets vs. wala. May cover sa cables vs. naked holes. Front/top panel i/o cables yung mas premium cases nakasama sama na sa isang plug nalang vs. isa-isa sa majority ng budget cases, etc. 

Ganun naman majority ng cases, 2000-3500php cases are around 70-80% similar to the 5000-6000php cases but the price difference is justified by how much you're willing to pay for the 20-30% qol improvements/convenient features.

Syempre di pa jan considered na yung iba eh practically the same case naman apart from the pre-installed RGB fans+fan hub. 

Pero some have significantly better airflow talaga pero depende lang din talaga sa gawa at di siya exclusive to expensive cases. The NZXT 510 is infamous for having bad airflow. Magkano yan dito? 6-7k ata para sa mid-tower version? Eh kahit local Rakk Haliya na phased out na for <2k mas maganda pa airflow dun

It all depends on you. May mga taong 40-50k budget lang pero ipipilit yung mga 5k cases na sikat na brand pero merong mga katulad ko na nung nagbuild may 70k budget pero yung 1800 na Rakk Haliya na may discount pa binili kasi basic airflow lang naman habol ko haha",1722470446.0

As for the Minneapolis bridge collapse, also mentioned in this episode, mothman sightings were only reported after the disaster. This makes them less credible (to use a word that’s repeated ad nauseum throughout this episode) and unlike the Point Pleasant bridge collapse, where sightings were documented well before the disaster.

Also I want to add that the creepiest part of the Mothman legend is Indrid Cold and it’s odd that both the original UM segment and this episode omit it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indrid_Cold

2. Ano nebudoval jsem firmu. Firma je jen název. Já budoval společnosti a mimo jiné taky umím matematiku. Aby tvůj příklad byl relevantní, tak ho převedu do správných čísel. Zvednout produkci z 10 na 30 je lehčí než zvednout produkci ze 60 na 120. Jestli myslíš, že z 5000 na 6000 je dvojnásobek tak se obavam, že začínám rozumět tomu, proč je tak těžké z tebe dostat cokoliv kloudného. Nicméně já to s tebou nevzdám. Zdvojnásobit produkci z 10 na 20 je rozhodně jednodušší než z 5000 na 10000. Navíc pokud se (jako v případě standard oil) naráží na technologické nebo kapacitní limity, tak je těžší i růst z 200 na 300 než z 100 na 200. 
3. No na rozdíl od tebe já podložil svoje tvrzení daty a na tvoje jsem reagoval. To ty jsi tady ten, co není schopen argumentovat. Vrátím ti krásné ad hominem, když už jsme se teda dostali na tuhle úroveň. Jak typické pro ancapa naprosto ignorovat argumenty, když se mu nehodí. 
4. Že jsi to ty, tak já tedy základní pojmy ekonomiky, které bys pro tuto debatu měl znát a ovládat (pokud tvrdíš, že se vyznáš v ekonomice) podložím. Však není nic jednoduššího, protože na rozdíl od tebe jen tak bezduše neplkám. [Zde](https://www.studysmarter.co.uk/explanations/microeconomics/market-efficiency/tariffs/) v článku máš shrnutí jak fungují cla a pár příkladů, kde podporují ekonomiku.
5. Tak to dokaž, ty tvrdíš, že je to jiné. Já tvrdím, že je to stejné. Klasická důkazní rovina funguje tak, že ten, kdo tvrdí nějakou odchylku dokazuje tvrzení. To, že se proměnil typ práce je fakt, ale rozhodně není pravda, že je potřeba menší délka. To, že jen ty jsi parazit na tom nic nezmění. Což je mimochodem krásné, protože to, co prezentuješ je výborný příklad socialismu a jeho parazitovaní na pracovní síle. Pracuješ méně s menší hodnotou neodpovídající přínosu společnosti, ale chceš si socialisticky bránit svůj parazitismus tím, že devalvuješ práci jiných. Vidím, že jsem našel pravého socialistu. Jen připomenu ad komínem jsi začal ty. Až skončíš rád skončím i já. Možná až začneš s argumenty tak se někam dostaneme.
6. Způsobovaly (ropná společnost je rodu ženského). A děláš si srandu jak moc velkou mentální gymnastiku musíš předvádět, když se v bodu, kde se bavíme o grafických kartách dostaneš k ropným společnostem? Jestli okamžitě nezačneš reagovat na to, co říkám a nikoliv na to, co chceš, tak končíme. Ostatně můj liberalně konzervativní přístup je v ekonomice ten, který je a bude preferovaný a ten tvůj extremistický se nikdy neprosadí takže já nemám potřebu tě přesvědčovat.",1722470447.0

That is why human are considered unique. Somethings in life don’t have an absolute answer. Nonetheless its doesn’t stop anyone from making hypotheses/theories. 

> Each is negotiating their text to derive, meaning they find useful. If it was strictly in the confines of that, I don’t think I would need to ever ask someone to substantiate their claims. 

Do you require others confirmation for your beliefs? If the answer is no then you might understand why theist don’t necessarily require atheist to accept god existence. It’s not bad asking or finding reason why theist belief in x, but the reasoning provided might not resonate with you/atheist. 

Example: pro life vs pro-choice both side can provide reasoning but there is no absolute answer to which one is correct. in the end the reasoning that resonates with individual is what they end up believing. 

In the case atheist they haven’t found a reasoning that resonates with them particularly to belief in God. 

> Those people are most likely not purposely but are not admitting to negotiating with their text. 

Think of it this way in car crash you can have multiple witness but when asked each witness individually will provide you different story about how the crash happened. Overall the crash did happen but the story is different based on who you ask. 

When it comes holy book almost all are not straight forward thus different interpretations are given. This why every religion has different sects. 

The core idea of any religion with God is that god exists. All holy book has  presupposition that God exists.  Meaning It’s recommended to establish a God exists prior to discussing religion or at least should be accepted for the sake of argument. Religion doesn’t prove God exists. What the holy book tries establishes is which God is correct among the many versions.",1722470447.0

Another somewhat non related PSA; Also another interesting thing is how low orbit satellites are destroying the ozone layer. On a related note, the holes in the ozone contribute to global warming, and melt ice caps. When those ice caps melt they release methane gas into the atmosphere.

Hey folks. Ive posted before but wanted some perspective.

I have a 2022 Telluride and has almost 80k miles. I drive a lot (120miles a day 5d ays a week).  Is it worth getting rid of it and rebuying a 3 row SUV (need size for family) just to get a car with less miles so I dont run out of mfr warranty and have a better sellback? Bought for 47. Have 21 left on it.  What probably will happen is I'll have my wife drive that Car and I will switch and drive hers but the question still stands ---is it worth getting out of it now before that 100k mile mark to get a better resale value

  
Let me know your thoughts!

"onguardforthee","t5_3icow","Maybe the Olympics isn’t your thing, but I do think that the Olympics is one of the few times host cities invest in “fun” for their citizens. And I think “fun” IS something cities Should invest in.

In Brazil Rio De Janeiro, they had a free Madonna concert with like 1 million people showing up. Olympics should be weighed against doing things like that. However they never do Put it this way. Cities do not invest much in giant public events for their people to have fun at, the Olympics gives them an excuse to do so.

i get that at a time when maybe one’s public transit and roads are crumbling, they may want to sort that out first before investing in fun which is fair. But this idea that for an Olympics host city to find it worth it they need to generate an economic return is not the right mindset. The mindset should be, what is the budget as a city I’m willing to spend on my people having fun, and is it enough to host an Olympics? If so, do my people prefer spending money on the Olympics or a free Taylor Swift concert or a giant carnival every summer etc.?

the conversation should not be “Will I generate a 15% return in my Olympic investment”.",1722470449.0

Imagine there were all these medals in basketball. Do you really think you would have a Phelps there? Absolutely never. Curry would win all the shooting and be hopeless at everything else. Athletic abilities would go to some extremely atheltic guys who again might not win much more. Kyrie would win handles but probably nothing else. And so on. Maybe Jordan would have won quite a few categories, but then again, he WAS so great in basically every aspect of the game, just like Phelps in swimming. Nowadays, there is no such player. Phelps is phenomenal, and arguably infinitely more dominant than any basketball player of this current era.",1722470451.0

"virgin","t5_2rs2k","There's a LOT of things about the subject, and obviously your situation might look a lot different to others, but the most important thing is just to not let it get to your head. A lot of people will fixate on the idea of relationships and intimacy, as if they are keys to fix their low self-esteem, when people in relationships and people who regularly hook-up with people, are still depressed. It dosen't fix anything, or makes life more bearable, at most it's temporary relief. I craved and wanted romance for so long that I built unhealthy and unrealistic expectations in my head, that ruined a lot of the relationships I ended up having. What I found helped me, was unironically building purely platonic friendships with a lot of women. Granted, I'm a lot less socially anxious tham a lot of people, so take that into account, but making friends with people of the opposite gender, where you have NO internal goal of romance, will help you more than anything. Cause it teaches you that women are ~individual~ just like you. It teaches you what characteristics you vibe with most, it teaches you to be openminded and in touch with your emotional side with zero shame. Don't believe the bullshit incels say that women won't make friends with you if you're an emotional man, even before I came out as trans, 85% of my friendgroup was women, and they never ever shamed me for how openly sensitive and emotional I was. And low and behold, sometimes relationships would form. Authentically, and organically.",1722470451.0

Would be so nice if there had been video surveillance in the house.

I also find it very strange that the husband didn't get worried by the phone cutting out and the sounds that were happening before.
That's why I have Amazon Echo devices in my home and my parents home. So when something happens or the phone gets disconnected I always immediately check on the echo devices. You can use a feature called drop in, where the call basically doesn't need to be accepted. You can just drop in as the name says. It's video and audio and you can try to call out the persons name, if no one responds... We'll then 911 and race there... I think this should be normal practice. This is even better than home surveillance as you can communicate with the other person. Only downside is that you don't have any recorded video but well...",1722470451.0

July 15,2024 I go personally sa Antipolo branch nila how to process a refund since di nga keri makabitan ng internet yung house namin due to location, I've decided to cancel nalang request to get my money back. Their agent told me na after mareceived yung refund form and masubmit yung form just give them 10 business days and then the money will be back on my account. I've received the refund form July 16,2024 and submitted it. I received a text message July 29,2024 to wait for 3-5 business days for them to send my money back. I've waited 10 business days tulad ng sabi nila. Last July 29,2024 walang update whatsoever galing sa kanila and nag decide ako na pumunta ulit sa branch nila. Their agent to me na naka schedule na yung refund ko and need to way until end of July. August na pero wala pa din update. Sana naman PLDT gawan nyo ng paraan hindi naman namin basta lang pinupulot yung money na pinang papamasahe namin para lang makapunta sa branch nyo then nganga pa din pag uwi.

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","> The Palestinian beach killings are a catastrophe but it doesn’t represent the entirety of the IDF. There’s always going to be unruly soldiers that are extremely racist and genocidal but most IDF soldiers are just defending Israel and doing what needs to be done to stop Hamas

I'd like to believe that, but given the countless other videos of IDF soldiers involved in actions excluding murder like burning and bombing infrastructure, houses, and mosques, bulldozing streets, destroying monuments, looting without cause, kidnapping and torture along with the rhetoric from the government and many in the Israeli population, I find it hard to believe.

> Wikipedia isn’t a credible source. Most if not all the sources are biased left wing websites which care “so much about Gaza”. Hell, even Al Jazeera is even cited as a source and all they ever publish is anti-western propaganda

These articles cite their own sources, take the flour massacre for instance, they source a CNN investigation that goes over how Israel's claim that the incident began after 4:30 a.m. is questionable due to survivor footage showing gunfire started seven minutes earlier. The Israeli military's drone footage missed the crucial moment of crowd dispersal, and requests for the full unedited footage were denied. In regards to the other incident at the Kuwait roundabout Al Jazeera is quite biased but they're an organization doing some of the most prolific coverage there and there are eyewitnesses of the event not just someone from Al Jazeera churning this out.",1722470452.0

"indiegames","t5_2qrf3","Hey all, I'm Oliver Joyce, best known for the *Swords and Sandals* game series.

After a decade+ of building S&S games, I was thoroughly burned out and decided to shift gears for a while.

Just over a year later, [Gorgon Shield is now live on the Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446920/Gorgon_Shield/) and is sitting at 92% positive after 40 reviews. It's a party management, shield spinner - you have to control four heroes as they rise up through a tower on their way to fight Medusa. Each run is pretty quick and there's a lot of meta progression around upgrading your town and character archetypes between each run.

So to be pragmatic about it, this game is not going to be the next big hit, nor will it come close to reaching the success of even the S&S series, but I think its unlike anything else out there. It was my first full 3D game ( well, 2.5D because I'm using billboard sprites) and there was a hell of a learning curve just trying to figure out how to optimize everything, make the lighting look nice - I even learned some Blender for the 3D models.

Everyone has their own game dev story of course, we all face challenges in our lives. Up until this year my life was pretty much gilded with gold, beautiful family, happy, healthy, building my own games fulltime. In April, everything changed when my wife was diagnosed with an incredibly serious medical condition. We've all rallied and she is doing great so far and we have hope for the future, but this year has easily been the hardest of both our lives when facing an uncertain future - you feel like your whole life path that was set out before you is now this anxious and uncertain haze.

I was eight months into Gorgon Shield development, and suddenly it didn't seem to matter. Games didn't matter, game dev seemed frivolous and inconsequential next to what else was going on in my life. I spent a month or so just kind of numb and afraid of the future before I realised that (seemingly self evident) truth - there are some things you can control, some things that are absolutely out of your hands.

I'm a game dev, that's how I make money and provide for my family - and I knew I just had to compartmentalize my life and try and focus on finishing off Gorgon Shield as best I could. Fortunately Swords and Sandals continues to sell, year in year out, so I do have that safety net - but I knew wallowing in self pity wasn't going to lead to good things. I owed it to myself, to my family, to my publisher, to buckle down and see this through to completion.

In May I resumed work on the game and finished it off last month, launching on Steam just two days ago. Aside from the classic launch day crashes ( I swear this happens every launch, someone discovers some crazy bug you'd never seen!) , the reception has been really positive, [even scoring some nice coverage from Wanderbots](https://youtu.be/OWsb_cICuaw) and others.

Thanks for listening to my tale - it's a cliche but life is finite, life is fickle. Enjoy the good times, work hard but make time for your loved ones and savour each moment. It's a privilege to be making games, and even more so to be able to generate money from them. This game will probably take years to break even, but I'm super proud of it.

If you're interested, please [give Gorgon Shield a try on the Steam Store](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446920/Gorgon_Shield/). It may strike a chord if you're a fan of fast paced party-management roguelites (there's a mouthful but it's a hard game to define!).",1722470452.0

Alex has said on multiple occasions that a season 3 was not ever planned, nor ever will actually happen. The original story ended great.

Now, 

A spinoff is very possible. Alex has stated that he feels like Dipper and Mabel's stories have already been finished. But you know what else Alex said? That he'd be interested in making a spinoff with the Pines bros. Maybe since sells show that the book of bill did good, they'd be possibly interested in that idea.

1) Galvanized and Galvanic are two different things. Galvanized is a zinc coating to prevent rust. Galvanic is a small electrical surge used to stimulate a chemical or biological action. Galvanic would indeed be the correct term here.

2) Tempest Strike needs a buff. The Arc Hunter kit is just a better Amplified and three forms of applying Jolt. If Lethal Current (punchy Jolt) and Ascension (team Amplified and AoE Jolt) are being unchanged, then Tempest Strike needs to see some level of change. It's simple though, change the brief window of DR it gets into a x2 stack of Galvanic so that Arc Hunter has quick access to it. Then maybe don't touch Combo Blow because Sweet Baby Ray's Jesus, that does not need a buff.",1722470453.0

"brandonsanderson","t5_2s2s6","I was thinking about my comment and I disagree with myself: Kaladin's arc on how he views lighteyes (and his tendency to make assumptions about people based on their status and identity) has nothing to do with his depression. In the Wok flashbacks his relationship with Laral is complicated because they have different eye color and that is escalated when Roshone arrives. Roshone becomes the embodiment of everything he hates ligheyes to be and what he thinks they are. This is reinforced when he the one lighteye he thought he could trust betrays him and it becomes firm in his mind that lighteyes are monsters who do not know suffering.

In Words of Radiance this views are challenged with Shallan where she makes him realize that just because she is a lighteye doesn't mean she hasn't suffered. Then in Oathbringer he realizes that not all lighteyes live like kings and closer to him than he thought. In Rhythm of War, Kaladin admits that relations between dark and lighteyes has improved under Jasnah. Through WoR and Oathbringer he has his assumptions on people challenged. Shallan is an example of this and another example is when he assumes that Lyn would want to be a scribe rather than a fighter because she is a woman.  

None of this has to do with his depression and his views progress throughout the book.",1722470454.0

For this fact alone story isn't refined and as fluent as supposed to be.
It was also seen in others opinion about adaptation where people were complaining about second cour and were satisfied with only first one. So show was also hurt a bit by it but producers did god's work adapting it. They even added some none existed characters like some 86s or famous bob cut hair girl.

However, I realized at that point, that the tech already got hold of the data on my browser password manager and personal documents stored locally on my PC. He then proceeded to change passwords to the accounts he could gain access to. I managed to recover most of the accounts by changing the passwords to stronger unique forms and added 2FA with my phone and also made sure to delete any odd devices present in accounts that had a device list (Just in-case you were wondering, yes there was an odd device on my Amazon account).

    ""Salviamo Angela Carini dalla pugile trans: è nata uomo, è più forte di lei, la massacrerà"", dice don Patriciello. Che, rispetto alle polemiche che la sua presa diposizione potrebbe provocare, afferma: ""Qui l'ideologia e la religione non c'entrano nulla. Qui c'è un problema pratico che viene sottolineato da medici e sportivi onesti: la massa muscolare e la forza fisica che possiede quell'atleta non è paragonabile a quella di una donna"".  
    Ma il Comitato olimpico ha ammesso Imane Khelif. ""Certo in nome di una ipocrisia del politicamente corretto. Eppure basterebbe leggere cosa ha dichiarato la pugile messicana che ha affrontato Imane: 'non ho mai avuto colpi così pesanti' e basta vedere la sua faccia come era ridotta dopo il match"". Al Corriere del Mezzogiorno, che gli chiede se sia preoccupato, don Patriciello risponde: ""Certo che lo sono. Dio non voglia domani succeda qualcosa ad Angela, con quale coraggio i dirigenti sportivi delle Olimpiadi consentono questo? E le femministe perché non intervengono in difesa di una ragazza che rischia tanto?. Io lancio un appello ad Angela Carini: domani non salire su quel ring. Capisco i sacrifici che hai fatto per arrivare alle Olimpiadi. Ma non rischiare la vita. Lascia perdere, sottraiti a questa follia"". ",1722470454.0

"CataractSurgery","t5_4hixcu","Couldn't love this more - thank you for clearing up some of my confusion!   I'm pretty sure he said I would qualify for toric in both eyes (one I was painfully aware of because it causes me issues) but was surprised to hear I had significant astigmatism in the second eye.     So I believe that means both IOL's will be toric but then we need to decide on the visual correction provided by the toric IOL.    I have heard read about doing one eye for distance and one for close-up but that scares me because as it is I feel as if my eyes don't work together and cause me some dizziness... I certainly don't want to flirt with adding MORE difference between the two eyes.  

  
It's funny because when I had PRK 30 years ago I was not the least bit nervous - just eager and excited.   People would ask how I could be so calm about having a relatively new procedure on my eyes but my justification was that my vision was so bad, I didn't have much to lose by trying!    I got amazing results and have enjoyed it for decades and will always be grateful.    But this upcoming procedure(s) is scaring me because I DO have a lot to lose - I could end up with worse vision than I have now or, God forbid, something that leaves me dizzy and nauseaus.   I guess what leaves me even more anxious is that I read so many negative results from people who opted for near vision - it seems the majority of folks go for distance so what do they know that I don't?

1. Blöde Uhrzeit, um das zu posten. Sieht heute kaum wer und morgen früh ist das aus dem Feed verschwunden
2. Wirst du da ohne Anwalt nichts machen können. Entweder du akzeptierst deren Angebot (zu dem du leider keine Angaben gemacht hast) oder du legst innerhalb von drei Wochen Klage beim Arbeitsgericht ein, was sich ohne Anwalt oder juristische Kenntnisse als schwieriges Unterfangen darstellen dürfte. 

Reddit kann den Prozess jedenfalls nicht für dich führen, und ohne Klage wirst du leider nicht rausbekommen, warum du gekündigt wurdest. Mutmaßlich eine betriebsbedingte Kündigung, aber wie gesagt jede Spekulation hier bringt dir nichts, du brauchst einen Anwalt. Kommt eventuell eine Gewerkschaft bei dir in Frage? Die können dir da eventuell helfen, ansonsten nimm halt mal 300€ in die Hand und bezahl einen Anwalt. 

Ansonsten: viele Anwälte für Arbeitsrecht gehen bei vielversprechenden Fällen in Vorleistung und stellen die Rechnung erst fällig, sobald der Arbeitgeber blechen musste.

If I’m reading her kit right almost all her damage is basic attack. Even her ult increases her basic attack. 

At R5 subscribe for more gives a flat 48% buff even ignoring the bonus option of storing your ult for another 48%. and depending on how fast you accumulate charges for the enhance basic (I don’t know how this plays out yet as I only just got her) you might have a 2nd ult ready before you’ve used the buff from the first one. 
It doesn’t seem inconceivable that you might store that 2nd ult/buff until after you pop her enhanced basic. 

Now will it be better than 5*s and crit LCs?probably not. 
But on paper it looks like it could be a decent option if your other choice LCs are already in use.

There are bad healthcare workers everywhere and I don’t want to make sweeping generalizations but it seems like a lot of women have bad experiences specifically with their postpartum nurses. I’m a nurse, I know it’s a challenging job and you can get burned out, I know we’re often overworked, understaffed, underpaid, not treated well, etc. but if you can’t treat your patients with kindness and compassion then maybe don’t work in bedside nursing? There are lots of other types of nursing jobs that don’t involve direct patient care of vulnerable patients. 

I told my first postpartum nurse not to come back into my room unless it was to give report to the nurse that would take over my care. This was after multiple rude interactions. I honestly regret not standing up for myself sooner, she made the first few hours following a bunch of complications so much more stressful, she honestly made me cry multiple times before I was finally like, why am I tolerating this?

6 additional sets of lateral raises

I performed within the 6-10 rep range I stated before, pushing until failure. My rest periods between each set were around 15-20 seconds. Also, I did not determine the set numbers based on any formula, but just moved to the next workout when I felt like the muscle was fatigued. However, the question in my case is that I seem to have quick muscle recovery. A couple hours later and I usually feel refreshed to go to the gym and do it all again. There is also the fact that I can return to the gym and work out another muscle set, such as my legs.

Kamala Devi Harris, Born October 20^(th) 1964 as Kamala Iyer Harris, was the Daughter of Donald Jasper Harris (Father 8/23/1938) and Shyamala Gopalan (Mother 12/7/1938)

**On her maternal side,** Kamala’s Mother Shamala was the daughter of Painganadu Venkataraman Gopalan (Grandfather 1911) and  Rajam Rajah (Grandmother 1923) 

Her Grandfather Painganadu was son of Venkataraman Iyer Gopalan (Great G.F.) and Seethalakshmi Iyer (Great G.M.).

Her Grandmother Rajam was the daughter Maruthukud V (Great G.F) and Meenakshi R Aiyar (Great G.M. 1980) All recorded Ancestors on Kamala’s maternal side are from India.

 **On her Paternal side,** Kamala’s father’s Donald was the son of Oscar Joseph Harris (Grandfather 04/05/1914) and Beryl Christie Finegan (Grandmother 1921)

 **Kamala’s Paternal Grandfather’s Side:**

Oscar was the Son of Joseph Alexander Harris (Great Grandfather 4/24/1871) and Christiana  Brown (Great Grandmother 8/13/1888)

Joseph was the son of James Henny Harris (G.G. Grandfather)  and Elizabeth (Eliza) Brown (G.G. Grandmother 1834)

James is descendant of Thomas Harris (G.G.G. Grandfather 1784) of England and Catherine Jane Watson (G.G.G. Grandmother 1792) of Scotland.

Elizabeth was the daughter of Thomas Brown (G.G.G. Grandfather 1816) of Scotland and Mary Ann Taylor (G.G.G. Grandmother 1792) of Scotland.

Christiana was the Daughter of Hamilton Brown (G.G. Grandfather 11/9/1833) and Jessian Prince (G.G. Grandmother 1844)

Hamilton Brown was to the son of Kate Williams (English Decent and Hamilton Brown Sr. (G.G.G. Grandfather 1776)  from Ireland.

Jessian was the daughter of William Prince (G.G.G Grandfather of English Decent) and Sahra Forbes  (G.G.G. Grandmother)  

 **Kamala’s Paternal Grandmother’s Side:**

Beryl Was the daughter of Patrick Alhanasous Finnegan (Great Grandfather 1882) and Orah Iris Allen (Great Grandmother 8/13/1888)

Patrick was the Son of  Patrick Finnegan (G.G. Grandfather 1843) From Ireland and Mary Watson (G.G. Grandmother 1836) from Ireland.

 Orah was the daughter of John Allen (G.G. Grandfather 1858) and Joanna Elizabeth Moses (G.G. Grandmother 1868)

John Allen and Joanna relationship is where it gets more difficult to track

Joanna is the Daughter of Peter Moses (G.G.G. Grandfather 1920) the Son of Charles A. Moses (G.G.G.G Grandfather 1798)

Joanna Married Alfred Augustus McCook (1864)  on May 2^(nd) 1894 after the birth of Orah, McCook’s lineage is traced back through John McCook who’s family Linage is from Ireland.

However, I could find no ancestry before 1858 for John Allen.  

 This leaves Kamala’s Ancestry as follows:

 **Mom's Side:**

Great GF  Indian

Great GM  Indian

Great GF  Indian

Great GM  Indian

GF/FM 100% Indian -> Mother Indian -> Kamala 50% Indian

 **Dad's Side**

GGGG GF English

GGGG GM Scottish

GGGG GF Scottish

GGGG GM Scottish

GGGG GF Irish

GGGG GM English

GGGG GF English

GGGG GM Unknown

GGGG GF Irish

GGGG GM Irish

GGGG GF Irish

GGGG GM Irish

GGGG GF Unknown

GGGG GM  Unknown

GGGG GF  Unknown

GGGG GM  Unknown

Out of the 16 Paternal Ancestor, 11  are from United Kingdom (34.375%) and (5) are not  confirmed (15.625%)

Looking at Photos it appears Christiana Brown (Kamala’s Great Grand Mother, Miss Chrishy, as referred to by Donald J. Harris) is of of mixed decent.

Looking at Photos it appears Orah Irish Allen (Kamala’s other Great Grand Mother, Miss Iris, as referred to by Donald J. Harris) is also of mixed decent.

**TLDR:** This would mean Kamala is 50% Indian, & 37.5% European, & 12.5% Jamaican .

I came from a family that just “moved on” and pushed those feelings of forgiveness away and the acceptance of it was always supposed to just be there. That’s fucked up when your family teaches you basically to apologize and not really mean it.

What I’ve been working with is just sitting with it. Take time out of your day. Meditate on it. Sit with the acceptance that these things happen, or happened. Accept the fact that you cannot change the past. You can’t change your behavior then, only the behavior you have right now. Live healthier. Live better. Love better. Exist in the moment and be responsible from here on out.

Most of all? You have to give yourself some grace. Do not be so hard on yourself. Grace is extremely effective when it comes to self healing.

This will take time. And that’s okay. You are not alone in the world. There are people to help and to listen if you need.

I’m working on things like this, the same as you. I haven’t been able to forgive myself for things 20 years ago. Let’s work on this together, shall we?",1722470456.0

Yes that mask will work.  And on a small network you might be able to get away with it. When you end up with a larger network or a wide area network spaning multiple buildings you're going to find yourself in trouble. the/30 is only for the area 0 that allows the 2 buildings in your campus to communicate. If you're internally using 10.0 networks, and you do use the 0.0.255.255 inverse mask, your overhead bandwidth between buildings is going to occupy unnecessary bandwidth.  Between all of theneighbor and adjacency traffic, then database sharing, you're occupying bandwidth  This could actually be used by the users.


Say each building has 5 floors and each floor has its own router, and on a 10.0 network, 90% of a building bandwidth stays internal.   The efficient way to maximize your data plane traffic versus control plane traffic would be to set up building A with area 1,  building B as area 2, and then the routers talking between 1 and 2 on area 0/backbone.  If building A, has the internet gateway, then building B's traffic is optimized to have a less internet traffic in the control plane.

 Remember the primary reason OSPF is taking over from RIP is it can handle larger complicated networks, and VLSM like this.

"Hydrocephalus","t5_2uv8f","hi, thank you really. i did have a pediatric neurosurgeon as i got diagnosed and did have an endoscopic third ventriculostomy or etv surgery when i was minor (17 specifically) i no longer do but have an adult neurologist. i suppose he himself is the only “care team” i have in specific regarding my hydrocephalus. i trust his knowledge but there isn’t much of a connection so i suppose it’s incorrect to say i have a “ good care team ” for me a care team is a collective of people i can connect with regarding an issue impacting my life, since i have a few conditions that fall inside the line of comorbidity regarding their impact on me, it’s difficult for me to call the doctors i have a care team at all, so i don’t.
to answer your question as to why i don’t have a shunt, i never knew about my condition until a placid car accident at 17, my symptoms are not enough to have a shunt, the only way in which i would get a shunt is if the etv surgery were to fail. so i guess i also opted out of it but it also wasn’t medically necessary, the etv surgery was more beneficial for my quality of life. 
the impact hydrocephalus has had on my life from getting diagnosed to now is more emotional then medical, however i have been having new issues sprout which are not entirely related but also not fully shut down.",1722470457.0

Redistributing the means of production is not our goal. This is just reshuffling deck chairs on the Titanic.

Marxism is not Cesarianism. We are not here to redistribute lands and pacify an angry public. 

The goal of the proletarian class is to assume state power and use it to abolish private property.

From the same work I quoted before: 

>*The proletariat seizes political power and turns the means of production in the first instance into state property. But, in doing this, it abolishes itself as proletariat, abolishes all class distinctions and class antagonisms, abolishes also the state as state. Society thus far, based upon class antagonisms, had need of the state, that is, of an organisation of the particular class, which was pro tempore the exploiting class, for the maintenance of its external conditions of production, and, therefore, especially, for the purpose of forcibly keeping the exploited classes in the condition of oppression corresponding with the given mode of production (slavery, serfdom, wage-labour).*

For more clarity, I will continue to quote that same work: 

>*The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The state is not ""abolished"", it withers away.*",1722470458.0

1 is (rounded of) everything between 0.50(rounded up) and 1.49(rounded down)
3 means everything between 2.50 (rounded up) and 3.49(rounded down).

In this theorie the answer could be 0 of we use/imagine too many significant numbers.

E.g. 0.50/3.49x2.50 ~0.36. 
Rounded down  = 0


If we use significant numbers/figures the way that we should
We end up with 0.999999etc. 
When we bring this down to 1 significant number we have to round up all the 9's. At the last step there's no possibility to round up to one significant number instead of 1

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Why do we yell ""Yahtzee"" or ""Bingo""?  Why don't we judge people for being heartless slumlords in Monopoly?  By creating simple 'rules' for play, it is not just kept safe, but creates license to act outside normal behavior, experiment, and find out more about each other in the process without judgement.

Creating specific language rules creates a safe and imaginative play environment.  There's often pressure not to alienate your partner by doing something they don't like or 'wrong' for them.  Making a rule of the game allows participants to behave outside their normal personality and not be judged.  It allows the recipient to enjoy the thrill of pretend 'danger' and be generous and trusting.  It allows their partner to perhaps act selfishly or dominantly when it would not be acceptable outside the bedroom, and prevents any awkwardness when things take an unwelcome turn.

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei","That's not really true, though, and often why a lot of other mixed economies around the world generally put in a lot of social safety nets. Saying that it's just ""thermodynamics"" to say that every hamburger given to a customer is a hamburger another customer can't have isn't accurate when there's three people in the corner of the restaurant with 800 hamburgers. Now replace ""hamburgers"" with ""houses"", and that's exactly the housing crisis that was happening in America during 2008-2009 when RE5 came out.

By and large, the resources to fix most of the world's problems are there, even world hunger. I don't think Chris is referring to like, rare earth metals here.

The general complaint of America's capitalism, and the one I'm guessing Chris/Capcom were pointing out, is that there's basically no floor for failure. We didn't have many safety nets for the longest time, caught up to most of the world around World War 2, and then we've spent the last 60-80 years slowly cutting those safety nets.

"animecons","t5_2tgyf","If it is an official figure, it should be ok, but some guests might be picky. The website doesn't mention different prices other than Funko Pops. You may want a back up item just to be safe. This can be something you buy at the booth, so be prepared to buy. 

It really is best to ask when you get there. Each guest is a little different, and it does depend on the item in question. You can try to ask before the autograph session starts, but there might not be someone who knows until you are closer to the front of the line. 

Assume the session will be busy and time with the guest will be limited. It is likely to just be a few pleasantries (Hellos), sign the item, and be on your way. If photos are offered, then there is time for that, but it's usually quick. The goal is for as many people to get an autograph as possible, so time with the guest is limited. 

It's not really rude not to buy merch from the guest. It's nice if you can, but if it's not required, then you can just bring your own. 

Do arrive early, I'd play to be in the area at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time. If you can, figure out when they open the line before the session starts, and aim for that time. Some really do fill up right away and you can miss your chance if you wait too long. The line might get cut so those in line get an autograph before the session is over.",1722470461.0

"amazonemployees","t5_3eeat","This (high turnover) topic is a PLUS-potential when taken a different way - when you’ve stuck with it, you’ve lasted 6+ months, proven yourself, are liked by the PA’s and you decide to move on at some point. Say, after a year of working in one center. 

I left Amazon amicably a couple months ago after just that year I put in. And in an interview for a new job, I could tell my experience with Amazon wasn’t being valued. I asked the interviewer - you can stop and ask interviewers things - what he thought about people who work at Amazon. 

I suggest you remember it if you feel the interviewer is trailing off and losing interest in you. Think about yourself there and how you would add a few points  about what it’s like (positive now) to be at an Amazon center as you were having had made it. Now, I described tak time and other objective production rates we must pass. Having good attendance. The safety rules we adhere to there. 

And what happens, you become a lock and get invited for a 2nd interview in another place than Amazon. 

So there IS a reason to stick with it and last awhile at Amazon. Don’t go getting a new car loan. Don’t sign up for a fancier apartment. DO WELL for some time, but then also make the decision to leave. Perhaps after a year. You will not get that kind of discipline in many other places you choose to work. You will have greater confidence in the next job (and future interviews) too.",1722470461.0

Saying no means no. Repeating no means repeating no. Reporting the continued behavior is needed for any real repercussions to take place.

You want the di##heads to stop being di##heads, people need to report such abusive behavior.

You act as though only women go through this and that is a lie. I've been through it and the only way to make it stop is to take the appropriate action. I've had many a woman act like this towards me (especially when I worked in the hotel industry) so please stop with the ""men are di##heads line when there are plenty of women who are no different. I'm not being an a##hole and doing the childish, ""women are a@@holes"" routine so you shouldn't either.

As for being a doormat....

Men are doormats as well. We see this more often than not and no matter the gender, you aren't a doormat until you lie down on the ground. Men are doormats for bosses, clients and much of the time for their SO. 

Guys who use the ""women s#ck"" to avoid taking the responsibility of their own inaction are no better than the females who use, ""men s#ck"" as an excuse to think that everyone will play nice and avoid responsibility to do what they should do.

Some segments of guys are touches as is a portion of females. Taking the low road only means you're not taking responsibility for what you can do. And oftentimes, what we can do in those situations is a sh#tty road.",1722470461.0

"TeenagersButBetter","t5_22w8b0","Never said that they were the majority, nor do I think they are. However they are also not a small number. They remain in mass amounts and claiming that these groups of people are in any way “small” is incorrect. I’ve also met many toxic swifties in person as well, however I still don’t judge people whenever they say they like her music. This is not to say that I don’t still proceed with caution though. I’ve met a large amount of toxic swifties both online and in person, so though I don’t immediately profile a person who likes her music as “bad” or “toxic” I’ve also learned the warning signs of those who are. 

Again, I never said the majority are bad. I simply said that it is NOT a small number who are bad. Which is a factual statement. Though it may not be the majority, it is still not a small number either",1722470462.0

* Why are LFI and PCF so far apart, in both axes? Their programs are like 90% the same thing, and in economics, LFI is far closer to PCF than to PS/EELV (I'm not even sure which one I'd put further left). Similarly why is LFI *that* libertarian and PCF more authoritarian than ENS?

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I always throw out the same answer for this: Ancestors - The Humankind Odyssey. Very repetitive and unintuitive gameplay make it hard to get into and just navigating, let alone surviving, is an absolute chore early on. However, you slowly come to grips with the controls and start exploring further and further from your home.

Eventually, you manage to make your way across this vast, hostile jungle and climb the tallest tree to see the world. It's so tall that it literally was giving me vertigo, but when you reach the top, MY GOD, the world just stretches out. There's so much more to explore, this huge jungle you've struggled in for the past several hours is just a tiny area.

Oh, and then you have to get DOWN from the tree, which is a feat in itself.

Getting to grips with this game's systems is an ordeal, but it's one of those games where hardship develops a bond, and I was very attached to my ape colony. Some of the most memorable gaming moments I've had were in this 6/10 game.",1722470462.0
"detroittigers","t5_2rhpy","We can do a couple things things still.  

Make an off season trade when the mallet is even larger. (Guys retire, more teams feel like they’re in it in 2025, also assuming he wins the Cy young his value will be higher even considering the lost half year of control- remember he’s never pitched like this for a full season) 

Perhaps we finish off the season looking a little better.  Playoffs would be a massive stretch but if we turn out 82 wins maybe we our selves want a go at a world series.  At some point it can’t be about the future every year.  When does the future arrive? If you are Scott Harris how long do you keep your job if you’re trade deadline sellers 5 straight years not even giving the team a chance at the playoffs. 

Third keep until next years trade deadline.  We can’t speculate if his value could go down.  If we did that we would have traded Tork last offseason and didn’t.  People will never not be desperate for pitching.  The haul will be smaller- but what if he’s on pace to win a second Cy young? Or what if he’s injured? That risk is something Harris is staking his career on. 

The fourth option was to trade him now.  Which isn’t an option anymore.  He says the value wasn’t there and I believe it probably wasn’t based on how we kind of got undervalued returns for other players.  

I think we didn’t lose our chance to still get value in a trade by not trading him today. That’s an opinion I might be wrong and look like an idiot a year from now.  But Harris maintains options to move him at other times still.  If we moved him now those chances are gone.  

Lastly we’ve been terrible for a long time - the people on Reddit are a lot more knowledgeable about baseball and what SHOULD be done for baseball reasons - than the average fan.  The average fan checks the standings once a month and says “we still suck”.  That matters.  They stop watching games buying tickets.  We need to not lose the entire fanbase that sold out every game in the early teens.  

Just a thought.  This wasn’t the end all be all.  I think maintaining the ability to make a future move is still there if that’s the best decision",1722470462.0

"Rhinestoning","t5_58touy","Thanks! Rhinestoning is getting more popular (or at least that's what my algorithm tells me), so hopefully, we'll see more people posting soon. But yeah, I can break down my process\~

  
1. Deciding on the design- I didn't know where to start, I just knew I wanted to make a summer-y purse to match a dress I'd gotten for a vacation. So, I browsed through Pinterest for some inspo and found this beauty: [https://pin.it/1uz2jfNm3](https://pin.it/1uz2jfNm3) and used it as inspo. Also I decided to go in the paisley direction because I figured it would be simple enough (I was so wrong about that, haha)

2. Picking Materials—I'm not the best drawer, so I found a cheap stencil on Amazon; I also bought the leather paint, rhinestones, glue, etc. there. Because I knew I wanted to draw/paint on the purse, I made sure that it was white and avoided purses that had a marble texture. I also made sure to get one with gold detailing since I knew I wanted to paint the piping gold.

3. Starting—I made sure to sand the purse to get rid of whatever gloss they put on it in production, taped the stencil to the purse, and traced lightly with a blue ink pen. From there, I blotted up any extra ink so it wouldn't bleed into the paint.

  
4. Painting- I figured it would be smarter to go in with/ the lighter color first, so I mixed my paints to get a light green color close enough to the light green rhinestones I had and began painting the background of the body of the bag, followed by the teal paisley. I also painted most of the gold piping at this step, too

  
5. The Rest- From here, I just started rhinestoneing. There was a lot of trial and error here in terms of how I began placing them, but I soon realized it was easiest to start outlining with the teal stones and filling them in, and then going in with/ the green gems. I would get bored doing this, so I'd do this in sections so I was making significant progress. 

Once I finished stoning the main body of the bag, I traced, painted, and cured the bottom. And began doing the same to the handle and any other white parts of the bag-sans curing. I finished by stoning the handle the same way I did the body of the bag and cleaning up as much glue as I could, haha

------

Going forward, I have so many more ideas for bags and other accessories so I'm trying to figure out how I can get more customizable stencils. I'm thinking maybe looking into getting a cricket or seeing if my local libraries have one I could use instead",1722470462.0

There would always be new orks – they were fecundity itself, multiplying like bacteria in a mire. But his troops were irreplaceable. Their necrodermis could repair itself quickly enough to mitigate all but the heaviest incoming fire, and they could even endure total destruction, so long as their patterns made it to a tomb’s reconstruction vault. But they couldn’t keep coming back forever.

>Even the most precisely engineered system, left to run for sixty million years, tended to struggle under the accrued weight of tiny errors. Especially in the crumbling realm of Ithakas, damaged as it was by early waking, and blighted more than any surviving dynasty by the scourge of the curse, the ancient systems were collapsing under the weight of their own complexity. The protocols of translation, reconstruction, scrying and all the rest had grown more erratic, less dependable, with every passing century.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Yeah, but the thing is that it wouldn't necessarily need to work in an ""Oh look, this post on a porn sub got loads of comments, let's go look"" sort of way. 

Primarily, it'd just need to give the post a bump in the algorithm. Comments do that on Reddit, and have done so for a while. In some ways comments are just as effective at boosting a post in Reddit's algorithms as upvotes are, but can be easier to bot because Reddit tends to crack down on artificially increasing upvotes much more than botted comments. 

My gut feeling is that most people who are subbed to porn subs don't care too much about what's happening in the comment sections. It's pretty much a given that it's all ""Oh wow, me likey!"" comments. They just want to see some naked women, and as long as there's a stream of them on their porn alt, they won't care too much how they got to that point in their feed. Having a bunch of botted comments probably would be effective in that sense.",1722470462.0

I also addedy main weapon:P

Main weapon is: a kinda looking big saw sword with big teeths pointing towards me. The sword is really heavy and sharp so i swing it slow but i does a lot of damage. There is sometimes a case where i instant kill him because i beheaded him but  the chance of that happened is 1 in 20

Ability 1 is adrenaline: it will gives me a speed boost and strength boost depends how much damage i have been taken

Ability 2 is finisher: i will stab my enemy and pull my sword out. Since my sword has big teeths, it will take the organs out with it. I can only use it against enemies that have <50% hp and it will one shot instantly

Ability 3 is laser hat: i will point the bottom of my hat towards the enemy and my hat will shoot lasers

Ability 4 is the Double Barrel Shotgun: i will grab my DBS and i will shoot the buckshot shells that does a lot of damage per shot.

Ultimate ability 1 is giant head: i will throw my hat in the air, it will float and the size will increase a lot (no limit). And after it increased, it will shoot one giant laser out of the bottom that will destroy everything in his path besides myself. I can control it with my mind

Ultimate ability 2 is giant Double Barrel Shotgun: my double Barrel Shotgun size increase a lot making it deadly for every creature if it get shot. The bullet spread increase 2 but i will have a really large knockback

Ultimate ability 3 is beheading: if i use this ultimate, i will be much faster and invincible for any objects and i one shot every creature instantly because im beheading them with my sword.",1722470463.0

If the nervous system is constantly stuck on high alert and pumping out cortisol that has a cascading effect on multiple other body systems, and it’s exhausting our resources and ability to heal. Research polyvagal theory and learn some of the simple exercises that if done consistently over time will retrain the nervous system to be in the parasympathetic calm state, where we can heal and regain strength. There’s lots of example on YouTube. I’m also learning tapping and havening which are also simple and very calming exercises. As another poster noted here, it does come down to letting the body know it’s safe in the here and now so it can relax and function normally. Hopefully you’ll see some immediate reduction in your body constriction and armoring and much more. 💔❤️‍🩹❤️",1722470463.0

"gameofthroneslegends","t5_ao12xd","Ok, after running numbers a bit... I don't have any good answers.

The skill does the same damage no matter who you put it on. I have Tyrion maxxed, so I can't test if it will do more damage when he levels until I get another star on him (maybe by December?) The skill can crit or deadly, but I ignored those numbers for my testing. I wasn't noticing any explicit increase based on enemy color, but I admit I haven't ruled that out specifically yet. The amount of damage done does vary from enemy to enemy, but is always consistent on the same enemy (so I can run the same stage 3 times and they will always be hit for the same amount when it goes off).

As enemy Max HP goes up, so does the amount of damage taken, but it isn't an exact percentage. I tested 6 different enemies, and it ranged between 29% and 39% of their total hp. HOWEVER, one odd thing I noticed is that if two enemies have a similar HP, but one has more defense, the one with more defense will take MORE damage.

So then I thought maybe it is actually scaling off of enemy defense. This didn't hold up quite as well, because the ability does between 83% and 137% of the enemy defense in damage, so that doesn't seem like a very tight correlation.

Also, I found out that if an enemy has defense down 5% before the ability hits, they do take almost 5% more damage (within a rounding margin, especially since numbers in game are not explicit below the hundreds place). On the one hand, it makes sense that they would take more damage when their defense is lower, but on the other hand, why do enemies with similar HP and higher defense take MORE damage from the ability in general?",1722470464.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","Ask her to try it, but READ A FUCKING GUIDE. She may have hated it because a lot of people try it with a plain old, bit of lube and jam it in. it's something to generally work up to, a little play, a little finger, and that's it, learn to relax and learn to enjoy it a bit over time then trying bigger things.

If she's up for trying that and you're up for it, then go ahead.

But have a talk with her about it, ask if she really hated it because you don't want to do something she hates, some guys are literally fucking gross and like doing it precisely because their partner doesn't like it, it's a power/control/degradation kink more than an anal kink. She might be saying she doesn't like it to either play up to that because she thinks most guys are like that, or maybe she likes it but is ashamed that she likes it.

have a conversation, see where it goes, make it clear you don't at all need it but if she wants to give it a go, gently, with using a guide and taking time to help her see if she can enjoy it, go ahead.",1722470464.0

I also did something similar for QEII Wildlands and Kawartha Highlands with JPEG maps I found online.

Also, I've got the **Avenza Maps** app. I don't use it much anymore, but I did buy a few maps from them in the past and I'll load them up if I'm in the area.

On my Garmin 66i, I use the Garmin base maps, plus I have the OpenStreetMaps layer (which has a lot of the major trails), plus the Trailforks maps.  I've also got a Backroads Mapbooks SD card - it was expensive, but I've found it very useful.

I've also got a Garmin Fenix 7 watch. Primarily, I just use the Garmin base maps on there, but occasionally, I'll add the Trailforks maps or just a Trailforks route.",1722470464.0

"CODZombies","t5_2sal9","i mean... bo3 is easier then coldwar... 

the only thing that really changed from then and now, is that youve gotten better at zombies over the years. what you used to struggle with then, is now alot easier todo.

>for example, bo3 it took me a long time to reach round 100 on any really map. 

i wasnt able to get to round 100+ on my first time of playing bo3, due to at launch it had a big crashing problem, but once that got fixed i got a round 200 on my first try of trying to highround (this was back before all the extremely op gobblegums or the deadwire buff happened) i stopped cus it was a nice even number, and it was getting **REALLY** boring.

and the first time i tried to highround coldwar i got to 200 just like before, and called it quits due to bordem

at the end of the day, both games are easy, and you shouldve prob picked a better game for an example lol

> haven’t gone back to that game in a while, just not as fun for me. just to easy compared to OG zombies

"vintagecomputing","t5_2qn45","The image is displayed on the CRT, with the lines being sent down the wire scanning left-to-right, and  the lines progressing top-to-bottom. At the critical time, you write new values into the 6845 CRTC (cathode ray tube controller) registers. The values of these registers defines how the values in memory will be interpreted. 

You arrange for your code to write Mode 4 flavour stuff into the ""top"" of the display memory, and Mode 5 flavour stuff into the ""bottom"" of the display memory, and provided the right values are written into the 6845 CRTC at the right time it will all look great. If you get the timing wrong, you'll still see graphics, they'll just look a bit odd.

So both of your statements are correct. A mode change is done at just the right time to change from monochrome high-res to colour low-res, and the mode is just a way of interpreting whatever is in display memory.

Even though it was sudden, astute traders could have gotten out the week before Black Monday  when the S&P 500 closed below its 50-week moving average and undercut the support levels from June.

The S&P 500 is currently 4% above its 50-week moving average, which was last successfully tested in April.

At minimum, if the market was to crash here, it would have to first undercut last week's low. IF that were to happen, I would become much more defensive. Until then, I will follow price, which says we are very much still in a strong bull trend.

"geologycareers","t5_2x755","Culture overall is pretty bad. Huge turnover, poor pay even compared to other mudlogging jobs, consistently last minute callouts, you'll be thrust into ""day hand"" without proper preparation and blamed for things you haven't been properly trained for if you seem at all competent. You'll be expected to drive 10+ hours, then work 12+ right after. On one occasion the company rep wasn't made aware we needed accomodations for 4 people and had to sleep about 6' from an air compressor in the lab/office.

"mindmapping","t5_2rdnk","The main alternative method I meant was writing by hand. 

Though it takes longer than typing, it’s a better way to build your thinking piece-by-piece. I’ve found the “morning pages” method of committing to write 3 pages nonstop on anything is effective (not necessarily in the morning and not necessarily 3 pages). Most of what you get might be trivial, but getting it out on paper helps you narrow down to the important parts. The “aha” moment when you do find something interesting that triggers a flow of insights is, I believe, essentially the same as the “Find The Thought Process” step in the Koi method you mentioned: [https://youtu.be/g7j\_CoKD1Xs?si=D2h6oSdW\_0t5\_F-p&t=170](https://youtu.be/g7j_CoKD1Xs?si=D2h6oSdW_0t5_F-p&t=170), so if you wanted to supercharge that step you could insert a 3-page longhand writing step in there. Taking a walk (short or long; “optic flow” in scientific terms) would offer a similarly reliable benefit. 

I struggle myself when it comes to the best way to use mind maps over the long term. For several months last year I kept a handwritten journal (with Zettelkasten-inspired page IDs) that was about 85% mind maps and 15% journalling. When I reviewed it a few months after I stopped, I found that the pages of cross-connected mind maps took way too much effort to mentally reaccess, while the journal pages were as accessible as if written yesterday. The most effective mind maps were the ones that accompanied journal entries. This was somewhat true when I kept a digital mind map journal as well: the mind maps helped set the menu for where I wanted to focus, but the real cognition was getting done in typed text embedded inside the nodes (much of which was summarizing insights from walks I’d just taken).

I’ve never focused on expressiveness like Koi recommends, but though I think it’s an important point I don’t think aesthetic appeal can substitute for the higher-quality knowledge gained through walking or writing (or reading, for that matter.) Deepening the quality of knowledge is what psychologist Art Markman recommends in his book Smart Thinking as the way to prime our knowledge for recall and recombination with other facts. The exercise he offers is to think of a common folk saying like “a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”, and then challenge yourself to fully define the principle it is illustrating without using expressive, imprecise metaphors. I find it very helpful to apply some kind of visual tag (like a cloud border) for areas where my understanding is unclear. This can include specific parts of a sentence. And since it’s a mind map, you can just branch out a few nodes to explore further. (This is one reason it’s good to leave plenty of gaps in your mind map layouts, especially at first.)",1722470466.0

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Eastern Christians (Catholics and Orthodox) still observe this ancient rule. For those who practice it, the fast is: no animal products and alcohol and Wednesdays and Fridays, and no consumption of any food or drinks from midnight till noon or 3 pm. These are our general fasting rules for any of the five yearly fasts (Nativity, Nineveh, Lent, Apostles, Dormition), we simply repeat them on Wednesdays and Fridays.

Brad Garrett is a slight step below DeVito as a spokesperson (hence the goofy character that Garrett is playing). And beyond that, Jersey Mike's strategy is working. They're eating our lunch. Our best bet is to be the best in terms of product and experience. There's another place Jersey Mike's has us beat in some respects. The one down the street from my JJ's has twice the labor at lunch rush. Of course...we still make things faster than they do but delivery gets to be a problem because we are so short staffed that the bike delivery person is often on register with orders to go out. So then you go to third party delivery which eats right into profits. In short, and on this score it's pretty obviously true, we are being cheap with our customers.



Which all makes sense when you look at ownership. Jersey Mike's has the same CEO that bought the first Mike's Subs in 1971. We are owned by Inspire Brands--a private equity spinoff from Roark Capital. I'm not blaming Inspire but what's happening at JJ's is a product of the way that Inspire does business. They don't invest in their brands the way that Jersey Mike's is investing in theirs. And, yet, I vastly prefer JJ's sandwiches to Mike's. We make good shit. For now. That's on a downward slide because we're cheaping out on the line and considering adding things we shouldn't. JJ's should not be in the fake hot sandwich business. It won't help compete with Jersey Mike's (as they have a legit grill). It might help with competing against Subway. On the other hand, Subway is garbage.",1722470468.0

Turns out he is a type of mage thought to be a myth, who can use raw magic to do basically *anything*.  There is a cult who believes him to be an abomination and they try very hard to kill him.

Ward contracted necromancy from the Arcanavirus but he can do things that no other necromancer can. It is because >!he also came from a warlock bloodline, and the combination makes him stupid powerful. Like, normal necromancers can commune with one spirit and then need a nap and a big meal.

A mental health crisis DOES NOT entitle someone to attack police or anyone else! The only thing that typically does, or ought remove a right to self-defense is actually provoking an attack. And by provoking, this doesn't mean looking at the psycho who will kill anyone that stares at them, it would be things like saying, ""Let's step outside and see who is the bigger man,"" or other things that a reasonable person would consider a threat, etc.

But your husband chose to marry you for a reason, and trust and believe it’s a lot more than your looks for why he married you. 

As a man, I can tell you that when I see an attractive woman, I don’t want to sleep with her. Sure, she looks good, but she could have a bad attitude, she could be toxic, she could be abusive, she could be manipulative. 

If your husband is anything like me, he doesn’t want a woman who is the most beautiful to the world (supermodels/ p*rn stars.) He wants the woman who is most beautiful to him. 

Don’t let this insecurity get the best of you, and ruin your marriage. It happened to me with my ex. She was always jealous over my friendships with women, I couldn’t look at certain women, I couldn’t have female friends eventually and every female I interacted with, family or not. I was automatically cheating. 

It made me resent her, and I felt like a prisoner. I got tired of it after a while.

The basics:

- use *black* ink on single sheet of *white* paper 

- clearly print your exact account name, the name of this subreddit, and today's full date (include the year and a non-numeric/written month, like 'July 31 2024' or 'Jul 31 24'). 

- take 3+ pictures of you holding the sign, bending the paper slightly in your fingers, with visible nudity in multiple pictures 

- upload them to a single album on reddit.com (using the reddit mobile app) or vidble.com (if you only have access to a web browser (reddit hosting requires their mobile app)). NOTE: as of May 15th 2023 imgur.com will no longer allow nudity - if you have previous posts there you are welcome to delete and reupload them to reddit. 

- make a 'link' post on this subreddit that links directly to the album with 'verification' or 'verify' (and correct gender tags) in the title 

- wait until a mod responds on your verification post before posting here further (it may take a few hours, please be patient)

"adhdwomen","t5_31aao","No I have not. Something to definitely attempt. I find I am not as flared up, aside from period time, when I literally eat super junky and carby (pastas, chips and breads) I would love to say this is a great reason to eat the carbs to bind me lol, but the problem is when I eat that way, all the other parts of me are miserable long term, immediate dopamine was good though lol. But I feel sluggish and gross. When I eat ""healthy"" I poop lots but all the rest of me is great. 

It should be relatively easy to eliminate as I'm almost positive it's veggie related (not a fan of fruits/sugars). Everytime I go on a "" healthy eating bender"" I flare. My meat staples are the same (chicken, fish, eggs,) along with seasonings. Only difference is a reduction in starchy carbs and increase in veggies. So I guess I'll just start with the veggies that are not as normal for me when I'm not eating super healthy. 

That being said, I know I have increased my water intake too due to the dry mouth with vyvanse. Which probably isn't helping my bowels. 

Thankfully my anxiety had decreased so drastically since starting vyvanse. I know it's not normal for all, but I feel 95% of my anxiety was due to over stimulation, with that curbed so is my anxiety.

Thank you so much :). I will try the elimination diet.",1722470470.0

He dropped out of highschool in 10th grade because of some crazy family drama. I didn't see him again until college and I didn't recognize him at all. He had joined a motor cycle gang and changed his name. Put on some muscle and had tattooes all over including his neck and face (back in the early 2000s when it was less acceptable). We grabbed lunch and he told me about how his gang was moving drugs from the west coast to NYC. He was still the soft spoken, thoughtful kid I knew. It was crazy. 

Second is one of my college roommates. He was very unique. Worshipped a pantheon of gods I had never heard of. Had insane ideas about politics and was adamant that earth would be uninhabitable by 2010 due to climate change. I loved talking to him, but most people just thought he was too weird. We kept in touch and I watched him turn into a totally normal adult. He's got a job at IBM and lives in a nice house with a great family.

**First car: BYD Sealion 6 vs. Mazda 3**

Still contemplating on what to buy as my first car. Mazda 3 was really my top choice but I went to BYD’s showroom and fell in love with the Sealion 6, which was only released a week ago. 

Mazda3 is reliable and great upon reading reviews and i love the looks (exterior & interior) but a deal breaker for me is ground clearance. 

On the other hand, BYD has introduced their first hybrid car and it was very enticing especially with its combined EV & gas distance (1100km). Since it’s new super, onti palang ng nababasa ko about it but it ticks all my “wants” sa car.

BYD Sealion 6 - Php1.548
Mazda 3 - Php 1.510

I’ve been driving our family cars (Toyota Fortuner, Avanza and Subaru Crosstrek) so this will be our first Hybrid car if ever. Also, it will only be a “bahay-school” car. 

Please let me know the PROS & CONS of both cars.

Thank you in advance!!!!!! :>>>>

"marriedredpill","t5_32dvh","Yes sir I stated in my OYS that my internal is what needs the work. I have struggled immensely with the internal.


I agree, I admitted to being a dancing monkey in my OYS. I have been basing my ""success"" on how attracted to me my wife acts. I'm going to try considering my relationship as incompatible and see if that helps me focus on my own needs and desires. Welcome any advice on fixing this.


Honestly, my definition of the prize is being the fun attractive person that needs the other less. The hypergamous best option. My wife is still the prize in my eyes. I don't think she can do better than me in the town we're in, but I think she can do better than me. I have always thought that. How can I compete with single guys with exciting lifestyles and more money, as a family man? She cheated on me before with a wealthy single guy from Miami who used to be a pro baseball player. She says that's not her type and he was a douchebag.... Lol it seemed to work for him. 


I have pulled attractive women before and I could do it again, although I typically feel the need to start with less attractive women and work my way up as my confidence grows. I suppose that means getting enough external validation to believe I'm attractive. I'm typically drinking when I pull, my drunk game is quite good. Sober - not so good. I get nervous. The first chick after a breakup im always so nervous I can't hardly get a boner. After the first ones outta the way, I feel much more confident. I typically spin plates single. I don't know if I could pull a more attractive woman, I have serious doubts. She was 2-3pts above me in SMV when we met. She had low self-esteem, and got pregnant early, which is why she stayed with me. I don't have the confidence to go on a date with an attractive girl right now. I wouldn't even know what to say. I'd honestly need to start out w less attractive girls to get the boost. I could definitely start over single and do that, I don't know how to implement it while married. I won't cheat again, and I'm in such a small town and well known enough that I get reported to wife for even friendly flirting around town. 


Bathroom thing, It was a shit test now that I reflect on it. I guess I was pissed off at her at the time because I forgot she is a woman, I have her on a pedestal and think she should just love me and never do anything to upset me or test me. At the time I took it as her rubbing it in my face that she's higher value than I am. I didn't fail it but I could have passed it better by A&A. My A&A sucks, I'm not that funny. I come off as cheesy. I could have said ya ofc they wait til I'm not around look at these guns, or you want me to take you to the bathroom? I love how perverted you are! I just find that shit so cheesy. My game is cheesy af. Send help lol. 


I have read pook many times. I internalize things very poorly. I think I need to beat the dancing monkey problem before anything else actually can stick. 


Dancing monkey is a covert contract so I guess you are right. I was scoreboarding too, it had been a few days since we fucked, we had a good night, and thought she'd wanna bone too with how much we were grinding and cuddling in bed naked. I was confused but not angry. I was upset with myself for not being able to close. 3 years here and not being able to close with a naked affectionate woman while I'm big spoon - I've got to be retarded.",1722470471.0

"whatcarshouldIbuy","t5_2ys2t","If the plan this time is to buy instead of lease, I'd go with the Mazda. The others, aside from the Toyota, have reliability issues, the Grand Cherokee has a nice cabin but tends to get noisy, so it's not going to be the most comfortable on long highway drives, similar issues with the Highlander, and yes, it's gonna be slower. The Mazda has a really nice cabin that you'll be comfortable in on the highway, it's quiet, it's relatively fun to drive for something its size.

Here's where I'm at with Hyundai/Kia: they make cars that are really nice when you drive them off the lot. The cabins are really comfortable, the tech is really cool, they tend to offer a really smooth ride (which would be in pretty stark contrast to the Mazda, which are known for their firm suspensions), and if you were only looking at it for what it is when it's fresh off the lot, there's a lot to like. It's just long-term that these things are a nightmare. There are so many issues and recalls year after year and model after model with Kia/Hyundai that there is just no evidence they are capable of making consistently reliable cars.

So if you're going to lease again and you like the Telluride--yeah, go for it. It's a nice car, you'll be covered by warranty, if anything goes really wrong with it they'll probably take it back and give you a new one (they've been known to do this so that they can study some of the more serious issues their cars have). But I would not buy a Kia/Hyundai, even with the generous warranty they have to offer because otherwise nobody would buy their cars, and the Mazda is a very solid option at this price point.",1722470471.0

"tipping","t5_2s4w1","If you live close enough to farmers or a farmer's market, then yes, absolutely support them that way. However, businesses (even small local ones) will use the cheapest available products to maximize margins, especially with the high minimum wages they're required to pay. Please understand I'm not advocating for a decrease in minimum wage either. The minimum wage has to increase 1-2% a year, which should \*ideally\* match the general inflation rate, which is also a sign of a working economy. The main problem right now is that with COVID-19, businesses realized that they can increase prices, and never lower them. No one has a choice in the matter because the products that increase in price are the essentials like food, clothes, basic hygiene products, and gas. No one is complaining about increased prices in luxury goods and services, the problem is with essential goods and services not lowering their prices back down once they can reasonably afford to do so. One of the things that would help force the hand, at least in the us, would be if the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) got a backbone and regulated these monopolistic companies. Another thing, that would help is Windfall taxes. A quick definition from the tax foundation is ""**a one-time surtax levied on a company or industry when economic conditions result in large and unexpected profits**"", which would force companies to lower costs down when it's viable to do so, otherwise sudden explosive profit is a deterrent because of the increased taxes. Now the main problem, which is why these sensible policies never go into place, is the two major political parties in this country are in cahoots with major corporations and holdings firms to do everything they can to distract you from thinking about these things, and instead focusing on division and working yourself to death to pay them more and more and more money.",1722470473.0

"paradoxplaza","t5_2su3h","It lets me talk about a subject I find reasonably fun, how bad CK3 is at being a successor to CK2. 

Ck3 doesnt have Catholicism, it doesnt have Orthodox, it doesnt have messalian, it doesnt have sunni. It has a table with selectable values that you mix and match to whatever you want that at a certain point will spawn endless religious breakaways of like constructed idea sets.

It doesnt have cultures either, it has whatever random crap that gets created each time. 

The game only holds together if you pretend it does because now you can do anything! Which means you've really got basically the same 'culture/religion' set that's optimal for your playstyle. 

It's pretty core to a culture a set of values and norms that represent the people there. It's why CK2 was better in that regard because greek was defined, greek was greek. Orthodox was orthodox. 

I honestly dont blame you for not getting it, people were literally cheering it as the best idea when the dev diary came out but by now it's just ""meh"". The best thing about CK3 is that it's not Victoria 3.",1722470474.0

[Tennendo Kukai.](https://kikohincense.com/collections/tennendo-incense-kikoh/products/tennendo-kukai-incense) This one will have the musk top note you'll get with somewhat with Kumo no sho.

[Kunmeido Shin Tokusen Reiryokoh.](https://kikohincense.com/collections/kunmeido-incense-kikoh/products/kunmeido-shin-tokusen-reiryokoh-incense) This one will have the aloeswood/sandalwood blend with reiryokoh, clove, and camphor found in Nami no sho.

[Baieido Tobiume. ](https://kikohincense.com/collections/baieido-incense/products/baieido-tobiume)This has a lovely sharp and sweet blend of Aloeswood, Sandalwood, clove, cinnamon, and camphor for a wonderfully sweet and spicy cool fragrance.

"MuseumPros","t5_2xp5z","Help me out here - I want to learn what is the best way to dispose of racist objects when they become our responsibility. 

In my case, I randomly came into possession of Uncle Frank’s nazi badge after my in-laws passed away and the sensitive personal belongings were sent home with my husband and me after we emptied their apartment. Uncle Frank was actually a nazi who immigrated from Germany after the war, and everyone in the family hated him because he was a horrible toxic person. I have no idea how my in-laws ended up with it, because they were not fans of him either. I want to take on the responsibility of disposing of Uncle Frank once and for all (to spare my kids from having to take this on eventually), but it doesn’t feel right just throwing it in the trash where it could spill back out into the world. The badge stands for a significant uncomfortable truth, and a connection to complicated family roots (having had relatives who straddled both sides of the holocaust.) I wish there was some place where we could leave the badge and Uncle Frank permanently in a vault in the hands of some institution where it would become part of a collective tragic memory, and not feel like some morbid relic that we’re hoarding to honor his memory or a fascination with nazis. Are there museums that take these things just to lock them away where they will never become someone else’s collector’s item?",1722470474.0

First, have you officially asked for accomodations from HR to get everything on file to protect you? My doctor wrote up 3-5 days off for flares and flexible work hours. That should help protect your job.

Second, although I know you probably don't want to seem ""weak"" communicating with your team will be important. You need a backup on all projects who while they may not do the work, are close enough they can step in so the client doesn't suffer/miss deadlines/etc. I'm always pleasantly surprised that people are human and willing to help. 

Next, practice your prioritization skills. I have a general rule that I only touch things once. If a deck/model/memo needs review I only start it if I have enough time to complete it. Constantly switching tasks slows you down and stresses you out.

I am much more senior than you at my diagnosis so I definitely have more flexibility and political capital to be cut some slack, but it can be done.  My goal is to burn as hot as possible and retire early.",1722470474.0

Sanctions didn’t cause Chavez and Maduro to decide to imprison their opponents or create a whole new constitution from scratch or remove the balance of power between executive, legislature, and judicial branches. The amount of people i know who have had family members kidnapped and robbed due to them speaking out about the corruption is not due to sanctions. The complete failure of the oil industry bc Chavez removed all the educated workers bc they were “bad and harmful” to the country and the people in the pueblos should be in charge, who really don’t know how to manage these complex machines and caused multiple rigs to explode and get shut down, is not due to sanctions. There are tooooooooo many things that happened and have put the country where it is. The sanctions happened BECAUSE of what was initially occurring. 

Your example makes no sense. Because the US didnt randomly willy nilly choose Venezuela to put sanctions on. like you’re saying the NFL would stop letting the lions score touchdowns.

To indulge & be literally one in soul & body for a moment is a beautiful thing when done right.

It's also healthy for body & soul as well.

""STOP doing something that he knows is harmful..""I can understand your point that maybe a few paletto members didnt want to have to deal with a serial killer, even if in reality the inconvenience is minor/trivial. That being said Lord Kebun doesn't peruse the reddit, nor watch Gta Streamers, so he isn't aware of any dissatisfaction unless someone tells him or he sees a clip about it. I'm sure he would have been receptive to dropping it sooner if he was aware of it.

""stop his toxic behavior if it is impacting people ooc.""This is where you lose me. Nothing about the PP arc can be categorized as ""Toxic Behavior"". You guys just throw that around wildly even when its not applicable. More apt descriptors would be ""unnecessary"" ""prolonged"" ""largely pointless"" ""Without much purpose"".

""Finally, if you think a roleplayer..""You clearly didn't see the OOC in person assault by MoonMoon against LordKebun when he was in MRPD on his knees begging for WuChang to be approved so that the Artists could do their RP business.

- the macbook m3 max, would maybe fit you more, because of the video and photo editing

now it depends, because you are talking about warranty and stuff, i am just saying, warranty is 12 months, and the other is out of warranty repair. you generally have 12 months of international warranty, the other 12 months is really, if something breaks, you are going to pay to repair it so it doesn't do any difference.

in your case, i would save up for that applecare+ and get it insured, because any damage, will cost you a lot of money, if you don't have 400$ spare, either go for the yearly 100$, or save up 1 month, and buy it.

"Albany","t5_2qzxo","I might just have a skewed perspective on the 2 movies per month thing, because while it's true that it evens out I just can't imagine consistently seeing that many movies per month. On my own I only go a few times a year if that. Even when I got them for free I didn't go that much. Other people are different though of course, so if you're already going to the movies that much why not.

I think I'm just heavily biased against regal, in part because they're a shitty company running a monopoly on the Albany area and are the biggest reason why local theaters like Spectrum and Madison (RIP) struggle so badly. The other reason is because I used to work there and saw firsthand how absolutely soullessly corporate they are and how... robotically they view customers. It's like people aren't even people to them. It's hard to view them the same way when the view from the inside showed how scummy and capital C corporate they are, more than any other company I've worked for. BTW if you buy a hot dog from there there's a decent chance it was cooked entirely in the microwave.

Yeah that's what you use to describe the husband 


>This is an uncompromising situation. You clearly feel very strongly about the situation. But you place him in an untenable spot and he can't abandon or treat his child as a dog to pick up when convenient and send monthly payments. 

She didn't get someone pregnant, he did, against his vows...


>Your husband wants all in on parenting and the ability to raise and influence his child and legacy.

Ewww. Not a legacy. 



> Children are not a mistake.


This one was. Context 


> They are real people with emotions and feelings and it's exciting to be part of their lives. 

Can be depending on context. 


>I will not understand your position because I'm not that way but I get that you are adamant in your opinion. 

What opinion? They're childfree. 



>Since you're unwilling to compromise your marriage and accommodate your husband's child, you must with clear conscience let him go.

There's no compromise on her side possible.  That was HIS job. He needs to let her go to find someone worthy of her


 >He has a responsibility to help raise this child.

Not above his wife. Plus he's choosing to.  


> Yes you might grieve but this is your decision to not participate in raising his child.

No. This was his decision to lie and go backwards on his word. Stop blaming the victim",1722470477.0

"roblox","t5_2rnsh","Joining the Discord and Guilded servers for the games is helpful as is the Rolimon's website and I would suggest for anything that is much of a grind that you check Marketplace before investing your time. 

That said, you can still be trolled, like trying to get the free hair from Kwarm. 

Some items are so sought after that the second it is released you are already competing with more people than there are items available. Someone always loses. You learn where it is wiser to spend your time through experience.

Right now Danimals has the easiest to get stuff with large stock.

Another tactic is to play the donation games and then purchase higher quality items with the free robux you earn. That can also be a grind, but you can get quite lucky.

Lastly, newer games seem to be more generous and obviously their stock is not yet depleted. I've played a lot of newer games, got one decent ugc and then they jack up the points needed to earn the next one and limit the stock more, along with other bs, and then I move on.

The most ridiculous I've found are those that make you earn points and then you also have to get lucky spinning a wheel to actually get the item. As soon as I see that set up I nope out of there.

Good luck.",1722470477.0

"TwoHotTakes","t5_4hlyni","Your husband was absolutely right. Tell ""Jenny"" that waiting around in a restaurant for her for an hour isn't just wasting your collective time, but also preventing a waiter/host for said restaurant from earning their wages the entire hour. 

I mean, had you waited around for an hour for her at a restaurant, in the shoes of the owner I would have asked you to leave. 

Besides which, Jenny is rude AF. If she relies a lot on unreliable public transport (have been there), it is on her to plan ahead for delays and backup travel routes, not on you. Or she could ask you to swing by and pick her up on the way **early**, with her being ready to go. 

She sounds like she does this a lot and is time blind. I speak as someone who is also time blind: I learned to be better with time management because my friends/family didn't coddle me about being late all the time. 

Not waiting for her to show up so you could drive her at her leisure and refusing to wait around for her for an hour isn't an asshole move. It's just letting her experience the consequences of her own behavior. If that's not sufficient for her to get her act together, **the next step is to stop inviting her to any time sensitive get together**. Mind, it may come to that.

"SaltwaterFlyfishing","t5_38s5n","So the line i use is 4 ft of 40lb mono and then 4ft of 30lb mono tied to a clouser.

Then, For the sharks, i use 40lb knottable wire attached to a swivel. I have this in a pocket easily accessible. If I see a shark I can cut my fly off that im currently using, and tie to the swivel quickly and get some shots ideally. But if I was just purely targeting sharks, I would just plan to already have the shark rig (swivel - 40lb knottabke wire - fly) attached to my leader. I use about a foot of wire.

As for getting sharks to bite, it's definitely tough haha. So I actually saw some sharks and was casting at them and then somehow hooked this red! Some blood got on the fly and then probably 10 blind casts later I was hooked up to a shark to a nice one.

If you want to come down here and get a shark for the first time on fly, I would *not* let anyone make you feel bad about putting some scent on the fly. I did this for quite awhile and only stopped because I stopped specifically targeting sharks and now it's more of an opportunistic thing. I still get them to bite without it though but it's definitely less often.

The big thing is finding them from shore where you can actually cast to them. Not sure if your gonna have a boat or not.

But ya dude, feel free to PM if you have anymore questions. I have caught quite a few sharks so would love to help someone else get on them if I can!",1722470477.0

Thank you all for the constructive advice. I'll definitely work on the pictures. It appears I have a lot to work on and change so I'll be doing just that.



The hand sign? You've never seen selfies like this one before? - [http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1006/20151113/0019b91ed7a117af9b2e44.jpg](http://images.china.cn/attachement/jpg/site1006/20151113/0019b91ed7a117af9b2e44.jpg)



As for pics, I didnt think anything was wrong with them at all. I was told I look Cool and Handsome in Pic #1 before. Bumble suggests it in first place as my most viewed pic. I will definitely be changing that one. ALL my pictures are recent. The one with less hair is Pic #5 because I just got a mohawk 2 weeks ago. Regarding the bunny suit pic because I think its hilarious and shows my silly side. It shows Im not intimidated by the color pink, a bunny suit, or your B/S about it. Do YOU have a suggestion that shows that same?



Regarding my interests, I'll get rid of some of the listed ones and try add more things I like to do in there as opposed to just things I like. I thought people wanted to see your interests and hobbies in a profile because they would be looking for people with similar interests. How do you show who you are without being too much of a list, life story, or wall of text?



My stand alone interest is gaming because it encompasses Dungeons and Dragons, Tabletop games, and Video. I dont ride my bike or take hikes as much during weekdays as I can relax with a quick game in the evening after work. Neither do I devote my life to gaming. I enjoy it for a couple hours as a way to unwind. Id prefer gaming with friends in social situations. Do you have a suggestion for something else to put in there?



For the non-construction advice - 



Im not attention deficit or ADHD but I appreciate you putting me in a box. I can't magically change my interests to...... \*checks notes\* what does everybody else like that Im supposed to conform to?



Oh and for the dudes telling me to delete it all and other friendly colorful things? I'm glad you don't like my profile. I didn't make it to attract men like you.",1722470478.0

If you have gotten rebellious, then its your way of defending yourself. 

All i can say is, it gets worse, so much worse. If you want to get along with your mom then the best solution is to get independent, otherwise you and your peace will suffer and no one around you will understand. Get a job, move out, try not to get angry at her or rebel as you've said it. It'll only get worse for you.

The 2 remaining in Gaza will not survive long as the places they have left to hide are growing ever smaller and smaller. This war will be over soon, Israel has one, the terrorist dogs of Hamas are near extermination, and afterwards Gaza will remain permanently bisected into 2 or 3 smaller divisions like the West Bank to prevent any future organization from ever having Hamas's capacity for another major attack ever again. Nor will there ever be any reason for Israel to ever negotiate or do anything but squeeze Palestinians out of existence as they no longer have any negotiating power whatsoever after losing YET ANOTHER war. There is no longer anything Palestinians can offer at the negotiating table whatsoever. They already tried being ISIS level terrorist scum and it only backfired. Iran is too much of a pussy to help you. What the F could Palestinians ever do or say to make Israel feel that de-occupying their terrorist territories would ever be in there interests?

I think in our life talaga there will be people that will became just a part of that chapter that will teach us a lesson and mold us into a stronger person mentally and physically. 

The mere fact that na ayaw na nya na maging part ng buhay mo shows that he is not the right person for you OP. You deserve someone better than him.

I totally understand na he is part ng mga important parts of your life but ayun nga hanggang dun lang sya sa chapter na yun. There is more to life than a person na ayaw na maging part ng buhay mo, i mean if he really wants to gagawin nya best nya to compliment your life kumbaga he is there for you while you grow and pursue your dreams.

To answer your question, yes it is normal to feel devalued and yung talagang unappreciated ka even you always try your best to Love and understand person. Kahit ako as a Guy nararamdaman ko yan, but sa tamang tao di mo yan mararamdaman OP 🤗


For now just focus on yourself OP 🤗 improve on yourself, maging busy ka and guard your heart. Will be praying for you na maging physically and mentally stronger ka pa to move on from this chapter of your life. 

The right  person will come tiwala lang again di mo yan mararamdaman sa tamang tao. I believe everyone is worth pursuing and loved for who they are despite their flaws 🤗

Siguro ayun nga start from acknowledging talaga naging part sya once ng buhay mo lalo na sa memorable parts.

Again there is more to life always choose and do what is best for yourself before others not in a selfish way naman .

Kaya mo yan OP! Naniniwala ako sayo Hugs! 🤗

Single moms in shelters get priority so you'll you'll after them. Reach out to united way in the interim if you need short term loans you can repay them later or after they thoroughly check your application. 

Head down to city hall social services and they'll help you with all of what you need to get in a better situation. 

10 yrs ago I had 8g in debt a baby and a shitty apartment. Withing 18 months I was out of debt with savings. My daughter has a life that would've never been possible without all of the supports in Canada.

If you have filed with courts- do and get them to garnish his wages. In ontario we have FRO- It took 6 months to get set up and I basically had to hold his hand but after it was set up it's been easy. If your ex is a job hopper expect to have to keep on them. Because he doesn't want to be forthcoming with financial aid, do not do this with him direct if you have the option not to. 

As for your daughter- tell her next time take her attitude to her dad- he should be able to send her money for it.

Don't talk bad about him just say, ask dad as normally as you would've when married. 

Do not give up half the assets and do not give him the kids unless they want to go with him. As soon as he's served he's gonna make you life he'll.

I dropped about 170lb, gained about 10lb of muscle. Also had a previously undiagnosed rare type of hypogonadism corrected, which effectively made me go through puberty in my last 20s. Changed my voice, body hair, facial structure, and fat distribution. 

Most of the changes happened over the course of about 3 years, with most of the muscle gains taking place from age 33 to 35.

Literally no one who I hadnt seen between the ages of 28 and 34 recognized me as someone they knew. It's very strange to have deep, impactful, long experiences with a person, and they have absolutely no idea who you are.

And working slowly toward the autumn and winter tree max level via dragon missions. Or hoping for a monster idol bonus when merging the idol chain, or having one of those come by in the magic merchant offer. I want that unicorn!! 

Just a lot of quite pretty decorative items are in the game, whether they end in wonder or not, and I want one of each top level at least.

Your post was removed for not following the proper title format. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *[FS/FT/GA/LF] - LOCATION - $PRICE - title*  

Example: [FS] - Location - $42 - Stuff for sale

# **Make sure you include the hyphens**

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

1. Use only LF, FS, FT, GA as tags (looking for, for sale, for trade, give away)

2. Use [] around the tag, so it looks like [FS]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.

3. For multiple tags, only use /'s, so it looks like [FS/FT] or [FT/GA]. Don't use . , \ | - : ; ~ or anything else.

4. If you are posting a discussion or PSA, please use a [PSA] tag at the beginning of the subject.

5. Your location must be included after your tag.

6. Your price must be included after your location. 

* If you are selling multiple items, please use a + after the lowest priced item.  **Example: [FS] - location - $5+ - multiple items**

* If you are giving something away, use the giveaway tag [GA] 

* If you are are posting LF, FT or LF/FT, a price is not required.   **Example: [LF] - location - stuff**

Its only within the last hundred years that the idea of not living with/or/in close proximity to extended family became the ""ideal"" that shows that people are ""doing it right"". Kids need lots of adults and other children, and so do parents. 

Menopause exists in only three species, humans, orcas and elephants, and the prevailing reasoning for its existence is EDUCATION. Passing on knowledge and imparting experience to younger generations. We have cut ourselves off at the knees with the way we are living and how we think about older folks, men and women, especially in youth-obsessed USA.

Also, the current economic system and its conditions do not support big families. Childcare yearly can cost as much as one parents yearly salary, yet often both parents are expected to work or the family will live in poverty. It doesn't make sense to have multiple kids, or even one, if you aren't upper middle class or wealthier.

What exactly do you take this to mean other than being hired because they're a minority? That is your suggestion, that people are being hired specifically based on their race and not their qualifications. So at bare minimum (with how that statement reads to me), you are suggesting that they are beginning the process solely on race and not looking at qualifications. 

If that is not your suggestion, then my apologies for misunderstanding.

In an ideal world where people could be trusted to not be racist, exist, classist, etc there would be no need for quotas or programs. Unfortunately we do not live in that world and people are those things and many people in power are those things an systemically and purposefully held others back for those reasons (class, race, gender, orientation, etc). Gotta try and level the playing field somehow. 

Unfortunately, because we do not live in that ideal world, these efforts at leveling the playing field are subject to the same shortcomings that humans have so there will naturally be blemishes and problems, but that's a dogshit reason to stop trying to fix the issue.

When I play a new game I always like to check out the subreddit for interesting stuff and there's *always* bitching and moaning. In every single one. It doesn't ruin my enjoyment of the game because who gives a fuck what they think but the spam on the subreddits certainly affects my enjoyment of those subs. 




And it's always phrased in the most entitled way possible:


* ""They *should have* done [X]""

* ""It's ridiculous this game doesn't have [X]""

* ""[X] is broken/unplayable/dumb""


It's like they think every game has to suit every one of their tastes exactly or it's trash. And/Or they think everyone else has the exact same taste so it can be said as a fact rather than an opinion. I blame YouTube/Twitch personally for the attitude, but it doesn't really matter. 



Why not try ""I wish this game had [X]""? Yeesh. At least you won't come off as a whiny brat.",1722470481.0

"Autoimmune","t5_3cy3p","Sorry to hear of your symptoms but now they are doing lots to reverse damage to myelin sheath. Also have you been definitively tested for Lyme’s and confections ie: Babesia?? Or thyroid issues which all have overlapping symptoms. It is often caused by inflammation. You might try  YouTube and search for some of the symptoms or re: MS. There are many people who are developing autoimmune diseases now that may also have to do with Covid even if you were sassy & didn’t get tested to see if you had it. Also try FB groups they’re very active & have lots of well regarded participants.
My very best to you. Just remember because of COVID/Long COVID there is tremendous amt of research being done on neurological disorders. 
I believe you & Drs are now afraid to say anything or just say all your tests are negative when they didn’t do tests they ought to have been done!!
I have lots of same symptoms as you & it turned out to be normal pressure Hydrocephalus. I had a shunt implanted and some symptoms got much better. But PLEASE don’t think that’s what you have. It’s pretty rare. I also have Fibromyalgia, Lyme’s & Babesia, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis & 1 Dr refused to do full thyroid panel saying TSH is only test needed. Well that’s lie!! ( ie: TSH is hormone that is made by pineal gland so they’re not even testing the thyroid!) I take various supplements that reduce the pain & stiffness & just started with a new neurosurgeon. So you need to go to a specialist ( for thyroid need to go to thyroid specialist as many endocrinologists don’t know that much about thyroiditis, etc)
I had a spinal tap to finally, definitively learn I had Lyme’s & Babesia which at times is likened to Syphilis & Malaria!
I hope you can find out what is really going on & get to drs who know helpful treatments!
I know ie what it like to be isolated & alone cause of symptoms. Oh and for your bladder issues try seeing a Uro- gynecologist.
My very best to you!!🤗🤗",1722470481.0

"MilitaryFinance","t5_2uhjq","Since you only have two GI bills for three kids, you will likely be on the hook for another college tuition. That could be $400k+ by the time that kid goes to college. 529 is the best option because it is post tax, but grows tax free. It’s like a Roth IRA with no income limit and no contribution limit. The other thing that is great is you can contribute to a 529 plan even before you have that kid, making yourself the beneficiary. When they are born, you can switch it to their benefit. And if they don’t use it? You can convert some of it to a Roth like someone else said, but you could also transfer it to their kids (your grandkids). If they get a scholarship or go to an Academy? You can withdraw without penalty the amount equal to that scholarship (or what the Academy states in a letter is the cost of the education they are providing). So I’ve always worried that I’m over contributing ($5000 deposit 18 years ago and $500/month for the last 18 years is now worth $225,000 and my kids are 12 and 14 and have my GI bill split between them). But I don’t mind if I over contribute because I look at it as building generational wealth through education.",1722470481.0

I used to worry about pressure cracks too, put shock pads in etc, but now I think its a waste of time to be honest. They did happen sometimes but not frequently. They also never happened by tightening down, only after skating the deck for weeks or months, so it's most likely caused by general wear and tear rather than being too tight.


Any decks that got them were worn out before the cracks were visible beyond the baseplate. I don't think any cracks I ever had progressed beyond a cm or 2. Never had a deck actually split because of them. I wouldn't worry about pressure cracks anymore than I would about my tail wearing out from ollies or my nose wearing from slides.",1722470481.0

Cross marketing and making money off skins. Let's pretend that that the franchise wasn't dead and they gave a damn enough to want to promote it.


They'd have to ask if the skin is unique enough and the character popular enough that people would want it.


Current volition and DS wanted to move away from what SR was so you wouldn't have Shaundi, Pierce, or Gat, not to mention they wouldn't be unique enough characters to warrant skins.


But they wouldn't want to promote the old games anyway, they didn't want new people coming to look at their older work. They were moving on to the new and would likely chose reboot characters because they'd probably think that those characters fit.
So 99% of the new cast falls into the same issue of not being unique enough/generic.

"edmproduction","t5_2sa4x","My experience there was the complete oposite, I always performed like crap in the vote rankings, but even when I was very rookie, I would do well in creativity and arrangement. Probably because I would often keep it ""simple"" and just grab the vocal and some fills from a very poppy song and write a future house track for it, the execution points were often on the lower side, but the creativity was there. I remember one where I did particularly well in the analysis was for a Chainsmokers contest, it was a very future bass song and somehow I managed to turn it into future house. I was often lucky that I was maybe the only one doing future bounce for that particular contest, so I asume gives extra points.

I would not break my head too much about it, specially if your songs are getting played. Maybe try and take some ""risks"" here and there, maybe ditching completely the original melodies, having a section with your own chords, If you do, idk, trap, maybe add a section with drums on a house pattern.

Also, check and compare your songs with proffesional tracks on the same one, that opned my eyes... A lot.",1722470483.0

The shoot was actually pretty brutal. 14 hours under intense fucking lighting in full gear, practice no breaks. Got paid SAG union wages though and made more in a day than I did in a week at my normal white collar job. Got 1 second of airtime in the final cut. 


 For the next 5 years  I was on the email list for the local casting company for about 5 years, went to one or two that interested me but nothing ever came of it.

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Your post has been removed for multiple reasons. Please make a new post, and be sure to correct all of the errors below:

* Poor title
* Poor body

Each of these is explained further below; read on if you need clarification.

---

Your post has been removed because **the title doesn't clearly state what kind of activity or interaction you're looking for**, or the title contains excessive emoji, punctuation, or all caps. As r4r caters to people of all interests, **it's important that readers can determine, *from the post title alone*, whether the post is seeking roughly the same thing as them, and whether it contains explicit content**.

NSFW posts can't have titles that'd lead a reader to believe they don't contain explicit content. **Please read the examples below;** blindly adding filler words to the title won't make it acceptable if you don't follow the guidelines!

###Examples of *terrible* titles:
* ~~23 F4A #Philly Seeking anyone for anything~~
* ~~45 M4F Hi folks, I am a 45 year old man looking for a woman for fun this evening in the city of Philadelphia while I'm on a business trip~~

Neither of these tells the reader **anything at all beyond the age, R4R, and location tags**; don't make everyone guess what you mean by vague terms like “fun” or “anything”.

###Examples of *good* titles:
* 23 F4A #Philly Seeking a hiking partner
* 23 F4A #Philly Seeking an no-strings hookup partner
* 45 M4F Looking for a fun lady for a night of bowling after my conference in #Philadelphia
* 45 M4F Looking for a fun lady for a night of flirting and sex after my conference in #Philadelphia

These are **concise and get the point across**, and, importantly, **it is now clear which posts are NSFW and which are not**

---

Your post has been removed, because it is too short. Please resubmit your post with some additional details about yourself and what you are looking for. Posts should contain a minimum of 100 words; **you are approximately 50 words short.** Note that padding out your post by repeating yourself or adding filler words is not going to make it meet the requirements.

Everyone knows that when you run a cover 3 against trips, your first instinct should be flood. And to prepare for this, you need to make sure to manually control the CB whose covering the deep 3rd and avoid accidentally running into your own guys in order to cover the go route. 

The alternative is to run a flip-6-3-hole defense, which in the game is as easy as calling a base 4 coverage and then manually tweaking every single player's actions/keys in the 4 seconds provided prior to the snap. If you'd have done this against this play, you'd have forced a 3-4 yard drop off pass which is basically a turnover in real football.  

This is just basic football. They teach this in pee wee. SMH. **WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS? A GAME OF SOME KIND? YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST CALL A PLAY AND EXPECT THE OTHER 10 GUYS ON DEFENSE TO ACT AS FLAWLESSLY ALL-AMERICAN AS THEY DO WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO THROW AGAINST THEM?!?!? YOU'RE EXPECTING SOME CONSISTENCY IN PRODUCT? **

"fromsoftware","t5_31rag","I think everyone is seriously underestimating the value of “premium” exclusive IPs for Sony.

Sony wants to sell consoles. They develop IPs in order to make those consoles more attractive. There is a reason you always see the same handful of games pop up in the same places (like the list of PS classics that they gave for free  when PS5 released, or the cross overs like Ghost of Tsushima’s armor sets or God of War Ragnarok’s poetry books). Part of the PlayStation’s identity is this list of exclusives. Does a single one make someone buy a PS5? Probably not in any amount that effects the bottom line. But as a collection, all of these exclusive games can move the needle. 

Each time you release one of these titles to other platforms, the value of that entire library decreases. The list as a whole is a source of prestige for the entire PlayStation brand. It’s like when a car manufacturer comes out with some limited production model that they lose money on building.

"ChristianUniversalism","t5_2spxl","So anyone who worships a monotheistic God automatically worships Yahweh even if it totally contradicts his character as revealed in the Bible and Jesus? I’m not arguing that there’s not only one God.  I’m saying that if you’re completely wrong about everything you know about him, then you don’t know him.

Islam (and modern Judaism) say God does not have a son and is not triune.  Christianity teaches God is trinity and had a son.  These two things cannot both be true.  One is false.  I understand a devout jew or Muslim would say I am wrong.  But it is not logically possible that we are both correct. If we are worshipping the same God, one religion grossly misunderstands his being and character.

I’m not trying to attack Muslims but I am a Christian Universalist.  I believe Jesus is the way the truth and the life.   I believe the vast majority of people are just trying to find their way in a broken world and don’t fault them for misunderstandings and I’m sure I have plenty of my own.  But Jesus is the center of my understanding of God.

And while the Bible does have misogynistic verses and stories, none of those are held up as perfect examples to follow.  Except Jesus who was perfect.

Islam holds Muhammed up as the perfect life, despite war , murder, multiple wives and child brides.  So yeah I feel pretty confident choosing Jesus over him. 

If you’re not a Christian that’s fine but we’re discussing this in Christian Universalism which is not all roads are correct but that all will eventually come to Christ so…

Also if you could stop downvoting me just for having a discussion that would be cool…",1722470485.0

You believe Anne to be doing this because she wants Ash all for herself as you are the best friend of Ash and Anne knew you didn't like her from the get go and possibly believes you are pushing Ash away from her. So she wanted to ruin you to get Ash all for herself/ away from you.

Toronto's local media insisted that Phil Kessel (who was one of the best offensive players in the league during his time there) fat and lazy and daily eating hot dogs on the way into the arena. After leaving, he continued being a dominant offensive force and was a key part of multiple championship teams (including back-to-back in Pittsburgh immediately after his tenure in Toronto.) Sports media members tend to be embarrassing in their blatant lies about members of the teams they support, whether or not they see them every day. They have a reason for it, and it's that they are obnoxious individuals who want attention. It isn't because KD is unreliable or Phil Kessel can't keep hot dogs out of his mouth or that Eloy ""dumped on"" this guy for six years.",1722470486.0

- a pillow: as others say, a balled up jacket is fine
- layers: the temperature can fluctuate so be prepared to adjust what you're wearing
- sleep mask: so you don't have to worry about your neighbor's light
- seat belt clearly fastened across your lap
- headphones/earplugs or something for the noise

"SiegeAcademy","t5_3jojv","what do you find different? since ranked is a lot more focused on the extrinsic reward of ranking up rather than just having fun, you’ll want to play the objective more so than ever. on defense focus on wasting attacker time and bringing ops that do that (wall denial, mira, castle, mute, etc) rather than just spawn peeking and dying every round— not that you necessarily do that.

on attack i’ve found that especially in the lower ranks NO ONE will play site. carefully drone and you might find that only one or two players are actually holding site and the rest are roaming. if it’s an easy site to get a plant off playing the objective here is essentially a free win.

however, none of this matters if your teammates aren’t helping you out. that’s why stacking >>>> solo queueing. we’ve all seen it— the guy who ash rushes without droning and instantly gets blown to smithereens by the kapkan traps on the doorway that he failed to drone, who then insta-locks Cav on defense only to not get a single kill and die within 10 seconds of the action phase. siege becomes 100 times when you actually have a stack to play with.

this can be done through playing with existing friends, finding them through LFG, discord, reddit, or simply done organically by finding them in ranked solo queue and asking them to party up. there are several reasons why stacks work so well in ranked.

for one, you have guaranteed communication and callouts. even if they’re trash, having teammates who can actually speak to you and tell you where an enemy is are better than silent ones who leave you to fend for yourself. another reason is team chemistry. Kobe Bryant wouldn’t nearly have as many rings if he didn’t have team chemistry with Shaq— he couldn’t do it by himself. It’s not the exact same in R6, but having even ONE teammate that can watch your flanks is miles better than hoping that you get a random who will play a good operator and push with you.

Of course— you can still solo queue. There’s nothing wrong with that. but remember— stacking with people will make it way easier to not only learn the game, but also to win.",1722470487.0

However, I think it gives you quite a lot of freedom and exposure to broad range of topics/skills/situations, from technical stuff to communication with customers, to people management and so on, which can then be useful to progress your career further into whatever you want. I also like that workload comes and goes in waves (at least in my PM role) and I can use the low workload periods for studying something that might be useful for your future role.

Differently than some other comments in this thread I feel my PM role is definitely not thankless. Actually, I feel quite the opposite -- other people do the actual job but I get to ""give"" it out/send/present it to the customers or brag about it to my managers. Of course, this is assuming things generally go well with your projects. If things do not go well customers may hate me, but, on the other hand, towards my management I still can blame it on other teams that did the actual job and managers are mostly on my side because it's always that other team that is not keeping up.",1722470487.0

"NCAAFBseries","t5_2tx3z","I feel like I'm the medium here, as in I'm very whelmed by the game overall. 

The gameplay is fun and exciting (minus playing defense in the last 2 minutes of the half), and as someone who's played Madden anytime it became available on GamePass over the last few years, I can definitely say I'm having loads of fun playing this game. I feel like it delivered for the most part for Gameplay and getting the environments pretty well for each team while in game. Recruiting is fun in my opinion (minus the visit glitch, but that hasn't bitten me too hard yet), and I love that they kept custom conferences with the logos for the conferences updating in game. 

THAT BEING SAID, I can see there is loads of room for improvement overall, mainly in RTG and Stadium Environments (Oklahoma State and the lack of paddle sounds, Wisconsin Jump Around, WVU Country Roads, etc). Teambuilder is great when the website cooperates, but I don't like the implementation of just taking over an existing team or the lack of Fight Song or Stadium choices. Dynasty is fun, but again, small things add up that need to be fixed.

Do I regret buying the game? FUUUUCK No, it's fun and I'm enjoying it. Could it be better? Also yes, which I'm hoping gets fixed in patches, but if not, DEFINITELY in next year's release. That being said, I'm not preording next year until I know for a fact that I'm not buying the same game again. I'll be happy to play CFB25 until then",1722470488.0

Yeah I know my oldest was very very afraid to let us in on what was going on with them b/c they were sure we'd shun them, but no way would we do that, we just had to adjust to the new normal. It wasn't even a question - of course we would love and support them no matter what.

Ideally you should be mining almost nothing, use bombs or mega bombs to blow up large numbers of rocks all at once. Bringing 80+ is pretty safe, but around 50 can work if you continue to make bombs with the ore and coal you collect on the way down.

Trade jade for staircases at the Desert Trader on Sunday. Because you’ll be getting a ton of stone as a result of bombing things, you can make more staircases as you go as well. Use them to skip infested rooms, spiral rooms, and other rooms with rocks spaced far apart.

I think it was Tolkien's way saying, just because a man doesn't share the same typical interests as a fighter, doesn't make him any less of a fighter. Other examples of this are Frodo (who isn't your typical hero, yet people even today still see him as less, clearly ignoring Tolkiens message).

There's a bit nine the books which supports Farmair being just as effective as Boromir (maybe even better):

>*Return of the King*

>*""Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!' said Beregond. 'But things may change when **Faramir returns. He is bold, more bold than many deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field.

Marshall never once showed interest in her until she made herself known to be available. Now the second time he did though about getting back together with her but decided against it because her choice to leave brought him great pain, embarrassment and humiliation. There are a few examples I can use as my evidence for Lily being the reacher or even Marshall being the settler if you like.

I can see why my comment may have been confusing though. Oftentimes personal property appears as communal to small children in a public space. That’s my point. Sand toys are likely to be picked up by other toddlers, and I think it’s important for a child to be warned before dumping them all out in that public space. Scooters may be swiped by other toddlers, and I think it’s important kids know that as well before they bring something to the park. Of course, if they don’t want to share, they don’t have to and we can come up with a solution or language to use to get our things back.

"fcbayern","t5_2sgxj","Physicality, ball carrying, taking on opponents, resisting the press, and defending, 5 key traits for a defensive midfielder, or a mixed midfieder. Kimmich is a much better passer, but worse at everything else. 

I agree Kimmich carried the midfield alone, not only in that match, but in fact, from 2021 to 2023, but that was more due to Goretzka contributing nothing to his half of the double pivot. It wasn't really a good thing (not Kimmich's fault) because Bayern's main issues were that huge gap in the midfield in the build up and defensive phases. 

The fact Kimmich had to do all that work for so long led him to believe he is a six, but when him and his teammates declined to the point the team's weaknesses became too evident to ignore, it led him to finally being dropped from that position by 2 different managers in 2 different teams (Tuchel and Nagelsmann at Bayern and Germany respectively).

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","-- A wicked man who dies of old age and is assigned to Gehenna was not ""executed"" by God.

No reference needed.  That's just common sense.  If you can't grasp that, you're mentally lacking.  To ""execute"" is to kill.  If a man dies of natural causes, it cannot be said that he was executed or killed.

Suppose a man is condemned to die by execution in a certain nation, but that he dies of natural causes before his execution.  *Nobody with comprehension would say that he was executed.*  Those who die of natural causes and are assigned to Gehenna were not executed or killed.  A judgment was made against them, but, by definition, they were not executed.

>it's as if saying someone ""assigned"" to the gioutine, was not executed by the king

The issue of whether one assigned to the guillotine was executed depends on whether he actually went to the guillotine.  If his life ended in the guillotine, then he was executed.  However, if he was assigned to the guillotine, but died before he was taken to it, then he was NOT executed.  It's very simple.  No reference needed... just a dictionary and a little comprehension.

Plus, you are wrong in comparing Gehenna to a guillotine.  A guillotine is an instrument of execution; Gehenna is a symbolic place.

-- There are more in Gehenna than just those executed by Jehovah.

I've already provided a reference for that, but here it is again:

Straight from the borg's website:

""Not everyone who dies goes to hell, though. **The Bible shows that some people become so steeped in wickedness that they are beyond repentance.** ([Hebrews 10:26, 27](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/hebrews/10/#v58010026-v58010027)) **When such ones die, they go, not to hell, but to Gehenna, which is a symbol of everlasting destruction.** ([Matthew 5:​29, 30](https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/matthew/5/#v40005029-v40005030)) For example, Jesus indicated that some of the hypocritical religious leaders in his day would go to Gehenna.""

[https://www.jw.borg/en/bible-teachings/questions/who-goes-to-hell/](https://www.jw.borg/en/bible-teachings/questions/who-goes-to-hell/) \[remove the ""b"" in ""borg""\]

The reference above refers to those who simply ""die,"" not those who ""executed by Jehovah.""

And... are you hoping that I've forgotten? Well, I haven't.  I'm still waiting for you to attempt to back up your claim about the ""*super tiny* fraction (<0.000000000001%) of all humans who have ever lived"" as being the only ones who won't be resurrected.",1722470491.0

I think you ought to consider what leverage we really have at this stage - Rob has done a good job of framing how strong the government position is right now compared to ours. You mentioned student loan forgiveness being an open goal for retention, when according to the DDRB there is absolutely no retention crisis. From page 45 of the report:

*3.2 The full-time equivalent (FTE) medical and dental HCHS workforce showed strong growth in the year to December 2023 (see table 3.1). The workforce growth was especially strong in England (5.1 per cent in the year to December 2023).*

  
At least we're disrupting electives and causing the waiting list to grow though, right? It's actually falling, and 52 week waits have halved. We're in a much weaker position than you seem to want to admit - there's a real risk that if we walk away from this deal, the government simply calls our bluff. How many of us can truly commit to escalating strikes? Do you really think you'll see doctors stood on picket lines for an indefinite strike, living only on donations, letting the electricity be cut off in order to stick it to the man? It's not 1984 and you're not Scargill. The pay erosion of the 2010s should never have been allowed to happen, and we should resolve to act as soon as there's a sniff of it happening again, but we can't expect to force the government to undo that damage now. Take the 4%, and we'll build on it next year with another above inflation pay award.",1722470491.0

If you don’t have a warning at all, the only thing you can do is keep them separated. You can’t train an event you cannot anticipate or understand. Drawing blood and leaving teeth marks is enough this isn’t acceptable or safe interactions. Crate and rotate is a good method, but you can use other two barrier systems.

I’ll just say it: you aren’t training hard enough.  You need to lift until failure and then rest 90 seconds and then lift until failure again.  Multiple sets.  100 movements or more per muscle group.

4x10 leg press

I fully agree that everyone should do their job. But when you have to send someone for physical work under harsh climate, you obviously would want to pick someone who is stronger. 

(And this has no relations to gender. I would freely pick a big strong woman over a small weak man if there is the choices available to me. It is just that at the time, the guy was the much stronger person.)

Ideally, I would not only pick the stronger person for the hard work. I would actually expect the stronger person to volunteer for the work when they realize that the only other person is less fit than them. Call it chivalry, but I think it is only common senses.

And this is even more so when the stronger person in this case is not really doing anything useful.",1722470493.0

* Each person looks for gigs staffed in or near one of the 2 cities; once she had a long term gig in our home city, another time I got a long term gig in her travel city and we lived in a hotel suite
* Get a remote gig so one can be in the other city

If you're both working pretty hard, like 12+ hour days, honestly it just became a routine m-th and you get super good at packing.  Basically work, gym, eat, sleep, repeat, travel, repeat.  

The thing is, we'd both do events & happy hours here & there, but we kept those to a minimum and a 1 or 2 policy, with calls every night at the same time, etc etc.

In my experience it's better to allow the information to seep into the story as it's told rather than over-explaining it in the beginning.

Discussion posts should be thoughtfully crafted to encourage meaningful, civil, and constructive conversation; avoid low-effort requests for artist, song, or album recommendations. 

**Very short discussion posts are usually a sign of poor quality.** Please try again with more in-depth text in your self post. All discussion posts should be conducive to discussion, and not merely contain a statement, a multiple choice or otherwise basic question, or a prompt for brief or quick replies. Do not ask people to list off favorite songs, albums, artists, concerts, genres, or other musical tastes.

Discussion posts should contain a minimum of 200 characters, not including any URLs or links. Posts with URLs will need to be a bit longer, but links are encouraged when mentioning songs. The most successful discussion posts contain between 280 and 320 characters, include examples, and leave open-ended questions and broad subjects for commenters to talk about. 

See our guidelines on High Quality Discussion posts in the sidebar.

Looking back there definitely were some lesbians in my school. About 10 years ago I saw an obituary and the name looked familiar. It was the mother of one of my high school classmates who was always a little different. When reading the survivors her daughter and her wife were listed.

I also dated a gorgeous guy in high school who was the funniest person I ever met. He never made an sexual moves and I couldn’t figure it out until later he was gay.

"Watches","t5_2qls5","The need to buy luxury (unecessary) material objects stems from a hole in our ability to feel/appreciate value in ourselves, pur relationships and the opportunities around us. It's not an obvious hole in many cases. It can be deep seated in subconscious. It needn't be linked to trauma (although it can be eg stress, dissatisfaction with a decent life compared to the one you were sold as a child, low self esteem or worse) and it can be created by marketing which is carefully and skillfully designed to create an illusion of value in things that don't actually offer much in the way of value (the fact we value a piece of paper as money is ludicrous when you break it down...same goes for watch complications that casio or your ohone can do).

It's hard to accept or believe this because it has been normalised.

The fact that you can want something so bad and then find out it doesn't scratch the itch reinforces that.

Now there's nothing wrong with doing it provided you are comfortable with it in your value system and its not out of control. This of it like alcohol. You know it's bad for you, with only a short term benefit that evaporates in hours, but as long as you do it.in moderation in an appropriate manner that doesn't affect the rest of your life then on balance no real harm done. But if it's trending up it's better to nip in the bud early before it becomes a problem.

I am into watches and so suffer from this condition as does most of society. But I'm happy that I can keep under control as I sit on watch decisions for months, close to a year, and then only buy if the want hasn't faded, or if there's a deal I know I can flip out of  easily without losing $. I also limit myself to max 3 watches with a 1 in 1 out policy (noting I'm up to 5 now, albeit the extra 2 were cheap $300 watches...but I'm already aware that is the 1st step of losing control and so am taking measures to correct).

Lastly I'm embarking a new technique that is to only buy luxuries that align to my values and reflect who I am and what I need eg my stlye is modern elegance, im an engineer by trade and im clumsy. so I own a reverso squadra which has cool engineering but looks great in its stylish art Deco case with a modern twist of being square. My other watch is a ming 17.09 which has a cool engineering twist (independent hours) and elegant modern distinctive look coupled with Japanese lines that tickle my jaoanophile nature and love of Japanese design....etc",1722470496.0

#NEW VIDEOS AND AUDIOS (Updated Weekly) (All Content is 18+ Only)

##Cuckold Mesmerize

Let me just talk into your ear, telling you all about what your naughty little wife is doing. She's in the next room, getting railed by her bull. You're just a cute little cuck now, so relax and enjoy me reminding you of your place. Let yourself go into a trance like state and listen to what I'm repeating to you, let these words get ingrained into your very being. Over and over I will say these sentences, making your mind more and more compliant, conditioning you to love the concept of him fucking and filling your wife.

##Your Big Dick is Too Small!

Sigh, I thought you were actually being honest about having a big dick, as I did tell you I was a size queen!! You thought you could impress me with this minuscule 24 inch long cock that can only fill a single cup up with cum?? I guess I'll give you a few chances to improve, so take these pills and I'll keep checking up on you. I can't help it if you feel like I'm gaslighting you and constantly increasing my standards. There's no way I didn't tell you from the beginning that I wanted a dick so big I'd need a crane to move it!

##Giving You Wedgies Again

Wait, I know you from highschool, since when do we go to the same college?? Awe, so who is this cute girl you're talking to, a perspective girlfriend perhaps? Well let me tell her all about how I used to bully you! But you know what? For old times sake I'm going to pants you in front of her and then give you a few wedgies while she watches. Oopsies, I guess you definitely don't have a chance with her now...

##Futa Step-Sister is Stealing Masculinity

The city is calling for a water restriction, so you and (your step-sister)(Nicole) are going to have to bathe together. Oh ummm... wow! She has a cock now, and like quite a large one at that, when on earth did that happen! I guess it must be because she has been stealing masculinity from all the guys she beats at her sporting events. Her cock is even larger than yours is now, and if you keep letting her man handle you then she might just end up stealing all of it. While I lather you both up how about I also stroke both of your cocks. I'll make both of you feel good and cum, but remember, you'll still have to bathe with the cum filled bath water after!

##You're A Cock Sleeve!

Just admit it... why deny that you want to be a cum dumpster for men. At this point we both know that you're just destined to service cocks! Stop pretending like you aren’t gay. I have organized a nice long line of guys who are excited to be able to fill and cover you with their cum. Enjoy it as they use your holes and make you their personal fucktoy! This was a custom order and the name Scott was used.

##Nudist Beach Hotwife

You've been such a fantastic house husband, except when I found you jerking off watching porn, without permission! But you've worked hard, so I booked this cabana at a nudist beach as a surprise for you. The extra fun part is that I saw that that porn was cuckold themed and the more I looked at your history, the more I realized I liked it too. So the best part is that this is a swingers nude beach!! I'm going to find a nice hunky, hung stud to fuck me while you watch, your dick in it's cage. If you're a good boy for me, sweetie, I'll maybe even have a nice creamy surprise for your dick!

##Freeuse Kitchen Time

I am so, so glad that you're finally starting to get used to just fucking me whenever you'd like. I would like to keep reminding you, though, my asshole and my mouth are yours to do whatever you want with, whenever you want. I know you love my throat, but I really need to do dishes, can you just use my ass while I clean them? And then when I'm done that, how about we hang out into the living room and binge watch our favourite show! Remember to finish by cumming all over my face, as you know how much facials help with my skincare!

##The Circumcision Fairy

Your caring, sweet girlfriend has really been trying to convince you to get circumcised, so she summoned me, the Circumcision Fairy! When I look back in your memories I am shocked to find that you don’t have any negative feelings about that gross floppy thing between your legs… I guess I will have to alter those memories and make you think that growing up uncut was horrible! I bet you will have a ton of humiliating stories to tell your girlfriend about in the morning, but don't worry, she will be there to support you through your inevitable surgery!

However it’s not really understandable that he would do such a bad job of defending himself over it, to the point of literally allowing Osha to kill him. The Jedi were always trying to do what they thought was the right thing, even if it was at times cringe inducingly stupid. For the Jedi to all then go in to ‘just kill me’ mode, like Torbin committing suicide or whatever 16 years later, is just beyond anything shown in the show. 

I’m not sure Qimir really did much effective against Sol. Sol bested him quite comfortably in the end and it required Osha to come along and save him while he failed to explain himself for a millionth time. Considering Mae was able to just apologise for burning down their entire coven and causing the deaths of basically everybody and Osha just gave her a hug, it seems like an apology could have gone a long way.",1722470497.0

As of May 2022, the project was two years late and the expected cost stood at £25–26 billion,[11] 50% more than the original budget from 2016. In February 2023, EDF announced that costs would rise to £32.7bn in 2023 prices and operation would be delayed by a further 15 months to September 2028.[12][13] In January 2024, EDF announced that it estimated that the final cost could rise up to £46 billion in 2024 prices and be delayed by up to three years to 2029-2031.

[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank)

> PageRank (PR) is an algorithm used by Google Search to rank web pages in their search engine results.

> Currently, PageRank is not the only algorithm used by Google to order search results, but it is the first algorithm that was used by the company, and it is the best known.

> The eigenvalue problem behind PageRank's algorithm was independently rediscovered and reused in many scoring problems. In 1895, Edmund Landau suggested using it for determining the winner of a chess tournament.[9][10] The eigenvalue problem was also suggested in 1976 by Gabriel Pinski and Francis Narin, who worked on scientometrics ranking scientific journals,[11] in 1977 by Thomas Saaty in his concept of Analytic Hierarchy Process which weighted alternative choices,[12] and in 1995 by Bradley Love and Steven Sloman as a cognitive model for concepts, the centrality algorithm.[13][14]

> A search engine called ""RankDex"" from IDD Information Services, designed by Robin Li in 1996, developed a strategy for site-scoring and page-ranking.[15] Li referred to his search mechanism as ""link analysis,"" which involved ranking the popularity of a web site based on how many other sites had linked to it.[16] RankDex, the first search engine with page-ranking and site-scoring algorithms, was launched in 1996.[17] Li filed a patent for the technology in RankDex in 1997; it was granted in 1999.[18] He later used it when he founded Baidu in China in 2000.[19][20] Google founder Larry Page referenced Li's work as a citation in some of his U.S. patents for PageRank.[21][17][22]

PageRank itu different entity, bukan google, tapi google punya hak exclusive, bayar puluhan M ke Stanford. Hak paten yang punya stanford.

> However, the patent is assigned to Stanford University and not to Google. Google has exclusive license rights on the patent from Stanford University. The university received 1.8 million shares of Google in exchange for use of the patent; it sold the shares in 2005 for US$336 million.[29][30]

Instead they said let’s double down on all his lies, throw every government agency under the bus, all so we can protect a guy we know is pure evil. Now he’s too intertwined into the base and they couldn’t get rid of him if even they wanted to. Unfortunately it means the country is stuck with him now too. Even if he loses again, his way is engrained as the new Republican way and his daughter in law is in charge of the RNC.

I’m not even a Democrat. I’ve always been in the middle, yet I can’t see ever voting for any of them again. I have several family members lifelong Republicans who are reluctant Democrats now.

Sorry for the delay, it's been a bit of a ride this last while. 

Yes! Confounds me why they wouldn't provide a size guide. Particularly given the company in question. At least around these parts, 3M is to filtration what Clorox is to bleach. Given such prestige, why then would one of your flashiest models that has been quite proudly advertised be without something as basic as an approximate fit chart!! Heck, I found multiple different filter and cartridge compatibility charts for this mask but couldn't dredge up a single sizing chart. 

But hey, once I buy all 3 sizes that quantitative fit test kit will sure give me some piece of mind after the fact lol!

At any rate, I ended up biting the bullet and bought the HF-802SD. Was kind of wanting something here, fast. And it absolutely fit just as the Aura did. Which is to say, it didn't. The bridge of my nose has paid the price this last while. Though, I suppose in a way that sizing similarity makes sense in hindsight I suppose. The Aura is(at my local box store anyways, and from what I could tell online) a one size fits all mask and Medium sits squarely in the middle of the Small-Med-Large pantheon. So a Medium much like a one-size, likely may be similarly dimensioned to fit the largest quantity of persons. If the one is too small, the two might be as well.

My HF-803SD came in today though. Excited to try it out in real use tomorrow. Pretty comfy, and amusingly cavernous coming from my 802.",1722470498.0

It’s probable that some of your opponents have dropped out. If someone is drastically ahead, you’ll need to shoot the moon, 4 wins in a row has about a 1/16 chance of winning, but would 15x+ your bankroll by pressing each win. Ideally, you will be closer to needing 1-2 all-ins to win. Bet against the chip leader, each win is basically a coin flip, go all-in enough times to earn and hold first place, and get lucky!",1722470499.0

I have no idea why Child wrote that. It would have been so easy for Army-era Reacher to have been aware that Jodie had a crush on him, and for him to think she was just an awesome kid.

prices being this high also serve as a deterrent. bottom line is you don't park illegally, you cannot be towed. 

as someone mentioned, they're low income waivers in place. but if you make good tech money, you gotta pay to play, aka pay to park on a knifes edge and park in spots you don't know if you're allowed or not.

It's like the first in that it actually follows what happened to a lone person. 

I will say the scares in the second one were a little better, the paintings, the singing segment, the weird video clips talking to the thing. Those were unforgettable moments. However, the found footage segments were more tense on the third, and the narrative was more cohesive. 

Personally it's my favorite, but if the second one didn't work for you it's likely that most of the things that put you off about the second one are still here (unanswered questions, meandering narratives, lots of ppl talking).",1722470500.0

I am not exactly sure where your chest pain is. And remember chest pains are a sign of serious heart issues like heart attacks. So if you are very concerned, you really need to speak with your provider immediately. 

You mentioned having trouble breathing. I guess one of the questions to determine is if you are having a problem getting air in or getting air out or maybe both. I think your doctor would be able to discover what the problem could be. 

Please don’t be like me and wait, hoping things will go away. In late June, I was sure I had a little bug. All indicators pointed to a virus. I ended up at the end of the week in UC on the verge of pneumonia. It turns out this bug I had way back in April just never went away. It would flare and hide. I have literally been sick every two weeks. Since I finally saw my doctor, I am on the right regimen to overcome this bacteria.

We figured money will always come and there will be another time to buy a house, but the opportunity to have a big wedding while we're young and child free will never come again.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I don't think you understood what I meant. I'm not saying that other people should read my mind, but comparing how different is getting affection when you asked for it than when the other person just gives it to you without asking. I'm just saying that I find much more genuine of a gesture when the other person shows affection without you asking, and that asking for affection sometimes feels like ""forcing"" the other person to do something they may not want to do. I know that communication is important, but when it comes to this kind of stuff, I feel like I'm demanding affection from that person instead of just letting them know what I would like to get.",1722470500.0
"askcarguys","t5_3fbt1","I would keep your 4Runner, since trade in value on cars is laughable. That will be a reliable car for years to come and it is already paid off. If money is already tight, you need to forget the Corvette fun car for now until you and your wife are in a better financial position. You can also use your 4Runner for the utility of hauling and towing stuff like you use the F-150 for. My daily driver is my late dad's beloved GTI, so I get the sentimental thing. It's up to you how attached you are to the F-150. No strangers on the internet have say on whether you should sell that or not. 

For your wife, have you considered something very fuel efficient and reliable, but less costly than a Prius like a Corolla or a Matrix? The hybrid comes with a higher price tag. She's obviously a safe driver because her car has lasted 24 years. The things that wear out with age are the rubber and plastics. If it's parked in a garage, those things last much longer. If the tires are in good shape, the fluids have been changed regularly, and all the maintenance is up to date; I don't really see any immediate danger in driving a car just because it is older. 

If you are worried about the one car she has, and finances, why are you even considering a car for yourself just for more fun right now? That just seems like your priorities are not straight. Your 4Runner still has a lot of life left in it. Also, the insurance is going to be a lot higher on a car like a Corvette. If you're worried about the Avalon, that's what you should be looking at replacing right now.",1722470501.0
"ToyotaTundra","t5_35y2r","The job of insurance is to literally make you whole. It's literally not to offer as little as possible. If that was the case why would they ever payout if their literal job was to offer as little as possible. 

What I hate about almost every insurance post is they forgot to mention that their discount insurance sucks so instead of staying that they tried to save some bucks using an insurance that is half price and no one ever heard of they play it like all insurance blows. 

I have State Farm and over my life I've probably had 5 big claims. They have all been resolved quickly and fairly because unless you're 20 you know with insurance you literally get what you pay for.

I’m not denying anything. I’m asking YOU to provide supporting data for YOUR claim. The fact you’re trying to shift it back to me makes it clear you have nothing to support your claim.

> Zero evidence to support that.

Look back at the last 3 years. Price goes up, price goes down independently from the company’s actions - it’s divorced from reality. 

> Every transformation gme has undertaken has failed so far.

NFT bubble burst, for sure. But it will be back, and the underlying infrastructure and knowledge GameStop accumulated will be ready. The technology behind NFTs is at a similar spot as the internet was in the 90’s. It existed and was this weird, cool thing, but nobody knew how to best use it. It took 10 years for it to really blossom (MySpace, Facebook, et al.). Similar thing will happen with NFTs, but on a shorter timescale. 

> …e-commerce overhaul failed, store updates failed.

Again, I ask you: what evidence do you have to support these claims? First of all, lets put that aside for now. Let’s start off easy - please define the “e-commerce overhaul” and the “store updates”.",1722470501.0

We will review your following post in accordance with our rules as we want to prevent an unexpected Redditor from spiraling or send them to the ER: Recently, it’s been so difficult to sleep and eat because I’m consistently anxious and my brain is running non-stop about scenarios. I’m at an all-time high stress moment and I can’t even tell my parents. I think my main concern is that I just want to eat. I know I have to because I’m on my period, but it’s hard. Definitely not normal to drop two pounds in a day. I’m nauseous to even swallow food because I’m so anxious. How do you calm down and get yourself to eat? Any tips for dealing with anxiety while on your period? Any hobbies you recommend that help as a distraction? Thank you :))

Frankly you don't get to decide whether Kamala Harris is black. And she actually does have significant African ancestry, so arguing the point would be bizarre. Not only does she objectively have significant African ancestry, she has both been actively claiming that blackness and being recognized as such by other black people for a long time.

"CozyGamers","t5_487hv0","I played all of these games and loved them all!! I play on a PC but I think most of them are on the Switch. In general they are light and easy with no or minimal combat and platforming.

  
Cozy Grove (Time gated to about 1 hour of quests per day but unlimited fishing and decorating)

The Last Campfire - Quest Adventure game with an excellent narrator

Roki - Quest Adventure game

Yono and the Celestial Elephants - A quest type game with some excellent music.

Tuberbrook - excellent graphics!!

Chuchel - So cute and fun!

Machanarium - more excellent graphics

Summer In Mara - some farming but also adventuring

Deiland - same as above

Far - Travel in a steam punk vehicle. Try to keep it running

Milo and the Magpies - help a lost cat get home. Short inexpensive game

Samorost - Wild inventive graphics

Tiny Bang Story - same

Tinykin - Some mild platforming. Nothing too hard. I hate platforming!!

Island Saver - This one is free so you have nothing to lose!

DonutCounty - Very original

Passpartout2 - You create art and sell it

Night in the Woods - Excellent game with multiple paths you can take. I played it once and then immediately played it again to take the other path. It also includes a fun video game within the game that the main character can play. Trigger warning – it touches on some heavy subjects.

Yonder - Great graphics and extremely open world. You do whatever you want whenever you want. There is an end goal but you can go about it any way you want.

Tiny Robots Recharged – individual stand alone levels with fun (kind of easy!) puzzles to solve in order to progress.

Cattails (the first one) – a sim where you are a cat in a colony",1722470502.0

"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx","> Why would I know the context for the slide you presented? 

Case closed.

> No, I think nonbinary people exist, even if most people (cis and trans) have a binary gender identity. 

This is called bad faith. You are both denying what the slide says, but also believe what you claimed it doesn't say.

Also, I doubt cis people for the most part have a GI. They have a sex but not usually much more

> What do you base this on? Have you spoken to many trans people about their experiences? 

Because every time I say ""I don't have a GI"" they get mad

> Yes, I think your stance on this is analogous to straight people in the 90s saying ""I don't have a sexual orientation, I'm just normal."" 

You are piggybacking off the gay movement too much. And no, heterosexuality is something clearly identifiable. Gender identity, for me at least makes little sense",1722470503.0

In my daily life, terms like trans, gay, lesbian, bi, non-binary, etc. come up about as often as “straight” or heterosexual, which is nearly never.  If a person wants to identify with one of those terms because they feel it describes them the best, and they personally ask me to when describing them to others. this does not trigger me emotionally.

I try to put myself in their shoes and wonder what that is like and move on with my day. We can choose to be decent or not to the people in our lives. If not wanting to use a word is good enough reason to disassociate yourself from them, I just can’t relate to that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think that unless you have a drastic change in your interest (like, I always loved creative expression and eventually settled upon music because I am apparently good with my instrument and I write) and go from one general passion to an entirely different sort of thing altogether (but you can always be MOST passionate about that one thing, and always incorporate other things into your life and be more well-rounded, y'know) but... I think you will be different by 30, but not in the way I mentioned if you've already got a decent head on your shoulders. You'll simply become a better version of yourself. 

More confident, less self conscious about the things you like and your unique quirks and more general self acceptance of the things about you, both amazing and maybe not as conventionally impressive at a glance. Like a lot of people say, you start to give much less of a fuck in general. Whether that's due to an unconfident ""resignation of your fate/place in life"" or a confident acceptance of what or who you are, I guess that boils down to the individual and the path that they've walked or how far they have to go to reach that point, if they ever do. 

I think most of the changes will simply be improvements upon the foundation of the self that you realized early on in life, rather than a complete shift in what makes you you. Your values will likely be roughly the same, maybe with more nuance. I think that values are more malleable/prone to change anyway. 

I think that a more self-assured young person wouldn't really let any external information (that they don't already read and agree with deep down in their gut) drastically change or influence the path that they decided to walk upon. It certainly didn't influence me unless I decided that the influence was positive. Nothing ever really made me second guess the general things that I've chose to focus on in my life thus far, and I'm anywhere from halfway to roughly a third done with my life as it is. lol.",1722470504.0

"BuyItForLife","t5_2ss1q","Hey I mean, some of my nicest stuff was cheap AF when I got it, and then I kinda just modded it/replaced parts or upgraded it during repair until it’s now way nicer than when I got it.

Like I have an outdoorsy looking “rustic” wood table that I never thought to treat or oil — I just assumed it would stand up.  All of the wood started splitting and creaking, so I had to like, *literally ship of theseus* swap parts out, one plank at a time, and properly oil and treat the wood so it wouldn’t rot out in the elements.

Now it’s like, functionally a big handcrafted natural-stained wood dinner table, which I would have never been able to afford if I had wanted somebody to
Like, build for me from scratch.

And, because I was just like, swapping out planks, replacing the nails, and like re-gluing everything back in, like I didn’t have to do any design or difficult woodworking stuff to get there.  Just like, swapped out and slowly upgraded parts.  I actually learned that the whole thing was hollow when some boards tore off the legs, but like, I’ve now spent enough time fixing up the legs, I have a clear idea of how I could make things even more solid by gluing together a bunch of 2x4s if I really wanted to.

That all is to say, I’m kinda glad I’ve gotten some aesthetic but crappier stuff, because I’ve learned how to like, cop the designs and schematics, and can now re-create them with nicer, more affordable raw materials, one chip at a time

But, totally acknowledge that tons of stuff can’t be done like that.",1722470504.0

Progression as in the common meaning of moving forward over time.  

I don't know much about the differences between his federal and provincial allegiances and views, but at the time, they were usually in sync.  I also don't know when, exactly, his views changed.

But if you're arguing for the conservatism of late 19th and early 20th century in BC, most of society, including most conservatives, have progressed on from that.  Women even got the vote!

Conservatives had a lock on BC politics over four elections from 1903 (when the first BC political party was formed, the Conservative Party) to 1916.  Before 1903, the province was usually leaning in a conservative direction on matters of race, gender, and economy, with Liberals mainly focused around democratic representation and some social issues.  Labour and social democrats, and the further left, were present, but still nascent.

Cooksley likely didn't change his views for opportunism, but for principle.  In 1912, the Liberals lost every seat.  He died in 1913, so he didn't live to see the resignation of long-time Conservative Premier Richard McBride, or the election of the Liberal Party in BC in 1916.

By 1916, it wasn't just people like Cooksley.  The Conservatives were crushed - a large swathe of the BC population embraced new more liberal views

The Liberals pursued their program of votes for women, ending political corruption and favoritism in the civil service, labour laws and workers compensation, addressing the economy by tackling the large railway debt and developing the Okanagan fruit industry to diversify the economy and the food supply, with the South Okanagan Lands Project.  There was also the beginnings of a legislated 8 hour work day, and a minimum wage (for women in some industries).

So yeah, progress in both the old and modern meanings of the word, economic and social.

The Liberals would later introduce Mother's Pensions, support for abandoned women, and improvements to health care and social services.

Not to sugarcoat:  there were Liberal improvements related to indigenous people, issues of race were still serious but not at the level of the Conservative governments, and long-time Premier Oliver generally saw poverty as a failure to work hard, or to become a settler.  Why were all those soldiers returning to their own families and homes, complaining about unemployment, instead of just going and being fruit settlers in the Okanagan like he had arranged?

The Liberals overcame the Conservatives to such an extent, that they became the naturally governing party until their election loss in 1952 to social credit.

When talking about the late 19th early 20th century in BC, Cooksley's time, particularly under the Conservative Party, yes, it's fair to say there has been development since then, and development in people's views.  Other than one more election victory in 1928 for the Conservatives, the right in BC and the ""free enterprise coalition"" generally turned its back on core policies of the McBride Conservatives.  Coalescing around the BC version of the Progressive Conservatives, then Social Credit, then the BC Liberals.  Federal Conservatives abandoned any affiliation with the BC Conservative Party.  The Conservative party name itself in BC politics was anathema, a political death knell for social and economic conservatives,  until developments in just recent months that might manifest in this Fall's elections.  But this reconstituted BC Conservatives, and it's tiny predecessors prior who never quite disappeared completely, likely will not pursue every policy of the BC Conservatives of earlier British Columbia.",1722470506.0

I always hated school. It got more difficult as time went on because I have some different learning style. I quit going to school when I was 16. Ended up bullshitting my way through the GED exam, passed with ease, just so I could have some document that showed I wasn't a complete degenerate or something. I'm 30 now, I just realized I am on the autism spectrum, recently was put under more stress than I could handle and got burned out. Now I'm jobless. Over 10 years of working hard with solid work ethic and attendance and loyalty to the two companies I worked for got me nowhere. Feels like the world is not made for or catered to people like me. I have this different way of learning and understanding things. Nature fascinates me. Physical science is incredible. But I learn hands on, by going out and really seeing things in action. I don't want to sit in a classroom.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","If you want polyamory, RUN. Agreeing with u/socialjusticecleric on this and I will get back to why in a sec.

If you want monogamy, the easier answer is to do it with someone else, for the reasons so many other people have stated - someday, when you think everything is fine, he'll be out there telling the next you that they're the only one who *really* understands, and whether he believes that or is just trying to hook them. For sex, for validation, for a safe place to monkey branch should something happen, for something to do with a bunch of unexpected free time, for a way not to pay a therapist - why hardly matters because it always sucks for you.

If you really want monogamy and *this guy*, you do you, but I would walk, and tell him that when he's fully separated, and has no one in his life who won't support the two of you in monogamy, you *might be*  up for starting again. From zero. Not from wherever you are now. Because knowing someone as your secondary in polyamory (and seeing they don't want it and are a bad partner to your meta and to you) doesn't demonstrate they can be a good monogamous boyfriend, much less that they can be a good life partner since that takes more vetting. So no, he can't come crash at your place and not leave, that's crazy talk. He can get his own place and invite you on proper dates and to spend time with his people over a reasonable time frame while you consider it. And if he takes too long you might end up back in case 2, in a mono relationship with someone with less baggage.

Okay, so why? Here's the thing, I have gotten pretty good over almost 30 years at reading people's actual desire for polyamory. And if this guy is truthful, which is the only case that matters, he doesn't want any polyamory. It's been a tool to avoid leaving his incompatible relationship. Once he does that, if he ever does, he won't want polyamory. (He still won't be honest if he ever decides to monkey branch or collect affair partners of the physical or emotional flavors, but the part where *you* get with other people, he doesn't like *that*.) This whole thing is an unintentional or not spin up to hoping he can get more pity sex, more emotional support, more investment, and maybe even argue ""but we can be (sexually) exclusive"" while he has a whole ass life partner so he doesn't have to use condoms. And, most importantly, so he doesn't have to worry about you moving on to someone who offers more of a relationship and only expects fairness. Those are all fundamentally monogamous states of mind, that are incredibly selfish given the actual reality. So the solution is to get out of the mess to the place you want to be, wherever that is, and stop being his bandaid that enables his tragic mess to continue. See if he fixes his shit then, or if he just looks for someone else who buys into it.

I'm sorry. But seriously, if you stick around, keep your eyes open and consider these things again in a few months with more evidence.",1722470507.0

Right out of high school, oh, say, 40 years ago, I got a job in a beverage warehouse as an order picker. We drove powered pallet jacks and picked orders for grocery stores, sometimes 25 pallets worth of stacked cans. My supervisor was a guy that had been there forever and the 3rd thing out of his mouth upon meeting him was to never stack Mountain Dew more than 20 rows high. We were allowed to stack all types of canned beverages 24 rows high, except Mountain Dew, which was only allowed 20 rows high. The reason? Mt. Dew has so much sugar in it, it is heavier than most beverages and stacking higher than 20 rows risked crushing the cans on the bottom.

I worked there for about 3 months when another new guy started, he was a bit of a know-it-all and didn’t listen to anyone. He overstacked a pallet of Dew once and the bottom row collapsed while he was lifting it into a shelf.

It's hard for me to envision a scenario where I would have had been better off not disclosing, as I think she would have grown more frustrated with me without any context as to what I'm trying to manage.

I don't plan to leave my job, but will if I feel things start getting worse. I suppose I'm looking for ways in which I might be able to address this now, giving her the benefit of the doubt and the chance to self-correct.

But I also don't want to come across as trying to get out of things, you know? I'm willing to do almost anything asked of me, and I've never told her ""no"" in the 5 years I've been there. But, if anything, I'd like her to stop pushing me to do things simply for the sake of ""anxiety,"" if that's what's actually happening. 

I don't feel I'd be able to effectively discuss the issues with her on my own, but I also prefer that we don't turn it into a whole big thing with HR. Because I'm NOT trying to accuse her of discrimination.",1722470508.0

"reactivedogs","t5_3jbj2","I guess what I am trying to say (and this may be an unpopular opinion), people can still be supportive of rescue and rehab without wanting to encounter dogs in public that make them feel unsafe - personally, that does not make that person a bad advocate for adoption or rescue which comes in many different forms. It feels a bit gatekeep-y to say ""if you support rescue you must support reactive behaviours"".

I definitely would have felt differently about your post if you hadn't used the catch all title ""rescue dogs"" if you're specifically talking about shelter intake, that's an entirely niche system and I agree is very stressful and difficult for dogs, especially council pounds are just awful places and I really feel for the dogs within them - but a shelter is not the only form of rescue/rehab. And without passing any judgement on you or your org, shelters are where I see some of the most concerning and dangerous placements of dogs who are immense community risks ('no kill' shelters are absolute shit shows in my area, and I say this as someone who's first hound was from a NKS). 

>It’s not expecting people to accommodate the reactive dog, it’s expecting people to know the bare minimum about dog reactivity to know how to diffuse the situation for the safety of their dog too.

I just think this level of expectation on the general public is too high and will only set you up to fail. If you need something specific, just ask for it, don't expect people to somehow have an inherent knowledge of dog behaviour, or the individual requirements of your dog.",1722470509.0

"wichita","t5_2r4wk","People who say there's nothing to do in Wichita either have never been here, or they can't be bothered to get out of their mom's basement and expect every second of their lives to be planned out for them by somebody else. If they learned how to use this magical device called ""The Internet,"" between Google searches, Wichita message board, and Facebook events, they'd discover there's *tons* of stuff to do. Any given day of the week, there's an exhibit, a show, an experience, a park, a sport, or something else to see, do and participate in.

True, Wichita doesn't have natural attractions like mountains or oceans. But as somebody who lived in those places, I'm gonna let you in on a secret: the people who actually live in places like that never actually do those things anyway. Similarly, the people who live in those places? They tend to do the same things that *everybody* does for entertainment: go out to eat and drink with friends, have and go to parties, have hobbies.

Wichita is great. In terms of day to day living, you can't beat the cost of living. The food scene is excellent. The music scene is growing. If you want a reasonable gym membership, you don't need a fancy gym (though we have them) because our YMCAs are brand new and the system-wide membership can't be beat. We have a professional minor league baseball team and hockey team.We have an arena football team.We have a professional indoor soccer team. If college sports are your jam, Wichita State is the biggest of three four-year universities in town. If you want to take classes for a degree, or just to audit for fun, you can. We have several large public parks, and a good public pool system. We have two zoos. If you have little kids, Exploration Place and Tanganyika are your jam. If live theater is what you want, take your pick from Music Theatre Wichita, Wichita Community Theatre, The Roxy, Mosely Street Melodrama and Prairie Pines Playhouse. If sports are what you're after, Wichita Parks and Rec has a robust adult rec league for softball, soccer and flag football. On any given night, there is live music at WAVE, Barleycorn's, Kirby's. If live stand up is your thing, hit up Vorshay's Lounge. We have one of the Top 10 film festivals in North America (by Filmmaker Magazine and USA Today). We have two opera companies. Or check out any of the museums and paddocks on the river, including Wichita Art Museum, Cow Town, The Indian Center and Botannica. If you're a foodie, golly, take your pick! Wichita is a Top 10 nationwide test market for chains, and also has a strong local restaurant game that - per capita - is on par with a lot of big cities.

As for schools, Wichita public schools are *excellent*, with multiple magnet programs including the prestigious International Baccalaureate program at East High.",1722470510.0

"mindmapping","t5_2rdnk","…I congratulate you on your successful application of the Koi method to prime your attention before lectures; that sounds like a really effective way to deepen the quality of your learning. You said:

> “this method works decently for me as I tend to use this to prime my brain before lectures. I have noticed that I am actually able to pay a greater amount of attention in class. The problem arises between different lectures where I am very unsure as to how I am supposed to take all that I have learned in the mind map of one lecture and connect it to a different lecture.”

When you say “take all that I have learned in the mind map of one lecture”, I take it that you are receiving lecture notes in advance of the lecture, mind mapping them, attending the lecture, and then …? Do you go back after the lecture and add to or annotate the mind map in any way? This is what I would do in this situation, and also for the situation of trying to revisit mind maps of old conversations or video content. Look, on some level there’s always going to be some friction needed to spin these topics back up in your mind. But as I discovered with my mind map journal and you’re discovering with your Koi maps, sometimes the meanings behind the nodes and images can be so tricky to retrieve that it hardly seems worth the effort. 

I think it is possible to keep old mind maps useful if every time you revisit them, you add some written notes pointing out gaps in the information you see, or tailored to help you get back into the flow of it faster next time. One of the cool things about studying something over time is being able to express it in increasingly concise language, which is value you can add to your mind maps through annotation every time you do the mental work to reenter its cognitive space.

Another value you can add is interconnecting them with your other archived & annotated mind maps (your first question.) I’m assuming you’re doing mind maps either on paper or on a tablet like Koi so I will attempt to advise for those cases. If they’re on paper, I recommend tagging them using something like the original Zettelkasten address system ([https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#the-fixed-address-of-each-note](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#the-fixed-address-of-each-note)) This allows you to include a two-way link to another mind map with any annotation you place on a mind map. 

Whenever you want to “spin up” the linked map for your study session, just place it side by side. For the third, make a rough triangle. For the fourth, a rectangle. The fifth, a pentagon. And so on. For content placed in a circular or near-formation, the distance the eyes need to travel between any two pairs is never more than the circle’s diameter. And any content you place in the center of that circle is (roughly) equally a radius-length away from everything else. What I’m trying to describe is a kind of mind map desktop layout that would be optimized for helping you make connections between whatever you choose to place along the circumference of that circle (or TO whatever’s in its center.) You could tape them on the wall this way, or lay’em out and take a picture. If you’re using a tablet app, maybe export them as images onto a whiteboard app like Miro or Figma. These programs have the advantage that you can make add visual links between map annotations in the program.

It seems to me that if you had a bunch of Koi-style maps arranged like this relevant to a big project or exam coming up, write down a bunch of keywords from all of them to put through the Koi method, take a long walk, and write down your thoughts when you return you’d probably have a great idea for tying it all together in 1-3 mind maps (ideal to study in the center of the circle archive).

Here is a simple technique for applying the circle’s bias for interconnection within a single diagram, which you might find helpful for its own sake or for understanding the archive layout I was talking about above: [https://untools.co/connection-circles/](https://untools.co/connection-circles/)

I hope some of these ideas can help you. Like I said, I struggle with this stuff myself so please understand I can’t offer you a guided tour through the best combinations of methods for you. You’ve really got to lean on your own canniness there.",1722470510.0

"uxcareerquestions","t5_2wbws","I studied UX and UI online out of BrainStation's Florida office in Spring 2024.  My time in their program was fraught with challenges, and I believe it’s important to outline what went wrong:

**1. Conveyor Belt Approach:** It increasingly felt like BrainStation operates more like a factory, churning out students without genuine regard for their learning process or success. The focus appeared to be on maximizing enrollment and revenue rather than providing a meaningful educational experience. This approach was demoralizing and made it seem like students were just another number to be processed.

**2. Double Standards and Punctuality Problems:** Students are required to maintain 90% attendance, yet instructors frequently showed up 5-15 minutes late or ran over their lecture times. This inconsistency was frustrating and undermined the integrity of the program.

**3. Rushed Lectures and Unreliable Sessions:** Lectures were often extremely rushed, with little opportunity for interactive discussion. Sessions were also unreliable due to missed or delayed lectures and technical issues that affected the delivery.

**4. Lack of Encouragement for Creative and Critical Thinking:** The program does not foster a creative approach or encourage critical thinking. Instead, it often emphasizes rote learning and strict adherence to predetermined methods, which stifles innovation and personal growth.

**5. Discrepancies in Professionalism:** Instructors frequently failed to meet the standards they set for students. Their preparation for lectures was often inadequate, leading to disruptions and delays, which felt disrespectful to our time.

**6. Negative Impact on Student Experience:** The overall environment felt passive-aggressive, and the promises of support often fell short. Many students, including myself, felt that the program did not live up to its claims of providing a supportive learning experience.

**Conclusion:** The program is massively overpriced, and my experience has convinced me that prospective students should consider other, more reputable institutions or alternative learning methods. BrainStation's focus on profit over quality and support undermines the value of their educational offerings and does not encourage a creative or critical approach to learning.

If you’re considering BrainStation, please take these factors into account. My hope is that sharing my experience will help others make a more informed decision.

That's why dating disproportionately happens via dating apps nowadays, because simply being present on there signals that you must be looking for something, which means you're fair game. I think different dating apps are geared towards different types of relationships, I heard Bumble and Hinge have a reputation for being a little less casual/hookup focused, whereas apps like Tinder and Feeld are more about getting laid.

Not to say you couldn't do it without dating apps, but in that case you'll either have to show more initiative or somehow make yourself appear more receptive/interested.",1722470510.0

"Fedexers","t5_2au4lz","Just from this past week experience as a swing driver, I got put on a route I never done before with 110 stops, that started at 6:15am for sort, left the building at 8:30am, got done around 5:20pm (Monday) Next day, same route, half the stops, however I have a pickup route. Started 6:30am for sort, left the building around the same time of 8:30am, got done with route around 2pm, started pickup route in a different area, done at 5:30pm. Today, on a completely different route that has an attached pickup route, 6:15 for sort, left around 8:30am, got back to the building at 5:50pm. Rinse and Repeat for tomorrow.

That is a Swing Driver Life. If you get a route, You will probably start early to help out with the sort at some compacity, but you will be back a lot earlier since you will not have a pick up route or a route that you are learning on the fly. 

I do have a family, I like to be home before 5pm at the latest, hence why I'll switching over to a regular route soon as one has opened up for me to bid on. I would get foot in door if you really want to pursue this type of career and wait until a regular route opens up.

I was at this game! I remember vividly: it was my first NBA game and my brother and I were obsessed with Kobe. Pops came home with some tickets after we’d been begging for weeks after hearing the Lakers would be in town, this was before everyone in PDX wore purple and yellow too, haha. Anyways, I specifically remember my dad excitedly showing us the tickets and telling us that it was going to be the last regular season game for the Blazers while the Lakers were continuing on for the playoffs. We had absolute nosebleed seats but were so ecstatic to see Kobe, it didn’t matter. I actually remember being so far back that the seats had binoculars, lmao. Seeing Shaq twice the size of a referee throw the binocular lenses is something I’ll never forget, not to mention the snow cones and popcorn we all got to make up for how far back we sat.

ANYWAYS

Years later I came across this video, I’m talking like a full decade later. I thought I had seen every single Kobe highlight/buzzer beater/compilation out there, but I guess not. I believe this series of plays was considered #2 in HIS BEST CAREER PLAYS, against my hometown Blazers, and I had never seen it, what?! Watching that video and hearing the announcer talk about how it was the last game of the regular season is what triggered the recall of my experience at this game.

All I remember is leaving at the midway point of the fourth quarter because my dad wanted to beat the traffic rush and “the game was over, anyways.”

If I were going to spray the tree....the pollinator issue would be much more of a problem, but this is systemic.  We had a large apple tree when we first moved and is got fire blight (I think it actually had it prior to us moving in).  Our area is very prone to fire blight and the previous owners didn't seem to understand the need for a blight resistant tree. There isn't a whole lot you can do for fire blight once it takes over a tree and we ended up having to cut it down to prevent further spread of blight.  We replanted with three blight resistant apple trees (all pollinators of each other), and they aren't even half the size of the big apple tree we used to have.  It's been 8 years.

It's an ETF that start at around 50.00$ at the beginning of the month. It slowly goes up during the month. At the end of the month, it resets back to 50.00$. Those who had shares at the ends get paid interest. If you sell at a ''loss'', you still got interest. For example, you bought at the 50.10$, sell at 50.00$ and got its interest (0,195$). Did you made a 0,10$ lost? Nope, you made a 0,095$ profit. 

If you bought [CASH.TO](http://CASH.TO) at 50.10$, you will be negative when its cycle reset at 50$. You still will get the interest payment and you will see a ''profit'' when the price reach 50.11$. 

If you never want to see a lost, you must always buy it on ex dividend date (beginning). It's logical. If the price stayed flat, then everyone would buy it at the end of month and sell it at the beginning of the month.

You should definitely read about this and think before buying ETFs, dividend stocks, dividend ETF, stocks etc.

""God doesn't care about drugs.""

Why would god care about drugs, we have free will. 

The god I experienced wasn't some robed dude with a beard on a throne, telling me what I can or cannot do. Rather, it was realization of being part of the indestructible, intransmutable universal consciousness and unconditional love permeating every quanta of creation.

""Cognitive liberty is our birthright.""

How is it not? See above.

""God and science are not mutually exclusive.""

Well, I have a neuroscience background, and there is zero conflict with my beliefs. Why would there be?

Life doesn't work that way.  If someone is pointing a gun at me, and there is a hammer nearby and I firmly believe that smashing his face in with said hammer gives me a better chance at living then running away, then I'm gonna cave his head in.

"MalzaharMains","t5_38tna","I played this season between plat and dia. My take on this is that sometimes if the enemy is good he waits till you w and clear them + wave or tank your e when it bounces cause he has second wind/refill. In general often ppl play with this knowledge very aggressive which is hard for Malzahar in the early stages. In dia at least jng understand this and help/punish such behaviour but in lower elo ppl often lose lanes cause the king won't come and they do bad trades (which are good in higher elos).

In general: Just focus on your farm and get asap chapter. After that and with lvl 7-9 you can clear most waves pretty fast. Remember you don't always be the one who does everything. Sometimes it's enough to just farm, scale and prevent the enemy mid to roam by clearing waves which are coming to your tower + warding",1722470511.0

"Controller","t5_2xla3","For the price i think there's nothing better, it became my favourite controller, my only problem is how loud fast d-pad movements can get.
It doesn't ""feel"" particularly excellent on the hands plastic wise, it feels like a decent quality plastic, nothing more. It's like anbernic/retroid handheld plastic.

The texture on the shoulder buttons and triggers are decent.

The thumbsticks and buttons are excellent, they feel like high quality light and mostly quiet mouse clicks.

I really loved the adjustable tension of the sticks, it can get very light and pretty heavy, the trigger both analog and digital are very nice, it almost feel cushioned, the dpad is very responsive, light and clicky, albeit very loud.
The back buttons are easy to press and require medium pressure to press.
I'm not a fan of the ""C"" and ""Z"" buttons ""click"", they are quite heavier than the other face buttons, very similar to the back buttons, while i love the extra buttons and the customization they provide, i don't enjoy too much how they feel, but overall I still like them, the extra 6 buttons was a deciding factor for my purchase. 
In short: Yes, the controller is excellent in most areas, and for the price, i doubt there's anything better. It's only the plastic quality that i didn't like too much, but i think they are on par with the ds4/xbox one/ 8bitdo ultimate controllers.",1722470512.0

It's like we're all in this big cosmic circle jerk, cumming hand-in-hand together in harmony, and I find that beautiful. 

  

Reject AI art, my friends. The computer knows nothing of the lust for the monster girl. The computer has no dreams of running its fingers through the silky fur of the werewolf, or of feeling the powerful but gentle hugs of the muscular demon. The computer means to take your dreams, to cheaply render them into a shallow husk of the beauty you hold in our heart. Your dreams deserve the love of those who share them, not the cold metallic embrace of a machine's thoughtless mimicry. 

  

Rise up, friends. Unburden yourselves from the shackles of AI. Become one with the lust of thy neighbor and let us all cum fiercely together in staunch defiance of the lifeless imitation of humanity that we face today. Be free, my friends. Be free.",1722470512.0

"Ratschlag","t5_4cv0iv","Immer wenn ich als 16-jähriger so etwas lese fühle ich mich bestätigt in ""ich trinke kein Alkohol"".

Viele von meinen Freunden trinken, einige mehr und andere weniger, aber wenn ich dann gefragt werde warum ich nicht trinke und ich sage ""das kann süchtig machen"" o.ä. wird gesagt ""ja ich trinke ja auch nur manchmal und nur für die Wirkung"". Ich kann dann ja auch schlecht allen sagen dass sie nicht trinken sollen, irgendwie muss ich ja einigermaßen normal wirken wenn ich schon nicht trinke. Aber auch teilweise erwachsene fragen mich warum ich nicht trinke, was ich dann irgendwie schon komisch finde. Ich bin mir selber einfach bewusst und wenn ich sowas dann lese, wo das in 10 Jahren hinführen kann und dann auch nur sehr selten mit guter Einsicht wie bei dir endet, dann fange ich lieber gar nicht erst an, auch wenn alle anderen trinken/rauchen etc. Wenn sie mich deswegen als Freund ausschließen war es eh der falsche Kreis würde ich sagen.

Ich bin einfach froh dass im Internet jetzt so viele davon berichten und sagen ""hätte ich nur niemals angefangen"", leider lesen das zu wenige",1722470512.0

Every time I eat even a small amount of wheat it's anxiety and racing thoughts a few hours later....then I get other symptoms the next day. 

Not everyone who is affected by it has all symptoms. But the list of possibilities includes anxiety, depression, fatigue, joint pain, muscle pain, digestive pain, digestive upset, and skin rash. From that list, what I usually get is the anxiety and skin rash and abdopain if it's one isolated exposure. If it's ongoing exposure then I also get fatigue and depression. But it just varies from person to person.

Some people are affected by airborne toxins in the same way, like synthetic fragrance.

"Sikh","t5_2rfo4","My personal opinion, but i think in recent times, sarbat khalsa has failed to fulfill its purpose, and i even know the reason for it. 1984 sarbat khalsa resolution was for khalistan, which failed badly. 2015 sarbat khalsa replaced akaal takht jathedar to hawara, which also failed. 

The reason is our own darkness, we need to be less emotional and more practical in nature. I reject the idea of having khalistan before having khalsa. No matter what we do, a half awakened or rather sleeping panth(in darkness) will not help sikh panth achieve what Guru maharaj wants us to achieve. 

Right issues, right demands and right leadership and not most important, right khalsa sangat will get us what we want and deserve as a panth.",1722470512.0

It cones from wider factors. I can't really put it into words but, the ""vibes"" of a project and who's making it determine if something gonna get hate and after release, how it's done will determine if the hate continues or fizzles away. 

Like that new game coming ""Concord"" everything about it reeks of box ticking, no heart, no vision, chasing trends with character designs one would find on 2015 Tumblr to make a quick buck via Blackrock ESG points to get bots to funnel investment money their way. 

Compare this to say, Miles Morales, very quickly after the first comics came out it was firmly established that not only was Miles his own character, but he's someone who idolised Peter Parker and wanted to follow in his footsteps, not replace him or prove himself as better. There was a lot of hate for this character when he was first announced then pretty soon after the first few comics came out it died down and the same ppl who hated him warmed up to him. 

One is mindless corporate box ticking slop pushed by elitist, racist, sexist, disconnected harpies on behalf of their corporate overlords, The other is actually fleshed out characters made by people who have a vision.

when a story is more concerned with virtue signaling, surface level political messaging, and identity politics, it’s clear that’s the issue with the plot. Plus the creative team will use those politics as a shield for criticism of their mediocre writing",1722470513.0

Servers are running on the bare minimum for security reasons. They are certainly not going to allow you to install an AI assistant, much less one that calls out to a web service just to auto-complete bash commands for you. In fact, that's really dangerous and would never be allowed.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","The comment about giving a hug is the first I saw that really spoke to me.

The clear issue here is open and honest communication, some of it with the two (or at minimum the poster) not fully aware of their own feelings / motivations behind what they are saying and doing.

When having a serious conversation about sexual stuff that can easily get emotional, that physical touch is important. When the poster said he was hurt, out of the mood, and quietly thinking, that was the time to say, “I’m sorry honey. Can we just cuddle for s minute while I think and process about this?” Then he would have time to sort through his thoughts before speaking again.

The putting on clothes and walking away is a huge missed opportunity to run toward the problem rather than away from it. His / their reaction will lead to more problems in the relationship going forward. The honest answers on both sides need to be respected but the communication needs to continue, not end.

The next / future communications need to come from that place where they both want to do their best for the other while respecting themselves. In this case, he may not get BJs, or at least not often and he need to be okay with it because he hopefully loves her more than just for one sexual act.",1722470513.0

Unemployment, food stamps, public school, the DMV all just make a little more sense and operate smoother. No whackos are going to ban what your children will read in school. I grew up in a small town in Southern Illinois but live on the east coast now. It used to be passively republican but obviously the Trump years made that less so.

If you are F or an playing an F character:
You arrive at the women only resort you booked.(continue with ""For both"" paragraph)

For both: 
As to expect at a women only resort, there a lots and lots of Female guests. (Depends on what you prefer: Only humans or also species like Catgirls, Slimegirls, Elves, other fantasy stuff,...) You get your Suitcase from the plane and make your way over to the welcome desk...

So much for the setting, now some technical stuff: You will meet as many women as you want in this RP, however I will only play as one at a time, please keep that in mind. You can either provide me a list of girls / women you want to be part of this RP (Pic plus, if its a character from Anime, Video games etc. Their name) Or just play it like ""I see Rias Gremory over at the pool and approach her"", but, since i dont know every anime and game in existence, you will also have to send a pic of that character as you introduce them to the rp.
Also, if you mention the character wearing a specific wristband thats the band they are going to wear, if you dont mention it, i will choose one myself.
This Rp is an optional noncon setting, because lots of women, no police on the island... you know, things happen, but if you want we can also play this as either some or even all women liking it, I'm fine with all of that

"probation","t5_2ro5w","Oh ya, I’ve probably failed more drug tests than I’ve passed. There was a few times, when I was getting towards the end of my rope, where I wouldn’t even bother waiting to fail, I’d walk right in my PO’s office and be like “no need to drug test me, I just shot some dope about 1/2 hour before walking in here” I had a pretty shitty attitude about all of it tho, I had this way in my fucked up brain, that I thought I was gonna do things, and make things happen and when you’re an addict you think you’re WAY smarter than everyone, and you think nobody sees you “shooting a move” as we call it here in Detroit. And I really didn’t have anything in my life that was worth a shit, I had burned all those bridges long before that, so I didn’t really give a shit about having to sit down(in jail)for a few weeks or a month or whatever, sure being dope sick sucks, but I was strong willed and wasn’t going to bend over for these Pricks(was my attitude) I’d rather go sit in jail for a weekend, than do what they told me to do. Few times I used it as a vacation, or a “quick clean out if I absolutely had to get clean for a few days, once to even hide from a Dopeman I had ripped off for like 1000$ and everyone on the streets was telling me he was looking for me, and was probably going to merk me over it. Motherfucker ain’t gonna come get me in jail!!! I actually had one PO told me straight up “I’m sick of you, I’m sick of your shitty attitude, I’m sick of having to fill out paperwork on you……you have 4 months left on Probation, and I never want to see you again, I’m not going to drug test you anymore, because there’s no point,(hadn’t passed one yet) all I need you to do show up once a month here for the next 3 months, and don’t catch ANY new charges.” And he absolutely kept his word, I came in, signed my name, he would literally look at me when he was coming out to get the next person in line, and just be like “OK Voodoo, I’ll see you next month” he didn’t even bother taking me back to his office anymore, few months later I got the Release from Probation paperwork in the mail, and I’ve never seen him again. He was actually pretty cool tho, he had the same disease that Andre the Giant had, so he was probably one of the biggest men I’ve ever seen in my life, absolute fucking Giant. Probably close to 7 ft tall, and 4-450lbs, I have a different friend who’s 6’ 8” and he weighs like 320, and he’s not even big, he’s built like a normal person, just really tall. My PO was thick AND tall. After I got clean, and started really looking back on my life, I understand why they are the way they are, and it’s just like anything else, it’s a job they have to do, many probably don’t even like it. I was the asshole for acting the way I did, I was an Addict who didn’t care about anyone or anything except myself, and how I was gonna get my next fix. I NEVER in a million years thought my life could or ever would be as good as it is now. I have a wonderful wife, and children(she came as a “ready made” family, which I’m totally cool with anyway, I wouldn’t want to bring any children into this fucked up world anyway), I’ve been raising them both as my own for 12 years, they are 13 and 16 now, I have a great job, that I love, and went to school for, but simply couldn’t do well while I was getting high. I have an amazing Hobby(keeping and working with highly venomous snakes) that I’ve ALWAYS wanted to learn, but who in Gods green earth is going to teach a dope fiend, that can barely keep their eyes open half the time, how to work with animals where the first mistake can cost you/them/someone their life or limb. Just SO many possibilities, that I never imagined were possible, opened up to me once I got, and stayed clean. 20 years ago I would have told you that I couldn’t even imagine a life without heroin/drugs/alcohol, and I expected to be a Dope Fiend until the day I died. Now I can’t imagine what life would be like if I did get high, I stopped having cravings years ago, I don’t even mind seeing someone shooting up on TV or whatever now. It took a while, but life is just totally amazing now, on a different scale, it’s hard to explain unless you’ve been there I guess. I have a way of looking at life and things in general a lot differently now, and honestly I think a lot of that comes from the things I saw, and did over all those years, running the streets, and not caring about anything. That’s not the person I want or choose to be anymore, and it feels really good to be able to make that choice, when I was on drugs, THEY were making the decisions for me, it’s good to not be like that anymore, and I like to share those experiences with others, and let other people, who may be in the exact same place I was 20 years ago, know that IF I can get, and stay clean, anyone can!!!!",1722470514.0

"alcohol","t5_2qi6q","50 years young. Due to age and a long drinking history, my answer will be long.

 I used to down a bottle of wine or a six pack every night for about 2-3 years, also occasionally cocktails. Then, I used to down a bottle of wine AND a six pack every night for 4-5 years along with the aforementioned cocktails.

After that, I found a comfortable watering hole and I'd down around 6 liters (110 oz.) plus whatever I'd down at home. Usually, a couple more beers and a couple shots or another bottle of wine. That was around an 8 year span.

I changed jobs, and my drinking subsided -- some.
I'd  have 2-3 beers or cocktails a night 4 nights a week and binge 2 nights with 1 sober day. As time went on the sober days increased. This was about 5 years. 

I'm now on a new phase. I drink one or two a night on average (by average I mean, some days 2, some days nothing. I have extended periods of no drinking -- 10, 15, 30 days). I'm happier. I'm happier because of many things, drinking less is one.

*Lessons learned:

* Don't drink your feelings. 
* Drinking makes you sleep like shit.
* Drinking can make you fat (I was 180lbs, now 290 after losing 50lbs).
* I can lose weight or drink, not both.
* Also, DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE! I did this for years with luckily no consequence, but it is irresponsible. 

Just my experience. I hope someone gets something from it.

"ProgressionFantasy","t5_x7vh9","Rising from the Abyss. There isn't much magic in the beginning, but there is a lot of martial training.

There are a lot of small scale military tactics later on, with some genuine tactics and real consequences. Not the usual platitudes and generic basics or mistaken beliefs expressed in a 'me smart' way that you usually see. Very fun to read.

Then when they get to magic, eventually, the magic is actually very science based. Spells create materials that react to generate explosives etc. and they go into a lot of detail. Entire chapters are dedicated to lessons. Sometimes the mc and his friends even experiment to create specific colors of flames and the like, or mix different spells in unusual ways for specific reactions.

"NarutoPowerscaling","t5_7a1yls","> The more years that pass the stronger Momo and Kin get...? So it kinda makes things worse for her as time goes on. 

Not necessarily because it depends on the fruits they eat and how they evolve. 

> the story makes it very clear she's afraid of them and doesn't think she'd win. 

What are those beliefs based upon though? The claim that she is correct in her assessment assumes that she knows about their power levels. So the positive claim is actually assuming that. 

The alternative interpretation of her beliefs (based on ranks) are more supported by feats. 

> Yeah Kurama is a large amount of chakra that Momo couldn't drain immediately through Naruto resisting him doing so. And arguably Naruto's chakra was also counted in that... This really isn't a power comparison in any real way.

Otsutsuki use chakra pills as power though. 

> So Kaguya would have information thinking they're weaker than they actually are? 

She wouldn't. She would assume based on their initial power levels or ranks. But we as the readers can compare the feats and determine if kaguya was right in her assessment of Momoshiki's powers or not. 

> We have no idea what determines clan ranks, nor do we know if rank alone is what Kaguya was basing her judgement off of. Again this is a burden of proof is against Kaguya moment.

It's not about burden of proof. It's more about which interpretation makes more sense. 

If you question, 'what are kaguya's fears founded upon', you would have to make assumptions. The interpretation that makes the least assumptions which is consistent with the feats is that she based on their initial power levels which might have changed. 

Unless you think darui and kurotsuchi are stronger than juubi madara which makes absolutely no sense. We have 8 gates gai who trains day in and day out and still weaker than juubi madara. No way kages without any sort of kekkei genkai would reach that level.",1722470515.0

"magictricksrevealed","t5_32bw3","Jason is an extremely talented magician.
Takes years of hard work and practice to get to where he is now.

Here are some explanations from my pov.

1. He just stacks the deck but in a way that the stack is prepared somewhere in the middle of the deck.
And yes, he can feel how many cards he's cut. There is a YouTube video where he demonstrates that he can perfectly cut the deck halfway down, and can (by feel) tell how many cards he has cut.
So the secret to this one is just genuine talent and hard work.

2. For the 7 handed poker deck, I believe he's using essentially a variation of ACAAN.
In other words the deck is either stacked in a memorized sequence, or it's just pure stacking skills (again).

3. The casino wash has me wondering as well. No idea how he does that 

4,5. Speechless about the dice and poker chip trick. Genuinely zero ideas.

6. Catching the aces (or just catching cards in general) has been a trending trick. Again, it's just pure skill and yes, he does actually catch 4 cards as they're falling.

7. Same as point 1. It's stacked somewhere in the middle, then cut to that point.

These are just what I suspect, feel free to correct me if I seem to have gotten anything wrong.",1722470515.0

"Doberman","t5_31oi7","They usually shake it out like a dog is want to do. We had two dobermans over the years that swam. One loved it and *lived* for it, the other swam just to get cool and then ducked out. 

So, clearly we are all worried about ""swimmer's ear"" in the summer, whether it's I'm regards to the kids, the dogs, or ourselves. I have the solution. 

Get yourself a plastic bottle shaped like those ketchup and mustard bottles im a diner. Get a little label and write on it ""swimmer's ear solution."" Stick it on the bottle. Then, fill the bottle up with rubbing alcohol and distilled white vinegar. Just half and half. Then shake it up and pour a couple of drops into your ears and massage your ear until you feel it get into that ear canal. Then flip your head, catching the fluid with a kleenex, paper towel, or toilet paper, and fill the other ear. 

Do this every time after you swim, or the kids swim, or the dogs swim. 

The vinegar kills any bacteria that would grow from the pool water, and the alcohol dries it all up. 

Keep the swimmer's ear solution for a lifetime. My pediatrician told my parents about this when I was little, and I only remember refilling the bottle once in my lifetime. Once we started using it, we stopped developing swimmer's ear altogether... going on 40 years.

And yes, we would squeeze some into our dobie's ears and massage it in after a splashy swim fest and then run away while they shook their heads. They never had swimmer's ear either.",1722470516.0

As some other person said, you can take the gondola to Trebevic, then you can hike up to the top of the hill (which isn't too hard honestly) and have a great view of the city and the surrounding nature. Waterfall Skakavac is also really pretty but I usually go via car so I'm not sure how you'd get to the start of the hike to it. Also, before going hiking, check if it's marked well and safe to go. Always stick to the path and don't stray away from it. If you're unsure, better go with a guide since a lot of mountains still have unmarked minefields on them.

The fact that they kicked him out to feed their savior complex doesn’t actually make them even 1% less assholey than if they did it for money. The fact is, after loving this child for 11 years of his life and helping to build him into the man he is today, they tossed that all out the window, to the extent of breaking the law, for the new thing. Whether the new thing is money or self-aggrandizement is besides the point. They still did that to this kid and now the kid has to live with the consequences.

OOP isn’t even close to being the asshole here. At worst, and frankly even this is overstating his “guilt”, he reached the way an 18 year old would react at learning that his family literally threw him out with 4 days to find a new place, and that maybe they didn’t love him so much after all. They didn’t charge him for the televisions though! He has every right to feel angry and sad and betrayed and disillusioned.

It is a tattoo in progress. You can still wear low waist line jeans. How does it affect your SW job at ""ONLYFANS""? Sorry, but that comment is just trying to get you subs.

If you're not happy with it, you have 2 options.....1. Get it removed....2. Have it finished.

I say to go and have it finished. It will be a great piece when finished. BUT, talk to the artist this time. Ask, can they finish it it the time you want or will it take more than 1 sitting. Make sure you have a connection with the artist and feel comfortable with him/her. Do not be afraid to ask questions. Take into account your pain levels. If you can not handle the long sitting and pain, make it several sittings. Have several consultations with the artist and feel comfortable with each other before getting more ink done.

You can see so much along the way, if you ACTUALLY look around.

Locals tend to miss out on it when commuting, because it's same stuff, different day.

Of course, you'll probably end up on the trains for one destination or another - but if you're going to make taking the train part of your experience, Red line gives you both underground and elevated experiences (underground downtown, elevated on both north and south sides of the city) - during off hours, it does get a little sketchy in places.

Must do with a toddler - Lincoln Park Zoo - try to be on the farm side around 11ish for feeding time and petting the goats.  You can easily make the zoo take all day.

Planetarium you can do a walk thru in about 2 hours - if to plan to spend time in the hands on play areas (which are toddler geared), you may want to double that.  I don't think the planetarium shows are best at that age, due to attention span concerns.",1722470518.0

"cissp","t5_2seif","I know what you mean, the other day I saw a LinkedIn post of some CISO passing the exam with only 32hours of prep but over 10 years of CISO experience. 

So the way I think about this is, the certification is to test your critical thinking ability and managerial thought process in a variety of scenarios, where ‘managerial thought process’ = CISSP Mindset and weather we like it or not, the CISSP Mindset seems to be globally recognised and respected in the Cyber Security industry. 

Effectively it’s ’Are you able to make what ISC^2 consider the correct / best decision in a range of different scenarios?’ If you pass the exam then you can use the certificate as validation of your decision making abilities in different scenarios. 

It’s similar to how some companies / employers use degrees to validate if a candidate is applicable for a role or not, because they see the degree certificate as proof or evidence to support your claim of “I know my shit”.",1722470518.0

"Endo","t5_2s8ot","I would focus on asking questions about those things. I totally get being anxious. Just remember that stage doesn't make your pain or symptoms any more or less valid. 

I'm also just salty about stage being used as if it means your experiences are more severe or your knowledge and experiences carry more weight than someone with a lower stage. That's absolutely not true at all and really needs to be less of a talking point in our conversations. I probably only have stage 1 or 2 but I am completely debilitated by pain and can't work. I've had people respond to me saying something like, ""Well I have stage 4 and I can tell you XYZ."" Like can you not wave that around like a cudgel? That means next to nothing to me besides your surgery will take longer than mine. We really need to not engage in oppression and disability Olympics with each other. 

I say all of this based on conversations with my doctor and research she cited to explain her reasoning. Stage is only important for surgeons to know when going to a repeat Lap. That's it. We know imaging is unreliable for endo and we know stage doesn't correlate to pain or symptoms. 

I'll probably get some hate for even stating this.",1722470518.0

"carnivorediet","t5_hpayg","Not at all.

Prior to carnivore, I'd not eaten junk or processed food for over 20 years.

My starting point was an incredibly diverse, ""healthy"" rainbow of all food groups. 

I ate copious amounts of vegetables, lots of meat, fish, dairy, whole grains. I cooked everything from scratch and would pile every meal high with everything that was considered ""ideal health food"". 

I made my own sourdough. I made my own fermented veggies. I bought the best virgin olive oil.   
Our family of three spent at least $700 a week on raw ingredients.   
Our food was diverse and delicious. We loved cooking. We lived to cook.  
We ate nothing pre-made. Ever. Even travelling, we would stock up with raw ingredients and cook.

I've always been extremely fit. Very little body weight. 

But despite this, I was always sick. I always felt like crap. Brain fog, depression, anxiety, fatigue, extreme pain, etc, etc. I was shitting all day long, to the point of bleeding. 

I was CONSTANTLY adjusting our food intake to try to get to the bottom of this issue. Surely vegetables will cure us, surely! I embraced every cuisine. I researched and researched, having this super food and that super food. I was a rainbow eater.",1722470519.0

Will he require a work visa? If so, it may be really difficult to find a job. On the plus side, American pharmacists seem to be the best paid in the world.

"missing","t5_2qnzt","Hi there! Thank you for sharing this post. We understand that finding missing people is a serious matter, and we want to ensure that proper steps are taken. Before posting, please make sure you have contacted the appropriate authorities and filed a missing person report. They have the resources and expertise to help in these situations.

Additionally, we would like to remind you that this community is meant for informational and supportive purposes. We encourage respectful discussions and the sharing of relevant information. Remember to protect the privacy and personal information of the missing individuals and their families.

Here are some authorities you can contact to file missing person reports or provide other relevant information:

1. Local Police Department: Reach out to your local law enforcement agency and provide them with all the necessary details about the missing person.

2. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC): If you are in the United States, you can contact NCMEC at their toll-free hotline: 1-800-THE-LOST (1-800-843-5678). They specialize in cases involving missing children and can provide guidance and support.

4. Missing Persons Helpline: Many countries have dedicated helpline numbers or organizations that assist in locating missing individuals. Check your country's official helpline or missing persons organization for guidance.

5. Ensure you are contacting the authorities for updates periodically, cases sometimes may close if the person reporting does not follow up.

6. Make sure you gather any info possible of locations, areas of interest, etc. for where this missing person will be and update your post accordingly.

"Vocaloid","t5_2rn75","The fact ""I Can Take My Panties Off"" aka ""Pantsu Negeru Mon"" is a song sang by the 14 year old Rin.
Like yeah, she's not real, but they never established that she was any older in the video.

The song is about becoming and maturing to being an adult by taking her panties off, and then when she wants to be a ""child"" and take a break, she will put them back on.

I get making a song about teens and tweens growing up, but why did it have to involve taking garments off?? Dunno.


I also feel a bit standoffish when I see songs that are about sex and drugs sang by Miku, like in Party Junkie or that one song when her 3D self gives Luka head??? (Edit: song found, it's called Kurumi*ponchio but I only mentioned what I said because the [music video](https://youtu.be/fZUy8rmGqY4?si=wDniG0WF-Xk-vljk) I originally saw looked like this, but also the [original one](https://youtu.be/5rhxZc2b9MQ?si=5snbpRDQN4PLfVpZ) Miku looks even younger than 16 talking about putting a ""banana"" to her ""mango"")Given that she's cannonically 16. Or Len in Pitiful Pet Boy. Literally, the artwork suggests he's a ""shota,"" and that's a running joke. Or even that Len is a horny MFKR when he's literally the same entity as Rin.. 14.. 

And like this is totally different when we see songs that are telling stories from the eye of the fly on the wall, and you can replace the characters with someone else or trauma related songs to get the perspective of the story like in Kikuos Gomene Gomene even though it is sad. I don't think anyone is replacing Rin with their ""L*li"" OC in the song and getting away with it without someone saying something ab it.

Honestly, if we're gonna talk about people looking at l*li p//n, then we should be talking about the vocaloid music sang by underage characters when there's no establishment that they're playing an adult roll.
But then again, we have characters like Luka, Kaito, Teto(utauloid but still), Gapuko, Meiko... who either have unofficial ages or are of age that should be used more to talk about these things.

If anyone can give me more perspective on this and tell me I'm crazy I'd appreciate it, but we have songs like the Lolicon song mixed with Gumi and Rin, and I don't see people talking enough about songs like it.
I don't even really know if people are talking about things like this and are also uncomfortable about it.


I mean, I grew up on a lot of these songs, and they didn't really affect me given I've been listening since I was 9 and I'm now 20.
But it's the fact that my child brain was normalized to seeing underage characters being sexualized.
I wouldn't want my kid listening to music about a kid getting violated or being seen in a provocative light.
I guess that's just the way of unmonitored internet.
But don't tell me you wouldn't be weirded out if the guy on the train next to you is listening to ""Pantsu Negeru Mon"" on youtube and you take a glance at their phone and all you see is a child-like character with subtitles talking about taking her panties off.",1722470519

"JonBenetRamsey","t5_2s3pg","IMO it was an accident. The other parent helped to cover it up. There were indications during the autopsy that JBR received prior sexual abuse (3 doctors agreed). There is no way JBR would not tattle on her brother; she was not afraid of him. It would have been someone she was afraid of to never share “their secret”. Someone strong and powerful. Since it was the holidays, I’m sure there were plenty of adult beverages at the White’s party. I’m guessing John miscalculated his strength and things went south. Patsy knew it was an accident, but didn’t want John to go to jail bcuz 1) loss of her income/family/world and 2) her superior image would be extremely tarnished. 3) she was going thru cancer and needed support from her family/circle. John, as you recall, called to arrange a flight to Atlanta that morning for a “business meeting”. A police officer heard him and stopped the call as John was informed he couldn’t go anywhere. His daughter was just “murdered” and he’s claiming he has a business meeting?! From all reports, the Ramseys were not cooperating well with the police. What gets me is that they refused to be interviewed by police months after the killing, and they wanted to be interviewed together and wanted to know the questions before the interview. Like what?!

I have a dear friend who I adore, and I will never forget her excitement when her first Grand baby was born and she wanted to go to VA to meet the baby and help her daughter.  Her daughter who she was/is very close to, said no company what so ever for the first 2 weeks as she wanted her and her DH to bond with the baby first.  My friend was crushed.  That lasted 3 days after she got home and the mom to the rescue call came.

Her son and his wife were the opposite.  Both moms were just in the waiting room for the delivery and they both took turns cooking and cleaning and doing laundry and what ever else needed to be done.

Please don't kill snakes - they are a natural part of the ecosystem and [even species that use venom for prey acquisition and defense are beneficial to humans](https://web.archive.org/web/20180802190346/https://umdrightnow.umd.edu/news/timber-rattlesnakes-vs-lyme-disease). One cannot expect outside to be sterile - if you see a snake you're in or around their preferred habitat. Most snakes are valued and as such are protected from collection, killing or harassment as non-game animals at the state level.

[Neighborhood dogs](https://web.archive.org/web/20210802235642/http://livingalongsidewildlife.com/?p=3141) are more likely to harm people. Professional snake relocation services are often free or inexpensive, but snakes often die trying to return to their original home range, so it is usually best to enjoy them like you would songbirds or any of the other amazing wildlife native to your area. Commercial snake repellents are not effective - to discourage snakes, eliminate sources of food and cover; clear debris, stacked wood and eliminate rodent populations. Seal up cracks in and around the foundation/base of your home.

It is silly. Removing Biden from office would at the very least require Harris committing political suicide and 1) voting to remove him, 2) having a majority of the cabinet picked by Biden do the same, then after Biden immediately sent a letter to the heads of both houses of Congress that he is resuming office 3) two thirds of both houses would have to vote to remove him.

It was never going to happen.

"HarryPotterBooks","t5_2zc4g","I quite like Ginny because she is perfect for Harry and that shows how capable she is, because not just any girl can be Harry’s girlfriend. Harry obviously has a very tumultuous life, so he needs to be very strong, and on top of that Harry’s personality is very unique. Ginny matches him perfectly.

She has that “blazing look” that characterizes her, which shows she is very strong. I mean the fact that she became a famous and confident girl in school after being possessed by Voldemort her first year shows her maturity and strength to overcome adversity. Also the book mentions how growing up with 6 older brothers toughens her up so she isn’t a crier, and Harry respects that. Not that girls who cry a lot are worse, but Ginny shows that she can stand side by side with him and understand him.

Adding to her strength, her personality is just fun. She loves Quidditch and is great at it. She is also funny, kind of like Fred and George. I love when Harry needs to use Umbridge’s fireplace and he mentions it to Ginny. She understands him without needing to ask questions and goes on to help without hesitation. 

She’s also a baddie and a badass lol

The parts that won me over tho were after Dumbledore’s death. 
 
First, when Harry is staring at Dumbledore’s body,  Hagrid tells him to go the castle, but he doesn’t listen. Then Ginny just comes up to him, grabs him by the hand, and leads him when he needed to be led. Ginny is an equal to Harry. She can truly take the lead when he needs to or stand side by side or stand back and be led

The most amazing Ginny scene is: 

**Harry looked at Ginny, Ron and Hermione: Ron’s face was screwed up as though the sunlight was blinding him.** 
** Hermione’s face was glazed with tears, but Ginny was no longer crying.**
 **She met Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say ‘Be careful’, or ‘Don’t do it’, but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him.**

I won’t repeat myself. But yes, Ginny is blazing, she is strong, she understands and Harry and can stand as equal to him. And she also loves that he will always seek to defeat Voldemort. They are united in purpose.

I like that she is more do and not tell. I think Harry is like that too. 

And I don’t think you can blame her for not getting over Harry. They are soulmates (not just to be corny)",1722470521.0

Being in the air protects you from hits and gives you a second to improve your grip on it. Also, opponents can try to contest the ball in the air, as long they don't contact you, but since you're being lifted you're higher than them.

The Calling is alright, I remember basically nothing about it though.

I do remember really enjoying Asunder, which bridges the gap between DAO/DA2 and DAI pretty well, provides closure for some characters and introducing others. Asunder and The Masked Empire (another pretty good one) are referenced heavily in DAI, I wouldn't call them essential reading but it'll add some depth to a few of the storylines in that game!

Tevinter Nights is 100% worth a read, some of the stories are kinda eh but a few others are fantastic, and overall it sets the stage for Veilguard in a lot of really interesting ways! If you only read one, I'd pick Tevinter Nights! 👀",1722470522.0

"Accutane","t5_2ui5x","Please read the rules before posting and remember to abide by them!
Posts and comments not following the rules will immediately be removed!

Have you tried using the search bar?  
Many questions are asked daily, and your question may have already 
been answered!  
If so, your post will be subject to deletion.

Please refer to the following commonly discussed 
topics:

1) No one can predict whether or not you will purge! 
Statistically, most people DO NOT purge.  
That is what the science and medical literature says.

2) No one can predict how long your purge will last 
nor when it could start. 
Be patient, the purge can be tough but so many people have gotten through it - 
you can too!

3)  Any questions related about dosage MUST include DOSE and WEIGHT(lbs or kg).  
Otherwise, that is considered LOW EFFORT and will subsequently be REMOVED.   

4)  Most people DO NOT replase when Accutane is taken until cumulative dosage is reached.

5) HOWEVER, cumulative dosage is a guideline.  
Everyone is different.  Some may need more Accutane, and others may need less.  Your dermatologist 
evaluates you as an individual.  
This also applies to your prescription.  Everyone is different, so no comparing of doses or asking why your dose is low or high.
If you do not trust your dermatologist, you should find a different one.

6) When in doubt, please consult a medical 
professional(dermatologist, doctor, pharmacist).  
DO NOT solicit medical advice from this subreddit.  
Remember Reddit is a bunch of strangers on the internet.

Passado um tempo conheci uma pessoa bacana, inteligente, esforçada, entre outras qualidades que admiro muito e com 6 meses de namoro eu a pedi em casamento, com 1 ano de namoro estávamos no altar, com padre, vestido de noiva, aliança, lua de mel. Foi muito natural, eu realmente quis isso e não me arrependo nem um pouquinho. Tudo o que minha ex implorava e eu dei desculpas para ela e para mim mesmo eu fiz sem pestanejar com minha atual.

Encontre uma mulher que você admira, que você sinta vontade de estar até o seu último suspiro e veja como não haverá dúvidas na verdade quando você faz de coração as dúvidas se transformam. Depois que casei fui promovido, ela também. Compramos carro, viajamos. Coisas que eu não conseguia fazer antes porque estava muito ocupado sendo infeliz e fazendo outra pessoa infeliz.

"Mediums","t5_2wv33","I'm trying to work on this with a friendly spirit at the moment and...he isn't sure how it works 😑 The connection is telepathic, or at least he says he is projecting his thoughts to me, not speaking out loud. They are heard in the back of my mind and sound like my own voice, so it's not the easiest to sort out. I have...uh...hand vibes? that are quite reliable with getting me a yes/no on things I have no strong opinion on, and often I double check. He can't tell me how often I'm right because I'm supposed to figure that out on my own, but I would say I've got about a 70% success rate right now. If it helps at all, I specifically feel a sensation at the back left of my head when I'm being thought projected at, but I don't think everyone would feel that.

I would recommend finding a second method to confirm things if you can, I have my vibes but I also just ordered a set of oracle cards to help out with this as I feel like I'll be able to manipulate the cards less than my own hands. Obviously there are a lot of emotions wrapped up in having a baby so it's possible that you could have just thought it on your own, but it's also possible they meant you would conceive in October or that you would have your baby on October of a different year. And sometimes things that are supposed to happen get delayed. Through no fault of our own. Sometimes I assume the opposite of what I heard and then ""threaten"" my guides with an I Told You So dance if they're wrong 🤣 Sometimes it does make them backpedal a little when it isn't guaranteed!

Of course we all just want healthy babies, but if choosing the gender is our one “perk” after going through all this, then we should be able to act on it without being made to feel weird or guilty.

"thefinals","t5_3lasp","Fair, we disagree.

  
With 50dmg and 3 hits to kill a light (which is the hardest to backstab) I feel it's fine, attack speed is very fast too. Consider one of those hits is (probably) a missed backstab , with only 2 left to get the kill. Using normal attacks against everything else is a battle you are not wining. About heavies, in my experience landing the backstab means a heavy is already dead either by you that can follow with a quick melee/an already fast enough normal dagger attack, or any stray damage going on in the battle. It's a change that's not needed and a graet way for echo chamber to focus on dagger until it's nerfed to the ground :)

  
Fully agree about the sound, QoL change that would be very welcome and has been in my mind for a while!

However, in many cases if you’re not fast enough you can go over the 40 hours on your prime and end up actually making less money than evaluation.
At our office the supervisor will usually work with you so if you would go over he will find someone else, but if not, he lets you work that 6th day. We have one RCA who worked 6 days on his prime which is a 48k. He busted ass to finish it each day in about 6 hours so ended up being paid 57.6 hours eval time.",1722470523.0

Conservative teenagers who agree with their boomer grandparents are not going to fit in with the popular liberal kids with their social justice and awareness. 

Like, mock all you want. You know it's true. Being a part of an out-group, and considered weird for you opinions, hurts self-esteem a lot as a kid. And those kids have now grown up and react viscerally to be called weird. That's all I've seen on conservative subreddits.

She was stupid, she was in denial, sure. 
But the *fault* lies with the rapist, not the victim. You would be wise to know the difference. She didn't have malicious intent about becoming a rape victim, but you DID have malicious intent about denying any sympathy and subsequently kicking her while she was down, That makes you an AH, and is indicative of your character as a human being.

Self precipitated victimization (in this case, denial of the risks despite signs and warnings) is always a factor in *preventing* future victimization. 

But there's a time and place for that. She was horrifically violated and traumatized, and you decided that was the perfect opportunity to place emphasis on how right you were about the risks you observed. That's not the appropriate time and place to be making those comments, and frankly the fact that you don't understand that makes you far dumber than she was.",1722470524.0

Hi,

I am conducting some research into the effects of social media use on the way people feel happiness and competitive feelings. In this study you will look at some social media images, comment on or like a couple and then fill out a couple of questionnaires. Totally anonymous of course. Shouldn’t take more than 10 to 15 minutes max. Less if you’re quick.

It would really be helping myself and another psychology student if you could take some time to check it out.

Thanks in advance. If you are interested, here is the link:

"Israel_Palestine","t5_madl8",">The actual president of the icj saying it’s not the case isn’t enough for you?

What is not the case? Why can't you be specific about what you're referring to? Do you understand what the president of the ICJ said? Did you watch the video you sent me? What do you think was said? 

>Ottoman leaders were tried and convicted

Not of Genocide and we are specifically arguing about the use of that word, which is why it's relevant.
Granted genocide didn't exist as a concept at the time of those trials, but considering Genocide has never been officially proven and never will be in that case, why is it appropriate to retroactively apply the term? If we go by your standard, it's not.

>The South Africa case is against Israeli leadership, not the entire state of Israel.

DUH, I know. Everyone knows this. And when I say Israel, that's obviously what I'm referring to.

>They couldn’t prove to the court that a genocide is ongoing, yet you claim it is?

No, that has yet to be proven or disproven as there is yet to be a verdict and won't be several years. A prosecutor hasn't failed to prove their case before a verdict has been delivered. 

The court didn't throw out South Africa's case, something which they absolutely could've done if South Africa's case was meritless, and they ordered for Israel to institute measures to protect Palestinians, measures which Israel still has not taken. It is incredibly misleading to present this as if Israel has been absolved of what they've been accused of.

>You can use any term you’d like, I’m pointing out that it’s not the case here, you admit that the court agrees with me, you agree you’ve been arguing without knowing what you’re arguing about

The court doesn't agree with you, far from it, and I never admitted that.

The court made an interim judgment. They haven't delivered a final judgment. They've made no judgment on whether a genocide is occurring or not.
The lack of  a final judgment yet is not evidence that the court agrees with you, and it's completely dishonest to act as if it is. Typically, these judgments take a very long time to be delivered. For example, the Srebrenica Massacre, which occurred in 1995, was not determined to be an act of genocide until 2002. The Cambodian Genocide proceedings only ended a couple of years ago.

"GaylorSwift","t5_mnhlw","And sidebar (I already went on my quarterly anti-Ellen rant below) because there is just something so delicious and deeply vital and visible about the word “decode” and the way Taylor herself used it in her titular TTPD. 

Is that dovetailing into the complexity of the gap between persona and inner person? Neurodivergence, masking and constantly being misunderstood, hiding but still yearning to be seen? 

I haven’t been seen/clocked/perceived  IRL in so long now, a question like “who else decodes you?” Hits different, it wrecks me? (Also isn’t the answer — nobody? This is the type of sly genius song that I emotionally sing in the car. It’s silly but … it’s not. I maintain it’s freaking beautiful.) 

We’re decoding her, whether well or poorly is tbd. 

She’s decoding us, and/or giving us the tools to decode her and also decode ourselves. 

Because I did not have the context and language for a lot of things about me, silly as it is, until I found Gaylor and found a lot of other people whose brain works and hears and interprets like mine? That riddles and and connects and … decodes. 

(Holy shit, she put the TTPD words in her fake error message on her page so we could “decode” it.) 

If it wasn’t important, if it wasn’t something she’s expressing to fans, it wouldn’t be the last line of the song? 

But also ALSO — have we talked about this? Someone please link me if we have — 

I didn’t ever hear this but it’s on the lyric sheet I’m reading. Does she really say at the end of TTPD …

Who’s gonna TROLL YOU?!

Shit, Taylor, you’re my favorite troll?? 
I don’t know who else trolls me like you do?? 
Is she trolling *us* or *them* or *everyone*

The last two questions (Question? Is also low-key one of my fav songs of hers, there is just something about this genre of question song for me) are

I absolutely adore all my foreign friends and their awesome different countries (including some of my Finnish friends, even though their accents are pretty crazy to me, I still really like the accents lol).

"Switch","t5_2svh8","Yes, I play both for sure. I find my Switch is much lighter and smaller, so it’s what I take in my backpack. 

My Steam Deck, on the other hand, is perfect for quick sessions around the house—on the couch, bed, back patio, you name it. The Steam Deck is also much better for (1) cheap games, and (2) more demanding games, including Sony and Xbox “exclusives.” 

However, the Switch is no slouch in the exclusives department, and it has a nice bonus in that I can buy my games physically. Sometimes, I’ll even buy/play a game on Switch that would run much better on the Deck, such as Kingdom Come Deliverance, just because my Switch feels more “at home” to me as I’ve been playing games on it for 7+ years now. 

But, I definitely can’t play Elden Ring on it, so the Steam Deck gets its fair share of use. I’d say my time is split about 50/50 between them. They’re both phenomenal handhelds, especially the OLED models. 

What’s interesting is that my gaming PC and Series X get almost no use whatsoever now. For me, the sheer convenience of these two handhelds outweighs the higher performance those systems offer. I know it’s small, but the speed I can jump back into a game on the Deck/Switch, the ability to “pause” with one click (the power button), and not being tethered to a specific room/TV makes for a big difference. Plus, a lot of games don’t need that added horsepower (IE, pretty much all indie games).",1722470527.0

Keep it small and simple. Once I have enough to look like I legally made it, begin investing. Every year its safe to 'make' about the tax threshold, sometimes going over and paying just enough tax that I don't look suspicious. 

I pay back ever penny I used from the ten mil and then keep playing that game and pocket the interest. The rest of the cash gets buried and kept safe until it can be  put in the bank and used to make interest.

The fact that Congress rarely has approval ratings above 30% (it was 16% as of June) shows that the vast majority of potential voters are not happy with our elected officials, but keep voting for them anyway.",1722470528.0

**Thank you for [your submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/comments/1eh2izt/fukien/) to /r/Bonsai!** 

Oops! Your submission has been removed because this subreddit requires appropriate user flair (the tags next to user names, separate from post flair — [read here for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/walkthrough#wiki_what_is_flair.3F_why_do_i_need_it.3F_why_all_the_rules.3F)). Bonsai advice is very location-dependent, and correctly filled in flair helps people give you better advice and helps them avoid giving you inappropriate advice. Flair often doesn't save correctly when using the app or mobile site. It's more reliable to set it through the desktop version of the site, which you can also get to with a mobile browser by going to the reddit settings menu and selecting 'request desktop site.' The option to set your flair is in the sidebar, either [here](https://i.imgur.com/yvRH3bL.png) on old reddit or [here](https://i.imgur.com/wDGyvES.png) on the redesign.

**You have also selected a topic that should be posted in the weekly thread, not as its own post, so along with [setting your user flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/walkthrough#wiki_what_is_flair.3F_why_do_i_need_it.3F_why_all_the_rules.3F), you can find the current weekly thread as one of the two stickied posts at the top of the sub.**  

While the vast majority of users come here looking for advice and discussion on their trees, we understand that some of you are not. In that case, you can set the flair to anything you like to meet the requirement. If you *are* here to discuss your trees, we do ask that you fill your flair out accurately. Thanks!

**If you are on a mobile device and can’t see the sidebar, try using your mobile browser. That usually works.**

**Also, please read [the Beginner's Walkthrough](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/walkthrough)** in the **[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bonsai/wiki/)** before posting for the first time.

"DOG","t5_2qiy5","Patience will b the most important part to start! Soft spoken words, no yelling (even if not at the pup, just in general) Let him come to u. We have a super sensitive, shy guy. He gets scared of loud noises, bangs, loud jets, u name it. He’s taught Jeff and I (mostly me) to talk about things as opposed to yelling or even loud and empathetic voices. We have learned to talk about things, so Max helped me w that! But it can happen, but it can be a slow process. He may sooo never b good in certain situations, and that’s ok too. Like we could never bring Max to a parade, like some dogs can handle. We can’t even walk down the st. The loud trucks, and motorcycles scare him. So when we go for our walks we go to the woods. That’s where he’s happiest. As long as it’s not hunting season and we hear gun shots. But those months we go to places where hunting isn’t allowed anywhere in the vicinity. GL, what you’re doing isn’t easy. Your pup is really lucky to have someone willing to take on a dog that is going to be a lot of work and patience. Also, I’d get a decent sized crate, put a comfy bed in there and a blanket over the top, so he’ll have his “safe spot” if he’s in there, that can be his room.

Bill Clinton actually got dragged by republicans for having a 40 minute speech at his first DNC. Length of time rambling on a stump isn’t a direct correlation to strength. I’m not sure why you think it would be.

Also, a good reporter actually does give challenging questions. Id be thrilled if all politicians were held to a higher standard and asked tough questions. Journalists aren’t there to throw softballs and make someone feel good. They’re there to get answers that their audience wants to hear, and that was a question their audience wanted asked. Nothing she said was false in the lead up to her question, and the entire context of it was that the chair of their organization actually stepped down from her position in protest of Trump even being invited - so of course it was the first thing that was brought up as his presence was inherently controversial (valid or not) to the organization hosting the event.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Are you reading what you wrote? You absolutely need to provide consent to undergo surgery. Other than emergency situations where consent is implied (but is often trickier to handle legally)? there is no context in which that wouldn’t be true. The process of consenting a patient involves explaining the procedure, the indications for the procedure, the risks and benefits, and what to expect under anesthesia, such as what might happen if the surgery goes wrong. I know this because I obtained consent from a patient for surgery just this morning.

You need that consent form signed, otherwise you cannot proceed with the surgery. Beyond the legal implications, you ethically must let a patient know what they’re getting themselves into.

Even if these “provisions” you speak of did not exist, would you say it would be ethical to wheel a patient into surgery to remove an organ without explaining why, or without obtaining the patient’s consent? Perhaps I’m missing something here, but I really don’t understand this argument.

"ECEProfessionals","t5_2t05v","> This kid is 4 years old and it's his first year at camp. He tends to get easily bored by the activities we provide, and most of the time chooses not to participate. 

Every time I planned an activity I always made sure I had adaptations, variations and extensions. Some children will find the activity to easy and may need a way to simplify it, make it last less time, or other supports. Other children will find an activity too simple or not challenging enough. For them I add extensions where they can take the activity further, add things to it or do it with other materials or in a different more interesting way. Sometimes they want to do the activity but do it a different way. allowing the possibility for the child to do it the way they want and that makes sense to them will help them engage with it.

I do almost entirely emergent activities. I watch my kids in their free play and then create activities around things that interest them. I had one kid that loved Godzilla and got his friends excited about it. So we did little Godzilla stand up figures, cut paper plates in half and made Godzilla that opened and closed his mouth with a split pin, Made little Godzilla figures out of 2 paper cups, made buildings out of cardboard from our community and made their own houses to set up on the car carpet for their stand up Godzillas to come and knock down. All with a Godzilla soundtrack playing of course. If you can find activities that feature their interests children are much more likely to engage with them of their own volition and take the activity further. 

I set my activities out as invitations. Here are some materials and an idea what you could do with them. One time I set out a caterpillar made from an egg carton because they liked the very hungry caterpillar story and game. They decided to make leprechaun traps with the materials. Okay cool, let's make leprechaun traps! Sometimes they aren't interested and want to relax and look at books. If you have a selection of things to do they will go for the one that meets their needs.


>They called his mom, and before she arrived, he had lost control of his bladder and had peed his pants. How could I have helped him in this scenario? What do you think was the reason he refused to use the bathroom? Maybe a phobia?

Sometimes a child will just be mad and want to be contrarian. Talk to their parents about how they go to the bathroom at home. With my kinders they know that after morning snack they need to go to the bathroom because we are going out on an adventure. The first week or 2 we had to come back from our adventure so people could go to the bathroom. They didn't like having to stop playing so they go on board with the routine. Having a solid routine and clear consistent expectations will help children understand what to do. If you keep it up eventually most children will become accustomed to it.

I have a kinder who wet their pants today in the room where we let them run around inside. He just wouldn't go pee no matter how many times we asked them. They had to stop playing and go get washed and changed so hopefully they will eventually figure it out.",1722470529.0

"horror","t5_2qh9x","I think you made some really good points about the movie. But I still would like to defend the movie. For me this movie was really impactfull. I watched it years ago when I was younger and usually the Films I saw were braindead Zombie Flicks, Video Nasties this kind of stuff. But MBTS was different, I mean I saw serious horror movies with gore before, but they were always a kind of cheesy, bad acting, bad costumes, bad dubbing... there was always something that I could never take the movies serious. MBTS was a different experience the first time. The costumes and the sets looked authentic. There was no dub, just the cantonese Audio with subtitles. There was real Stock footage and many written facts displayed during the movie. It felt more like a documentary than a movie at first.

I remember  there were kind of characters that you were following. There was this group of children that were young recruits for the camp. It is still not like the movie is following their story. But for me they were the protagonists who were the human part of the Story. They befriended the one kid that got the worst fate and avenged him at the end. The movie had also an main antagonist Ishii Shiro and a smaller one 

But what made this watching experience different was of course the violence. And I think for this movie this works. The movie chooses to shock the viewer constantly.  And the violence has a purpose. The movie is from 1988 and at that time Japan still had not confirm the existence of Unit 731. The movie wanted to be shocking to stand out and also point out the war crimes. And it went beyond that. 

 Every gorescene felt unplaisant. I mean in other movies you can enjoy the violence, but this movie made this enjoyment impossible. I do not like the fact that they used real bodies and I really hope that the cat scene was a trick like they said. But I think because of the extreme violence it stands out and got attention. After I watched the movie, I researched this time of history because I did not know much about the japanese history of WW2. 

For me it was a intense first watch. More disturbing than most horror I experienced. I do understand all your points and critism. I find it interesting though that all what does not work for you, perfectly works for me. The fact that the movie has a minimum amount of story or any character development. It is like pure explotation that wants to shock every 10 minutes and with the amount of sick ideas it surprisingly succees. The focus stays always the violence. And the movie refuses a break from this until the end. It is like more story would distract from the horrific stuff. I think this is how it was intended.

And I surelly won't recommend watch this one blind.",1722470529.0

Games workshop and Black Library have retconned his relationship with the Lion from definitively a parent-child to more of a Inversion of the Anakin and Obi-wan relationship in star wars with the Older brother figure Luther being the one to turn to the dark side(Chaos).

  
Luther even comments on this in first of the fallen to one of the Dark Angels supreme grand masters who is questioning him years after the heresy. He wonders that if his wife , Fyona and daughter had survived (his wife died in child birth and the girl was stillborn) then he may have had a more father-son relationship with the Lion and that the influence of having a maternal figure and a sister and not being raised entirely by the Order in Aldurukh may have had a positive effect on the lion.

The League of Nations had failed to stop the expansion of Italy, Japan, and Germany, so it was an important test. Funnily, the only reason the resolution was able to get through the Security Council, where any of the five permanent members have veto power, was because the Chinese seat was still held by the Nationalists even though they had retreated to Taiwan the previous year. The USSR was boycotting the UN as well because of this, so they did not veto the resolutions.

Secondly, even if all religions are wrong, that doesn’t mean we don’t have souls or that there isn’t an afterlife. If praying to god is how you process this and speak to your son, then do it.

Yeah. It feels that way because that's precisely what I'm doing, and I've explicitly stated as much. I want to couch them in a different context so that the Atheists here would have an opportunity to provide some insight as to why their standards of evidence should apply the way they do. 

What you'll need to do if you want to answer the question is assume that the arguments are sound, then explain why, for example the pot of boiling water, is an unacceptable piece of evidence. My contention is that demanding direct evidence of God's existence is akin to demanding video evidence that someone put the pot of water on the stove and turned on the fire. Technically, sure, without that kind of evidence perhaps we can't say \*for certain\* that a human being put the kettle on. But do you see how that's unsatisfactory? Do you understand how that, in a way, ignores the issue we are faced with when confronted with such evidence?",1722470531.0

"thebachelor","t5_2tj74","I'm surprised everyone is giving him so much credit. He is a content creator. Obviously he's there for the publicity. Not surprising it was on his own dime. He goes from a nobody to a million people knowing who he is overnight. The value of that is 1000x more than the cost of a ticket. 

As Jenn said, he could have told her all this before she left or accepted the gig.

Aside from all that. He's cute. And there is something about familiarity that makes him real versus the guys. I think the contrast is going to knock her into reality that she doesn't know these guys at all. It might work in her favor in terms of being more careful.",1722470531.0

"inthenews","t5_2rgzp","the media is owned by the rich and the connected

Democrats aren't playing to win because their major donors don't want them to win, they want them to be competitive to negotiate with Republicans,  Republican donors want them to control the entire government head to toe and then use it to radically reshape the country

 it's a different game

this election is just important enough that some Democrats, some, are okay with upsetting a few of the rich country club private school set

remember Biden had to get together in front of a bunch of rich assholes and say "" things won't fundamentally change""  because that's what the people who own things like Broadcasting Companies and News Networks want to hear, because they also own BlackRock and Blackstone etc. etc.

 remember, the first thing Democrats did when they got off the floor on Jan.6, having hid from a mob sent there to kill them to stop the government from doing its job, a coup if you will, was get busy making sure the coup was just seen as a riot,  business as usual just that Trump guy is the problem but no real structural problems and the media was right there with them, turning a coup in to a riot

one headline i think in one publication was ""coup"" and the next day it was back to being a riot at that paper because both Republicans and Democrats chewed them out

it's why we have the same FBI Director, the same guy who let that happen is still in charge today

it's why the secret service can erase their phones and be like ""whoops""

it's why after the election Trump lost, the first thing he did was replace the head of the military with a loyalist and crickets, nearly zero pushback

it's why Biden didn't replace Trump's Post Master General, who admitted to trying to stop mail in votes 

because Democrats aren't allowed to rock the boat at all, their major donors will get pissed, they are there as a negotiating position for the rich 

if they do too much to stop Republicans, the media will turn on them harder",1722470532.0

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","So, when worn properly, an n95 should protect you from COVID. Surgical masks & cloth masks are the ones that are effectively useless at protecting you. Your larger problem while wearing an n95 is going to be not wearing it properly/not being sealed to your face all around, touching your face with your hands, eating/drinking with the mask down, etc.

That said idk how fun clubbing will be with a mask on lol.

The current COVID wave is def real, but also not all that harmful, so it’s really up to you whether you think it’s worth getting sick to go. If you have a vacation in a week that’ll get all messed up by being sick, don’t go. But if you don’t have anything critical coming up or going clubbing is a really important thing to you, go for it.

Unless you’re pretty severely immunocompromised, you’re not gonna be at huge health risks from getting these current strains of COVID, at least from what I understand. It’ll be like having a cold/flu.",1722470532.0
"Psychic","t5_2qmhd","No psychic, medium or divination method is 100% accurate 100% of the time. We’re only human, we misunderstand, we misinterpret, we make mistakes. And that’s dealing with current energies, when it comes to predictions, that’s adding a whole other boatload of moveable parts to deal with too. We read energies. In the moment of the reading, from our own unique viewpoint, filtered through our own unique bias, judgement and experience. 
Even if our interpretation is absolutely spot on, we still aren’t guaranteed to be correct. Any predictions we do make is what we consider to be the most likely outcome based on our interpretation in that moment. 

You have free will, but so does everyone else whose life even slightly impinges on ours. People change, energies change, ergo so does the future. Nothing is set in stone, readings don’t come with guarantees or assurances. Think the butterfly effect. Thats why not all readers will give future readings. So it’s possible that both interpretations were accurate in the moment each was made. 

As far as the concept of soulmates goes, it really doesn’t mean anything at all. We have more than one, soulmates are at the basic mates of our souls. We might have the potential to have romantic relationships with them, but they are just as likely reincarnate in our lives as siblings, friends, children, parents, or even pets. Even in those who are potential romantic prospects, it doesn’t offer any more guarantee of a happy-ever-after-roses-around-the-door-lifelong commitment or partnership. Relax. Let the romance play out and unfold however it will, and don’t worry about the label, they’re for soup cans anyway. 

Lastly, a psychic being paid for their readings is perfectly legitimate. You’re paying for their time, energy, knowledge and experience using an ability they’ve spent a lot of time and effort honing into a usable skill to help others. There are free readers out there, and there are scammers who charge out there, but someone charging for the use of their abilities isn’t automatically a reason to be suspicious.",1722470532.0

Simply put unionized companies will be allowed to hire scabs and companies that aren’t unionized will push their members trying to organ into these collective groups so that the workers feel like they have agency over there paychecks and benefits however they won’t have any of the protections that a real union Will give them and protections that they need because without the union they don’t have them at those jobs not all places. I’m sure there’s some good companies out there that have great track records of taking care of their employees that are not unionized, but it’s not the majority encourage everyone PDF and at least read the pages on unions OSHA and the other many topics that interest you it’s written poorly so I recommend grabbing a beer to get yourself through it",1722470532.0

Non-diabetic nocturnal or reactive hypoglycemia means there's something causing your blood sugar to drop. It explains your symptoms. I have my attacks when I wake up from sleeping or a nap. Others have them after eating. I suspect your symptoms are caused by an underlying health condition. It could be due to your past history of ED. It's possible it's something else.

Having high inflammation markers is concerning. The rheumotologist should've ran a complete autoimmune panel on you. At the vary least, it would rule out other conditions and point your doctor towards fibromyalgia.  

If you're dealing with Cushing's and hypothyroidism, even if it's subclinical, an endocrinologist should be managing care for that. Many doctors fail to realize that just because specific numbers aren't high, it doesn't mean you're not experiencing subclinic symptoms of that condition and it should be treated by medications. If you're able to manage without medications, that's fine too. 

Some studies have found that people with fibromyalgia (FM) may have higher levels of lactic acid in their muscles and tendon sheaths, both while resting and during physical activity. This buildup can cause a burning sensation or a feeling of inflamed nerves, which can contribute to FM pain. 

￼

￼

￼

Lactic acid is produced in muscle cells and red blood cells when oxygen levels are low, which can happen during intense exercise or as a result of constant stress. FM patients also have an increased risk of glucose metabolism issues, which can also lead to elevated lactate levels. ",1722470533.0

Lean bulking has become popular lately. Studies have shown that a 200 calorie surplus (200 surplus * 30 days / 3500 calories = 1.7 lbs a month) builds as much muscle as a high surplus but with much less fat. 

But it is hard to bulk at such a small surplus unless you weigh your food. It works for me since I usually cook everything myself. I eat out only once a week and just guess for that.",1722470533.0

Budgets are obviously different for everyone, but your house maintenance budget may be a tad low (assuming you own an average property), I'd recommend 1% of the value of the property per annum.

The key thing is that you are young enough to return to work if it all goes a bit pear shaped. And if you do pull the trigger and FIRE you will really be able to get the most out of your early retirement if you are in good health.

"equestriaatwar","t5_nigbe","Watching your child going down the path of extremism can leave parents feeling helpless. You can't reason them out of it, because you'll just be called a weakling who's fallen for the lies. You can't forbid them, because rebellious teenagers are attracted to what parents disapprove of. You can't even throw them out on the street because it irrepairably destroys all hope of getting through to them. And their beliefs are not a crime, so no government institution is going to bother correcting them. You just have to watch them circle the drain until one day you get that phone call that you need to come to the police station, and they're facing time that exceeds their total years alive.

"pourover","t5_3462h","It is a little puzzling what the issue is, it seems like you have a lot of the fundamentals down. So I can only guess what might be going wrong and offer some ideas to explore. My suspicion is now that you're getting uneven extraction, so some of the grounds can be over extracted while other grounds are under extracted, leading to that sourness.

I do think it is somewhat easier to brew a 1 cup vs 2 cups, so I would attempt the following:

* Work with a 12g coffee : 200g water or 15g coffee : 250g water method until you have something that is working for you
* Go to a simpler recipe. Stirring, agitating, swirling... these CAN be helpful, but they're also more variables that can go wrong and are absolutely not essential to a good cup of coffee. For example the April Coffee Recipe is dead simple, and they're also world renowned. 
* Be careful how fine you are grinding. While finer grind should lead to higher extraction, it can also lead to stalling and channeling which has the exact opposite effect. People get well extracted tasty coffee with course grinds, without swirling, without stirring.
* Don't take James Hoffmann's advice as gospel. He's awesome and I I've learned a ton watching all of his videos. But he also has a specific flavor preference that is not universal, and his methods tend to push extraction very far.

>**April Coffee Recipe**  
Dose: 12g  
Water: 200g at 92°C  
Grind size: 11.5  
Brew time: 2:30-3:00  
Target TDS: 1.25 - 1.35  
  
Begin your brew with an initial 100g pour. Use your first 30g of the pour to saturate the coffee bed evenly whilst implementing a circular pouring technique.  
Continue your pour by completing the final 70g pour into the center of the coffee bed. Replicate this pouring format once again, commencing your second pour at 35 seconds. Finish the brew with a total brew time in 2:30-3:00 minutes.  
  
**Example of the pouring structure:**  
1. 30g Circle Pour - 70g Center Pour (0:00)  
2. 30g Circle Pour - 70g Center Pour (0:30)",1722470537.0

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","As a women who believes we are working backwards against the sexist society we come up in to achieve equality it is certainly a huge factor. But maybe for slightly different reasons.
Obviously we are expected to do the brunt of the labor of carrying and caring for these kids, and we are expected not to expect help, but it goes beyond that.
I become incensed when I am seen as nothing more than a future mom. It's the expectation to just throw my life into having a child because it's just the next step, like I don't have goals and dreams and a career to be concerned with. Because men aren't expected to do jack crap, so when a man asks me and my husband when we are having kids I feel this anger inside that he doesn't even know what that means. That even if I have the best husband in the world, and I do believe I do, he would succome to the constant normalization of every young family around us living within the same patriarchal social norms. The worst part is, I've known forever that I don't want children... and people tell me that I'll change my mind. And I find it so frustrating because it is the truest form of not being taken seriously. And I'm sure if a man said it, it would be accepted as fact. It's not the child rearing that's unfair, it's the whole way that you are diminished as an individual for being a woman with the potential to bear offspring in the future. Like a piece of meat. Like property. Like an asset. It makes my skin crawl and puts me off the whole experience, even if I was okay with all the other reasons I don't want children lmao.",1722470537.0

- Fire & Blood, The Sons of the Dragon

No fewer than forty-two persons stood accused, for those named by Lord Graceford had in turn named others when questioned sharply.

- Fire & Blood, The Lysene Spring and the End of the Regency

"writing","t5_2qh2n","Yeah, I've found it to be. The only real pitfall I can identify is not using elements from the public domain in your works. Use the public domain as a template for your version to be unique.

I have the characters observe that Kong's successor and presumed son is just under 30 feet tall so I can have a bigger Kong without one of the copyrighted versions getting their hackles up. In a future novel, if there is one, perhaps he'll grow taller still. 


It's also handy to leave the partially-copyrighted names out of titles. I know Amazon is an asshole about that. It may decrease your reach, but it will definitely decrease your headaches as well!",1722470538.0

"BanPitBulls","t5_3d2z7","Copy of text post for attack logging purposes: Maybe a change in vocabulary would be helpful. Some thoughts.

  
Aggression in a dog can be defined as: hard stare, growling, barking, snarling, lunging, snapping, and/or biting. All of which can be negligible, harmless in many dog breeds. Under this definition, a Chihuahua can indeed be very aggressive but its actions can be entirely physically inconsequential. Also, aggression is a behaviour manifested for a moment. The potential for danger exists no matter the state of the dog - even if it's asleep. One can try and provoke aggression as a test but a dog could skip directly from calm to playfully mauling to death.  


You can be perfectly safe all day with a very aggressive dog who only snarls and barks.  


Two normal (not pit bulls or similar) dogs who get into a fight for natural reasons will end it by themselves when one of them shows signs of surrender. Therefore, it could be argued that pit bulls were not bread to fight but rather to murder. They will enjoy/prefer to continue until there are no signs of life. I don't think that ""dog fights"" would have been such a popular sport among their degenerate patrons if all that happened was barking and intimidation until one of them backs down - no blood, no death.  


If murder isn't the right word then ask yourself, what verb in human behaviour has this breed been bred for? For which human activity will it assist? Herding? No. Guarding? No. Fighting? No. The quality which is bred for is that when placed in an arena with another living being, it is most likely to kill with no reason to do so, no provocation, no command given.  


Pit bulls may be one of the least aggressive breeds but they are the most dangerous. If you understand that aggression is not synonymous with danger then one can concede that pit bulls are not the most aggressive.  


Pit bulls were not bred to fight but to kill/murder. An individual may spend its life not expressing the bred-for behaviour but there is no way to guarantee it will never happen.  


I would go a step further and label them ""insanely dangerous"". If the danger can appear for no rational reason (hunting, protection) then it is insane.

She needs to go speak with her OB because a 2nd birth this close to the first can be dangerous for both her and the baby. It’s certainly doable, but it’s going to be hard on her body. The two of you also need to sit down and seriously discuss birth control options. Vasectomy for you if you don’t want more kids, any of the various forms of birth control for her depending on what she’s most comfortable with, and condoms are a massive help when trying not to have kids. Buy some, they’re super cheap.

Otherwise yeah, you’re both going to be overwhelmed, stressed out, tired, and your finances will be strained. That’s par for the course. Rely on family if you’re able, pick up a second gig if you can even if it’s a part time minimum wage job. Save what you can. Good news is the stuff you have for the first will work just as well with the second so you won’t have to buy new bottles and clothes and stuff. Look into government assistance and see what you might qualify for as well.

So yeah, wrap it up, save up, and buckle up.",1722470540.0

A cheap replacement t5 could be had at the junkyard ala 4 cylinder t5. They had lower gearing and  thus better low end acceleration . They do not hold up well to speed shifting (wide open throttle shifting) or launching on slicks. They are not rated for much tq at all. In my group of 5 we ran these for a while until the 3550 became available, just because they were so cheap. Between all of us I'm talking dozens of transmission swaps in the first couple years.  If its a mild build you will probably be fine for a bit. Don't expect it to hold up to much abuse with decent power enhancing mods though.  When we were trashing them it was basically stock on slicks, cam, exhaust work and a small hit of n2o. Iirc we we started destroying them in the high 12s range.",1722470541.0

Batman and Hawkeye

"youtubedrama","t5_2usaz","There were jewish nazis, there existing groups that would be hurt by an ideology supporting the ideology doesnt mean that ideology is no longer harmful to them. Men are also victims of the patriarchy and yet plenty support it. Also pedophiles cross the gender barrier so there being women involved doesnt make it anti-pedophile suddenly. 

Didnt Lauren Southern literally come out about how as a tradwife influencer she was actually in a horrifically abusive marriage? 

Half the country doesnt have to actively think it in order to perpetuate it. Tons of white people during literal slavery didnt think they were racist, but they still perpetuated the systems.

When it comes to individual conservatives I really dont know at this point. The more people I talk to the more I realize most people have absolutely incoherent politics. My dad votes republican every time and has over the past decade fallen into the candace owens and election hoax bs hard and yet...eats brunch like every weekend with his gay married son and his husband. He has never had any issues with gay people. He either cant make the connection between voting republican and the anti-gay policies...or he doesnt care. Cognitive dissonance is what ends up happening.

Republican officials on the other hand? Genuine evil, like demons wearing human skin evil. They know whats up, they understand the game, I feel well within the bounds of reality to call them a party of pedos and rapists. Just look at what happens everytime someone gets found out for being a creep, rapist, pedo, racist, transphobe, etc...they immediately grift to the right. Russel brand, jk rowling, andrew tate, elon musk, dr disrespect, etc.

Half the country at any point in history thought something depending on the era be it not really caring enough to end slavery, not thinking women should vote, not seeing anything wrong with child marriage, not thinking gay people should be able to adopt/marry/donate blood... its really not hard to think that a vast swathe of the country is just straight up dealing with pedo brain. With how conservative media places fertility and purity on a pedestal and all the weird comments from people like Walsh about how the real problem with teen pregnancy is them not being married...not to mention how a lot of our older media was really flippant with consent and sexualizing minors, its a wonder if we made out with less than half not dealing with it.",1722470541.0

"LinkedInLunatics","t5_25tcjz","**Title:** *ICU Sales Cycle*

---

**INT. HOSPITAL ICU - DAY**

*The scene opens in a dimly lit ICU room. Machines beep softly, keeping rhythm with the labored breathing of SANJAY’S MOTHER, who lies unconscious on the bed. SANJAY, mid-30s, stands by her side, visibly exhausted but holding an iPad in one hand, while nervously scrolling through a presentation with the other.*

**NURSE (mid-30s, calm demeanor):**  
Mr. Sanjay, your mother's condition is critical. You should probably be by her side.

**SANJAY:**  
Oh, I am. But this presentation is crucial for closing Q3 strong. She’d understand—she was a small business owner herself.

*The NURSE gives SANJAY a puzzled look, unsure of what to say, and quietly leaves the room. SANJAY’s phone buzzes, and he glances at the screen.*

**SANJAY:**  
(whispering) Oh no... the weekly sales sync.

---

**INT. ZOOM CALL - SANJAY'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY**

*Sanjay, off-camera, quickly joins the Zoom meeting. His name appears in a black box, ""Sanjay (no video)."" Several other squares pop up, all showing colleagues. KAJOL (early 40s, stern, always polished), the sales manager, commands the screen.*

**KAJOL:**  
Sanjay, why is your camera off? You know our policy on engagement.

**SANJAY:**  
(muted, whispering to himself) I can’t let them see where I am…

*He hesitantly clicks the “start video” button. His screen flickers to life, showing him in the ICU room with his mother in the background. The others in the meeting fall silent, shocked.*

**KAJOL:**  
(visibly irritated) Sanjay, this is highly unprofessional. We’re discussing pipeline targets and closing techniques, not personal drama.

**SANJAY:**  
I’m sorry, Kajol, it’s just... she doesn’t have much time left.

**KAJOL:**  
(sighing) Look, I’m not going to fire you. But this—this shows a lack of focus. I’m cutting your salary by 15%. Consider this a lesson in balancing empathy with performance. This is a *compassionate* move, Sanjay. Don’t apologize for being human.

---

**INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - LATER THAT DAY**

*KAJOL, walking out of the hospital, types furiously on her phone. We see her LinkedIn post being composed:*

**KAJOL (V.O.):**  
Just made a tough call today. Cut an employee’s salary because they were attending a Zoom meeting from their dying mother's ICU room. Empathy in B2B sales means making sure your team learns the importance of focus, even in the face of personal challenges. This is what true leadership looks like. #CompassionateLeadership #B2BSales

*She hits “post” and walks out, self-satisfied. Meanwhile, back in the ICU, SANJAY is slumped over in a chair next to his mother’s bed.*

---

**INT. HOSPITAL ICU - LATER**

*Enter DR. PATEL (50s, seasoned, no-nonsense), the attending physician, who walks in and sees the state SANJAY is in.*

**DR. PATEL:**  
Sanjay, I need to talk to you.

**SANJAY:**  
(weary) Is it about my mother?

**DR. PATEL:**  
No, it’s about B2B sales.

*Sanjay looks up, confused.*

**DR. PATEL:**  
(angry) I saw Kajol’s LinkedIn post. How dare she. She thinks she understands B2B sales? She wouldn’t know value-based selling if it hit her in the face!  

**SANJAY:**  
(surprised) Wait, what?

**DR. PATEL:**  
This situation is the perfect analogy for why understanding your customer’s pain points is crucial. Kajol thinks cutting your salary makes you more focused? No, it just destroys morale. In sales, like in medicine, you have to treat the root cause, not just the symptoms. Kajol’s “solution” was nothing more than a band-aid on a gaping wound.

*DR. PATEL gets closer, her voice low and fierce.*

**DR. PATEL:**  
If she truly understood B2B sales, she’d know that relationships are built on trust and understanding, not just closing deals. She’s playing checkers when the game is chess.

**SANJAY:**  
(softly) I thought the point was to not apologize for being human?

**DR. PATEL:**  
(more frustrated) That's the problem! These corporate types have twisted that mantra to mean ‘work harder, no matter the cost.’ But true sales leadership is about acknowledging humanity—yours and your customers’—and building something meaningful from it.

*The words hang in the air as SANJAY processes this. DR. PATEL, with a final stern look, walks out, leaving SANJAY alone with his thoughts and his mother.*

---

**INT. ZOOM CALL - LATER THAT WEEK**

*The screen shows a new Zoom meeting. SANJAY is now in a sterile office background, but his demeanor is changed—more serious, more focused. KAJOL is leading the call again.*

**KAJOL:**  
Alright, team. Before we start, I just want to reiterate our commitment to balancing empathy with performance. Remember—don’t apologize for being human, but also don’t forget what’s at stake in our sales cycle.

**SANJAY:**  
(muting his mic, whispering to himself) I think I finally get it.

*He clicks to raise his virtual hand, ready to speak up, but hesitates. The screen lingers on his raised hand as the meeting drones on.*

---

**FADE OUT.**

**TITLE CARD:** *""Don't Apologize for Being Human""*  

*Screen fades to black as a LinkedIn notification pops up: “Kajol shared a new post.”*

It's crazy to me that so many people are so willing to accept anything someone says with no attempt at researching that thing.. like I will never believe something someone says unless I actually know it's true by doing my own research 

Also horrifying that the people/things that the masses buy into are usually detrimental to other humans or the planet in general.. like the person trying to convince me that climate change wasn't real and no one should do anything like recycling or reducing meat consumption or being against single use plastics because that was ""woke propaganda"".. like what would anyone get from trying to save the earth other than the earth continuing to exist?

There's not really any point in asking for recommendations, you just get someone else's subjective opinion. People who prefer sopranos usually say it's about the jingly Hawaiian sound, and because it's little it's easy to take around. Tenor players talk about the greater range and fuller tone, and that pretty much all modern professional players play tenor. Concert players like that their uke can sound like either.

"CATHELP","t5_2ryza","Cats don't know they are fixed. So it's not a matter of ""doing it for fun."" They don't understand they can't reproduce. It lowers their hormones, yes. But it doesn't  get rid of all urges to mate, bc they have other sources of testosterone. Some fixed males will absolutely still ""mate"", they just can't physically reproduce. My male cats when I was younger sometimes would try, but the fixed females wouldn't be in heat so they wouldn't let them. But when i stayed with family one time and had to take my unfixed female with me, the male did initiate (and succeed. We were all woken up to a loud surprise that night). The male was fixed, and a bit older, and lived with a fixed female cat and had never tried so didnt think much of it since he hadnt tried in years. But he did when the unfixed female was brought into the house. It's also a similar thing when the cats use their toys for uhm personal time. 

When you neuter a male you get rid of their main source of testosterone but not their only source. So they still have the hormones, just less of it. I want to say it's effective like 80% of the time? 85%? Of lowering the levels enough to mostly stop aggressive/sexual behaviors. Just depends on the cat.  And how late they were fixed can play a role due to learned behaviors. It's harder to stop a cat from spraying for instance, once it's already started.",1722470543.0

Like its enough for us all to live on even if it was not meant to support 5 people, so well make it work to reduce our overall familial labor input.

I agree it is a weird feeling combining the professional and personal in that way. i do think for the right kind of people they can see it as family care giver support rather than “my paycheck as a transaction”.

  It looks like you’re posting about side effects. Did you know that the most common side effects can be found on the Zepbound website? Simply click [here](https://zepbound.lilly.com/how-to-use) for more info. Below is also a list of common side effects. 

* **Nausea**
* **Diarrhea**
* **Constipation**
* **Stomach (Abdominal) Pain**
* **Indigestion**
* **Injection Site Reactions**
* **Fatigue**
* **Allergic reactions**
* **Belching** 
* **Hair Loss**
* **Heartburn**

 While these are some of the most common side effects, this isn't all of them. Truth is the medicine affects everyone differently, but most see some or a combination of these common effects. Be sure to visit the search bar for something specific or click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/search/?q=side%20effects&restrict_sr=1) for all post regarding side effects. A lot of good remedies for certain side effects can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/search/?q=side%20effects&restrict_sr=1). 

 According to the manufacturer ""In studies, most nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting occurred when people increased their dose—but the effects generally decreased over time.""

 Not everyone responds well to this medication. If side effects are continuous and impacting your everyday life, you should consult your dr or healthcare provider for strategies on how to mitigate these outcomes. 

 Complications from this (or any) treatment are usually a result of ignoring persistent side effects.

Wrongly or rightly, these murders are seen as domestic, ""nothing you can do about it"", somewhat expected. Feminists often take issue with police statements that describe these types of killings as ""isolated"", even though they happen about 80 times a year.

A guy, deliberately seeking a child's dance class, when he has no relation to any of the kids, and trying to stab them all to death and their teachers too*, is very unusual, more similar to a terrorist attack than a domestic abuse murder. I'm not surprised that people are angry.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw",">Most of the “negative things” about Islam are not in our holy scripture.

Okay, these are-

Quran (33:50) - ""O Prophet! We have made lawful to thee thy wives to whom thou hast paid their dowers; and those (slaves) whom thy right hand possesses out of the prisoners of war whom Allah has assigned to thee"" This is one of several personal-sounding verses ""from Allah"" narrated by Muhammad - in this case allowing a virtually unlimited supply of sex partners. Other Muslims are restricted to four wives, but they may also have sex with any number of slaves, following the example of their prophet.

Quran (23:5-6) - ""..who abstain from sex, except with those joined to them in the marriage bond, or (the captives) whom their right hands possess..."" This verse permits the slave-owner to have sex with his slaves. See also Quran (70:29-30). The Quran is a small book, so if Allah used valuable space to repeat the same point four times, sex slavery must be very important to him. He was relatively reticent on matters of human compassion and love.

Quran (4:24) - ""And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess."" Even sex with married slaves is permissible.

Quran (8:69) - ""But (now) enjoy what ye took in war, lawful and good"" A reference to war booty, of which slaves were a part. The Muslim slave master may enjoy his ""catch"" because (according to verse 71) ""Allah gave you mastery over them.""

Quran (24:32) - ""And marry those among you who are single and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves..."" Breeding slaves based on fitness.

Quran (2:178) - ""O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female."" The message of this verse, which prescribes the rules of retaliation for murder, is that all humans are not created equal. The human value of a slave is less than that of a free person (and a woman's worth is also distinguished from that of a man).

Quran (16:75) - ""Allah sets forth the Parable (of two men: one) a slave under the dominion of another; He has no power of any sort; and (the other) a man on whom We have bestowed goodly favours from Ourselves, and he spends thereof (freely), privately and publicly: are the two equal? (By no means;) praise be to Allah.' Yet another confirmation that the slave is is not equal to the master. In this case, it is plain that the slave owes his status to Allah's will. (According to 16:71, the owner should be careful about insulting Allah by bestowing Allah's gifts on slaves - those whom the god of Islam has not favored).

Quran (4:89) - ""They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another). So take not Auliya' (protectors or friends) from them, till they emigrate in the Way of Allah (to Muhammad). But if they turn back (from Islam), take (hold) of them and kill them wherever you find them, and take neither Auliya' (protectors or friends) nor helpers from them."" Verse 4:65 says that those who have faith are in ""full submission"" to Muhammad's teachings. This verse explains what should happen to Muslims who do not ""have faith"" and (along with verses 90-91) do not agree to banishment and subjugation. (See the ""Why They are Wrong"" section of this response to apologists for a deeper analysis).

Quran (9:11-12) - ""But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge. And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist.""

Other verses that seem to support the many Hadith that establish the death sentence for apostates are Quran verses 2:217, 9:73-74, 88:21, 5:54, 9:66.

Quran (7:80-84) - ""...For ye practice your lusts on men in preference to women: ye are indeed a people transgressing beyond bounds.... And we rained down on them a shower (of brimstone)"" - An account that is borrowed from the Biblical story of Sodom. Muslim scholars through the centuries have interpreted the ""rain of stones"" on the town as meaning that homosexuals should be stoned, since no other reason is given for the people's destruction. (Inexplicably, the story is also repeated in three other suras: 15:74, 27:58 and 29:40).

Quran (7:81) - ""Will ye commit abomination such as no creature ever did before you?"" This verse is part of the previous text establishing that homosexuality as different from (and much worse than) adultery or other sexual sin. According to the Arabic grammar, homosexuality is called the worst sin, while references elsewhere describe other forms of non-marital sex as being ""among great sins.""

Quran (26:165-166) - ""Of all the creatures in the world, will ye approach males, ""And leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your mates? Nay, ye are a people transgressing""

Quran (4:16) - ""If two men among you are guilty of lewdness, punish them both. If they repent and amend, Leave them alone"" This is the Yusuf Ali translation. The original Arabic does not use the word ""men"" and simply says ""two from among you."" Yusuf Ali may have added the word ""men"" because the verse seems to refer to a different set than referred to in the prior verse (explicitly denoted as ""your women""). In other words, since 4:15 refers to ""your women"", 4:16 is presumably written to and refers to men.

>It’s just idiots passing down their own made up crap over generations.

I mean, yea, it’s a religion.

>Women have more rights in actual Islam than it seems.

This is like arguing indentured servitude is good because at least it isn’t slavery… which is also completely okay per your religion.

Islam was a cult founded on its founder fucking (consent not needed) and warring their way across the region. If you look at the Quran with that in your head, it makes a lot more sense.",1722470544.0
"Music","t5_2qh1u","It's not really about sides. The essence of punk has always been anti-authoritarian.

It just so happens that the current manifestation of the Rupublican party is becoming increasingly authoritarian.

American Idiot dropped in 2004 when Bush was in power and was clearly a critique of the way american society was headed under his leadership. That said, Green Day is not pro-Democratic party either. Keep in mind the Democrats in 2004 supported the war on terror and the patriot act etc.

An ""old key board jockey"" + ""not well versed at VBA"" statement ought to get some reprimands from the community who did move into modern techniques.

So first, venture in to building a character style with above settings, e.g. name is as ""*BookmarkHyperLinkFormatting""*

to which you even can assign a [shortcut key without](https://cybertext.wordpress.com/2021/11/05/word-apply-a-keyboard-shortcut-to-a-style/) any VBA ^((dig around in the format part of 'modify style'. There the option to assign a short cut is present. The CTRL + SHIFT + any character are often available to take))

Which then allows you to:

* delete any of these applied to a selection with [CTRL +1](https://lawyerist.com/news/fix-microsoft-word-formatting-instantly/)
* modify all instances just by updating the style itself, should you want to empasize it differently
* do this without the VBA at all, as essentially it is core technology.",1722470544.0

If the receipt does not show a charge for an oversize grave, you can be sure that you were not provided with an oversized liner. 

Generally, a regular sized crypt or liner is around $875.00, while an oversized crypt is approximately $1100.00. It almost sounds as though the cemetery is trying to charge you double. It seems that should you have to pay, you should only pay the difference between the two costs. 

If this is a privately owned cemetery, I would go to the cemetery board and plead your case to have the additional fees waived. 

If the cemetery is owned by a municipality, then go to the appropriate department manager and plead your case. And if it’s owned by municipality, then somebody higher up the food chain, such as the mayor, can waive the additional fees.",1722470545.0

Junk and Hanzo feel HORRIBLE to play now that they can't even one-shot. I understand the spamming at choke playstyle isn't particularly skillful or anything, but at least with Hanzo, he feels awful because he was supposed to be the projectile sniper. They even nerfed his projectile speed and log hitbox in OW1 to make him feel more skillful and make the one-shots more satisfying (I think they reverted these changes in OW2). Doing 225/250 damage only for it to get healed up immediately feels so unrewarding and makes it so that no one picks him as much as they used to. 

Having a second tank to make these characters playable again, keeping their threat factor but also having obvious counters would be the best direction they could go in.",1722470546.0

You can have multiple, different circadian rhythms going on in your body at the same time (technically each cell has one) and if they happen to sync up for a day who knows if that trips you up or not.  Or maybe the opposite happened and you were fully in sync but one part unsynced because it's extra sensitive to something and it takes a couple days to realign.

"CatastrophicFailure","t5_38tab","For goods and services sure, for the average commuter it takes 2-3 times as long and is notoriously unreliable with their timing which makes it hard to rely on for things you can’t be late for 

I used to take busses/trains to exams and I would always make sure I had someone that could come pick me up if the P.T. just didn’t show up, if you’re late to an exam they aren’t letting you in and you’ve just wasted 12 weeks of uni and $1500+ 

I was late to work all the time when I took P.T. Because they were so inconsistent, I’d arrive 25minutes early one days and 15 minutes late the next, even getting the EXACT same train / bus each day 

Then you have to worry about the ridiculous payment system (atleast in Australia) that hardly ever fucking works and you have to remember to top up your card in advance since the system is so dogshit 

This isn’t even considering replacement P.T during constructions, having to get to/from a train station (so either live close or get in your car and drive/park anyway..), other people ruining the experience (literal junkies fighting), disgusting slobs leaving messes everywhere

On others the tree branches are so low you have to crouch to get through and your head still hits branches. Some sidewalks are so uneven that it’s safer to walk on the street. Sometimes you have to avoid a sprinkler pointing the wrong way, glass shards, feces, or a dead animal. Sometimes a homeowner’s fence is low and there is a menacing dog trying to jump it. Oh, and when winter comes, many people don’t shovel their sidewalks so it becomes too dangerous and slippery to walk there.

They might want to look at the real world application between the 2 groups.

One is an individual the Kingdom of heaven is within them, it's the way they chose to live their life.


the other is mandated authoritarian and violent.  There is suffering each individual has a price and a value they are assigned a number even in socialized medicine and individual is a scientist a score of value that they provide society.  Every week across America every hospital has a meeting discusses who lives who dies, who gets what medication who does not.

Hospitals SOP for covid had 50, even as high as 70% death rate. 

In New York DJT sent the ship mercy to help the governor Cuomo mandated forced infected elderly out of the hospital into the nursing homes, the nursing homes were forced to accept them. their calls and pleads for help even specifically to go to the ship mercy were transferred away as they died.


It seems the OP is propagating for government oversight of Christianity as a religion and form of government. meaning a lengthy book the Catholic or Christian Canon of religionn, only. are they allowing other sects like we see with jewish religion.


Although when they were surrounded by Romans. Jewish murdered each other didn't even take their food, they would simply burn it.  There's some very violent sectors of that religion


****

It's called marxism it's not communism it's not socialism it's marxism. anything else allows them to say well that wasn't real communism if they were in charge it would have worked.  The difference between marxism and zionism is religion the 2 founders worked side by side and argued over it. at that point there became the split they can either allow one religion or no religion.

Radicalized Christianity should look something like socialism but it’s almost always the opposite

Feed the hungry? Heal the sick? Clothe the naked? Welcome the refugee? Love your neighbor? Turn the other cheek? Give to the poor?

If the gospel of Jesus was radicalized and taken to the extreme it would look like socialism, or at least something like it. And yet so many Christians, at least in the US, are right wing extremists that hold beliefs that are arguably on opposite end of the spectrum.

Aniseya was consistently against fighting the Jedi; while at every turn, Koril was trying to engage in or promote conflict (including coaching Mae in what's obviously Dark Side technique). 

The other thing I didn't realize until the last episode was that: Until Sol saw Osha under the Bunta tree, the Jedi had no way of knowing anybody lived on the planet. In fact, they DID think it was uninhabited (despite Aniseya's chiding).

On the other hand, Koril was VERY aware that the Jedi were there, and she even hinted that she knew they had been there for some time (which was one reason she was being so paranoid and indignant). 

I don't know if Qimir was there, at that time; but I suspect Plagueis was there, and did, in fact, interact with at least Koril. (if not, also, Aniseya - in the creation of the Twins).  And it was under Plagueis' guidance that Koril was instructing Mae (if not both twins) in use of the Dark Side. 

Koril was going to start shit with the Jedi, no matter what Aniseya said or did.  And it was probably under Plagueis' direction, I'd bet.",1722470547.0

Air pistol shooting is more ""layed back"" compared to air rifle shooting. Most shooters just wear track pants or shorts with a short sleeve top. Fancy athletic clothing if you will. Shooters either place their non shooting hand in their pocket, waistband, or they have a belt they can loop their thumb on.

This scenario is a 9 rating per https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2438111/star-difficulty-levels. I went Win-Loss-Win-Win to meet my win condition on this scenario. Here is my final iteration of the deck. Much like CM, I had not played as She-Hulk since January probably when I first played the game. I went with Aggression for the Minion control and because I didn't want to just stick with Justice in all solo plays.

Here is my deck : [https://marvelcdb.com/deck/view/758998?deck\_name=She-Hulk%20Solo%20Champions%20League%20S1%20R2](https://marvelcdb.com/deck/view/758998?deck_name=She-Hulk%20Solo%20Champions%20League%20S1%20R2)

Brawn was key for killing drones and keeping threat down, as well as Lockjaw for emergency thwarting. I think I was able to keep it on scheme 1B for a long time which I find most useful for Ultron. Hall of Heroes was also useful and once the scheme popped to 2A/B I could take some AE breaks to take advantage of HoH card draw. I really like to stay on 1B scheme so I do not take many or any AE chances there. Jarnborn is also key but I did not build around fist resources, mostly counting on Relentless Assault to do my damage to the villain.",1722470548.0

"beermoneyuk","t5_359qr","Penfold is a UK pension provider that launched in 2019 and is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. They describe themselves as a modern, flexible and faff-free digital alternative to traditional pension companies, enabling customers to track their pensions easily via their website or their smartphone app.
The website and the app are both easy to navigate, clearly displaying the value of your pension and transaction history. You can also easily change between the funds that Penfold offer, including a sustainable fund that only invests in environmentally and socially sustainable companies. 

**[REFERRAL LINK WITH £25 BONUS](https://account.getpenfold.com/refer/christopherbrimyard)**

Penfold are currently offering a £25 bonus for anybody that signs up using a referral link to open a pension with them and deposits £25. It's important to note that because this is a pension, the deposit and your bonus are locked away until you are 55, this is retirement beer money. It can, of course, be transferred into other pensions that you may already pay into, and if you don't have a pension this may be the most important beer money offer you ever do.

1. Sign up to Penfold using the referral link to ensure you earn the bonus
2. Verify your identity
3. Make a £25 deposit, this can be done by debit card, or you can set up a direct debit if you want to make regular contributions
4. Your £20 referral bonus from Penfold will show as a pending transaction on your account activity. Mine was confirmed 14 days later.
5. Your £6.25 deposit tax relief and £5 bonus tax relief will show as pending transactions and will show when they are expected to be paid.
6. Once all the bonuses have been paid, your £25 deposit will have resulted in £56.25 being paid into your pension.

Penfold have a very simple fee structure. They charge an annual fee of 0.75% for all of the funds they offer, except for the Shariah fund which is 0.88%. There are no fees for  anything else, including deposits, fund purchases, transfers, etc.

You need to pay in £25 to earn the sign-up bonus, but future payments into your pension can be as low as £1. Pension contributions are subject to tax relief from HMRC, so for every £1 you contribute you get an additional £0.25 added to the pension.

So to give a little background I have been best friends with Andres Me, Dereck for 4 years. We have beenfriendsfor4years.We met around some school cabins at our previous school and we had things in common like playing the same games and being the same race and all of that stuff. Life was good until a major event occurred when I switched schools. I went there for a few months then switched back. After I switched back I met back with A and we had a fun time. We went on a school trip with the same staff at the event. Then we graduate and move to the next grade. Here is when problems start to arise. We hung out in my house before and then we went to the forest next to our community just to explore .a few sometimes we do that. We started hanging out more often. Here's the first problem the reason why he wanted to hang out more is because he used me for to go to the forest. .



Anyways we were friends until December of2022 I was getting picked on by other people (btw I hated them with a passion).It was night time when the problem occurred. Andres said we couldn't be friends anymore and  because he was getting bullied because he was my friend. It kind of bothers met hat people leave their friends just to fit in after I cried all of that stuff happened. We were both in a friend group of 4 names are (Kenith and Justin) we barely talked to each other until May of last year while we were in school season he asked to be friends again I said yeah. Healing myself and picking up the pieces was difficult but we were alright it was until 2024 of this year we went to a new school we played fornite together but he made new friends not bad but when I wanted to play with him but he said no I asked to join him and he used me again for gifts it was rinse and repeat just for me to play with him I reached my breaking point and then I was like no i am not dealing with this crap so I cut him off. Oh btw we are going to the same school this year and might encounter again but don't worry I have other friends. And I did everything and our friendship made the first move planned everything and was the glue of being together .I was just tired and broke it off .I am not trying to be a narrcist when I said I did everything I just wanted something better

I could be the asshole in this situation of not talking it out with him instead of just dropping him

Was riding down main st in the small, drug-ridden town over from the small, farm-oriented town I grew up in. 

Some woman had disheveled dark floofy hair (it was prob like 1995-96) with a black bra and panties on, stilettos, and had wrapped herself up in some sort of cling on food safety wrap, and made it into a tube style mini dress. 

But as it was see through, I was so confused to her outfit, so I asked my mom why she had food wrap as a dress and everyone can see her underwear. Well, I got my answer!

Either way, it’s an easy fix for them to just rebill the claim to the correct insurance; make sure to reach out to their billing dept (if they have one).

Decided to journal all daily salt content of food. I also put 12g of salt in a small screw-top jar and used this for all my sprinkles and for adding salt in my drinking glass. 

I Weighed the little jar at the end of the day many times. I was aghast at the results. It was about 6g of salt per day (which is only 2.4g sodium). 

I have been using 8-15g of salt per day the last 2 years now depending on movement and climate. Keto might need even more at times.

Important to note: Salt as in NaCl is not equal to Sodium!

One gram of Salt contains 0.4 grams of Sodium.  
The conversion factor is 2.5

Writings on the net are often sloppy with this distinction.

Suggestions to upgrade to a significantly more powerful 7800 XT for $1030. Changes include:
* **CPU Cooler**: A 240mm AIO should be plenty for your use case. You can get the 360mm version if you want for $10 more, but it’s not a necessity.
* **Motherboard**: Z690 with WiFi and Bluetooth for about the same cost (so you can play with overclocking if you wanted).
* **Memory**: Less expensive same spec RAM.
* **Storage**: Better spec less expensive drive (similar speeds, HMB, but with much bettter endurance ratings using TLC memory vs QLC for the Crucial).
* **Video Card**: Upgraded to the 7800 XT which will perform about 46% better than the 6700 XT at 1440p based on [these Techpowerup benchmarks](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-radeon-rx-7800-xt/31.html).
* **Case**: I like the Phanteks better as it comes with four 140mm PWM aRGB fans (vs the Montech with the same number of fans, but only the front three are aRGB) while being similar in size.
* **Power Supply**: Unless you’re going to get the next 5090, you don’t need 1000w; 850w is plenty and saves some cost.

"Global_News_Hub","t5_al4o0f","Well said, that’s why I put “white” in quotes. The world sees the Irish as being white today though and the value of having “white” people advocating for Palestine can’t underestimated. 

Ironically a big part of the reason the Irish team didn’t shake hands with the Israelis is because their coach called them anti-Semitic in advance of the game (their players also posed with IDF soldiers with guns which didn’t help.) 

The Irish seem very comfortable with knowing they are not anti-Semitic so any bs accusations from Israel don’t have any impact on them.

My guess is that they are using real paperwork, just using someone elses.

Im guessing the friends wife then files the tax return and pockets that money. 

There are likely also cases where the actual person has moved back to their country for whatever reason. I doubt the irs is matching up flight records to work records as long as they are getting paid their taxes.

I used to hand out the checks on friday and names of workers wouldnt always match the names on their checks. And im not talking using a white name instead, the guys were still using an african name that didnt match the one on the check.",1722470549.0

Your defense of Trump, while selectively highlighting his acts of charity, ignores his numerous controversial statements and actions that have been widely perceived as racist. Your attempt to paint Democrats as the sole manipulators of minorities is reductive and overlooks the complexities of voter behavior and political dynamics.

Fact check list



 in Trump’s first year in office during his presidency he instituted about [*two-thirds* of the policy recommendations](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) from the Heritage Foundation

  
Project 2025 was developed by the Heritage Foundation, a well-funded conservative think tank. Two of the people spearheading Project 2025 worked in the Trump administration.

The Heritage Foundation has authored Mandates for Leadership since 1980.

A comment from u//graneflatsis 

>Some facts about Project 2025: The ""Mandate for Leadership"" is a set of policy proposals authored by the [Heritage Foundation](https://pro-lies.org/the-heritage-foundation), an influential ultra conservative think tank. [Project 2025](https://www.mediamatters.org/heritage-foundation/guide-project-2025-extreme-right-wing-agenda-next-republican-administration)is a revision to that agenda tailored to a second Trump term. It would give the President [unilateral powers](https://theweek.com/politics/heritage-foundation-2025-donald-trump), strip [civil rights](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2024/03/the-heritage-foundation-dei-project-2025-trump-diversity-equity-inclusion-american-fiction-erasure), [worker protections](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2023/08/project-2025-gut-worker-protections-labor-department-heritage-foundation-trump-2024), [climate regulation](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/04/15/a-deep-dive-into-energy-plans-for-trump-2-0-00152281), add [religion into policy](https://thecause.substack.com/p/taking-project-2025-personally-with), outlaw [""porn""](https://www.salon.com/2024/03/19/decoding-project-2025s-christian-nationalist-language/) and much more.

>The MFL has been around since 1980, [Reagan implemented 60%](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership) of its recommendations, [Trump 64%](https://www.heritage.org/impact/trump-administration-embraces-heritage-foundation-policy-recommendations) - [proof](https://www.scribd.com/document/369820462/Mandate-for-Leadership-Policy-Recommendations). 70 Heritage Foundation alumni served in his administration or transition team. Project 2025 is quite extreme but with his obsession for revenge he'll likely get past 2/3rd's adoption.

[here’s an in-depth write up on Trump’s involvement](https://meidasnews.com/news/trump-falsely-claims-he-knows-nothing-about-project-2025)

 There's some [pretty convincing connections](https://meidasnews.com/news/trump-falsely-claims-he-knows-nothing-about-project-2025) between them.




[Trump PAYS for ads that feature Project2025](https://i.redd.it/jjzreqrzaqad1.jpeg)

:

Agenda 47 is Trump’s official agenda and is basically P2025 lite. It features many of the same policies.

https://www.donaldjtrump.com/agenda47

Trump also worked with the Heritage Foundation during his first term, and his own site references the foundation.

https://www.heritage.org/article/timeline-heritage-successes

In 2017, Trump was the keynote speaker at the Heritage Foundation’s Annual President’s Club meeting

https://www.heritage.org/impact/the-best-the-2017-presidents-club-meeting

> “The great Heritage Foundation has been at the center of several incredible tax cuts in American history, working closely with the Heritage Foundation, Ronald Regan cut taxes to unleash the economic miracle of the 1980s”
> 
> “this is our once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize our economy, revive our industry, and renew the American dream. The Heritage Foundation can once again help make history, by helping to take this incredible idea, this proven idea, this tax cut, making it a reality for millions and millions of patriotic Americans.”

But sure, he knows nothing about their project.


Also the 3 main people behind it (Paul Dans, Spencer Chretien, and Troup Hemenway),

they all used to work for Trump's administration. Those bios are on the associated websites.

[https://www.project2025.org/about/about-project-2025/](https://www.project2025.org/about/about-project-2025/)

[https://www.heritage.org/press/former-trump-appointee-troup-hemenway-joins-heritages-project-2025](https://www.heritage.org/press/former-trump-appointee-troup-hemenway-joins-heritages-project-2025)


Part of the plan is to get rid of most of the government officials in place, and to hire people loyal to Trump so that they can push their agenda.  That planning has already started.

[https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/13/trump-loyalists-2024-presidential-election)

https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/11/politics/trump-allies-project-2025/index.html

140 people who worked for Trump are directly tied with project 2025. 

He’s lying. Even if he’s not lying, which once again, he is, the people around him want it, as we have already seen and can see. His far right advisors will want it, his agency picks will want it. It’s more likely to pass with a Trump presidency, clearly. Best to defeat him to be safe.

The issue you raised is irrelevant to the moral baseline of veganism.  The life of a dying cat who is suffering is not more important than the lives of animals who were violently abused and killed to produce the animal products that you purchased to keep the cat alive.  

> Instead, you offered criticism completely unnecessarily. Do you know why? Because dead cats don’t eat animal products. In fact, they don’t eat anything!

Your cat is still alive currently, are they not?  

In the name of veganism, you have:

> criticized a grieving person about something that they clearly will not be doing anymore.

You are continuing to purchase animal products even now are you not?

> caused additional suffering to this person who is already deeply in pain (this is why you’re not vegan).

Your suffering is irrelevant to the moral baseline of veganism.  Veganism isn’t about you or me.  It is about the **unwilling victims**.  

> made yourself into a fool by assuming that a vegan, in a vegan subreddit, grieving about their dying cat, will continue to buy animal products after their cat is dead. 

Incorrect.  I made no such assumption.  You’ve clearly stated that you’re purchasing animal products right now while the cat is alive.  

> demonstrated your ineffectiveness, as well as callousness, by choosing a thoughtless approach about your target audience.

My target audience is those who profess or claim to be “vegan” while they purchase animal products.  

> proven that you are oblivious to basic human psychology, and also are not actually trying to improve the world. Instead, you just want to get an ego boost from judging others without trying to understand the context. Your superiority complex is showing.

1. Write to market and sterilize it.

2. Write to market and do your thing.

3. Don't write to market and either sterilize it or do your thing.

  
Option #1 will probably provide the highest chance for success given you do the \*asterisk stuff well.

Option #2 will probably make you happier, unless the only thing that will make you happy is extra money. If you're good at the \*asterisk stuff, your sub-market audience will find you. There is risk here as this audience will likely be smaller than the market in the genre or niche itself. Probably, but not necessarily. This one is like Schrodinger's Cat in way.

Option #3 is what most miserable self-published authors do, and most often why they fail outside of failing on the \*asterisk stuff above. Nothing really matters at that point.

Even if the trader booking the trade didn't know any of the information, because our firm knew - we would have been guilty of insider trading.

It's pretty easy to prove, if she was a member of a committee that voted on, or debated a topic that could move a stock. Then, did she (or her husband) book any trades prior to the vote?

Discussion posts should be thoughtfully crafted to encourage meaningful, civil, and constructive conversation; avoid low-effort requests for artist, song, or album recommendations. 

**Very short discussion posts are usually a sign of poor quality.** Please try again with more in-depth text in your self post. All discussion posts should be conducive to discussion, and not merely contain a statement, a multiple choice or otherwise basic question, or a prompt for brief or quick replies. Do not ask people to list off favorite songs, albums, artists, concerts, genres, or other musical tastes.

Discussion posts should contain a minimum of 200 characters, not including any URLs or links. Posts with URLs will need to be a bit longer, but links are encouraged when mentioning songs. The most successful discussion posts contain between 280 and 320 characters, include examples, and leave open-ended questions and broad subjects for commenters to talk about.

"Guiltygear","t5_2tiga","I think this mode would be perfect IF

They gave every character their own health bar, Marvel or DBFZ style

and had a mode without the skills list

The skills list made things so insanely chaotic that strategy was often thrown out the window in favor of just filling the screen with enough garbage to overwhelm the opponent, and mash assist if your main dude gets hit. Damage is too high for a single health bar and tagging out is so risky that it often lead to TOD situations out of nowhere for both myself and the opponent. Making it so everyone has a health bar and making it one round per game means everyone gets a chance to play, and to strategize. 

Even if you wanted to tag in, often times the point player would either not know how to tag out, or just refuse to tag out even if they were losing, so the assist players never get a chance to actually play the game as point. Its frustrating when you watch your random online dude on point get absolutely mauled and ignore every call to tag out. 

Aside from that, still had a blast. Was really fun to queue up with friends and im glad a FG is actually adding a co-op focused game mode for once",1722470554.0

Female protag games are either for folks who want to see one woman transform into the town's greatest and most depraved whore or for women who want to immerse into that kind of hedonistic, depraved character. If neither one interests you then female protag games just aren't for you.

The only game I tried that deviates from these two archetypes at least a little is ""Our Red String"" if you make the right choices, although it also leans into the modern, hedonistic woman fantasy.

Personally I don't play these games because I immerse myself in the story as the main character. Since I'm not a woman though, they just aren't for me.",1722470554.0

I immediately terminated the remote session when I realized what was going on and proceeded to change all of the passwords in my browser password manager. However, I realized at that point, that the tech already got hold of the data on my browser password manager and personal documents stored locally on my PC. He then proceeded to change passwords to the accounts he could gain access to. I managed to recover most of the accounts by changing the passwords to stronger unique forms and added 2FA with my phone and also made sure to delete any odd devices present in accounts that had a device list (Just in-case you were wondering, yes there was an odd device on my Amazon account).   
  
He is still trying to change my iCloud password till this day, and I know this because I often get notifications from Apple asking if I want to approve a password change on one of my devices. It is a shame that a company you entrust to protect you turns out to be the devil himself. I don't know how many other victims out there are dying in silence or simply in oblivion on what is going on. On the other hand, I refuse to remain silent to help save other potential victims.

For $20, I was able to buy 50 packs of PiP, Whizbang's mini set (which itself is $15), and a several gold packs to fish for another legendary. In addition to the tavern-pass only rewards.

"voiture","t5_2wx7z","Honnêtement avec ce budget, tu peux trouver d'excellentes Toyota hybrides (voire Lexus CT200h 🤩) propres. Je pense aux Auris voire Corolla ainsi que leurs versions break si la longueur supplémentaire te convient en échange d'un coffre beaucoup plus spacieux. Il y a aussi les Prius 3 et Prius+. Ou alors la Yaris hybride si tu veux vraiment un petit gabarit.

Dans tous les cas, ce sont des voitures ultra robustes et fiables (c'est pas pour rien qu'ils sont ultra populaire chez les taxis et VTC, ces voitures font +300k km sans broncher). Côté kilométrage on peut acheter à 200k km sans problème (modulo carnet d'entretien, CT, HistoVec etc comme d'hab).

La partie hybride fait que ça consomme peu (~5L/100km en conso réelle en ville en faisant vraiment pas attention, possible de descendre à 4 voire 3,5 sur les modèles après ~2015), et que la conduite en ville est ultra confortable.

Le seul potentiel problème est le vol de pot catalytique, mais avec 17k tu auras accès aux modèles récents qui ont assez bien résolu le pb (catalyseur situé en majorité dans la baie moteur), donc ce sont surtout les Prius 2 et 3 qui sont concernées.

Sinon avec 17k c'est un peu limite mais il y a moyen de se faire plaisir avec un Golf GTE, une hybride rechargeable de 204ch 😇🤩 Sinon j'imagine qu'une A3 essence moins puissante mais assez récente pourrait offrir un grand confort sans être porté sur la boisson ni énorme comme une berline, mais je ne m'y connais pas.",1722470557.0

In the year 1324, reaching age 85 at all was nearly an impossibility.  Age 5 was old enough to start working for money.

If average life span of Americans is now somewhere in the ballpark of 75, then 19 is young adult, 37.5 is middle age, 56 is old, and 75+ is elderly IMO.

Front is good for cleaning the wheel, but the rear needs a lot more maintenance with the chain, cleaning and adjusting.

Really the front all you're  doing is cleaning and occasional new tyre.

One of our other cashiers will never work anything but ASCO (we don’t have a mainline register, just ASCO, Lumber, OSLG, and Pro) because she doesn’t handle change well, but also because she gets more credit apps than the rest of us combined.

"Market76","t5_n9nn1","I agree it's not always like that, but it's often also a matter of how bad you want to get rid of it etc (as a seller). People who 'specialize' in junk are simply a different person to deal with than someone who doesn't (they may have to scrapoe the bottom of their stashed to get to it). And it's a matter of how the other perceives the trade and how you do.

Personally, even for ones I really like what the person has to offer, I try to keep the mindset of being very willing to walk away from the trade, even if it's the one item I've been eyeing for a while, on a lot of levels better for your position. Both from a negotiaiting perspective as your own mind. :D

My reasoning behind it is a bit two fold. Both, I don't want to pay to such an extend, and also 'learn' the other, you're often kinda lucky (not really the right word but best that comes to mind now after a few drinks) to find someone who is interested in what you have to offer in the first place (in my opinion too many are completely blindsided by whatever value something is supposed to have, completely ignoring the fact that if you find no buyer your value is worthless).",1722470558.0

**Bobby Lashley**. I'm not sure he's much use to many currently existing companies (big money but limited utility) and I'm not his biggest fan. If WWE let him go (which I expect they will) or already have, he's absolutely my pick.

But, for a new company trying to make a statement, bringing in the Hurt Business guys (Lashley, MVP, Shelton) would give me something to start building my company around and help legitimise that we are going to try and be a big name.

A few other names I know I'd probably want: Shelton Benjamin, MVP, Elijah, Trevor Lee, Raj Dhesi, Donovan Dijak (a number of recent WWE releases with some name value or utility to somebody starting out)

From there can fill out by trying to pull away AEW guys who are losing their value and finding talents on the Indies.

No big deal, I thought, I just went into the right lane, went around the limo and went back into the left lane again.

"nursing","t5_2ra72","His argument is not valid unless people are grabbing saline primaries without orders. Most places I have worked have standing orders that are modified per occasion when an infusion medication is ordered that typically includes an allowance for a primary crystalloid infusion. An order written as IVPB would insinuate that there is a primary to piggy back onto but if there is no specific order for that primary grabbing a random crystalloid is a no-no since you are making a determination as to what the proper crystalloid should be for that patient. 

Delivering medications without a primary is not unusual and done frequently in outpatient infusion centers and pretty anywhere outside of the hospital. Not all patients need a primary crystalloid infusion. You can pull the line from the pump and run it by gravity and still manage the infusion rate, thats what the roller clamp and drip chamber are for, again something commonly done outside of inpatient hospital units. 

If I saw an order for a piggyback without a primary I would call to clarify the order. If there are no standing orders I would ask leadership with the provider team to develop a set of standing orders for when IV medications are ordered, its safer and easier on everyone.",1722470559.0

"intj","t5_2qowo","I can't emphasis direct discussion enough. Do that instead of building your resentments up in private and avoiding confronting direct sources.   
  
Example:  ""We are going through \[x\] predicament right now. A led to B and B led to C and so on. This is my side of the story (what I think vs what I feel). What is your perspective and is there a way we can appease or compromise this? e.g. can you try to be a bit more compromising and I will try to do X and Y."" And please don't discuss it an embittered, unjustifiably emotional way, just get the point across.   
  
If someone comes to me with a problem they want me to work through with them, I would want to get to the root of trying to work past it if I find what they're proposing reasonable enough. I value honesty, just don't beat around the bush nor passive aggressive, but also don't act like you're entitled to a certain reaction from us when we're trying to process. If you're angry, sit with your emotions for a while until they pass. If there's resentment during the process of working things through it might ruin everything and we might just give up. Ideally you should be in a state where you're able to detach a bit and look at things from multiple perspectives rather than fixed on the negative emotions.   
  
Although be aware that not everyone is good at emotional consolation. I personally have more developed Fi than an average INTJ but still might struggle to find the right wording. I can guarantee that's not just an INTJ thing and that not all INTJs are necessarily like that. My mom (ISFP) and my ex (ENFP) were both horrible at emotional consolations. In my mom's case, her mother (my grandma) never told her she loved her and never hugged her once. And my ex got beaten up by her mom as a kid when she was displaying her emotions. It explains why they both suck at this. While not all cases are extreme, please acknowledge, everyone's got a story and insecurities (even though some stories come across as superficial to you, if it affects someone to make them that way to that extent, then maybe there's something); some have reasons as to why they struggle with emotions unlike you. Don't make it seem like we're just all cold pricks because a lot of us are very clearly sensitive inside. As long as you know you're not dealing with a psychopath or narcissist with barely any empathy to none, try and see multiple sides to the story.

If in the end it's a deal breaker for you or you know you can't achieve emotional consolation from him, get it from another source. you shouldn't rely on just one of your friends. If the friendship is no longer compelling you can part ways. Friendships aren't really like ""this person is obligated to do me something"", especially if they don't have the capacity for it. but if it's really draining because what you want's not met, don't force yourself to stay or be close to someone either. 

I hope it helps. I think your struggles are valid, so I hope you get to a good place either with that friend or with someone else.",1722470560.0

"aspiememes","t5_aeo7s","I don't think that this is overtly sexual outside of there being a female in the picture as there is no way to display a female with out a female present. You may find it arousing, but that is really up to things you find attractive. If an attractive person is doing anything they may be sexualized (internally by the viewer) even in the most mundane of situations.

&#x200B;

The human form is inherently sexual as the quality of sex is inherent to a given individual of our species. Looking past the the modern bullshit it makes sense that such things are as prevalent as they are due to our only empirical function (reproduction), sexual content is just integrated into society as it remains at the subconscious core, the whole and entire purpose of being.

As humans we are life, and as life we are part of the story of evolving chemistry which as a participant we continue through the perpetuation of ourselves. It is as simple as that.

The real issue in my opinion is the shielding of children from understanding the human for what it is so when feelings of sexuality later arise they are met with understand as opposed to the puritan disgust. I am not saying that children should be exposed to any porn or be exposed to Hollywood's disgusting masquerades of moral degeneration, Rather we should understand our own biology as we would the biology of the trees and animals. A fact of life that is incorporated into the intricacies of our complex species but not the dominant factor that has grip over the entirety of what your life is to be. It is a factor to be honest about, it is a factor to be understood, it is not a factor to be embellished, nor coveted in any higher esteem than using a toilet.

&#x200B;

We must be responsible for our own children and make sure they understand the media's display of sexuality as an immature display designed to entice people into mental lethargy. I believe that if more people had a better education of the functions of life there would be less low fruit in the media as they would see it for what it is. It wouldn't by any means fix it, but it would spare us looking at cheap displays of sex for the soul purpose of drawing attention and dollars.",1722470560.0

I had a CSM DQ me at the two mile run for the Pre Ranger PT test.  I was a POG that crew'd shithooks.  I was way out in front of those Infantry boys and CSM couldn't have that.  Was told upon crossing the finish that stepping off the track was the cause for my DQ.  I don't even recall stepping off the track, but I would rather kick a bull square in the nuts.  Before I ever argue with a CSM.  So I thanked him for taking corrective action and asked CSM, if I could run it again right then and there.  He approved laughing and off I went.  Shaved 15 seconds off my time from the first run.  I never told the poor bastard I ran on my highschool track team.  Four miles is just another day at track practice.  

After taking the Pre Ranger PT test three times and getting bumped twice so a officer could go.  I finally got my shot at Pre-Ranger (called RASP now I think).  Hated and loved every second of it, it made made me a better soldier and eventually a NCO.  I managed to get Honor Grad.  But turned and gave it to the Infantry shame shield standing next to me.  Honor Grad was a automatic ""Go"" to Ranger School ""back in the day"".  I was a POG...Infantry are tip of the spear.  The guy I gave it to was a hard charger.

When drying, use spacers between boards to allow even air circulation. I try to dry dimensional lumber for two weeks indoors before beginning a project. Avoid drying wood in direct sunlight, as the sun will dry the boards unevenly and cause exaggerated twisting and cupping. 

Your table saw can be helpful to get a squared board, but starting on a jointer ensures your boards are flat and square before you make any cuts. 

Using dimensional lumber for projects differs from rough construction. Projects require higher precision, whereas rough construction has lower requirements for precision, and allowing the lumber to dry is one of the best ways I know of to gain that precision.",1722470560.0

But it's like a clip of her being emotional during the last Fearnada in her hometown!  That has nothing at all to do with her crying over being anxious.

The documentary was over a long time, many if not all idols actually deal with these issues too I would imagine but they aren't all brave enough to show it to the world.
