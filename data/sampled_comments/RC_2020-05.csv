"ACIM","t5_2s5jj","Theology can be a contentious topic.  How much and what anyone can accept depends on where they are at.  Reality is not understandable from within the ego framework because we made the ego so as not to understand it.

* C-in.4. **The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give.** It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, “How did the impossible occur?"", “To what did the impossible happen?"", and may ask this in many forms. Yet **there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you.**

I walked in and she was sitting on her chair next to the little white plush rug, reading a book with a melting warm candle glowing next to her. I think Beau could be her buddy that walks together with her in the morning, down from the mountaintop to the hot springs while molly tells him all about her storybook as the sun just rises over the mountaintop. Beau is the guy who comes over during the harsh rainstorming nights to lay on the rug next to the fire while molly sweeps the table to get ready for dinner while thunder crashes outside. There isn't much said through words on these nights. However, being together on nights such as these transforms the thunder into nothing but a lulling, distant drum.  I think molly and beau will be the next two who pick up a mic together and anxiously try to sing along to rockstar or wandering. When beau stumbles over the  words he does not know yet, Molly will clap for him and let him know it's okay. If molly starts to feel down and starts to doubt herself, I know beau will come in and let her know no matter what, she can prevail and ""Go Beyond!"".  I think together, they can unlock pure curiosity,  adventure and the excitement of island life while they explore together. They'll be the best of neighbors and the best buddies for life.",1588291200

"Reformed","t5_2riuy","Communion with believers is \*always\* in the context of our union with Christ. It cannot be separated, particularly when we use the word Communion as a name for the Lord's Supper—it is first and foremost a description of our sharing in Christ through the sacrament, not in our physically sharing the same space (And hence, why I don't think this strain of argument has a place in the virtual sacraments conversation).

There IS a sense in which all believers commune together in taking the sacraments. The WCF (29.1) explicates on the link: 

&gt;...the Lord's Supper, to be observed... for the perpetual remembrance of the sacrifice of himself in his death; the sealing all benefits thereof unto true believers, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in and to all duties which they owe unto him; and, **to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other, as members of his mystical body.**

The headmods of both rIran and rIranian (rIran 2.0.) also share the same ideology. People had an exodus from r/Iran to r/Iranian when beloved mod rezsahin was banned. But then rezsahin got banned from r/Iranian as well because the headmod got into an argument with him over headmod's massive support for Russia, and 1am another beloved mod got banned recently as well along with a whole slew of the most active users. 

And they are now banning anyone who even mentions these events to the community. But the truth can't be silenced forever.

Both headmods routinely sticky talking points from Israelis and regime changers and deny the alternative (1Am was the last bastion remaining, and now they are both controlled by regime change opposition).

So there is now an exodus to r/ProIran, which has measures in place to ensure something like the other events never happens again.",1588291202

"assassinscreed","t5_2s6v6","Got this from an interview in reference to the mythology: 

Darby - ""The way we approach Norse mythology in Valhalla--we wanted to take a grounded approach, but we wanted to portray this culture as people who legitimately believed in these things. This mythology, this religion--it's infused in every aspect of their life. They bargained and bartered with the gods before raids, before feasts, before harvests. We wanted to portray that in as grounded a way as possible.

For somebody like Eivor--who in the midst of battle would believe these things about these gods--we felt they'd believe they could see Odin. We wanted to start from there, to keep the player swimming in that feeling. I'm not going to go too much further than that, but this is the same team that made Origins and our feeling about how to integrate [mythology] is similar. We want to create a similar feeling of being suffused in the mythology, but also the daily practice of this religion. Especially since you're going to be in England, which is a Christian nation. There were a lot of interesting frictions, but also some attempts at understanding one another.""

I, for one, could not be happier. Odyssey took things a little too far with the mythology imo. Origins had just the right balance.",1588291204

"ActionFigures","t5_2scrt","Thank you!  Glad you enjoyed them!So I have been collecting doll parts from primarily Amazon, Etsy and Ebay.

Amazon: best place to get furniture sets.  Just type in 1/12 and furniture, and you can find whole kitchen sets, living room sets, for something like 24 bucks.  I usually just use Amazon first, cuz they are the most cost effective solution.

Ebay: Ebay has a wider selection than Amazon; if you really need this specific prop, go here. Just type in 1/12 and whatever you are looking for: 1/12 and telephone, for example.

Etsy: So only if Ebay and Amazon don't have what I want, do I go to Etsy.  Etsy usually has the higher prices, because, understandably, a lot of their stuff is not mass produced, but hand-made by individuals.  But there are surprisingly good deals sometimes.

Special shout out to Retroldtech at Etsy, he makes very reasonable priced video game consoles (literally all of them), and can make whatever scale you want (1/6, 1/12, etc.)  Also, he is willing to customize, such as make specific screens for your switch.

Stores like ShoptOfMiraclesArt at Etsy has just about everything you can think of:  like an 8 piece set of pencils and clipboard, for 6.73 dollars, just scroll through their store.

I have a doll-house, which is basically 3 green walls and a floor, that I got from Etsy; I can't find my specific one anymore on the site, but I think you can just use three boards and a floor/paint them for similar effect.

However, djs\_dioramas at instagram makes diorama sets (3 wall/floor set), for very reasonable prices, and can customize them to colors/wall styling that you want.

I also installed windows/doors on some of my diorama sets.  So the diorama I got from dkasten004 was made of foam boards, so I just used a box cutter to open up holes in the diorama to install them.  Very messy/ugly holes, sure there is a better way to do it, but I don't really know what I am doing.  You can get 1/12 windows and doors just by typing ""1/12"" and ""window"" at Amazon, Ebay, etc.

On some of the series part, I use a storefront; I basically just bought a storefront facade and plopped it in front of the dollhouse, to make a ""store"" appearance.   I like it a lot because it has already installed plastic/""glass"" windows out of the box, and has a functioning door. Here is the listing for the storefront

I just looked at her and said, ""baby, you have big boobs too"".  She got all huffy and said with a generous helping of side-eye ""*not as big as hers*"" .  

I had no idea where this came from, but as I thought more about it, I can think of other times she's said things like that over the years. It's not like she's fat or ugly or ever had trouble attracting men either. She's still hot and thin by any measure and when she was younger she was an absolute smokeshow.

I did what the voice wanted and followed it into the kitchen. I was surprised to see a giant can of Chef Boyardee sitting in the middle of my kitchen. I stood there in amazement wondering what would happen next. Then he broke the silence and asked, ""Why haven't you been your Chef Boyardee my child. I said I didn't like Chef Boyardee anymore. He said I was lying and asked me to climb inside of him. I said no. Then, he pulled out a gun and said, ""Get inside of me or I will kill you."" I said ok and climbed inside of him. The Chef Boyardee was like quicksand, the more you struggle, the quicker you sink. After a while, the Chef Boyardee consumed me and I fell into a Chef Boyardee void. I fell for what seemed like hours, and then a white light consumed me, and I woke up laying on the floor in the kitchen. I was reborn. I was a new man. I stood up and said, ""Thank you chef."" He smiled, and floated into the floor. Ever since that night I have been eating Chef Boyardee for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. My friends don't like me anymore, because all I talk about is Chef Boyardee. But that didn't matter. I don't need them because I will always have my Chef Boyardee.",1588291205

Ff4's intro really sold it to me so I stuck with it for a good while, even though I'm not a fan of turn based combat. I've been tempted to get ff15 as it also isn't turn based and I enjoy the idea of the narrative progression it's going for, but I'll have to see.

Bloodborne is what I wish souls wanes were more like. Its just a bit more straightforward and quicker. I like the idea of being challenged, but clunky slowness combined with punishing difficulty isn't entertaining for me. Bloodborne's speed makes up for the punishing style of gameplay. Also the areas are more interrsting and straightforward, evoking a deeper interest and reaction from me that souls games do. I've yet to try sekiro but that too seems to fit what I want from a soulslike game but leaving behind what I don't like.",1588291205

He always looks so calm and cool on tv, but it was neat to see how calmly fired up he was over a 9-hole $5 match that we all know and love, hyping himself to hit a good shot, along with the passive aggressive shit talking to his opponent.

I've already got a sports bra and binder picked out, and can't wait to honestly look more middle of the road than anything.
I'd suggest Planned Parenthood if that works for you, and a PCP if that's not an option. The cost of HRT wasn't very high either, even without insurance, though that was through Planned Parenthood ($50 USD all in all).

Specifically OW, I'll crank my sound up to the point where I can ALWAYS here a Sombra walking any where near my team, I can get stuns off with McCree without ever seeing her.

But then some BITCH in voice chat screaming all game is asking why everyone sucks and it's probably cause NO ONE CAN HEAR ANYTHING but yO WHINNY ASS VOICE.

I have anxiety and I'll get super worked up the second someone starts talking shit to me, I'll start playing like utter crap because my hands just can't be still anymore. 

The only thing that calms me is straight up forgetting I'm in a game for a second, giving this shitty person a bit of their own medicine, and proceeding to go off whilst saying ""maybe if you shut up for a couple seconds and stopped talking (or typing if I'm not actually in voice chat) we'd actually stand a chance"".

Nothing shuts a man up faster than another man with a calm mindset and powerful words. 

If possible, (almost always is) you can make them look like an idiot with little to no repercussions.

I've only reported a few people in my time, and a couple days after nearly all of them, I've recieved an email stating that the person has been suspended or banned.

So me and my sister co-own a youtube channel and just recently we got onto the trend of having a tok-tok account.  Its actually not as bad as I thought and most of the videos are us just dancing or makeup type stuff.  me and my sister fight a lot and don't get along very often its nothing serious just sibling rivalry.  But anyways she wanted to post a couple dances and a make up tutorial to the account and right now I have not been in the best health wise and have a sore throat and I look like I am sick (don't worry its nothing bad).  But I told her no, she kept pestering me and told me to stop being a baby and get it over it.  It takes us almost an hour to make like 4-5 cause we either mess up or try to fix stuff.  I kept trying to tell her no that I'm not doing any tik tok dances with her and that I don't feel good.  After while my mom told us to be quiet, and now she's saying that I should have just humored my sister.  

AITA for not making tik-toks with my sister?

"dreamcatcher","t5_2u1sp","Agreed with everything you said here.

I think it's important to know that in K-pop, just because a certain group is doing a concept, doesn't necessarily mean that it's everyone in the group's favorite genre.

Of course, there's enough Dreamcatcher content out there where you can reasonably conclude that most of Dreamcatcher does indeed love their concept.

But to clarify, that also doesn't mean that it's their number 1 favorite concept of all time.  Jiu and Yoohyeon both seem to gravitate towards more pop concepts when given the choice to do what they want.  Dami loves hip hop, Sua I'm not 100% sure about.

Bisognerebbe ricordarsi che a “determinare” cosa sono, non è come io mi definisco, ma ciò che dico e faccio.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

Twitter said that this access could also be used by approved applicants working on crisis management, emergency response or communication within communities, as well as those developing machine learning and data tools to help the scientific community understand COVID-19.
Social media platforms have both introduced new policies to curb COVID-19 misinformation and warned that there may be errors due to their reliance on more automated moderation systems during the pandemic. Researchers studying the platforms have argued that the companies must collect data about this period.
European Commissioner Vera Jourova called Twitter’s move “a good step in the right direction.”
“Our cooperation and regular contacts with online platforms to fight disinformation are bearing fruit. I have constantly underlined the importance for researchers to have better access to useful non-personal data and tools,” she said.
Last week, 75 groups and individuals, including digital rights and free speech organizations, wrote an open letter to social media platforms asking them to preserve and publish their content moderation data.
However, Twitter said that once tweets were taken down, they would have to be removed from this COVID-19 data set.
Currently, Twitter’s free, public API access offers a small percentage of its full stream of tweets, although the company does provide greater levels of access to paying clients.
Twitter said it had never offered a full stream on a particular topic before, and that it represented tens of thousands of dollars per month in data.
Researchers will be able to access tweets created from the moment they connect to the data set, but it will not provide historical data.
In the blog post, it said that any developer or researcher with an approved Twitter developer account can apply for access to the COVID-19 stream endpoint, but they must meet a set of requirements, including that the use case supports “the public good.”
Applicants will also have to explain how they will protect the privacy and safety of people represented in the data.
Twitter said that researchers would be bound by its usual rules projects analyzing health-related topics, for example, not deriving or inferring information about a Twitter user’s health and not storing any personal data about such sensitive information.",1588291210
"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","That is a good nuanced view.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of fossil bones from the tail of ​Spinosaurus in southeastern Morocco that provided a deeper understanding of the appearance, lifestyle and capabilities of the longest meat-eating dinosaur on record.
“Spinosaurus had a highly specialized tail - a propulsive structure that would have allowed this river monster to actively pursue prey in the water column,” said University of Detroit Mercy paleontologist and anatomist Nizar Ibrahim, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.
Spinosaurus, which lived 95 million years ago during the Cretaceous Period, was a highly unusual dinosaur, and not just because of its staggering dimensions - up to 50 feet (15 meters) long and seven tons.
The anatomy of Spinosaurus had remained mysterious for decades after crucial fossils were destroyed during World War Two until the 2008 discovery of the Morocco skeleton, with the additional tail bones dug up since 2015.
Its tail was flexible with a large surface area thanks to a series of tall neural spines - different from the stiff and tapering tails of other carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus rex - indicating Spinosaurus and its close relatives engaged in tail-propelled locomotion unlike any other dinosaurs.
Laboratory experiments in which a plastic model of the Spinosaurus tail was attached to a robotic swimming device showed that the tail could move laterally to create thrust and power the animal through water like a crocodile, said Harvard University fish biologist and biomechanist George Lauder, a study co-author.
This indicates Spinosaurus terrorized rivers and river banks as a semi-aquatic animal, not merely wading into the water waiting for fish to swim by. It may have eaten huge fish, including sharks.
“This discovery overturns decades-old ideas that non-bird dinosaurs were restricted to terrestrial environments,” said Harvard University vertebrate paleontologist and biomechanist Stephanie Pierce, a study co-author. “So, yes, we believe that this discovery does indeed revolutionize our understanding of dinosaur biology.”
Spinosaurus still was able to move on land and lay eggs there, perhaps walking on four legs rather than two like other meat-eating dinosaurs.",1588291211

Yes, it does.  

The closest to a contrary take is hardware retailers' in-house study that does as much to justfy spending even more on a grinder as it does to justify not spending.  Grinding fresh still makes a huge difference, they just think that a nicer grinder makes even more of a difference.  

&gt;If I do get a grinder, which one should I get? I'd mostly be interested in manual ones since I live with roommates and wouldn't want to bother them with noise. I'm ideally looking to spend as little as possible to get a decent quality grinder, but am set on spending no more than $80.

Germany began easing its lockdown last week, when some shops were allowed to open provided they practised strict social distancing, but Chancellor Angela Merkel and government advisers are worried about the coronavirus infection rate rising.
The reproductive rate, known as ‘R’, is at just under one in Germany, Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said on Tuesday. That means one person with the virus infects about one other person on average.
Earlier this month, the rate was at 0.7.
In a joint statement, scientists from Germany’s Fraunhofer Society, the Helmholtz and Leibniz Associations, and the Max Planck Society must be kept low.
“The situation is not stable, even a small increase in the reproductive rate would take us back to a phase of exponential growth,” they said.
“Therefore, until a vaccine becomes available, the reproduction rate must be kept below 1,” they said, adding that “consistent contact restrictions” remained necessary.
Germany has reported 157,641 coronavirus cases but carried out early and extensive testing and the death toll has been relatively low at 6,115.
The education ministers of Germany’s 16 federal states agreed on Tuesday that schools would slowly reopen classes for all grades by the summer holidays, although pupils would have to work and learn in smaller groups.
Retailers with floor space of up to 800 square metres are now allowed to open, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookstores, though they must practise strict social distancing and hygiene rules.
Merkel will discuss the next steps for easing the lockdown restrictions in a telephone conference with the state premiers on Thursday, and again on May 6.

"steroids","t5_2rifm","~~If you go generic HGH, you’ll likely need to run double the dose to get the same effect as pharma.~~ **See u/DecaTest’s comment below.**

Tell her to stay away from clen—it’s bad news. Look up the cardio toxicity of it. u/DecaTest, can you link your studies?

My advice would be to stick with the Bronkaid (I’m very happy with it) coupled with caffeine or go with albuterol which is extremely cheap and can likely be found wherever she was going to get her clen. With a caloric deficit of 500-1000, the fat will melt off.

"makeyourchoice","t5_2w8em","A seems all right. It seems to be a very nice community, and their lack of modern art isn't much of a problem for me, even though the only video games you could probably get are basically their version of Civilization (good!) or *maybe* something like Breath of the Wild. The fact that their eugenics system is seemingly enforced by specifically non-violent means, with people just applying bureaucratically to gain reproductive capabilities, goes a long way towards making this a lot better than it could be otherwise. The real thing that determines whether or not this is a good choice is what counts as a ""radical"" alteration of one's being -- can their lifespans, at least, apply to me via their medical procedures? I can probably match them in terms of intelligence, depending on how far above normal humans they really are, but not physical capabilities.

B shuns responsibility. That's all I needed to know. I'm not going there.

C has a philosophy that sounds like a very extreme version of my own. I could probably do well there, generally. Not only could I acclimate to their culture quickly, but I think I could potentially become one of the powerful elite if I am very careful. That said, this society will absolutely obliterate the last shreds of psychological health and stability that I have left, and I can guarantee you that I would become a very, very evil person after not too long spent there. So it's not great, and staying home is better because I'm already on a pretty ambitious path in real life without compromising my own morals. 

D feels like it could have been my kind of place if I had gone a different direction in life and gotten involved with the military like most of my family. Overall, it actually seems pretty decent, with military training being pretty fair, soldiers having a decent life expectancy despite being soldiers, and a great emphasis on discipline. I'm too much of a critical thinker for this, though, probably -- and their conservative attitude towards gender roles means that working in the military (biodefense, maybe?) is really my *only* path to doing something useful with my life.

E sounds like a completely insane pulp adventure movie. I feel like I would actually be really socially isolated and lonely there, because *nobody* would be able to understand me and the way I think -- they're all either Bronze Age warrior types or crazy advanced supercomputers.

TL;DR: Either A or stay home.",1588291213

The three companies, which include firms of tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, will share $967 million from NASA.
Details on specific amounts each company will receive were not immediately known.
Boeing Co (BA.N), a NASA contractor and one of the companies that bid for this contract, was not selected.
Unlike the Apollo program that put astronauts on the moon 50 years ago, NASA is gearing up for a long-term presence on Earth’s satellite that the agency says will eventually enable humans to reach Mars.
The next manned mission to the moon will require leaps in robotic technologies and a plan for NASA to work with the three companies to design and develop human landing systems.
“We are following through on the president’s space policy directive,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said, calling the selection “historic”. 
Picking three providers allows NASA to have redundancy in case one company falls behind in development, Lisa Watson-Morgan, NASA’s human landing system program manager, told reporters on Thursday. ",1588291213

"TalkTherapy","t5_39dpu","that would be.. weird. therapists and counsellors MUST keep some notes. It's meant to be a way for therapists to not only keep a record of what transpires but also a way for therapists to formulate plans, consider case conceptualization and keep track of progress. they may be called up to reveal these notes only by court order but... since that may be a possibility, they have to do it. 

However it is also a tricky thing, some clients are uncomfortable with the idea that notes are being kept. It feels a little invasive. I remember being told there were notes but that I could see them if I wished. transparency was offered to me. I never did. I was uncomfortable with the idea. it took me awhile to actually bring that up, but when I did my therapist was willing to talk to me about my fears (that I'm being graded!) But I came to understand why they were being kept and it wasnt about therapists trying to use this notes to get me or analyze me, it mostly was to ensure the therapist was doing everything ethically and properly. 

The part about your comfort and feelings of safety is still key though. you have every right to bring up that her actions made you feel uncomfortable and if she is a good therapist she should be willing to discuss what she was doing, be willing to listen to you and consider alternatives. if she does not....if you are still uncomfortable, then she may not be the right therapist for you and if you do decide to seek someone else, you can tell the new T why you left the last one.",1588291213

"audioengineering","t5_2qkby","There is no magical threshold that determines what's recorded and what not. If you can't hear the noise, that means that it's too quiet to show up inside of the range of the meter. If you can't hear it, it jsut means it's too quiet for you to notice. The noise is still there though. 

Instead of aiming for less absolute noise, you want to aim for less noise in relation to your signal. We call this the ""signal to noise ratio"" ... or SNR for short.

To get the best SNR, you want to add as much gain imput as possible without clipping the input. In practice, there is no need to record extremely hot levels though.

Be careful when using compression. As the name implies, a dynamic range compressor compresses dynamic range, meaning it brings down the louder parts of a signal (like your voice), bringing them closer to the quiet parts (like the noise). So compressors decrease your SNR. 

One way to combat this is to record at a high SNR to begin with. You can also use a gate before the compressor to mute the noise while the voice is silent. If you are fancy, you can also use a denoiser.",1588291214

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

The Heritage palace completed its reconstruction in late 2015, to early 2016. The architectural structure and design elements of the palace, are what give it its label as the White palace, alongside the green landscape surrounding the marble building. The greenery which is consistently maintained, includes a garden, filled with marble figures, plants, flowers and palm trees, which accentuate the beauty of the entire property. The Palace, consists of six luxuriously designed rooms, which includes a suite. The furniture and marble were imported from exotic countries, such as Italy, Jaipur, and the city of Agra.
Located in Dhamdachha in the district of Gujarat, its location is at the epicentre of business in India. However, the exact location of the palace is what gives it a reason to be of such high tourist attraction. 
 The focus of the building, is directed towards the 1400 square foot lobby, which includes a gala hall, which transforms into a venue for Bollywood events and meetings. Over 100 Bollywood celebrities including Jay Bhanushali, Mahivij, Nawab Shah, Imran khan, Shahbaz khan, Sonali Raut, Anup Jalota, Khalid Siddique, Zulfi Syed, Haider Khan, Ishita Raut and Munna S have made appearances here for photo shoots, video shoots and launched events. It was recently in which actor Shawar Ali’s latest photo shoot with Libas, took advantage of the phenomenal views at this Palace. 

The White Palace has many facilities, including a guest house for visitors, families and celebrities from across the world. A library is also part of the interior, which contains books from some of the greatest authors in history, visitors are free to visit this library and make use of the wide range of literature on offer – the library especially helps as the royal family love to read books.
Rare copies of books with expired publications are stocked throughout the library, which adds a uniqueness to the feature. The royal families enjoy playing traditional games such as chess and polo – while visitors may access sports areas which cater for pool, table tennis and much more.
The lighting of the fountain out front is outstanding and perfectly complements the front viewing. The lighting gets even better at night as the cleverly constructed lights make for great viewing in the dark, great for parties and gatherings.
The building was kept white in colour to enhance its beauty, it was greatly inspired by the Taj Mahal in Agra, a classic piece of architecture. The White Palace in Gujrat is popular among tourists and locals alike, as a popular heritage spot – visitors often return more than once due to the convenient location.
The Palace itself holds lots of history due to being over 100 years old, it was recently renovated and named White Palace, hence the main aspects of the interior, and the exterior focus upon modern design and pronounced visual effects - Something that the Taj Mahal in Agra is well renowned for by residents, locals and tourists alike.
The Palace has a website associated with it, where potential visitors are free to access event history, as well as photo galleries of the building features.

"UTM","t5_2vz59","So the difference between ""tech"" jobs and ""non-tech"" jobs is essentially your portfolio. If you have a decent GPA, some cool side projects, and can show that you can work independently AND in a team, you're in the right room as they say. Some first year students do get internships, and their lack of experience on paper (i.e. only taken one year of courses) is made up for by a really, really good github/portfolio, where you can demonstrate your abilities. 

There is no straightforwards formula for landing internships, just like with any job in the real world, but a candidate who has what I mentioned above is probably in better shape than someone who just finished first year. 

My absolute pro-tip for CS jobs in general is that you need to demonstrate that you can communicate and work in a collaborative setting effectively. One of my parents works as an expert in the field of AI for a massive company, and my parent, as well as all of his teammates and peers all hold PhDs and have hired many, many people. I've heard first hand that being able to communicate alongside your technical ability makes a MASSIVE difference. Just something to think about :)

Personally I wouldn't worry about internships in your first year anyways - you're competing against upper years who have way more experience both with side projects (usually) and on paper, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't work out! If it DOES work out though, then congrats and good luck!! :)

We had had several email chains following the meeting confirming that we had taken action based on the decision made in that meeting, which every single member of the group had replied to at different points. 

Today, one member of the group insisted that he had no recollection that we had agreed to this plan, and it kind of threw everyone for such a loop that we couldn't contest it. It was right on the slide! It went to a larger body which also voted to approve it! But he's the guy who takes the minutes, and so the minutes (unapproved) reflect something totally different from what was decided.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

The discussions involved reforming of the functioning of the Ordnance factories, streamlining procurement procedures, focused resource allocation, encouraging R&amp;D/innovation, attracting investment in critical defence technologies and promotion of exports.
PM laid emphasis on positioning India among the top countries of the world in Defence and Aerospace sectors, from design to production, with active participation of public and private sector fulfilling the twin objectives of self-reliance &amp; exports. He reviewed the proposed reforms for attracting domestic and foreign investment in defence sector.
It was discussed that defence expenditure be economized and the savings be channelised for strategic defence capital acquisition.
Issues relating to defence procurement processes, offset policies, indigenization of spares, transfer of technology, attracting global OEMs to establish manufacturing facilities in India, expanding our presence in international supply chains, etc were also deliberated.
For India to emerge as a global leader in defence manufacturing, focus on the export of quality and state-of-the-art equipment/systems/platforms has also been emphasised.
PM directed that India should reduce dependence on imports and take forward ""Make in India"" to build its domestic capabilities for designing, developing and manufacturing state-of-the-art defence equipment.
He emphasized on initiatives to promote export of defence products along with industry participation in global defence product value chain and to create an environment that encourages R&amp;D, rewards innovation, creates Indian IP ownership.
The meeting was attended by the Defence Minister, the Home Minister, the Finance Minister and Minister of State for Finance along with senior officials of the Government of India.",1588291216

"ITCareerQuestions","t5_30560","Having Security+ with zero job experience may actually count against you in the eyes of an employer. With no prior experience, most individuals would be looking at entry level positions. The only prerequisites are normally A+ and/or experience. By having Security+, the prospective employer may assume you are looking to be paid according to how others with Security+ and job experience expect to be paid. Your resume may get pushed aside in that instance. There is a delicate balance between education level and true work experience that cannot be discounted in the eyes of the prospective employer. 

That being said please don't think I am bashing the fact that you got a great cert. I highly recommend getting as educated as possible. At some point you do need the on the job experience. It kinda sucks, but I recommend getting your A+ cert so employers can say you check that box and can hire you for entry level stuff. Put in a year or two and start applying to new positions or work your way up through the company. You have already shown enough drive to get your Security+ cert on your own time, so I imagine you would show your worth quickly. Good luck.",1588291216

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

With sport severely impacted by the pandemic, Bach wrote an open letter to the Olympic Movement to initiate a debate on the challenges and opportunities the situation presents.  
 
The global spread of the virus has meant that the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020 and Paralympics have had to be postponed to 2021, a historic decision that was taken in order to safeguard the health of the athletes and the hundreds of thousands of people involved in the Games. 
 
Speaking of the postponed Tokyo Olympic Games, Bach confirmed that the IOC will pay for its share of the costs for these postponed Games, which could amount to several hundred million US dollars.
 
To achieve this aim, the president called on reforms of Olympic Agenda 2020, in particular with regard to sustainability, in order to address the coronavirus crisis.
 
""We have made it clear that the IOC will continue to be responsible for its share of the operational burden and its share of the costs for these postponed Games, under the terms of the existing agreement for 2020 that we have with our Japanese partners and friends,"" he said.
 
Bach introduced a joint Task Force with the symbolic name "" here we go"" that is working on making ""these postponed Olympic Games feasible and successful.""
 
At this moment, nobody knows what the realities of the post-coronavirus world will look like,"" he said. ""What is clear, however, is that probably none of us will be able to sustain every single initiative or event that we were planning before this crisis hit."" He added that the IOC should also view the crisis as an opportunity.
 
Thomas Bach also said the Olympic movement should consider its relationship with e-sports in light of social distancing.
 
The IOC President finished the letter by proposing a ""wide-ranging consultation among all of us under the guidance of the IOC Executive Board and the IOC Session"".
 
""Let us take this opportunity in a way of unity and creativity to emerge from this crisis even stronger than before,"" he said.
 
""The post-coronavirus world will need sport, and we are ready to contribute to shaping it with our Olympic values."" he said.

"ProtectAndServe","t5_2ug10","I'm going to give you examples on how it is certainly human nature. These are hypothetical, but we can all relate.

Someone with power and authority does something that you feel is wrong. You run your mouth. The person in control of the situation threatens you and you close your mouth because you decide that it's not worth the consequences. That person is wrong but there are consequences for challenging them so you don't. You then get out of the situation and take your rage out at someone who has no authority over you. Every person on this planet has, does, or will do that. They won't even think about it, they just do it.

Soldiers in combat will surrender peacefully when it's clear they won't win. They know what they're fighting for is right. But it's not worth certain death, so they stop.

Humans will act aggressively and confidently based on whether or not that they think there will be consequences to something. Even police officers that act unreasonable and unprofessional to you are taking their frustrations out on you because they know you cannot do anything about it or are not likely to.

This is an example of showing strength when you can and becoming passive when the consequences hit. Even if not everyone does this, most people do. There, I fixed the generalization. You can rest easy.

These tweakers you refer to who trash-talk police are taking their anger and aggression out on the police who they feel are being unreasonable assholes, but will quiet up once the consequences present themselves.",1588291217

My suggestion weapon test, figure out the basics(shoot, how to turn to squid + refill paint, how to turn back normal to a kid, jump and use the special) the only extra is using the map to jump to another player which you will see that online... as in just know the basics and go online for fun.

Your mother needs a machine that is dependable, supported and comes with a lot of preinstalled software to handle her day to day business needs. She is not a gamer.

If you spend this time convincing her to build a component parted PC, YOU are going to become support. If anything isn’t working or fails, it will be YOUR fault and YOUR time. If she even just doesn’t like the way things work, it will be you spending time to make something work.

I think a very important part of understanding computers and the users that use them is understanding what people’s needs are.

Looking at the number of cores on the processors between an all in one and a parted PC is a naive comparison.",1588291218

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

The research may provide a ray of hope in India’s fight against COVID-19, as the nanomedicine can decrease or increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) in our body, depending on the situation and cure the disease.
The ability of this research for controlled enhancement of ROS in mammals raises hopes of a new potential for the application of nanomzedicine in controlling virus infections, including COVID-19. Animal trial for the Reduction &amp; Oxidation processes (Redox) healing of several diseases is completed, and now the institute is looking for sponsors to start clinical trials on humans.
The medicine combines nanoparticles extracted from manganese salt with citrus extract, like from lemon.
A crucial combination of manganese and citrate employing tricks of nanotechnology produces the nanomedicine.
The artificially made nanomedicine was found to be important to maintain a balance of reduction and oxidation processes (Redox) in our body’s tissues. Redox reactions in cells add or remove oxygen, and are essential for many processes such as generating energy in cells.
The redox reactions can also create products harmful to cells called reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can instantly oxidize lipids (fat), proteins, and nucleic acids, accelerating the ageing process.
However, it has to be noted that our immune cells naturally produce ROS or generate oxidative stress to kill viruses or bacteria and infected cells in our body.
Thus, controlled-increase of ROS or oxidative stress aids our immune cells to perform their natural functions more efficiently.
Enhancement of oxidative stress by nanomedicine in animal tissue is also commendable and finds application in curing diseases, including neonatal jaundice.
Recently the institute has shown that the added oxidative stress upon administration of the nanomedicine can break down bilirubin (the toxic molecule causing jaundice), providing a cure for hyperbilirubinemia (jaundice). In a trial on mice, the nanomedicine was found safe and swift, precisely bringing down bilirubin levels within two and a half hours.
This ability of controlled enhancement of oxidative stress (ROS) in mammals paves new potential for the application of nanomedicine in controlling virus infection, including COVID-19. Recently, local administration of hydrogen peroxide, which is in a class of ROS, is recommended to be a way of surviving COVID-19.
The excess ROS was achieved by applying the hydrogen peroxide chemical in respiratory track through a nebulizer is advised in order to inactivate COVID-19 by breaking down the viral structure.
As a direct application of hydrogen peroxide create several complications, including direct oxidation of normal body cells, replacement of the chemical by the nanomedicine would be beneficial.
These findings have been published in international journals. In October last year, a comprehensive review entitled “Role of Nanomedicine in Redox Mediated Healing at Molecular Level” of all the development has been published in the journal Bimolecular concepts.
The concept got immediate attention of international experts in the field and referred as “a new front in redox medicine, the emerging field of ROS-based nanomedicine, involving nanomaterials with ROS-regulating properties, holds promise for optimized therapeutic efficacies” in a recent Nature journal in March in this year.
The efficacy of the developed nanomedicine in balancing oxidative stress (ROS) in mice was tested recently by injecting Lead (Pb) ions to create higher oxidative stress (ROS) and liver damage.
It was found that the nanomedicine reduces oxidative stress of the mammal due to lead-exposure and also helps to remove the toxic ions from the liver (popularly known as chelation therapy in medicine) reversing the damage of the organ. Recently, ChemMedChem has highlighted this work on the front cover.",1588291218

If you want to focus more on low level, to understand how CPU, Memory, Clocks, etc works, thank for start write GPIO drivers and Try to Blink LED. I know this sounds easy, but it's painful when you start doing it.

She says it doesn't work at home because she changed the internet... and I said that is an issue with your service provider not our IT department.

I ask her why she thinks I can help her and she replies with it's because she can't work from home thus it is my responsibility to fix it. Baffled..

My latest novella, [How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Defeat-a-Demon-King-in-Ten-Easy-Steps-Audiobook/B086R2N27Y), just came out. It's an Audible Original, so if you're eligible for Original Member Benefits, it should be *free* right now (and discounted if you're not a member - $7.99 in most regions).

This book is my loving and comedic homage to NES games like the original *Zelda*, *Final Fantasy*, and *Dragon Quest*. You've seen a lot of those influences in my previous works, but this one gets more into parody territory. It's a lighthearted LitRPG with a lot of references to those works, as well as some gamier stuff that may feel a little more D&amp;Dish. It plays with a lot of the tropes those stories created, similar to works like *Maoyuu Maou Yuusha* or *Rokka no Yuusha*.

It's very gamey - I'd consider it a LitRPG, for those of you that are familiar with the concept. This is 100% deliberate, but if you don't like game-like fiction, you may want to avoid it. (For those of you who have read *Arcane Ascension*, this is \*more\* game-like than that.)

This is a novella, not a full novel, so don't expect the kind of length of my usual works.

I hope people enjoy it!",1588291219

The study showed how rivers in drier Ladakh Himalaya operated in longer time scales and how they responded to varying climate, an understanding of water and sediment routing,which is crucial as the country gears up its infrastructure and develops smart cities.
 
The scientists have traced where the rivers draining Himalaya and its foreland erode the most and identify the zones that receive these eroded sediments and fill up. The Ladakh Himalaya forms a high altitude desert between Greater Himalayan ranges and Karakoram Ranges. The Indus and its tributaries are major rivers flowing through the terrain. The Zanskar River is one of the largest tributaries of the upper Indus catchment, draining orthogonally through highly deformed Zanskar ranges.Two prominent tributaries of Zanskar River are the Doda and TsrapLingti Chu, which confluence at Padam village in the upper valley to form the Zanskar River.
 
In the study published in the journal Global and Planetary ChangesZanskar catchment was explored by WIHG team to understand the landform evolution in transitional climatic zone, using morpho stratigraphy and provenance study of landforms like valley fill terraces, alluvial fans(triangle-shaped deposit of gravel, sand, and even smaller pieces of sediment, such as silt).
 
Their research suggested that the wide valley of Padam, with an area of 48 square km, in the upper Zanskar, has stored a vast amount of sediments in these landforms. Where, presently, 0.96±0.10 km3 of sediment is stored in its terraces and fans, and since the last 32 thousand years, 2.29±0.11 km3 of sediment has been eroded by the river from Padam, giving it a specific sediment yield of 2.2×103 tons/km2 per year.
 
The sediment contribution from such transient basins is significant when compared with the 4–7 km3 of sediment reportedly eroded from the entireIndus system in Ladakh since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the 7–22 km3 from the Zanskar since last 10 thousand years. ThusPadam valley is a hotspot of sediment buffering in the Zanskar.
 
A study of the sediments suggested that most sediments were derived from Higher Himalayan crystalline that lie in the headwater region of Zanskar. It was found out that dominant factors responsible for sediment erosion were deglaciation and Indian Summer Monsoon derived precipitation in the headwaters despite the presence of a geomorphic barrier (the deep, narrow gorge) between the upper and lower catchments of the river, and it remained connected throughout its aggradation history.
 
The study by the WIHG team will help to understand river-borne erosion and sedimentation, which are the main drivers that make large riverine plains, terraces, and deltas that eventually become the cradle to evolving civilizations.",1588291220

The Earth’s magnetosphere is a vast region which has a finite number of satellites hurtling through this realm. Hence, the in situ observations are finite and discrete.
The morphology of the plasma processes around the satellite can be understood quite well. However, when they leave the observational domain of one satellite to enter into another, a vast blind arena is created. How the morphology of these processes changes over space and time can be ideally deciphered only through computer simulations.
This was the motivation for Dr. Ajay Lotekar to address the problem under the guidance of Dr. Amar Kakad from IIG.
To tackle this problem, the team developed a generalized 1D fluid code which modelled the coherent electric field structures in space plasmas.
They tested their code for various kinds of wave phenomena that generates coherent electric field structures in near Earth’s plasma environment.
These simulations were performed on the High-Performance Computing System at IIG.
The results obtained through their fluid simulation code, published in the journal Physics of Plasmas, were found to be well in agreement with the spacecraft observations of coherent electric field structures.
Almost 99% of matter in the universe is in the form of plasma, Earth’s magnetosphere, too, contains this material and the plasma processes have the ability to hamper the working of a number of satellites that have been placed in orbit in the magnetospheric region.
Apart from the well being of these expensive satellites, the academic understanding of this region is quite essential to comprehend the cosmos in its entirety.
Sun is the major source of plasma deposition in space around the Earth. Sun forces some of its plasma towards the earth in the form of the solar wind. The speed of this wind varies between 300 to 1500 km/s, which carries with it solar magnetic field, called as Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF).  The interaction of the IMF with the earth’s magnetic field creates the magnetosphere of the earth.",1588291221

The global pandemic has created unprecedented situations leaving a large number of people vulnerable to hunger. Those worst hit by this pandemic and lockdown are stranded persons, daily wage labourers, migrants, children, coolies, homeless, the poor and many who form the floating population.
Indian Railways staff from a number of Railway organizations have worked tirelessly since 28th March 2020 to provide hot cooked meals to needy people after the lockdown due to COVID-19. Railways has been providing bulk cooked food with paper plates for lunch and food packets for dinner through IRCTC base kitchens, RPF resources and contribution of NGOs. While delivering the food to needy persons, social distancing and hygiene is being observed.
Distribution of food is being done with the help of RPF, GRP, commercial departments of Zones, State Governments, District administrations and NGOs, even beyond the station vicinity to cater to the food requirements of needy people in areas surrounding the railway stations.
With the active cooperation of IRCTC base kitchens in New Delhi, Bangalore, Hubli, Mumbai Central, Ahmedabad, Bhusaval, Howrah, Patna, Gaya, Ranchi, Katihar, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Nagar, Balasore, Vijaywada, Khurda, Katpadi, Tiruchirapalli, Dhanbad, Guwahati, Samastipur, Prayagraj, Itarsi, Vishakhapatnam, Chengalpatu, Pune, Hajipur, Raipur and Tatanagar spread over various zones such as Northern, Western, Eastern, Southern and South Central, more than 30 lacs cooked meals have been distributed till today 30th April 2020.
Of these, about 17.17 lacs cooked meals have been provided by IRCTC, about 5.18 lacs meals have been provided by RPF from its own resources, about 2.53 lacs meals have been provided by Commercial and other departments of Railways and nearly 5.60 lacs meals have been donated by NGOs working with the Railway organizations.
The Railway Protection Force has played a major role in the food distribution to needy people prepared by IRCTC, other Railway departments, NGOs and from its own kitchens. Starting with distribution of food to 5419 needy persons over 74 locations on 28.03.2020, the number has grown daily. Presently about 50000 persons daily are being provided meals on an average by RPF across approximately 300 locations across the country.",1588291222

Most of our covid case growth is from outside Indy right now and I don't think the rural counties are ready for this.

The state is pretty split on opening back up, and conservatives seem to believe we've flattened the curve and ICU and ventilator usage is low enough that we should open things back up.

If you are okay with meeting one on one in a public place, even if you have a mahram around but not sitting at your table, you can pick up on certain things. I think how a person treats service workers says a lot. I know it sounds lame, but I worked in the service industry and you can see someone who is genuinely being nice. I think after you loosen up a bit, a person's normal speaking pattern returns and you see how they really talk about things and people a bit more.

Since I got a pc and got into Tarkov I've realized the programming abilities of smaller studios can be equally compared to larger AAA studios, at least when it comes to thorough development of game mechanics.
It's far from optimized but at least the AI in Tarkov is smart enough use cover, lean and crouch and actually hit their targets when they shoot at someone.
They are far from perfect but they at least use the games mechanics to encourage the play base to get better.

"the1975","t5_2x80q","Phoebe Bridgers is one of my favorite artists, and I see how that line might come off to people who aren’t familiar with her, but in a lot of her music she uses sex as a way to deflect emotional vulnerability, and it creates this powerful effect that someone who isn’t very open with their feelings can relate too. Like in her song “Demi Moore”, the opening line is “Take a dirty picture babe, I can’t sleep and I miss your face”. So in the first line she’s asking for nudes, but the second line reveals that she doesn’t really want nudes, she wants to see the persons face, revealing she misses them on a more emotional level. The masturbates line in the context of it being a Phoebe Bridgers line shows that she’s still not comfortable telling this girl how she feels so she makes it a sex thing. This could also be a comment on how society sees lesbians, cause lesbians are often seen as sex objects for men to look at. Another interpretation is that it could be a reflection of internalized homophobia, Phoebe equates her crush to something skeevy like masturbating the second the girl she likes leaves, and feels guilty for her emotions, even tho she’s not literally masturbating in this interpretation. Furthermore, this line can be seen as a metaphor for same sex attraction. Like masturbation, same sex attraction is something both religion and society like to make us feel ashamed of, despite the fact they’re both completely normal",1588291224

They're still creating top notch music. You are not alone was a masterpiece and honestly stole the show for me on Time for us. Fromis_9's Clover was one of the best songs of 2018. And Destiny. which they recently wrote for IZ*ONE is one of the best songs of the year so far. BIM BAM BUM was also one of the best debuts I've heard since Glass Bead. And Rocket Punch's Lilac is another masterpiece. Although it just looks like Iggy/Youngbae produced the music for it, they didn't write it. I'm sure they put their stamp on it though, cause it does feel like them.

So yes. More Iggy/Youngbae please.",1588291224

I think this is the smallest available that would meet the requirements. 

A VFD on the motor, or swapping the motor itself for a single phase motor would probably be easier. 

Another option depending on how often it would be used would be to pick up a bunch of 10/4 SOOW and some twist lock plugs/connectors. Have an electrician temporary connect an outlet near where you'd be using the shredder. Connect the shredder to the temporary outlet with the long cables. My company does this often for floor refinish and concrete cutting companies. It might be a cheaper way to go,  especially if you use it in the same area often. A receptacle installed immediately adjacent to a panel is going to be significantly cheaper than owning/operating a 3phase generator, even if you have to have them installed in a bunch of buildings. A long cord can be a nuisance but if it's only for a couple hours most people won't mind. You're on par with the average carpet cleaning company at that point.",1588291225

By being placating and submissive.  I mean I'll start off apologizing for bothering them.  In situations where I suggested the test becoming optional, I apologize for asking.  I'll ask how they're doing.  And, I usually end the email telling them to be safe.  Things of that nature.

Honestly, the implied lazy/cheating comment really cut me off guard, so I'm afraid I couldn't explain what I could have said previously to caused it.  It is possible they didn't realize the implication, or maybe I could have been reading too much into it (English isn't their first language).  Contextually it was pretty abrupt, so that's why I think it was intentional.

Thank again for taking the time to read my rant and replying back with such kindness.  Please stay safe and healthy out there! &lt;3",1588291226

Little Big Planet is floaty because the movement is physics based, and you're basically applying acceleration force through input to make the character move around, which is incredibly indirect.

In Hollow Knight your movement is a direct product of your input, to the point where you literally lose 100% of all upwards momentum when you let go of the jump button, and start falling. To the point where when you let go of a direction button in the air, you stop instantly instead of lingering momentum carrying you forward.",1588291227

"firewater","t5_2rcpo","Not practical.  Aside from being a cleaning and maintenance nightmare the problem is energy transfer.  Total energy transfer depends on the temperature difference.  Even if you recycled boiling water, you're still dealing with a very small deltaT.  And the boiling point of the pot steadily rises, so the situation gets worse and worse as it goes.  Eg: most pot stills run the stripping run to a pot temp of about 208 or so.  At that point the deltaT is far beyond impractically small.  

Commercial systems use steam, which is super heated and/or condenses in the ""hermes coil"" (the phase change transfers more energy than a mere temp difference).  Not very practical or safe on the hobby scale.

A simpler idea is to do away with the coil and use ""steam injection"" (homebrewers have done this as well for both mashing and boiling though it never got super popular).  The steam just condenses in the boiler, steadily diluting it, but at a known, calculable rate.  It works ok for both beer and distillation but ultimately offers few benefits to other solutions.",1588291227

This one seems close to what I was looking for with the colors and stuff. I'm not at my PC but how would I get it to be desktop at like 1920x1080 but still look good and not like pixelated.

I've never used steam wallpaper engine and I dont own it but it would be cool if it had maybe effects like this one below. Do you just buy the engine and the wallpapers are free or do you need to buy each wallpaper?

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

The Control Room monitors the 
issues of internal trade, manufacturing, delivery &amp; logistics of essential commodities and
difficulties faced by various stakeholders during the lockdown period to resolve any supply chain issues.
 
Out of the total number of 1962 queries registered till 28th April 2020, 1739 have been resolved/settled. 223 are currently under resolution.  Out of 1962 queries registered, more than 1000 queries were received from five States/UTs viz., Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat.
A dedicated team has been put in place to monitor and tracking the disposal of queries and to generate daily MIS reports for information of senior officers in the Department. The team also closely tracks the important queries by calling up the affected people and obtains their inputs while taking up the matter with the concerned agency. This also helps in making an assessment about the efficacy of various agencies involved in resolution of issues. This team of professionals helps senior officers to know the impact of their interventions and thus keeps everyone apprised of the status of resolution of grievances.
The queries are being received in the control room through telephone calls as well as email. Any manufacturing, transporter, distributor, wholesaler or e-commerce companies facing ground level difficulties in transportation and distribution of goods or mobilization of resources can inform to the Department at the following telephone number/ email:-
            Telephone: + 91  11 23062487
            Email         :  controlroom-dpiit@gov.in
The telephone number is functional from 8 AM to 6 PM.  The control room has been receiving queries regarding ground level difficulties as well as the procedural and policy issues being faced by the manufacturers, transporters, distributors, wholesalers and e-commerce companies. After registering the queries, the DPIIT control room staff forwards the same to the State level control rooms and the Chief Secretary of the State with the request to initiate necessary action and ensure that the required relief is provided to the querists at the earliest.
The queries received in the control room are forwarded to the senior officers of DPIIT who constantly monitor the issues and in case of an issue requiring urgent intervention, the same are also taken up with other officers of the State Government including the concerned District Magistrate or Police functionaries.  All the senior officers of the DPIIT have been assigned specific States with which they continuously interact and urge upon the State functionaries to initiate action on pending issues. The State Government Departments such as Industry, Transport, Consumer Affairs and Food and public Distribution are also monitoring the resolution of such queries separately.
Minister of Railways, Commerce and Industry Shri Piyush Goyal quite frequently takes stock of the nature of issues raised through the control room and has been urging all concerned to initiate action necessary to ensure supplies of essential goods to the common man in every part of the country. Dr. Guruprasad Mohapatra, Secretary DPIIT along with his senior colleagues also regularly reviews the status of pending issues in the States during his meetings held through video conferences.
On 24th March, 2020, the Central Government had announced a nationwide lockdown, with a view to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 virus, while putting in place arrangements for ensuring that supplies of essential goods and services remain available to all citizens.",1588291230

"entitledparents","t5_358dh","I didn´t shave my head, but when my trich was pretty bad it got to the point where i had bald spots and people noticed, i felt ashamed so i made a huge effort to stop (i was around 10 at the time and had no idea that it was a disorder, so i didn´t seek help).

I stopped pulling hair from my head but i replaced that with pulling hair from other parts of my body, like my arms, legs, above my lip, sometimes eyebrows, so i don´t think shaving the head would help, since there is always more hair on other body parts. It does help in keeping people from noticing bald spots and therefore avoiding the stress and shame that sometimes comes from it, but it could also act as a way to just hide the issue, as in my case. 

To actually be able to stop you need to be conscious of what triggers it and find another way to cope, and of course, seeking help from a therapist is always a good idea.",1588291230

I’m not suggesting any changes to what’s working for you but in my experience so far, acros in higher nitrates do better with higher alkalinity. I’d say my leading causes so far have been alkalinity not being rock solid, too much direct/strong directional flow (polyps pinned one way much of the day), and not dipping. How nitrates may play a role in susceptibility to infection or overall health though is beyond me. Just my 2¢. Best of luck 🤞🏼",1588291230

At this moment in time the key competitive 2000 point list units are:

Imotekh the Storm Lord - Lord of the storm ability/+1CP for Warlord/My Will Be Done on two of the Tesla Immortal Units for free. Our best overall HQ.

Overlord - Basic HQ to be used if not using Sautekh/Imotekh

Cryptek with cloak - to keep up with Tomb Blades/Destroyers for +1 Reanimation or sit and repair Doomsday Arks.

Lord equipped with a Sword - Low point cost, helps Immortals to re-roll some 1s when doing damage. Also filler for HQ requirements for detachments. 

20  - 30 Tesla Immortals - Combo with Imotekh/Overlord for 5+ Tesla trigger, and add a Sautekh Stratagem that will help trigger Tesla on 4+

9 Tomb Blades with Tesla and Shieldvanes - Fast units that have a -1 to be hit. The Tesla guns still get two shots after Advancing when run as Sautekh, targeting something that was marked with Methological Destruction helps trigger Tesla. Shadowlooms might be better than the 5++ with the newer Space marine armies getting extra cover bonuses.

5-6  Destroyers - Point them at something mean, spend a command point, erase or massively hurt that target. They will then be targeted and destroyed quickly though. People like running multiple units because of that. But their high point cost limits this. Adding in a Heavy Destroyer to the pack is okay, it can work as ablative wounds.

6 Wraiths - Fast hard to kill unit that acts as a distraction. Can actually cause some damage to hard to kill units or lock them up so they do not do as much damage to you. Using Wraith Flight you can get them deep into enemy territory to cause a lot of havoc. Consider putting them into their own Auxiliary Detachment (-1CP) as Novokh. This lets you keep the rest of the shooting units as Sautekh and gives the Wraiths the re-roll failed hits on/being charged. 

2-3 Doomsday Arks (DDA) - Key unit for hitting heavy armor hard. Can do okay against hordes. Using multiple of it helps even out the random number of shots and damage.

Sautekh Airwing with 3 Doom Scythes - No less than 3 as you will be focused on using the Stratagem as many turns as you can. This also adds a Command point to the army. Position to snipe characters or destroy defenses. Declining in value as more and more opposing armies are getting either +1 to hit ""FLY"" or BS 2+.

3x units of 3x Heavy Destroyers. With their point cost drop they are a good alternative to either Doom Scythes or even DDAs in a pinch (DDAs are still better over all).

As long as your 2000 point list contains mostly the above units with very little ""fun units"" you should do okay.",1588291231

On 6 April 2020, at the age of 99, he began to walk laps of his garden in aid of NHS Charities Together, with the goal of raising £1,000 by his hundredth birthday. In the 24-day course of his fundraising he made many media appearances and became a popular household name in the United Kingdom, generating much interest in his life story, earning a number of accolades - and attracting over 1.5 million individual donations. He featured in a cover version of the song ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", with proceeds going to the same charity. The single topped the UK music charts and made him the oldest person to achieve a UK number one.

On the morning of his hundredth birthday the total raised by his walk passed £30 million, and by the time the campaign closed at the end of that day had increased to over £32.79 million. His birthday was marked in a number of ways, including a flypast by the Royal Air Force.

As far as moving, I was lucky to stay in my company and just transfer offices. I've actually done it twice now. So I kind of have the best of both worlds, though I was also not making like Tech/Software money. More hardware - we squeeze the shit out of our staff money. I am worried if I want to leave I'll be in a slightly worse place but overall I think I could move fairly laterally and still benefit from the COL being lower.

So, I grew up with the books as a young'un, and when the first film came out, I assumed the adage of ""the books are better than the films"" was true in all cases, so I just missed the films entirely.

How wrong I was.

I watched the films with some friends of mine, and from the very first moment, you could tell that they'd changed a lot from the books, down to the very premise of the story. And in my opinion, it was a far more interesting story that they had created. Rather than have the Vikings of Berk already acquainted with and, in many cases, riding their dragons (as in the books), the story was of suspicion and hatred between the two, and it was far more emotionally mature. Plus, I do still prefer movie Toothless to book Toothless... While book Toothless is a whiny sob and Hiccup already knows how to understand him, movie Toothless just seems more wild, a very interesting character, even though he can't talk.

Yeah, I'm a bit of a fan, I know.",1588291233

Your original point was that is was a problem in Yemen because of the societal conditions there, or lack thereof. I said that the problem was one throughout the Middle East. I never stated it was endemic to this region. As far as I'm concerned, other places don't matter in this discussion, because it's not about them. 

If you wanna talk about child marriage in South Asia, we can have that discussion. Looking at the statistics, it's odd that Bangladesh, the country with the highest rate of child marriage, is a majority-muslim country. Could this be because Islam is especially lax about child marriage, or because it's a societal standard in the Indian subcontinent? I don't know, probably a mix of both. 

In regards to Columbia, we have a lot less information on child marriage there, but it is estimated that 23% of women there are married before 18. I don't know why; probably antiquated gender standards. If you do, feel free to let me know.",1588291234

If you want to discuss issues with the America health system that is a separate topic. If you bring up the health system during a conversation about Covid 19 I'll be responding to that. Sorry, some of us have the mental capacity to stay on topic. Something you apparently lack. 

&gt;And you're 6 times worse than the global average, with a lower population density.

Goodness. You really are not very smart. If you are taking the population density of the entire country you are either stupid or disingenuous. Most the cases have occurred in New Jersey and New York.  Guess which areas have extremely high population densities? Oh, yeah, New York and New Jersey. New York is the most dense city of an western country. New Jersey has 2 cities in the top 50 most population dense cities in the world. 

&gt;But, you're arguing with all of the technical acumen your country has that twice as bad as Canada is somehow good?

Canada is significantly less dense than the areas being hit hardest in America. Of course Canada will be better. Canada also has a better health care system. With that said if you look at mortality rate its practically the same between Canada and the US. 

&gt;I know you don't trust me, but I do hold a graduate degree in applied science not that you're going to believe me, but, my name is easily discoverable through my reddit history (hint, look at the links that I've posted in /r/pottery), and you can do a search in the library of canada for my thesis. I employed differential equations to compute a mapping field from a parameteric surface to an implicit surface, the application is in computer graphics where I make my living. I've only taken two undergrad statistics courses, they were 20 years ago. My expertise is certainly not in statistics, nor in public health, but really, nobody needs that expertise to see that the united states is a festering boil. I'm sorry you're too stuck up your own presidents ass to open your eyes. My expertise is certainly not in statistics, nor in public health, but really, nobody needs that expertise to see that the united states is a festering boil.

I also have a graduate degree in applied science.  though I do question the truth of your statement considering the fact that going from a parametric surface to an implicit surface isn't anything new and wasn't new 20 years ago either.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When I was 17, a few friends and I were hungry late at night and caught wind of a truck stop a few kilometres away. It was about 10pm at night and we cut through farm paddocks to a main road where we walked the long way down, hiding in the bushes if a car came past the road and walking away from street lights and intersections. Along the way my friends were making jokes about how us 5 could take on someone if they tried to mug or chase us...

After walking for an hour we reached the truck stop to find that it was closed. We stood around for only 10 minutes and watched some cars go by, and my friend whispered to me. “Hey, watch out if you see the same car twice.” 

The road we came from was a dead end with nothing at the end but farm paddocks that we had came from.

Next minute, my friend goes to check when the truck stop is open, and a car indicator light turns on to turn into that road. An empty road. And we watch in complete silence sitting at the empty truck stop as it comes to a complete stop, screeching its breaks, and turns quickly into the station and tries to run us over. 

My friends all bolted in different directions and some hid behind the truck stop. We thought it was over until we saw the bright headlights of the truck and voices screaming to come out! And the screeching of car breaks. The car had been circling the block around. 

It was silent for a few minutes so we grabbed eachother and ran down the road only to feel dread at the sight of car headlights again on the dark road with us jumping over into people’s front yards and behind fences every time the car passed.

We all laid down behind a bush in a yard and noticed a friend was missing as the car was metres away from us. He was flat on the ground behind a tree only about 2 metres from the car. With the men inside screaming

“Come out!” “We only want to chat!”

The car sped off and my friend was in tears as he was the closest to the parked car, and if someone had gotten out of the car they easily could have grabbed him. But he just stayed their still. I’m very glad his adrenaline told him to freeze and not run or fight. It would have been a different story.

After passing houses we came to the paddocks again but lost our way and could only follow the road. Knowing we had nowhere to hide we had to call our Scout Leader and tell him what happened.

He wasn’t angry at all. Just told us not to tell anyone. We all sat in the trailer of the truck and never really spoke of it again. But it sure has given all of us a massive fear of walking past roads at night, knowing that one of us could have been hit by the car even before the chase began. It was just luck that we realised “why would someone turn down an empty road?” Before it was too late...",1588291236

"electrical","t5_2sa2d","Are you asking about a second circuit or a second meter?

I can't think of a reason for the charger to be on its own meter. Usually electric rates get bulk rates as usage goes up, so you'll get a lower price per kwh the more you use. Plus the second meter will likely have it's own separate service charge that can be $10-30. So higher kwh rate and an extra monthly fee on top of that would be a no from me.

I believe most EV circuits are 50 amp, which is not a large draw that would merit a second meter either.

Better to just have a circuit installed in your existing meter",1588291237

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","They did say it, that's why we all know about it. Eventually China caved in, and on the 20 and 21 of January WHO specialists were allowed in Wuhan.

By the end of the month, although there were less than 8,000 cases worldwide, of which the vast majority in China, the WHO declared it a global emergency concern. 

I'm not saying the organisation is perfect, but I do believe that the attacks it has received and its supposed favour to a China are very unfair in light of how it conducted its work within the limits set by the statutes of the organisation. Even the director general travelled several times to China to lobby the government.

Denise era de complexion pequeña, asi que iba en las piernas de Salvador, con los alcoholes encima y el movimiento del auto, ella se puso horny comenzando a aplastar el gusano de forma continua al mismo tiempo que incitaba a Salvador a gozar de sus carnes. A medio trayecto se bajaron: el almacenista y el auxiliar, entonces Denise se paso al area de copiloto, el Hector ya le había echado el ojo por el retrovisor y ni tarde ni perezoso le dio la señal del sabueso ""bájese por su hueso"", el amigo salvador estaba en el punto de quedarse dormido así que no se dio cuenta de aquel frenesí. Después de unos mamelucos, de entre los asientos delanteros se ve salir una manita juguetona buscando premio gordo, y tómala! que se va sobre el salvador, él flojito y cooperando que se deja querer, tremenda imagen: una mano ordeñando y con la boca pecando! cada cierto tiempo la amiga se levantaba y le acomodaba unos besotes románticos al Salvatoree, de lenwita french, para después proseguir con su encomienda oral.  
El pobre Pepe se quedo mirando todo el show, deseoso de entrar en la jugada, inmerso en la calentura que comienza a automotivarse, en una de esas que se le ocurre magistral idea:    en audaz movimiento se arrima a salvador, toma la mano de Denise y la coloca en su retoño, ella sin darse cuenta continua en sus labores, hasta que se levanta para darle sus besotes a Salvador y sorpresa : NO PEPE, TU NOOOO!! le retira su mano, besa a Salvador y continua, Pepe lo vuelve a hacer y ella se da cuenta: QUE NOOOO PEEPEE TUU NOOOOOO!!.  
Hector dejo a Salvador y a Pepe cerca de sus casas, se llevo a Denise a darle servicio de bombeo intenso a dos cuadras de donde los dejo a ellos, después Denise toco a la puerta de Salvador y amaneció en su cama.   
Al día siguiente Pepe estaba resentido por no recibir un pokito de cariño, así que nos conto todo, Hector lo confirmo y agrego, Salvador contó a medias y agrego mas, Denise se porto distante por un mes,  Hector y Salvador dejaron de hablarse, jeje  Salvadoreee no le gusto la idea de conocer el sabor del nepe de su amigo.

A couple weeks later I stayed home from school sick and found them running around during the day eating bird seed and enjoying their day. I should have bought a pellet gun.",1588291239

Bihar, Jharkhand and few other states have already designated nodal officers to prepare a register of such stranded people and are devising the Standard Operating Procedure to be followed during their transit.
People have welcomed Centre's announcement of allowing movement of stranded people starting from 4th of May.
The decision will address concerns of migrant workers , students, pilgrims , tourists and other people who wanted to travel back to their home.
State Governments are coordinating to allow movement of passenger buses carrying people stranded due to the nationwide lockdown.
Seating arrangement in buses is being planned to ensure contactless travel. People who would be travelling are required to get themselves registered with the Nodal officers in their State.
Proper screening of passengers is made necessary both /on commencement and completion of the journey.
After journey every traveller will have to stay under home quarantine. Government has also asked people to download Aarogya Setu mobile App so that their safety can be well taken care off through technological intervention.",1588291239

"mbti","t5_2s90r","Basically tests are shit lmao. That’s the most real answer I can give you. The types that online dichotomy tests give you are practically meaningless because they can change in a span of like months depending on your mood and experiences.

You wanna learn cognitive functions? Sure. The only issue is the fact that nobody can agree on anything and that most people can’t even explain why the definitions are the way they are. The best way to learn them is to really understand the very basics and then build up from there. People try to learn what the functions are without even understanding the basic dichotomies. People shouldn’t be telling others what extroverted intuition is if they can’t even explain what extroversion or intuition is in the first place.

Rural STRs are going to vary dramatically by location. On the west coast of Vancouver Island it’s busy but northern and cariboo regions of B.C. not so much based on my time up there talking to other hosts. The pricing is dramatically lower compared to here. I would imagine the best would be something on a lake near a ski resort in the interior so you’d have two high seasons instead of one. Sadly most of those are probably priced sky high these days if you didn’t get in twenty years ago or earlier.",1588291241

You can also get them off amazon, because some states can be strange about buying needles without a medical or vet license and amazon dgaf somehow.

If you have any left at home, just check the packaging. It will list the needle gauge, length, connection type, and brand. You don’t have to get it exactly the same as what you have, but at least similar. So some keywords to look out for: 

-hypodermic; some needles have a blunt tip and aren’t meant for giving injections to people. Check any photos they show to make sure the tip is angled, but if the description has precisionglide (it’s a brand name but it might be like xerox at this point) or hypodermic in it, you’re probably good

-Luer-lok; or luer slip, but people have issues with the slip needles sometimes coming apart. These are the twist lock type and the reason you want to specify is so you know everything will fit together.

-18g/23g/25g/27g; g is gauge, the smaller number is a thicker needle, bigger number is a thinner one. Subq uses a shorter needle, so you want about .5”-1” for that, 1”-1.5” for IM. I hate drawing oil with anything smaller than 18g because it takes me forever, but some people don’t notice any difference",1588291241

"proceduralgeneration","t5_2ssff","Sure, no worries.

All code to generate VBOs to send to the GPU is at the bottom of the ""tree.h"" file. These are the ""\_construct"" function to generate the triangle mesh of the tree, and the ""addLeaves"" function to generate the leaf particle system. Both of these functions use a recursive technique.

A cylinder is meshed for every branch of the tree, using a start- and end-point and a radius. The start-point is passed to the recursive function ""addBranch"". The end-point is computed as (start-point + direction \* length). Then the cylinder is meshed. If the branch isn't a leaf-branch, you call ""addBranch"" for the child branches and pass the end-point as their new start-point. The tree is meshed recursively by calling addBranch on the root branch from the position (0, 0, 0).

The cylinder is meshed as triangles by stacking two N-polygons in a half-staggered fashion, and drawing the lines between them. [Like this](https://weigert.vsos.ethz.ch/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/treegrow_mesh.mp4). I do this by computing a normal vector to the direction and rotating it by a half-step and going up- and down between start- and end-point.

You can get a normal vector to the branch direction by forming the cross-product of the direction with an arbitrary vector. You can rotate the normal-vector a half-step around the direction vector with a rotation matrix. The angle is 2\*PI in 2\*N steps, so rotation angle = (2\*PI )/(2\*N) = (PI/N). Rotate by multiplying the normal vector with the rotation matrix. Jump between (start + normalvector \* radius) and (end + normalvector \* radius \* taper) while rotating, repeat N times. Note that adding the taper makes the cylinders more conical. This makes them overlap nicer.

The rest of the rendering (VAO / VBO construction, etc.) is handled in the main file and the model utility class of TinyEngine. Read those for more info.

The particle system uses instanced rendering of the ""leaf.png"" file. The ""addLeaves"" algorithm recursively descends the tree (""addLeaf"" function defined in-line). When it hits a leaf, it pushes a bunch of model matrices into the ""particle"" utility class of TinyEngine, which does the rest for you (using whatever shader you specify). Check the main-file (main loop, particle class and shader initialization) to see where this is called, the particle utility class and the particle shader to see how the rendering then happens.",1588291242

I believe policy based routing happens prior to SD-WAN, and can refer to the interfaces that are SD-WAN members.  You can create policy based routes to send the guest wifi source out wan2 and the exchange server out wan1.

After he came back following the shooting,  Beth being able to provide him with cash (real or fake) helped expedite the process of him getting back to work. 

I don’t think the 100k was ever a permanent solution from how the conversation went, though, it just bought her time. 

At the bar she asked how much it would cost to buy her life and he said she couldn’t afford it. Then she played devils advocate and asked what he had to lose, mick could cut her into pieces at any point and Rios been out of the game for while so he would need cash to get back up and running. I think the $100k was mean to be just out of reach for her so that either she didn’t get it and he could kill her, but if she did, he could get back up and running and kill her next time she screwed him over (which lets face it she would). She never even paid him though because he found out about the money printing - which once again, he won’t need long term. In the short term, it helps him get back in the game as his previous contacts most likely moved on in his absence. 

The 200k in season 2 would’ve been to pay multiple people off so he could get the body before the police (unless he already had it and just wanted to fuck with her, which I could also see)",1588291243

That does not mean she shouldn't back up her important files (macOS has a great built-in tool for this called ""Time Machine""), but it does mean that she is less likely to get a virus or ransomware attack as long as she steers clear from shady websites and e-mail attachments from unknown senders. In addition to security, you also get stability. OS X/macOS has proven to be a very stable operating system, so it will continue to run similarly to when it was first purchased rather than slow down over time like a Windows machine. Last but not least, the applications that are included in macOS make it great for students. It includes an office suite (Pages, Numbers, Keynote) that makes it easy to start working without spending even more money on Microsoft Office. There are also a few others such as iMovie, GarageBand, and Notes. 

Besides macOS, the build quality of Macbooks are excellent. They have beautiful screens, one of (if not the best) trackpads available, and solid battery life (though it can vary depending on use). Macbooks tend to hold up much better and longer than an ordinary laptop, which means it's less likely you'll have to replace it in a year or two. It also means that they hold their value way better, so if she needs an upgrade later it wont be as much of a difference money wise. Even so, make sure to get AppleCare+ for the Macbook ($249 for 2020 Macbook Air) so that if any problems do arise (including accidental damage), you're covered and won't be responsible for repairs (exception is accidental damage, in which case there is a deductible that is much lower than replacing the parts without it). 

Taking all of this into account, it is a wise decision to choose a Macbook for your student if you want a laptop that will generally last much longer than a comparable Windows laptop, provide s better security and stability overall, and helps them focus more on work rather than play (although there is still some room for the average game should they want to use it for that purpose).

If you go with a Windows laptop, just be prepared to purchase/download anti-virus software, the possibility of bad updates or viruses causing loss of data/time, and rolling the dice on quality depending on what manufacturer and model you choose. I'm not saying every Windows laptop is worse than a Macbook, but rather that there is more of an issue with quality control with Windows laptops compared to Macbooks.

If you have any questions or concerns based on what I've written, don't hesitate to reply or PM me.

TL;DR I would get a Macbook over a Windows laptop",1588291244

"longisland","t5_2qk64","There's some pretty bad advice here.

You have three options: agree to the increase, move out, or refuse and face eviction. 

You're a month to month tenant, and your rent can be increased with no maximum as long as you're given 30 days notice. You can also be told to move out with 30 days notice.

If you refuse, your roommate/landlord can go to court to get an eviction order to force you out. It's true that New York is generally a tenant friendly state (and right now all evictions are on hold until June 20th), but you're talking about a few months for the process. Certainly not years.

Good luck ever renting again with an eviction on your record.

That being said, no one can force you out until there's a lawful eviction order enforced by the police. Any attempt to change the locks or throw your stuff on the curb is illegal. Although it's a ciivl matter and your recourse will be to pursue relief through the court system (meaning the police aren't going to break down doors to get your back into your house).

I'm more sympathetic to the libertarian position than comes across here; I'm usually defending libertarian positions. But I can see the dangers to free speech and political institutions that this presents (even if I don't yet know how to remedy it).

&gt; Also, they're way deep into 2016 Russian conspiracy bullshit. I keep hoping the left will pick another hill to die on re: internet speech.

I think Jack is a little into it, not nearly as bad as a lot of folks. I don't have him pegged too exactly on this. I'm quite negative on Russian conspiracy bullshit. I think they tried some misinformation, but it probably was insignificant in the election. I don't think much hinges on this.",1588291245

It's not a bad idea to play now because you're just learning the basics. You should probably avoid fighting other players and you can potentially do a lot of scav runs just to learn maps and all that.

You need to learn all the exfils, spawn points, etc on each map. You'll have to learn them whether you start playing now or post wipe.

You also can take out thicc Bois with dirt cheap gear early on. Like vepr Hunter with m80 headshot will basically take anyone down.

So yeah it is a bit harder right now, but there is something really wrong with your play style if you're dying that much. I would avoid PvP and just learn to fight scavs and loot for now.",1588291245

I transplanted babies into 19 pots today (all pictured). Some of my mature plants got into the picture as well. The black grid-like planter is my seedling greenhouse that I've been using to start seeds since 13 April. It's my first time starting seeds and I did it just for fun not really expecting much to come of any of the seeds. 

But wow I got a lot of sprouts and many of them already have real leaves, which are the ones I transplanted today. I even had to throw away some of the babies because I just had way too many! The radishes in particular grew fast and already have roots the length of my forearm. 

The ones I transplanted today were: 

Tomatoes 

Carrots 

Kale 

Arugula 

Radishes

Hot peppers 

Basil 

Dill 

Sage 

Carpet of snow 

Royal carpet 

Nasturtium

I have 16 other types of plants still in the seedling greenhouse. I'm not sure if some of them will sprout at all (lavender) and others are almost ready to be transplanted (like parsely). 

I'm still not positive that my transplanted seedlings are going to keep, so I'm not getting my hopes up. But it looks like plants all do a LOT better at surviving than I give them credit for!",1588291246

"rawdenim","t5_2scl9","One thing people new to raw denim sometimes don't always consider is that they will be looking at the unfaded denim much longer than they will be looking at the faded denim. So it is also good to consider how a pair of jeans looks to you when they are brand new.

For example, there are subtle differences in the initial appearance of those 3 denims, such as the denim color, the amount of the weft yarn peek-thru (how much white/off-white you see from the outside of the denim), and the stitching color. The Indigo Selvedge has tonal stitching whereas the other two have contrast stitching, with the Standard Slub having the brightest stitching. And the Indigo Selvedge also has the selvedge visible on the coin pocket, which some people like and some people detest. And even the selvedge ID is slightly different, with the Indigo Selvedge having a red line and the Deep Indigo Selvedge having a pink line.

And as far as levels of slub go, it is often easiest to tell how slubby a denim is by looking at how irregular and wavy the white weft lines look on the cuff and on the inside view of the yoke and back pockets in the pics. The Standard Slub is not super slubby by using that metric. And in fact, the Indigo Selvedge looks just as slubby as the Standard Slub does to me, and the Deep Indigo Selvedge looks like it is the slubbiest of those 3 denims.

There are also comfort and feel factors that should be considered also. Such as the Deep Indigo Selvedge is a bit heavier than the other two, 15oz vs 13oz, but that is also why it costs more.

But in the grand scheme of things, those 3 jeans are more similar than dissimilar. So basically, you just have to decide which one speaks to you the most.",1588291247

"Warhammer40k","t5_2rr81","I hope you dont mind if I copy paste my explanation from another sub

Sure. So these are just some bases I ordered on Etsy that already have tile stamped into them. I put some Elmer's glue on it for big chunks of sprue, medium chunks, fat grain sand, and then fine grain sand.  Prime, basecoat, heavy dry brush with a lighter color, wash, lightly dry brush with an even lighter color, and then I retouched up my gold because I dont like my golds to look dull even in the grittiest grim darkness of the far future. The Emperor protects!

For most of the basecoat, it was two thin coats, but for tiles that had rubble covering them, I put one thin coat over them so the rubble wouldnt be weird and chunky.

Heres my progress picks. 1 is the result of me following a tutorial on youtube for how to make rubble bases. I hated it and did bad so 2 was me taking the parts of that video that I liked and making the rest up myself. It's also me just try to even make rubble based on r/minipainting's advice. 3 is me trying to learn how to actually paint rubble with regular rubble-y colors. It's the same base coat, heavy dry brush, wash, light dry brush. Ignore the pink on that base, I'm giving that base to my best friend to use and she wanted pink belts. 4 is me seeing if I could get away with just a portion of the base having rubble AND if my sandstone colors would work using the same method. 5 is after I applied my rubble to the bases I got from etsy and after it's been primed. 6 is the final product. As a bonus, the base in the middle is how they looked coming straight from etsy.

There's a reason for why every game since Sora was created have other developer working with it. Because those will be the ones working on the game for programming, design, assets, etc, while Sakurai works as director leading the game and Michiko as UI designer.

I think Reade is a problematic person but she didn’t just come out with this story after Biden won Super Tuesday. 

Here’s a story from April of 2019:
https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/

The NYT and CNN could’ve covered this a year ago but they didn’t want to derail Biden’s shot so they ignored the story. 

Now that Biden is the presumptive nominee, this story “comes to light”

This is journalistic malpractice by the big media players. CNN especially needs a “both sides” story to create a semblance of balance between trump and Biden coverage. 

Reade didn’t say Biden tried to rape her in this 2019 story. Her story now is a lot worse than what it was a year ago but it wasn’t fully fabricated this year.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

Anders Tegnell was until the start of the crisis an unknown civil servant at the Public Health Agency but has become the face of Sweden’s strategy to keep schools, restaurants and businesses open during the outbreak.
Now the 64-year-old has name recognition on the streets and has been immortalised as a tattoo.
“I think he (Tegnell) is like the face outwards during this crisis and for me, I mean, I think he’s doing quite a good job because he has been standing straight in the frontline and he’s just been doing his job great,” said Gustav Lloyd Agerblad, 32, admiring the image of Tegnell’s face on his arm.
Sweden strategy has not been to stop the virus but to slow the spread enough for the healthcare system to cope. It has not been based on bans but instead on voluntary measures emphasising social distancing and good hygiene.
Even though the plan has prompted some scepticism from policy-makers overseas, around three-quarters of Swedes have expressed high or very high confidence in the Public Health Agency, a survey from Novus showed this month.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven’s popularity has also surged and more than six out of 10 people have confidence in the government’s handling of the crisis.
“I came up with the idea because I believe in our strategy and I believe that the authorities can’t make us stay at home,” said tattoo artist Zashay Rissanen Tastas as he inked Tegnell’s face onto Agerblad.
“If we keep our distance it’s probably going to be fine.”
Still, more than 2,200 people have died of the virus in Sweden, fewer relative to the size of the population than in Britain, France and Spain but far more than in Denmark and Norway, where authorities have taken a stricter approach.
The disparity with its Nordic neighbours has drawn fierce criticism from some Swedish scientists. But as other countries are seeking to re-start their struggling economies, people have also highlighted the benefits of Sweden’s approach.
On the streets of Stockholm, as in the tattoo parlour, some passers-by spoke highly of Tegnell.
“Everyone loves him. Absolutely. That’s how it is. He’s very popular,” said Tove Falck-Olsson.
But will it last? “We’ll have to see. It’s too soon to say, as he himself says, one has to give it some time and we’ll see,” she said.
The National Ballet has cancelled all its performances until June 1 and stopped its dancers from rehearsing together. Many have resorted to practicing at home.
“This is our way of bringing a poetic production, despite not being able to work together in our studio or to perform in front of an audience”, National Ballet spokesman Richard Heideman said.",1588291248

"politics","t5_2cneq","Reade said she made the complaint to an outside office which at the time was the Senate Personnel Office  

&gt;[Ms. Reade,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/15/seriousness-flaws-tara-reades-allegations/) who worked as a staff assistant helping manage the office interns, said she also filed a complaint **with the Senate** in 1993 about Mr. Biden.  

  
&gt;Reade says she filed a complaint with **Senate officials**, but she does not have a copy of it, no such record has been found, and the **law would have required that any such allegations be referred to an official hearing; there is no indication such a hearing took place.**  

Senate officials, not Biden staffers. Not filed in Biden's office but an office of the Senate. Biden would in no way have control of those records.  

But now she believes those records are in Biden's personal records  

&gt;[Reade attempted to track](https://dailycaller.com/2020/04/30/tara-reade-complaint-dennis-toner-ted-kaufman/) the complaint down in 2019. She said she was told that “it would have gone back to Joe Biden’s office, to the Chief of Staff.” **She is unsure who told her this**, but believes it may have been OWCR.  

&gt;“Joe Biden, I want you to release all the personnel records from 1973 to 2009""  

&gt;“I want this brought to light and I want you to admit it in public. **I want a public apology for calling me a Russian agent** and having other people try to smear my character in order to cover your crimes.”    

She can't even remember who she talked to *last year* about the complaint? Come on, she should be able to figure out that much in such an important matter. Phone records? She always maintains a strategic vagueness with everything.  

And I *really* don't know where she got the idea that Joe said she was a Russian agent.",1588291249

I've already made 3 DSC characters that pretty much one shot everything with multi million dps values but didn't really enjoy the game with any of them. Then I've started a HC character and it feels waaaaay better to play and I enjoy the experience a lot more. There's no need to rush, high risk means high reward... Constant struggle to improve my character creates an amusing strain on me, which doesn't exist in SC. People delve to 6000+ with 100 hp dying 200 times every day, nothing matters as long as you have a headhunter, there's no build diversity and everyone plays the same shit because only thing that matters is clear speed. This is why every player with deep game knowledge plays maximum clear speed or MF builds, it makes no sense to play anything else. This is why I can't find any reason to play SC anymore, I'd only do it if I were to sell currency and most SC players I know play SC for the same purpose.

Footage of each piece will be edited together into a film titled “Gently Quiet” that will be streamed online by early May, the National Ballet said.
“I like this project as we can show what we want to do and what we are waiting for to do again,” said 25-year old dancer Yvonne Slingerland, who performed her piece beside the Amstel river on Friday.
All bars, restaurants, museums and other public places have been shut in the Netherlands since March 15 in an attempt to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.

I was definitely someone who voiced my frustration at us not being under lockdown sooner, but frankly had he not taken these incremental steps, you'd probably have seen Marylanders a lot more pissed.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

A hand-written sign with an Instagram handle encourages kids and adults alike to contribute submissions, with the wall of the bus stop covered in drawings depicting things such as a unicorn, flowers and rainbows, which have come to symbolise positivity and solidarity with Britain’s health workers during the outbreak.
Sarah Lamarr, a part time teacher and mother of 4-year-old Rosie, started the gallery when she woke up the day after Britain’s coronavirus lockdown began and realised she would be stuck inside indefinitely with only a bland bus stop to look at.
“I just wanted to do something to brighten it up so I didn’t have to look at a grey bus stop for the next however-long,” she told Reuters.
Lamarr said she felt like the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock’s 1954 thriller Rear Window, which stars James Stewart as an injured photographer who watches his neighbours after he is confined to his flat with a broken leg.
“If you have a bus stop near you I would really encourage anyone to do the same because it’s just a really lovely thing to have in your community,” she said.
“If you are stuck in a first floor, second floor flat with no garden with kids, it’s just a great thing to watch out the window.”

One picture of flowers was accompanied with a message saying “Let’s focus on the positive” while another drawing of a Superman costume said “Thank You Heroes” and listed roles which frontline workers are continuing to carry out.
Several locals who saw the artworks on the bus stop in west London, near Turnham Green, said it had improved their mood.

In the end, what you said is factually correct, albeit admittedly a poor analogy. The term itself has a sexist history and was pulled out of someone's ass. Never met someone who had a biological clock tell them that they needed to become mothers right away. You either want to start a family or it sadly just happens to you. Nothing about your body suddenly compels you to have babies outside of the social pressure you receive from your environment. The few cases where women describe having baby fever are too unreliable to generalize.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","I'd argue that it's more inherent not necessarily because there aren't pansexual people who have preferences for race...rather it's more inherent (I haven't read much sociological studies on this so I can definitely be wrong and I accept that if I am), since I think there're generally two major reasons when people say they have racial preferences

1. Racial preferences because of appearances, ie. if someone isn't attracted to short people, and then mistakenly by judging off stereotypes and averages, just reductively say I'm not attracted to asian people...I'd argue this is more just reductive and correlation based reasoning rather than a real racial preference, since if they meet a tall asian person, their supposed ""racial preference"" would no longer factor in
2. Excluding racial supremacists, the imo, genuine type of racial preference where people legitimately don't feel attraction to a particular race (regardless of their appearance) doesn't at all stem from inherent or intrinsic feelings of attraction...Rather it comes from associating cultural and certain social traits that have been presented to them in the media or they have personally experienced about a particular race...ie. the association of asian men with submissiveness or a lack of masculinity, the association of black men with aggressiveness and dominance

And reason two, is why I'd argue, while we should tolerate and not judge since no one can change who they're attracted to, racial preferences when it comes to attraction wouldn't exist in a tolerant neoliberal world and it would be better if it didn't...Whilst discriminating potential sexual or romantic partners based on gender or sex, would be still imo perfectly acceptable...I don't think it would be a better or worse world if more people became pansexual, since being gay, straight, bisexual or etc isn't completely if at all, results of prejudiced representations of particular genders or sexes",1588291253

Then you have a very small subset of programs that have a genuine guarantee that they will only ever have to handle ASCII. And then of that subset, there is a *vanishingly tiny* sub-subset that is both guaranteed to never have to handle anything outside of ASCII, and is also so extremely performance sensitive that the size of a single `char` makes any measurable difference.

Handling text properly in computer programs today implies handling everything as Unicode by default, and having as few footguns present as possible. The real world use cases for throwing away those guarantees for the sake of a tiny bit of extra performance are virtually nonexistent. And if one of those rare use cases does pop up, you can always use a byte array.",1588291253

The dismayed staff at the Ronttosrouva bakery found all their orders cancelled last month, at the same time as panicked consumers began to hoard toilet roll.
This sparked the idea of a toilet roll cake made of oat batter, passion fruit mousse and covered with white fondant.
The first five cakes sold within an hour, baker Uliana Timofeeva told Reuters, and the cake became a social media hit.
The bakery now has hundreds of orders and its owner Saana Lampinen has even been able to hire two extra people to her 9-member team.

Taiwan’s settlement by Chinese occurred around the same time as America’s settlement by Europeans.

The Chinese refugees were numerous enough that they were a significant minority, but they were never close to being the majority.

However the Chinese refugees were well armed and they made life hell for Taiwan. The Taiwanese had enjoyed peace, stability, rule of law, education, and increasing prosperity under Japanese rule. The Chinese destroyed all that except for the education, but they turned the education into a propaganda to and a way to erase Taiwanese culture.

Look up the 228 massacres and the White Terror to learn a bit more about “Free China”.

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","Making travel just a one big line of combat encounters is exactly what makes it boring. The players need to be able to make decisions other than which enemy to hit next. The thing is, if you're ignoring encumbrance, food, water, light, shelter and navigation like many are, the only obstacle you have left is combat. The decisions you're left with are choosing between lines of enemies like going through either ogre forest or spider cave, which is pretty much deciding which enemy to hit next. 

Tracking all that stuff gives you more things to consider like taking the long road and going hungry or taking a shortcut offroad and risking getting lost. Also climbing a cliff is much more interesting if you also have a donkey to carry all your stuff. If they're actually using food, the players might realize they can throw some of it to an owlbear to get it off their backs. And doing that would cost them a valuable resource.

That's the best way to make travel interesting and feel like travel, but it's also a style choice. I don't track all that stuff in all my games. In games that don't focus on travel, I usually skip almost all of it. In those games travel's start-flavor-scene-flavor-scene-flavor-arrive. Flavor is few sentences of narration that prompt no action. It's just for giving a feel of moving from place to place, a description of changing scenery, weather and time. 

The Scenes prompt action. They can be starving peasants begging them for food or money in a village they pass through in an area struck by famine, one character noticing a spider climbing on another character's head, a group of knights burning down a mill, a fearless young deer seeking shelter from the blizzard in the party's tent or anything that makes at least one character make a choice that tells something about the character. Scenes have the ""what do you do"". They can lead to encounters, but usually don't have to. These are good for prompting discussion between characters and don't have to be long.

Scenes during travel can also lead to other scenes, interactions and even whole side adventures, but I like to keep these very optional. The players might dig deeper if they want to, and if they do, they get to feel exploration and discovery. If not, the travel goes on.

I give the players a scene or two along the road depending on how many ideas I have, but never a lot. Three is usually the upper limit. Keeps the travel fast and brings the players to the actual focus of the game sooner.",1588291255

Be careful about promise and payoff though. The early parts of your novel are going to be setting up expectations. You're making certain promises to your readers with your setup, first chapters, etc.

So if they're expecting X based on the early book, and it becomes Y, you have to do it well. It's not impossible. Changing things, twists, genre bending, etc are all possible and useful tools. Just use them wisely and not haphazardly. I think going from less action to more action is going to be more acceptable to people than the other way around. ""Action"" not necessarily meaning fight scenes or whatever, but people doing stuff.

Re: a protagonist being ""special"" or not. They have to be an interesting character. Preferably they have an interesting arc. In one of my projects, the main character is a monk. Not a martial arts kung-fu D&amp;D style monk, but an absolutely mundane scholar type dude. Because he's a scholar, he's the only one who's read about and cares about a certain destructive ancient event and the cycle that might cause it to repeat. He has no fighting skill, no magic, and isn't particularly street-smart (he's lived in a monastery his whole life). But he's intelligent and he's passionate about figuring out this event and trying to stop it from happening again. And he has a character arc!

Will it all work in the end? Hopefully. Just gotta actually pull it off, do it right.",1588291256

"funny","t5_2qh33","I know this is probably an unpopular opinion but as someone who largely uses Apple products in a lot of creative avenues (product design more notably), Apple products are mostly incredibly well constructed and the price reflects that. 

Milling and fabricating aluminum even at that production scale likely isn’t cheap before you even get to components. Most wouldn’t argue that their screens are of their own class and internally they’re consistent (albeit more expensive) than similar spec laptops. You pay a premium for build quality but the trade off is that they tend to last a lot longer (hopefully more so now that the keyboard has been fixed) than other laptops utilizing (probably injection molded) plastic. If you take care of your stuff it tends to last, my previous MBP Pro was a 2012 model that was running strong up until this year. 

Their UI is inarguably cleaner and more consistent for the average consumer because it was designed to work seamlessly with their other products and do it efficiently. As far as tablet drawing, I’d consider it a step down to go from an Apple Pencil and an IPad to any other equivalent. You could argue that I could buy an equivalently priced drawing setup but at that price point I’m not going to be getting something as versatile as an IPad. 

Apple sells a lifestyle product that people want. While I know it’s cute to talk shit about the follies of corporatism on Reddit but I think the obnoxiousness of Apple fanboys is significantly less common than the disdain that PC users have for Apple products. Why anyone is surprised that things like this cost more money is baffling to me.",1588291256

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","For starting classes I would recommend Knight or Cleric. 

Knight because you'll start off with a 100% physical resist shield (very important but can also be obtained very early if you explore and encounter a certain undead merchant) and good armor that gives you poise (poise is a stat that reduces how much enemies stagger you). 

On the other hand, Cleric starts with the Heal miracle, which as a beginner is very useful as you'll be able to basically full heal outside battle (5 times per bonfire rest) which will allow for more room for error and you'll be able to explore a bit more comfortably.

Some more general beginner tips:

* Don't put points into RES
* Speak to NPCs until you exhaust their voice lines
* Any weapon is viable, find one that you enjoy using and just upgrade it whenever you can. Note: Weapon upgrades are far more important than shield/armor upgrades, basically only reinforce armor when you have nothing else to do.
* try not to go above 50% equipment load, you'll move and roll incredibly slow.
* When in doubt, put points into VIT and END.
* Press sprint button while sprinting to jump (no idea why the tutorial doesn't cover this).
* Weapons have different stats scaling, when you choose a weapon invest some points in those stats to increase damage. eg. if a weapon has B str scaling, it's very beneficial to invest in STR.
* As for weapon choice, imo one of the best weapons (in terms of moveset) is the Claymore, you can 1-hand it with little STR and DEX investment and you can find it fairly early in the game. But again, just use whatever you like, mastering a weapon's moveset, range and stamina usage is important.
* If you care about the lore, you'll learn most of it through reading item descriptions, if you ain't got time for that, there's always YouTube.
* If you decide to roll a Cleric, I recommend investing in FTH and eventually making a Divine weapon - it'll come in handy at a certain point in the game.
* Don't consume Fire Keeper Souls, give them to a fire keeper instead (there's one at Firelink) to improve your Estus Flask.
* Starting Gift doesn't really matter, but I'd say: Avoid the Master Key on your first playthrough, choose Old Witch's Ring if you want to feel sad, choose blackfire bombs/divine blessings/twin humanities for utility.
* Humanity: You can consume them to heal and earn humanity (number next to your HP) or earn slowly through killing enemies. they're mainly used at the bonfire to Reverse Hollowing and Kindle. Kindling will permanently increase the amount of Estus charges a bonfire gives you. While human you'll be able to kindle, summon NPCs at certain spots to help you and you'll be susceptible to invasions from hostile players.

He assured them that NDA government will be a pro-active supporter and facilitator in their efforts, and the Indian Missions abroad can play an important role.
The Minister said this during discussions with the Export Promotion Councils of the country through video conferencing on Wednesday. He called upon the exporters to identify their strengths, potentials and competitive advantages in specific sectors, and focus on harnessing them in world markets.
He said incentives can be given, but they have to be justified, reasonable, and WTO-compliant. Goyal said the Ministry is working on identifying the specific sectors which can be taken forward in the immediate future for the Exports.
He said that India is going to have a bumper Rabi harvest this season, and storage facilities are overflowing.
At the same time, many countries are not having food of appropriate quality and quantity, due to disruptions in the supply chains because of Covid-19 crisis.
The Minister said that this seems to be a good opportunity for export of agricultural and processed food items",1588291258

I don't think you're saying that everyone who stays in a nice hotel isn't getting a true experience, or that everyone who stays in a hostel is. However most backpackers are looking for an authentic cultural experience and many vacationers are mostly looking for a beach and a place to relax. I've been the resort-goer and the hostel-stayer and I can say I've gained a lot more knowledge and appreciation for other cultures while backpacking than while staying on a resort. When I'm backpacking and I meet people who ask me ""are you here on vacation"" I cringe a little bit. It's kind of like asking someone who's climbing Everest if they're there on vacation.

&gt; The prevalence of pedophilia in the general population is unknown because large-scale epidemiological surveys have not yet been conducted. Much smaller surveys of convenience samples suggest that the upper limit for the prevalence of pedophilia is around 5%, as almost all of these surveys have shown that 3% to 9% of male respondents acknowledge sexual fantasies or sexual contact involving prepubescent children (e.g., Briere &amp; Runtz 1989, Fromuth et al. 1991, Templeman &amp; Stinnett 1991). Only some of these respondents might meet the diagnostic criteria for pedophilia, however, as these surveys have not asked questions regarding the intensity or persistence of sexual fantasies or behavior.

https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.032408.153618

&gt; Our current estimates from the best researcher of pedophilia in the field, Michael Seto, indicate that pedophilia affects less than 5% of the male population and less than 4% of the female population[4]. The DSM-V indicates that the highest prevalence for pedophilia in male population is 3-5%[5]. As such, about 1.12-1.86% of the world’s population are pedophiles, though for minor attraction as a whole, this base number is likely bigger.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

The organisers of the annual awards made the announcement on Tuesday, adding that the COVID-19 outbreak had forced the Academy to make the ""temporary exception"" due to the shutdown of theatres.
Earlier, the Academy required that a film be shown in a commercial motion picture theatre in Los Angeles County for a theatrical qualifying run of at least seven consecutive days, during which period screenings must occur at least three times daily.
""The Academy firmly believes there is no greater way to experience the magic of movies than to see them in a theater. Our commitment to that is unchanged and unwavering. Nonetheless, the historically tragic COVID-19 pandemic necessitates this temporary exception to our awards eligibility rules.
""The Academy supports our members and colleagues during this time of uncertainty. We recognize the importance of their work being seen and also celebrated, especially now, when audiences appreciate movies more than ever,"" said Academy President David Rubin and CEO Dawn Hudson in a statement.
For the 93rd awards ceremony only, the films that had a planned theatrical release but are initially made available on a commercial streaming or video on-demand (VOD) service may qualify in the best picture, general entry and specialty categories.
The film must be made available on the secure Academy Screening Room member-only streaming site within 60 days of its streaming or VOD release. When theatres reopen as per the government guidelines and on a date to be set by the Academy, this rules exemption will no longer apply.
""All films released thereafter will be expected to comply with the standard Academy theatrical qualifying requirements,"" according to the press release.
To ease the theatrical exhibition requirements when theatres reopen, the organisers will also expand the number of qualifying theatres beyond Los Angeles County, including venues like New York City, Bay Area, Chicago, Miami and Atlanta. The Board of Governors also announced that they will be merging the two sound categories -- mixing and editing -- into one award.
The 93rd Oscars telecast will air February 28, 2021 on ABC.

And even a single parent who loves and cares for their child is better than none.

Things you need to be a good parent: empathy, love, a willingness to fight for your children, boundaries, understanding, and in a lot of cases, getting help. 

I read parenting books instead of fiction now, and am in classes and therapy to help me do the best for my kids. I accept when things are too much for me alone. I’m an okay parent, as is my husband (mom and dad), but we try our hardest to raise loving and functioning independent adults. 

Our genitalia have no bearing in our parenting decisions. None. If they did, we would be doing it wrong.

I see shows like killjoys and the expanse getting a shit ton of hype, and for the life of me I just do not get the hype. 

I feel like they both try really hard to be dark, funny, sexy, philosophical, and thought provoking all the while ultimately being none of those things. 

God forbid you say you dont like the expanse, because people go berserker.

Some schools will allow give you space in CASPA to discuss this grade. Some others want you to email them directly as an addendum. Some won’t want to hear about it. It depends on the school.

The r/Metal List:

* Bathory - *Under the Sign of the Black Mark* (1987, Sweden)
* Sarcófago - *I.N.R.I.* (1987, Brazil)
* Master's Hammer - *Rituál* (1991, Czech Republic)
* Darkthrone - *A Blaze in the Northern Sky* (1992, Norway)
* Rotting Christ - *Thy Mighty Contract* (1993, Greece)
* Emperor - *In the Nightside Eclipse* (1994, Norway)
* Burzum- *Hvis lyset tar oss* (1994, Norway)
* Ulver - *Bergtatt: Et eeventyr i 5 capitler* (1995, Norway)
* Vlad Tepes / Belkètre - *March to the Black Holocaust* (1995, France)

EDIT: I should clarify the list isn't the be-all-end-all of black metal.  It's a small collection of classics that offer a broad look at the primary sound of the subgenre.  There's a lot more to black metal than just those albums.  Listen to Caladan Brood - *Echoes of Battle* if you want something totally different that still falls under the umbrella.",1588291263

&gt; Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis responds to a question at a news conference at the Urban League of Broward County, during the new coronavirus pandemic Florida also excludes travelers and seasonal residents who died in the state, though medical examiners include them.

&gt; Florida health officials have stopped publishing real-time coronavirus death data reported by medical examiners after they showed a higher number of fatalities than the official state total.

&gt; The updates stopped after The Tampa Bay Times reported that the medical examiners&amp;#039; death count was 10% higher than the number reported by the Florida Department of Health.

The HFPA implemented new rules last month that are in effect until April 30.
However, the HFPA announced on Tuesday morning that the date has been extended indefinitely because of theatre closures due to the global health crisis, reported Variety.
""The HFPA will continue to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on motion picture distribution and exhibition and may make other temporary variations to those rules as it considers appropriate in the future,"" the organisation said in a statement.
The organisation has suspended the rule that a film had to be screened for HFPA members at a third-party facility in the greater Los Angeles area.
According to new guidelines, distributors must contact the HFPA to arrange a screening date on the official HFPA calendar that meets the timing requirements of the awards eligibility rules.
Distributors must provide all HFPA members with a screening link or a DVD copy of the film on the date the screening is scheduled so that members may view it at home adhering to the social distancing guidelines.
The rules for a film's release have also been changed.
Instead of only considering a movie that was released in theatres or made available on pay-per-view cable or pay-per-view digital delivery in the greater Los Angeles area for a minimum seven days before December 31, the HFPA will now consider titles that had a theatrical release planned to begin in Los Angeles starting March 15, with no cut-off date.
Following HFPA's suit, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences also announced changes to its eligibility rules to allow only films streamed online for the forthcoming Oscars in the wake of the industry-wide shutdown caused by the COVID-19 outbreak.",1588291263

I asked if this was because of that abnormally large blue jet, he replies 'No, it's because of the rhinos' at which point we arrive at a huge fucking truck where herds of rhino's started coming out of it stampede style.

The other reason is that I'm going to be calling generate\_moves with either `Color::White` or `Color::Black` (called `US` in the code I posted), which is then gonna call a few different functions with that same value, and I have a hard time believing that the compiler is going to inline all those functions, which it would have to do in order to optimise away all of the if expressions that check

    if US == Color::White { do_something() } else { do_something_else() }

Using const generics ensures that those checks are optimised away, in that it generates a separate function for each argument value, which I don't suppose the compiler will do on its own.",1588291264

If the players decide to do side quests or other stories, have the main story progress in parallel. You can have the players drawn back in with an encounter or hearing gossip about the events that transpired while they were doing their subplot.

Example: a bad guy is slowly collecting artifacts of macguffin importance to release an ancient evil. One of said artifacts is in a nearby museum. Players are introduced to some adventure hook that draws them to museum, but they decide to go into woods to hunt for bandits. They hunt bandits but return to town hearing about how the museum was robbed from the gossiping townsfolk.

You can have the players do what they want, but progress some story in the background and reveal major events and changes to said story at convienent times.

This may also work for major sub stories that you introduce to the players.",1588291264

Seafood, poultry, shellfish and the like are perfectly fine with me, but the red meat gives me food poisoning levels of sickness that can last (at the most severe case I've had) about a week. I was diagnosed with a form of ""alpha-gal"" Syndrome, which Usually comes from tick bites from the Lonestar Tick (not in my case, however) - Generally, the symptoms of a normal case of alpha-gal would only trigger from ingesting red meat, but it's believed I somehow grew intolerant to proteins in pork as well. Even small amounts (a single crumb of ground beef, for example) makes me incredibly sick.

I haven't had any tests run in the last few years, but I've grown to just adapting to a pescatarian diet, as it seems to be the safest option. It's been rough when I go out to eat, because I have to often ask strange questions about cross-contamination in their kitchens.

* Limits the power of the Attorney General in trying to correct districts that are unfairly drawn. 

I'm not a huge fan of Clean MO, but this new plan is ludicrous. I'd rather see them spend time putting together Ranked Choice Voting.

Quick Edit: Wasted votes are votes that exceed the number required to win. It in no way invalidates a person's right to vote, or their ability to vote.",1588291264

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","I know of a lot of teenagers who have baby showers, but that might just be because of where live. Regardless, baby showers don’t only work in “normal” situations. Sometimes all you need for a baby shower is a couple snacks and your family and friends. While it is possible that OPs daughter had some friends she could have asked for her, her mom could have also asked people for help if she was unable to do it herself. I get what you said about presents and if that was the case it could have just been a celebration of new life or at least to show OPs daughter that she has people who love and care for her and her baby. A lot of times if a mom-to-be tries to throw herself a party and ask for gifts she’s seen as selfish. Especially a teenage mom. Without enough information we’ll never know why OPs oldest daughter didn’t get a baby shower. Maybe she couldn’t, maybe she didnt want one at the time, we won’t know.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

Ross Taylor and White Ferns skipper Sophie Devine took home the men's and women's T20 Player of the Year award respectively, while Suzie Bates was rewarded for her consistency with the bat as she claimed the women's ODI player of the year.
The awards were presented online for the first time due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Williamson had a hugely successful year, both individually and with the New Zealand team, which he led to the World Cup final.
At the World Cup, the 29-year-old amassed 578 runs at an average of 82, including two centuries, which culminated in him being named player of the tournament.
""Kane was simply exceptional at the ICC Cricket World Cup last year,"" New Zealand head coach, Gary Stead said.
""Kane fully deserved his selection. He builds great partnerships with our well-established middle order and when he bats deep in an ODI innings, we'll invariably be in a good position to win most of those matches.
""He leads the team well, he has his own style and certainly the respect of his peers. His calm, purposeful demeanour flows through his leadership and, in turn, the team,"" he added.
Veteran Blackcaps batsman Taylor scored 330 runs at a strike-rate of 130 to take home the honour in the shortest format of the game.
""A man of Ross' international experience is very valuable in the fast and furious nature of T20 cricket,"" Stead said.
""He has the ability to sum up batting conditions quickly and accurately in a variety of venues and countries. This is a skill which serves the team well and helps us adapt plans quickly in the shortest form of the game.""
In women's cricket, Bates was named the ODI player of the year after making two half-centuries in three matches against South Africa - the team's only games in the format in the past year.
Despite only having one ODI series against South Africa at home this summer, Bates showed her class scoring 142 runs at an average of 42.
""Suzie has been a world class performer for many years,"" White Ferns head coach, Bob Carter said.
""She paces an ODI innings really well and has the ability to read fields and pre-empt what opposition captains are trying to do and how they are looking to contain or restrict her game.""
In women's T20, Devine enjoyed an unprecedented year, scoring her maiden T20 century while also becoming the first player, male or female, to reach 50 in five, and then six, consecutive T20 Internationals.
""Sophie had an exceptional season with the bat in T20 cricket,"" Carter said.
Devine scored 429 runs at an average of 71 and at a strike-rate of 132 employing a power game that rivals the best female players in the world.
""Our T20 side is at its best when Sophie is scoring runs at the top. She gives others around her the freedom to play their natural game.
""Sophie's ability with the ball in T20 cricket goes under the radar at times. She will often step up and bowl the hard overs and uses changes of pace to her advantage. She is a top quality all-rounder and an exceptional T20 talent,"" Carter said.",1588291266

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Every other religion starts with a lone revelation, normally by a single man, and they spread their religion with money, power, and societal pressure. Only Christ changed the world by laying down money and power while fighting against societal pressure.

So the Jews prophesied a messiah was coming, right?

Isaiah 53

&gt;5 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed.

They had said thousands of years ago a man was going to show up and turn the world on it's head. Well here comes this guy performing miracles claiming to be the Messiah. He's fulfilling prophecies left and right, and he's captured the hearts of the people to the point that even the rulers are afraid of doing away with him. There is no way for a man to gather that much support out of nothing. He must have been doing and saying incredible things to have garnered the love, attention, and belief of so many. The Bible even talks about where the Jewish leaders say, ""We've dealt with false prophets before. They always fade away without the true mandate of God. Let this burn out.""

Acts 5

&gt;34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. 36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nought. 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed. 38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nought: 39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God. 40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.

But that didn't happen. Jesus had so much success that it proved God was on His side. Notice here the Jews aren't saying, ""They made it all up!"" This was a public ministry. The public had seen the miracles themselves. The Jews were accusing Jesus of doing demon-magic. They were not accusing Him of lying about doing miracles.

Not only this but after Jesus was crucified people claimed to see him rise from the dead. And not just a few people, but hundreds. The people that witnessed the events of Jesus were so convinced of his message and power they were willing to stand up in the face of persecution. A great many people lost their lives because they refused to recant their words. They believed that Jesus was Lord. These people forfeited their lives because they were there. They had seen Jesus perform miracles. They heard his words. They knew the truth, and they could not face their deaths and lie to save their own skins. This must have been a very powerful message indeed.

The message continued to survive persecution even with the power of the world's greatest empire trying to snuff them out. These Christians, these poor middle eastern men and women, were surviving against armies, gold, and might with simply the power of the words of Jesus on their hearts. Ultimately they did survive completely, and the message of Jesus spread like wildfire, changing the world over in a figurative blink of an eye. Not a single person living today has had their life unaffected by the words and actions of this singular poor man from the middle east. This man held the power to change the world, and He claimed to be God.",1588291266

"bapcsalescanada","t5_2tesr","\&gt; I bet any 500$ chair if you do your research will be as comfortable or more.

For many people they use these exact chairs at work, know they're comfortable and supportive for long periods, they have the disposable income, so why faff about?  The cost of an ergonomic chair relative to the medical/productivity/quality of life costs of issues like back pain are marginal.  Issues with a chair may not be obvious until using it for an extended period of time especially if you already have issues to start with.

I'm sure there are chairs that are just as good, I would be surprised if there aren't a fair number of cheaper chairs that are actually better for an individual's body, yet companies like Herman Miller and Steelcase do good business because people know they have solid R&amp;D, solid adjustability, you can try their products out easily, and they will compete with cheaper vendors if you're buying at volume.",1588291266

"rutgers","t5_2risk","Took calc BC in my junior year of high school and calc 3 my senior year but rutgers wouldn’t accept my transfer credit of calc 3, so that’s my point of view for this: 
I’d say just skip directly to calc 3 in college. Yes, BC may not be exactly like college level courses; however, from helping some of my friends in those classes, it seems that there’s so many subjects covered in calc (especially calc 2) that haven’t really been mentioned in higher level courses. Calc 1 and 2 just seem like weed out courses at times here, and I personally felt that the education from BC was enough to set me up well for higher level math courses.
As for comparison of calc 3 in my high school to college: the only real difference was the larger class size at college. The curriculum was essentially the same and the difficulty was relatively equal for both. All in all, I’d say, especially if they may want a math minor, just start with calc 3. No point in them retaking calc 1 and 2 if it may also just hinder their passion for math!",1588291266

That is an oxymoron.

Being armed and protesting are mutually exclusive. But even so, the ""liberal"" media is giving white supremacist terrorist groups special treatment. 

If they are armed, they are NOT participating in a protest, they're participating in the crime of armed intimidation. They are not protesters. They are domestic terrorists. Terrorists use violence and threats of violence to force people into following their political desires. This is textbook terrorism.  Can you imagine how a Black Lives Matter rally would be treated if there was even ONE firearm present? 

Getting an Americans to accurately label a white terrorist group as such is harder than pulling teeth from a lion.  

I have been to MANY protests and political rallies of many different groups. I have NEVER seen brandished weapons by anyone other than the police. EVER. But white supremacists get special treatment.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

More than 430 million enterprises in hard-hit sectors such as retail and manufacturing risk ""serious disruption"", the UN agency added.
The findings appear in the ILO Monitor third edition: COVID-19 and the world of work, released Wednesday.
Globally, there are some 3.3 billion workers. Two billion have jobs in the informal economy, the most vulnerable workers in the labour market. The agency said 1.6 billion in the informal economy ""have suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living"" as a result of the economic meltdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to lockdowns or because they work in hard-hit sectors, these workers globally have seen a 60 per cent drop in income during the first month of the crisis, according to ILO estimates.
This translates into a more than 80 per cent decline in Africa and the Americas, 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia, and 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, the ILO said.
ILO Director General Guy Ryder said as the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the world's most vulnerable workers becomes even more urgent.
""For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing. They have no savings or access to credit,"" he said. ""These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don't help them now, they will simply perish.""
The UN agency estimated that compared to the pre-crisis levels, there will be a 10.5 per cent deterioration in working hours during the second quarter (Q2) of the year, equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs. Previous projections had put the figure at 6.7 per cent, or 195 million full-time workers.
The situation has worsened for all major regions, again compared to pre-crisis levels. Q2 estimates suggest a 12.4 per cent loss of working hours in the Americas, and 11.8 per cent for Europe and Central Asia. All other regions are above 9.5 per cent.
The ILO added that the proportion of workers living in countries where workplace closures have been recommended, or required, has decreased from 81 per cent to 68 per cent over the past two weeks.
While this is largely due to changes in China, measures have been stepped up elsewhere. At the same time, 436 million enterprises operating in wholesale and retail, manufacturing, accommodation, and other economic sectors that have been hardest hit, face ""high risks of seriousruption"".
The ILO called for ""urgent, targeted and flexible measures"" to support both workers and business, particularly smaller enterprises and those in the informal economy.
""Measures for economic reactivation should follow a job-rich approach, backed by stronger employment policies and institutions, better-resourced and comprehensive social protection systems. International coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will also be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable. International labour standards, which already enjoy tripartite consensus, can provide a framework,"" it said.
The ILO also stressed that international coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable.

""May 2016, MSNBC's  Mika Brzezinski accused the DNC of bias against the Sanders campaign and called on Wasserman Schultz to step down.Wasserman Schultz was upset at the negative media coverage of her actions, and she emailed the political director of NBC News, Chuck Todd, that such coverage of her ""must stop"".""

Its also pretty damning when the Chairman of the DNC, the effective leader of the org,  is saying ""he isn't going to be president."" I mean come on. What more do you need? 

You also can't forget the blatant evidence of it actually happening which means it's not a conspiracy theory but is an actual outright conspiracy against his campaign:  ""the DNC chief financial officer (CFO) Brad Marshall told the DNC chief executive officer, Amy Dacy, that they should have someone from the media ask Sanders if he is an atheist prior to the West Virginia primary.""

And this great quote from Mark Paustenbach: ""Wondering if there’s a good Bernie narrative for a story, which is that Bernie never had his act together, that his campaign was a mess”

Are you so naive to think that these emails are all that happened and there was nothing else the DNC did to hamper Bernie's campaign? Do you still think the DNC is neutral in it's action towards member candidates? If you do. Great. You give me more reason to see the Biden campaign as blue MAGA. Has had ample opportunity to be transparent and show they made a mistake and will no longer have any amount of favoritism towards a candidate. They didn't so they can't be trusted.

&gt;• a committee by Assad claimed he’s involved in tax fraud &amp; must pay more: 125-130 billion  
&gt;  
&gt;• I’m willing to pay but not all of the sum at once   
&gt;  
&gt; Apart from the plea, the remarks are quite interesting.  He says when he claimed he abandoned his businesses &amp; turned his wealth to humanitarian work after the 2011 uprising, it was to take a bullet for Assad &amp; to not embarrass him. This is the result of that move, he says.   
&gt;  
&gt; Assad’s cousin also says this:   ‘I’m made to look like the bad guy. That’s fine.’  He says if I’m forced to pay all of the amount, the company will collapse.   
&gt;  
&gt; Rami Makhlouf starts defiant, saying his biz pays exactly what it owes.  Then he says he’ll pay but please don’t make me pay it all at once.  Then he tried benevolence, saying please spend the money I’ll pay on the poor Syrians because the committee might steal the money.",1588291268

"sololeveling","t5_r7x8p","I hope this is a joke but I don’t think it is. Zeno can snap his fingers and erase an entire universe or timeline. Jin woo is crazy strong by the end, easily the strongest thing in the SL universe  but he would get smacked around by any main cast member from DB post dbz. I won’t bother to prove that he lose to Zeno, Zeno doesn’t need to fight he just ends your existence jin woo has nothing to stop that. And dont bring up his immortality, zamasu was immortal too

As proof let’s do some simple power comparison (I feel like a good source for this since I finished rereading the SL LN last week and I own all of the dragon ball manga and have read it many times):

Everything below is SPOILERS for LN idk why spoiler &gt;! !&lt; thing doesn’t work maybe it’s too long

&gt;! The dragon emperor who is undoubtedly the strongest opponent jin woo ever faced is stated to be able to destroy a planet with his breath of destruction. Saiyan saga vegeta can blow up planets, king vegeta is said to have blown 3 planets up at once, Freeza blows up planet vegeta. In SL The combat between the sovereigns and rulers leaves the planet they fought on destroyed, the combat between ssg goku and beerus was going to leave the universe they fought in destroyed.

There are terms for overall character level independent of the series they are from, here are some examples: mountain level (can destroy a mountain), continent level (can destroy continent), world level (take a guess), universe level (can destroy a universe)

It’s a good way to compare raw strength (does not include “hacks” abilities like many naruto characters have).

Goku is universe level (source: whis in ssg goku vs beerus)

Jin woo is planet level (source: he has stronger but similar power to that of dragon emperor)

Most dbs character are above solar system level (source: cell was solar system level and most characters are much stronger then him)

Point is jin woo fights off world ending threats and goku fights universe level threats !&lt;",1588291269

Actor Amitabh Bachchan tweeted: ""I'm devastated"" as he announced the news.
President Ram Nath Kovind, Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid their homage to the actor recollecting his immense talent and the work he has done over the years.
Union ministers, film industry colleagues and people from all walks of life remembered Rishi Kapoor's films and the memories they shared with him.
Kamal Haasan condoled the death of Rishi Kapoor. He recalled Kapoor was always ready with a smile.
""Can't believe it. Chintu ji @chintskap (Mr Rishi Kapoor) was always ready with a smile. We had mutual love and respect. Will miss my friend. My heartfelt condolence to the family,"" he said.
Rajinikanth, who had acted with Kapoor in the Hindi flick 'Dosti Dushmani', described him as a ""dearest friend"" while Haasan expressed disbelief over his ""Saagar"" co-star's demise following his battle with cancer.
""Heartbroken ... Rest In Peace ... my dearest friend #RishiKapoor,"" Rajinikanth said in a tweet.

A little bit of backstory: I occasionally work at a sub contractor position (2x 7 hours a week) after my 9-5. I was on my way home at 1am when my car broke down. Being a proud car guy I couldn’t call a tow truck and limped it home after a few hours trying to fix it. 

Decided it would be easier for me to just stay up from 5-7 than to try to get 2 hours of sleep &amp; go in for my 9-5. Fatal mistake. 

We closed a location from a few states away and the moving trucks got back that morning. This included a fair amount of I.T. Equipment, to which my boss asked everyone to help unload the trucks. In addition to our stuff, there were probably 200 chairs, and over 100 wooden tables. And around 8 guys to do the work. 

Que me being awake for almost 28 hours and working for 20 of them at that point, I nearly passed out carrying a table up the stairs. Boss noticed I was pale as a ghost &amp; asked me to please take the day off (paid) and rest. 

Side note: I got sick that weekend and experienced all the symptoms of COVID-19. However we only had a couple confirmed cases in the U.S. at that point. Who knows?",1588291270

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","Zeus has a very high def buff as long as his two ""wings"" are up, so you need to destroy the top and bottom if you want to do decent damage to his main body. The best way to do that is using the MC, and it's also better to do the top part first.

So use this order: top -&gt; bottom -&gt; middle. On his 3rd HP bar, the top and bottom will come back, so just repeat as your MC skills come off cooldown (if you have a strong attacker or someone like Jalter or Super Orion you may be able to do enough damage to ignore one of his sides).

There's a ton of RNG in this fight since there's nothing stopping Zeus from critting, stunning or evading multiple times in a row which can ruin everything, so just because you lose doesn't necessarily mean your party doesn't work.

Será que toda tu postura, existe, totalmente basada en la idea, intangible y delirante, de que los intercambios son justos, mientras existe violencia en diversas formas detrás de todo capitalismo, detrás de todo intercambio, en manos del estado o de privados, y genera un movimiento de capital que fue fundado en base a la imposición de las armas.


El ""intercambio justo"" en nuestro continente fueron invasores con armas de fuego masacrando flechas y lanzas, generando ríos de sangre para explotar minas como la de potosí, que demarcaron el territorio y los centros urbanos. 


En base a eso se ""genero riqueza"", o se extrajo como dice tanta literatura.


Realmente esa falacia de que una escuela eligió decir que la teoría del valor del trabajo esta refutada, hacerse consenso propio, y construir a partir de ahí, es el cuento que vos elegiste creer, y según yo entiendo nadie te tomaría demasiado en serio fuera de tus propios círculos.


No comprendiste algo tan básico como que se puede generar una historia a partir de una herramienta y eso puede contraponerse o usarse para construir algo más, por que esas herramientas suelen dar una buena forma a los datos, pero bueno, sino como hacen otros chantas existe la posibilidad de construir a partir de la negación del materialismo histórico cuentos fantásticos, y utópicos, donde la ""libertad económica"" que no existe, pero en la que creen fervientemente, es el único camino a la utopía.


En base a esa injusticia inicial, y muchas otras guerras, masacres, dictaduras y tiranías, se fundaron naciones, conflictos eternos que generaron capital y valor obviamente, que siguen presentes; si no encontraste fuentes es por que realmente no estas queriendo aceptar posturas que no miren las situaciones solamente desde las estadísticas económicas de institutos privados que tienen intereses poniendo presión sobre sus resultados, y sobre el uso de cierto lenguaje y datos específicos para pintar un cuento donde el capitalismo es solamente un pobre malentendido.",1588291271

Everyone is too concentrated in the central score.

If you're into the Empire, Tarkin was one of my favorites and I thought Catalyst (the Rogue One Prequel) was great as well in terms of telling the early story of the Empire and Death Star.

If you're into political intrigue, Bloodline was great. I thought it did the best job so far of setting the stage for how the First Order came to be.

If you like Mad Max, post-apocalyptic stories, Phasma is also one of my favorites and sets up her character so well. But also makes me sad about how they treated her in the movies.  

I think the Thrawn Trilogy is must-read, but that's definitely due to the nostalgia factor of the original ""Thrawn Trilogy"" from legends. It's just awesome seeing him in book form again.

The only ones I'd 100% avoid are Heir to the Jedi (just terrible all around), Canto Bight (I'm embarrassed I read that), and maybe Force Collector (but only because I thought they could have done so much more with the concept).",1588291272

It also sounds like you two keep your finances separate and they're of the mentality that finances should be shared.

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

As part of its emergency steps, the Fed said it will also keep buying Treasury and mortgage bonds to help keep rates low and ensure that companies can lend easily to each other amid a near-paralysis of the economy caused by the coronavirus. It did not specify any amounts or timing for its bond purchases.
At a news conference, Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned about any prospects for a swift or a robust economic recovery, saying, ""I would say that it may well be the case that the economy will need further support from all of us if the recovery is to be a strong one.""
Powell suggested that given the depth of the US economic catastrophe, with perhaps 30 million people having lost jobs in the past six weeks, it will ""probably will take some time for us to get back to a more normal level of employment and ultimately maximum employment.""
The chairman and the Fed itself sought to provide reassurance, though, that their aggressive intervention could help mitigate the vast damage to the economy and to millions of workers.
In its statement, the Fed said it is ""committed to using its full range of tools to support the US economy in this challenging time. The viral outbreak and measures to contain it,"" the statement noted, are inducing sharp declines in economic activity and a surge in job losses.
Under Powell, the Fed is confronting a deeply perilous moment for an economy that had looked robust just a few months ago. Since the virus struck with full force last month, widespread business shutdowns have caused roughly 30 million workers to lose jobs. As layoffs mount, retail sales are sinking, along with manufacturing, construction, home sales and consumer confidence.
In its statement, the Fed also raised concerns about slowing inflation, which is likely to sink further below its 2 per cent target level in the coming months.
""Weaker demand and significantly lower oil prices are holding down consumer price inflation,"" the statement said.
During two emergency meetings in March, the Fed cut its benchmark rate to a range between zero and 0.25%. It has also announced nine new lending programs to pump cash into financial markets and provide support to large and medium-sized businesses as well as cities and states.
The Fed's statement provided no additional details about its actions. It said it will keep its rate at nearly zero until it is confident that the economy has weathered recent events and is on track to achieve its maximum employment and price stability goals. That's the same language it used in its previous statement last month.
Nor did the Fed provide details about the pace of its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. It has tapered those purchases recently as markets have calmed. But earlier this month, it bought as many Treasury securities in a day as it did during an entire month in the 2008-2009 Great Recession.
The Fed's statement came on the same day that the Commerce Department released grim news about the economy: Economic output shrank at a 4.8% annual rate in the first three months of the year the worst showing since the Great Recession struck near the end of 2008.
The economic picture is expected to grow ever darker, with the economy forecast to contract at a shocking 30% to 40% annual rate in the April-June quarter. The unemployment rate could reach 20% when April's jobs report is released next week.
The central bank has already slashed its benchmark interest rate to near zero and escalated its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to pump cash into financial markets to smooth the flow of credit. It has also said it will buy corporate bonds and lend to states and cities two actions it has never previously taken.
The fact that they are operating in those markets is unprecedented,"" said Nathan Sheets, chief economist at PGIM Fixed Income and a former director of international finance at the Fed. They are coming up on the extent of their legal authorities here.
Yet this crisis is unlike any other, and it comes against a backdrop of horrific economic data. More than 26 million Americans have sought unemployment benefits since the viral outbreak shuttered much of the U.S. economy in mid-March.
As economic activity has collapsed, inflation has also begun to fall. Economists expect it to drop below 1% by next year, far under the Fed's 2% target level. That poses another problem for the Fed: Declining prices can eventually lead consumers to delay spending, thereby slowing the economy further.",1588291273

After hitting a high of 33,640.73, the 30-share index was trading 895.69 points or 2.74 per cent higher at 33,615.85.
Similarly, the NSE Nifty shot up 247.20 points, or 2.59 per cent, to 9,800.55.
Maruti was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying nearly 7 per cent, followed by M&amp;M, ICICI Bank, Infosys, Tata Steel, Bajaj Auto, Axis Bank and Bajaj Finance. Shares of Reliance Industries, HUL and Tech Mahindra were trading on a positive note ahead of their earnings announcements.
On the other hand, Sun Pharma was the sole laggard.
In the previous session, the BSE barometer settled 605.64 points or 1.89 per cent higher at 32,720.16, while the Nifty advanced 172.45 points, or 1.84 per cent, to close at 9,553.35. Foreign portfolio investors turned net buyers in the capital market on Wednesday, as they purchased equity shares worth Rs 722.08 crore, according to provisional exchange data.
Investor sentiment improved on hopes that gradual lifting of global lockdowns would help start economic recovery, they added.
Investor sentiment was buoyed by news of a possible breakthrough in testing for a treatment of COVID-19.
Top US epidemiologist Anthony Fauci said that Gilead Science's remdesivir ""has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery"". Further, the US Federal Reserve signalled on Wednesday that it will keep its key short-term interest rate near zero for the foreseeable future as part of its extraordinary efforts to bolster the economy.

I think it is very useful to think of datums not only the way that it is going to be made but also in the way that it will be used but most importantly the way it will measured. For the big part case, if your datums were the sides of your part you would need a giant CMM to touch off on the sides of your part to then measure your clearance cutout to. Whereas if you have the bolt pattern as datums you could create a small go-no-go gauge.

"transmaxxing","t5_263axm","I know my comment won't be so popular, but I'd like to present another point of view and hope you'll benefit from it in a sense.  Fyi, I'm from Asia and was born male.  I'm not an incel, but I'm just giving support and pointing a few things out.

&gt;Why its too difficult for me to repress as an asian incel AGP **gender dysphoric** male.

First and foremost, dysphoria is absolutely horrible.  If you feel dysphoric, transitioning might be an option, and you could be a girl, enby, or anything really.  Regardless, I suggest talking to a professional who specialises in gender, as I'm not qualified to help you determine the best course of action or help you seriously.

I've watched the video you embedded and I have to say it's ridden with flaws.

Firstly, most of the information is cherry-picked; points that are ""disadvantageous for Asian males"" are highlighted and exclusively presented.  Sure, there may be a sliver of truth to those studies, but instead of staring at it in dismay, look into the antecedents (= cause and effect) and how you can improve the odds of being liked whilst being who you think you really are.  Basically, be the change you want to see, and don't change for anyone/anything else.  I'll leave the antecedent tree with you as homework.

Secondly, I have watched in full some of the videos whose parts were included in the embedded video to support the claim that Asian women choose not to date Asian men.  About half of the Asian women interviewed actually preferred Asian men, most notably men of their own ethnicity, over western men.  Again, this follows from the first point that many points were cherry-picked.  And I totally understand why you'd feel upset if you only saw this portion of reality.

Thirdly, some straight facts for ya.  Most Asian women in their respective countries prefer men of their own ethnicity and tend to be from the middle-to-upper echelon, most of whom are well-educated and able to sustain themselves financially.  Only a minority in their respective countries prefer men outside of their own ethnicity and tend to be from the lower echelon.  I'd even argue that even the majority of the lower echelon prefer men of their own ethnicity.  I do not know about multicultural societies in the west, but the world is a darn big place.  And there is a reason why interracial relationships are special: they are not as common.

With societies being more open and connected with each other, interracial dating is becoming increasingly common.  There are more and more people interested in dating outside their ethnicity.  Even white women are on about K-pop and consequently Asian men.  I'm actually quite surprised by the growing trend of K-pop in the west, since it's already been around where I live for quite a while.

&gt;Asian males have  
\&gt;small dick  
\&gt;short height  
\&gt;neotanous face and body  
\&gt;no body hair  
\&gt;lack of beard

So what?  All sizes, shapes, and bodies are marvellous the way they are.  If someone says otherwise about you, simply because they don't like something about you, it's their loss and they can go on the long walk and spend additional time trying to find ""the one.""  Besides, if you're a trans woman, wouldn't the feminine resemblance help you pass?

&gt;\&gt;all race and gender DESPISE asian men as dating partner  
\&gt;all race and gender LOVE asian women as dating partner

That's quite a thing to say.  As I mentioned earlier, this is not necessarily the case.  If it's any consolation, the dynamics of a relationship between an Asian woman and a man of another ethnicity is actually rather toxic and abusive a lot of the time.  In other words, each party always has an ulterior motive to gain certain things from each other.  For example, the woman may be in the relationship mainly because the man provides her with regular income from his income and the man may be in the relationship mainly because the woman is perceived by the man as being more traditional and kind thanks to a bunch of stereotypes.  This leads to negative public perception towards pairings between an Asian woman and a man of another ethnicity, especially WMAF.  Needless to say, not all WMAF relationships are like this, but those that are showcase the underlying social structure at play.  On the other hand, AMWF relationships are quite the opposite.  Each party tends to be more or less equal and the dynamic is generally great.  Public perception towards such pairings are less negative.

There's also the reality of misogyny and transmisogyny.  Misogyny is a much bigger adversary if you're a woman of colour, even contemporary feminism still needs a lot of work doing in order to address non-white groups.  Transmisogyny is also an important factor to consider, which also brings up a point that being in a relationship as a trans WoC is actually really dangerous, because not only is there misogyny against WoC, but being trans also makes you even less visible to society and mainstream movements when you need it the most, which means more odds of being abused and shunned, etc.  With that said, many movements are becoming more intersectional, considering the experiences that occurs when being a woman, coloured, and transgender intersect, but it's still being developed and also pretty white-centric.

&gt;**Im a** ~~coward and~~ **neet.**

No offence, but that might be the reason why some people are reluctant to be with you.  When most people look for a partner, they tend to look for one with a similar background, especially in terms of education, careers, and experiences.  I surmise that this is advantageous in order to guarantee the smooth future of the relationship and the well-being of each other's offspring.  There's nothing wrong with voluntarily being a NEET as some might be, but because most people don't relate to that experience, they are bound to feel a bit of resistance.

You might want to check out a few subs that might give you different viewpoints.  r/amwf, r/AMWFs, r/AMBW, r/AMXFs are subreddits that showcase and seek to empower relationships between Asian men and women mostly outside their own race.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","The Switch release of BOTW was at 16.3 million as of December 31.  It did just over 1 million for the Jan-Mar quarter last year (which is nuts, btw). It could be presumed to do less this year under normal circumstances, but will also have been supported by pandemic game buying, so lets say a 20% YOY boost for 1.2 million as a guestimate for this year's quarter.  17.5 million on Switch.  If you want to add WiiU, roughly 19 million.

We have two known numbers for AC:  3.9 million physical in Japan, and 5 million digital globally for the first month.  With just those two data points, we'e pretty much at half of BOTW's best guess total.  We also know through NPD that AC was not only the top selling game physically in the US in March but propelled Switch hardware sales to the highest total of any March for any Nintendo hardware ever. And there is little reason not to believe that sales remain strong in April, particularly as the game has pretty much been the top seller anywhere any such list is posted.

It is, ultimately an educated guess.  But given it is dominating sales everywhere, and given Nintendo's other major titles with broad Japanese and global appeal have typically sold to about a 3-5:1 ratio of ""rest of the world"" vs Japan, I would feel very comfortable in predicting at this point that the game is going to be close to the 18-20 million range.

Now, this is all unprovable, of course.  Assuming the May 7 earnings call remains on schedule, we'll know figures to March 31 then.   By the time we get the next earnings call in late July, we will have added another two months of sales from today.  At that point, I expect AC will have handily passed BOTW - but of course, we'll never have an April 30 comparison.",1588291276

What you need to relise is the reason you do these rituals is because you’ve trained your brain and brainwashed it into thinking somehting bad will happen and what you need to do is replace it with good connotations. So if you say a disease like ...*example* look at that word and as hard as it may be and repeat this does not result in anything this does not result in anything and watch. Don’t do your ritual and nothing will happen other than your anxiety creeping up on you because it’s trained to do that. Next try mediation. Think if the perosn you want to become-free from ocd and steady your breathing this really helped me . Realest affirmations to- my anxiety is trying to convince me things that arnt true and I am stronger and will not be defeated.

If it is so hard for New York to do them how the fuck did China do it? Or fucking Russia? Or Brazil? Or fucking Columbia?. I am so sick of this stupid ass argument, every modernized nation on earth except the US has some form of universal healthcare. In addition the states you say are not locked down are now seeing blooms in their cases as now rural areas are being hit by the virus. This disease is not a city thing you fuck it is affecting the nation. We are in a recession so no those states you mentioned are being affected and business everywhere in the country are recognizing that if all their workers are sick they cannot function and thusly shut down regardless. The only reason meat plants are open right now is because trump forced them to stay open. And no this isn’t a way to sneak in state bailouts you dumb fuck the only thing that are being bailed out are the same companies and banks that started the 2008 crisis. 

Edit: here’s a direct example in Maryland of the state having to protect supplies bought using state funds from trump trying to steal them

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","&gt; ah yes, the old ""when they develop the tools, then we'll see real progress"" line

It's a line, because it's reality. Full stop. If you don't understand that, you don't understand how software is developed and how video games are produced. Those tools are used to create things a much larger scale and at an efficiency that is reasonable. If anyone expected that CIG would be able to build out a massive open universe all handcrafted, they would be insane. There is no way they could do that on a scale that would be reasonable to anyone. Which is why they've invested so heavily into procedural tech. So they can use that to scale up the amount of content they create in a faster timescale.

&gt;i think i've been hearing that for the last 3 or 4 years now. look, idk how long you've been following this project, but i've been here since the beginning.

As have I.

&gt; CR made sky-high promises during the stretch goal days. promises that have been plaguing this project for the better part of a decade.

And here we go with extending timescales on a hyperbolic manner. Real development, and any sort of 'promises' haven't been happening for the 'better part of a decade'. Hell we haven't even hit 10 years of existence of the company, let alone real development efforts. That didn't start until 2013.

&gt;why has Star Citizen been unable to do what other AAA games have with more money, more resources and more time? because it's biggerer and betterer than all of them?

Give me some examples of things that other AAA games have done that CIG hasn't been able to do. And i don't care about 'gameplay' or 'polish' or anything of that sort at this time, because the game is actively and pointedly still in an alpha state. If CIG were trying to promote the game as some finished product, ready to be sold to the masses without any disclaimers to say 'we are still actively building this thing'  then yeah we could talk about that. But right now, it is simply due to them still actively working on the thing. If you don't like that, okay that's fair, people like having finished products. Come back when the product is finished. Meanwhile, those of us that like watching the sausage get made, will enjoy watching that process

&gt;or because the man at the helm has no one left to whisper in his ear and say, maybe it's time to scale things back a little, this isn't working out. instead he's just sailing directly towards the sun.

Can we let this point go at any time? Sheesh. We haven't had a 'new feature' promised to us in years. And in the mean time, CIG has been building out the tech to make the features that were promised a reality. And they've delivered on a ton of them so far, with even more on the horizon.

&gt;i guess they can just go on selling jpg's forever

So i have a problem with this line of thought. Because this assumes that the people who could be making those 'jpgs' as it were (even though a vast majority of the most recent concepts have been based on renders that go on to be used to create actual in game assets, yanno for efficiency sake) are those that could be working on gameplay or building tech or whatever. They have over 500 employees. Some people can come up with some designs and create some art and if it helps keep the lights on, I don't have a problem with them doing this. Because while the one or two people who are making those 'jpgs', they are creating revenue for the project to keep 500+ people employed and working on the project. The notion of the 'jpg scam' has sailed along time ago. 

&gt; but i think enough time has passed to show that something is clearly wrong with the development of this game on a structural level.

I fail to see this. Those that have that perspective, hey that's fair and I respect their opinions, but that is not the objective truth. The objective truth is the game is being built and they are creating something that hasn't been done before. The only thing that that perspective gains is an insight into the game development process. CIG isn't unique in its struggles. It's only unique that those struggles are laid bare to everyone because they are far and away more open than any other software developer I've ever seen

At this point, I grow tired in having these same circular arguments using the same tired points and the same counter points. You can have your perspective, I will have mine. If you do not appreciate where the game is at or the pace that its going, that's totally fair and I don't begrudge you having those opinion I simply don't agree with them. With that, have a good evening and perhaps I will see you in the verse. I'll buy you a beer!",1588291278

"Jcole","t5_2vdqu","\&gt; but I can't really sit down and listen to some kendrick without feeling like he's preaching to me lmao. Different strokes I guess.

naw big fax bro u rite

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so glad the whole bs ""rapping fast = talent"" trend is gone

&amp;#x200B;

I have hella kendrick songs in my library but tbh

&amp;#x200B;

I hate to say it but Kendrick can be fucking annoying in the way he raps, its so pretentious (just like his fanbase) it can be aggravating, like swimming pools is great, but most his songs make me feel like I'm being lectured like foh

&amp;#x200B;

its unfortunate cuz some of his bars are fire; some other ones are just so try-hard n corny

&amp;#x200B;

M&amp;M is garbage too idgaf, his whole popularity is built on the foundation of preteen white bios

&amp;#x200B;

J cole has 2 songs that can come across preachy but even then he acknowledges that that's not his intention IN the song and the overall message is not only true but his tracks can still set a great mood &amp; vibe.

&amp;#x200B;

Like with Cole I don't feel as if the beat carries him, he works with it.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PSA for those who want to know what 2 songs I'm referencing:

1.) ""*Friends*"" on *KOD*

The whole ""meditate, don't medicate""  shit came across so corny,

but at least he acknowledged by saying *""I understand this message is not the coolest to say"".*

&amp;#x200B;

Plus the rest of the bars were on point.

*""But I'm aggravated without it*

*My saddest days are without it*

*My Saturdays are the loudest*

*I'm blowing strong*

*Some niggas graduated with powder*

*I dabble later, I doubt it*

*My database of narcotics*

*It's growing long""*

&amp;#x200B;

2.) *""Love Yourz""* on *2014 Forest Hills Drive*

*""It's beauty in the struggle nigga, ugliness in the success""*

Yikes, this can be so offputting to any1 whos been in poverty lmao, but he redeemed himself by later on in the song saying *""Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect*

*To all my niggas out there living in debt""*

And the fax he spit out about materialism was fucking legandry

*""Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me*

*'Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly*

*Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got*

*Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the one's you rock*

*Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours*

*But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours""*

&amp;#x200B;

This shit is so mentally relieving and therapeutic to listen to, I listen to it hella

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I went to listen to my Kendrick tracks on my Spotify playlist &amp; I feel obligated to say, if u like j cole, u will 100% like ""Feel"" by Kendrick. Fucking timeless",1588291278

"portugal","t5_2qmie","Sei que das primeiras medidas que a Dinamarca tomou para o desconfinamento foi a abertura de creches e pré-escolar, sob o pretexto de que mesmo que contraiam o vírus, não seria tão crítico porque os pais logicamente serão mais novos (e eles constituem família mais cedo que nós, por norma) e têm mais probabilidades de ficarem assintomáticos ou sintomas ligeiros. Assim, além de não sobrecarregarem os hospitais porque são sintomas ligeiros, no máximo, vão desenvolvendo anticorpos, contribuindo para a imunidade de grupo (Tenho de procurar fonte, tenho quase a certeza que vi isto algures). Além de libertar os pais para trabalho, como já foi aqui dito.

Ora, há muito poucos casos de crianças dos 0 aos 9 anos infetadas com o virus, segundo os dados da DGS. Não sei se será por serem realmente menos, por estarem menos expostos porque têm que estar em casa ou se é porque têm mais resistência ""natural"" à coisa, mas talvez possa fazer algum sentido abrir-se as creches em primeiro lugar antes do resto do básico",1588291279

Find a roaster manufacturing company that will support you with parts and tech support. Roasters can be temperamental and shit goes wrong (several times per year, even if you keep up with tip-top maintenance). Also, check with zoning and your health department/department of agriculture. Trust me, the roaster is just the tip of the financial iceberg. Prepare to spend equal the roaster cost on electrical, smoke abatement, makeup air, fire suppression. Add a high quality grinder, scale or weigh-and-fill machine, bag sealer, bags, labels, green coffee, rent before you break even, and you are easily looking at $30K. If you have enough assets to guarantee a loan, write your plan and do it fast, because fiscal liquidity will soon be drying up fast.",1588291279

Ankle ORIF is **major** surgery. We use are ankles to walk, so we bear **all our weight** on them. This explains you're swelling and taking into account the adjustment to the hardware, but I don't anticipate this will be be permanent. As I mentioned, full recovery will take time. It's great that you were able to complete PT. As I mentioned, a compression sock will help manage the swelling. This is what my surgeon recommended when I had swelling in my ankle. 

Once things return to normal, go in for a check-up with your orthopedic to ensure that all is good with your hardware. It's a good sign that you are not experiencing pain, so I predict your hardware *has not* shifted. Nevertheless, it's best for the specialist to take a look and physically examine your ankle once it's safe to do so.",1588291281

"DDnews","t5_2fp314","**Summary:** 

Until now, Britain had reported only deaths of people who had tested positive for COVID-19 in hospital but there has been mounting concern about high numbers of unreported victims in the wider community.
On Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics said deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending April 17 were running at roughly double the five-year average and were the highest weekly total since 1993.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Wednesday said there were an additional 3,811 deaths included in the outbreak since the start of March, on top of figures from the last 24 hours.
""They don't represent a sudden surge in the number of deaths,"" he told reporters.
Britain has now leapfrogged the tolls in France and Spain and is the second-worst affected country in Europe, behind Italy's 27,359 deaths. The United States has the world's worst death toll with 58,355.
Britain has widened its testing regime for COVID-19 to care homes, the over-65s and people unable to work from home, as part of increased measures to curb the outbreak.
A total of 85 frontline workers in the state-run National Health Service (NHS) have died from the coronavirus, and 23 in social care, according to the government.
There remain questions about the provision of personal protective equipment to medics and others dealing with patients, and the availability of testing.
Raab, who has deputised for Johnson during his illness and recovery, warned the government is not yet ready to ease lockdown restrictions. ""This issue of a second spike and the need to avoid it, it's not a theoretical risk,"" he said. ""Having relaxed restrictions in Germany over the last week, they've seen a rise in the transmission rate of coronavirus.
""We're in a delicate and dangerous moment. We're coming through the peak, but we're not there yet.""
Britain shut non-essential shops and services, and ordered people to stay at home except to shop for groceries and medicines, on March 27.
A review of the measures is expected on May 7, amid dire warnings about the economic impact and indications of frustration at the continued confinement.
Johnson held a lunchtime telephone call with the leader of the main opposition Labour party, Keir Starmer who has called for more clarity on the lockdown exit plan.
Starmer earlier joined well-wishers in congratulating Johnson on becoming a father again, particularly after his recent experience. Symonds also displayed COVID-19 symptoms but was not tested.

Look at their twitter account and review their tweets in January, if you don’t think that is downplaying then idk what to say. Let’s say you’re the representative of WHO that was looking into this, and multiple doctors are warning you about the virus spreading rampantly, are you going to go straight to the public and quickly downplay the situation? Or would you caution the world and the representatives of each nation? Like I said, think for yourself. I’m not suggesting that China was the corrupt one here, even though it’s obviously that they’ve lied about their numbers overall, they pretty much instantly notified WHO when this happened, unlike the sars outbreak where they delayed telling anyone. in my opinion I think in this situation was the WHO trying to downplay the situation to the world, I’m sure they didn’t think it would end up like this. But I’m just saying if your job is maintain world health and you waiting months before declaring a global emergency. Idk why I’m even having this convo with you. Trump is definitely incompetent as well, he shouldn’t be a president or any political figure. In this situation he tried to set up travel restrictions in January. But The Who advised [otherwise](https://mobile.twitter.com/drtedros/status/1223288481159503873?lang=en)  This is all documented just look it up. Idk why you see the need to look up to them.

"homuradidnothingwrong","t5_39dsj","I was focusing on the explanations that focus on how she is able to normalize and justify murdering so many innocents. Specifically highlighting that since concepts like utility isnt controlled by her actions so she actually justifiably can say it doesnt matter. This is more explaining the moral ambiguities they present even in her most detestable actions. 
Edit Cause this was in response to a person making arguments against her ignoring that her motivations reflect a common theme of making decisions based on what she would know based on the sheer fantastical elements of her world that make her understanding of it seperate from a normal person(for example she takes entropy argument far more seriously than a random tv viewer because she knows simulation hypothesis is true and it is directly related to the concept of entropy thus her actions are framed from that perspective not a nonmagical person)

And Divorce protections only really exist if you have the money to go to court over and over.

Otherwise the court says you get money but your ex decides not to pay and you either get a lawyer and spend another year trying to get what you're owed just to come out with your money going to the lawyer or you move on.

Divorce is a pain when your ex wants to make it one.

Edit 2: His speech is mostly word for word on the roadmap document, page 2.

Edit 3: Says the reopening of the state will be done in phases, with constant ongoing analysis to help prevent any spread.

Edit 4: The threat remains real. Just a month ago the models were predicting deaths in the tens of thousands and overloading of hospitals. The only reason Nevada's results have been lower is due to strong social distancing and stay at home measures. 
Still requiring a 14-day decrease in new cases. Seem to have reached the peak on April 24.

Edit 5: We now have the testing capacity to test all symptomatic individuals in the state and are building the supply to test asymptomatic individuals as well.

Edit 6: The live stream on both the [vimeo](https://livestream.com/ndemmedia/governorsisolak043020) and [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyY34J_tWM) platforms has stopped.

Edit 7: [This reporter is live in the room](https://twitter.com/MichelleRindels/status/1256013817521168385) and we can follow her tweets for anything we missed.

Edit 8: Feed is back on youtube. Bars, nightclubs, gaming and sporting events will remain closed. Gaming will not be opening at the start of phase 1, we will be in phase 1 for a minimum of 2-3 weeks which is the minimum to evaluate trends. Gaming reopening will be done through guidance of the gaming control board.

Edit 9: We are partnering with county officials at the local level to help best execute the reopening of local life. This is the locally executed portion of the reopening plan.

Edit 10: Forming a Local Empowerment Advisory Panel, or “LEAP"" for this reopening purpose. on the task force= JJ Goicoechea representing rurals, and reps from NACO, GOED, Department of B&amp;I.

Edit 11: The youtube link is frozen and the vimeo link has no audio...

Edit 12: You can check out the [live tweets from the Governors account](https://twitter.com/GovSisolak/status/1256016055752814594) for highlights. He also usually posts his entire speech on the nvhealthresponse.nv.gov website when he ends the press conference. Everything is still frozen/no audio for me so likely no more updates :/

Edit 12: Audio is back now on [Youtube only](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lyY34J_tWM). On questions from the press. First question I caught on not having enough contract tracers.

Edit 13: Governor answers that some businesses have offered their employees who are being paid but not working, such as call centers, to do contract tracing. This will help us move into phase 1.

Edit 14: Clarification on what businesses can open in phase 1, Gov clarifies that this will mostly be up to counties and things like the restaurant association and licensing boards to help determine what can open. Entities need to have plans in place for safety in the new normal.

Edit 15: Any updates on the moratorium on evictions? Gov - no changes to the eviction orders now. Not sure when it will come back, again likely up to counties.

Edit 16: There may be 3 phases or more depending on counties needs. First phase of reopening will hopefully be May 15 and gaming will not be opening in the first part of phase 1 (note that this leaves open the possibility for gaming to open toward the end of phase 1).

Edit 17: All counties must provide information needed to open phase 1, all or nothing. If one county doesn't provide information requested by the state then no counties can open.

Edit 18: Going outside for walks and rides is fine, just practice social distancing and stay out of groups of 10 or more. Next question, can hair stylists offer curbside services or in-home services? Gov answer, no in home services per their licenses. No idea how they would do curbside. It will be up to the cosmetology board to come up with a safe way to reopen. (Note - the Cosmetology Board [released this guidebook for reopening](https://sites.google.com/nvcosmo.com/nevada-board-of-cosmetology/home/board-of-cosmetologys-covid-19-information) on 4/29)

Edit 19: Governor is asked how many phases are in this plan. He says we are talking about phase 1, there will be a phase 2 but we won't know how many phases we are going to have.

Final edit: I think it's over? Hard to tell because the audio/video just cut out suddenly but twitter indicates it's done. Note of personal disclosure, I work with the cosmetology board sometimes.",1588291286

However, watching my family and friends who work at the hospital die from a distance, lose sleep, begging for mask and testing kits and supplies to save patients, going weeks without seeing their kids, I truly think if we wanted to thank our essential workers then we'd give them what they need instead of telling governor's they have to reopen and telling them to find resources themselves. Today they announced as a country, we have enough testing kits. No. We dont. Not even close. So while the flights are nice if it makes the pilots feel better, those essential workers they're thanking are still begging for supplies so they can save lives.

As it is measuring human behaviour, I was wondering if anyone has any thoughts or ideas of other ways of measuring. Or if anyone is willing to collaborate on something like this. I work for a lot of big clients so there is money to be made with the right model.

Edit: don’t kill yourself. Don’t put your boyfriend through that. Don’t let the people at your school think they had something to with it either. I’ve been there and thought about it-but I realized that my class mates, my professors, my parents, all of them would think that they could’ve done something to prevent it.

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Rube Goldberg Project Help

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

For one, they support people actually being able to fucking vote. 

Giving any grounds, in the mind of citizens or even in public discourse to a party that is anti democratic is dangerous and stupid. The entire party should be burned to the ground and the democrats should split into real conservatives like biden and real progressives like bernie. If the two party system is going to continue. Obviously ranked choice is much more reasonable and we should have plenty of parties but step 1 in the poor and middle class retaking this country is call out the faux conservatives in the GOP who really are grifters and traitors who look to enrich themselves under the guise of ""conservatism"". For fucks sake remember the emoluments clause? How many times does trump break that a WEEK? Any real ""constitutionalist"" would have wanted trump gone day one.

Thalison against tommy yip at 2018 worlds had a nice bolo entry from top from a smash pass which is pretty much the saddle

Eaton midland TX incident- april 30th I found out that they towed my dry van from a local yard.(why did they towed it is a different story). I called them and dispatcher treated me like shit. So rude so unprofessional and she hung up on me without answering my questions. I was like what's wrong with her. I thought she probably having a bad day or something. I went to their yard with my gf (because she is the owner) to get my trailer. Office lady talked to me rudely because apparently only trailer owner was allowed to be inside the office. I came outside and sat down in my truck. After 15ish mins my gf came out and she told me this-

Office lady told her that truck drivers are trash that's why she treats them like this. She told her that she could have hold my trailer as long as she wanted too. Truck drivers are piece of shit and that's why she talk so much shit to them. I went to their google page and I was surprised to see that there were atleast 3 more people who complained about dispatcher (possible owner's family) being rude to them. This place doesnt deserve our business. I request my fellow drivers to not to give your business to any place who cant respect us.

Edit 1. People who are thinking that I'm crying/whining because my van got towed. No I'm not. It was a legal towing. My company manager didnt know that it was my van so they called the towing company. Simple. No hard feeling for my company or towing company. But calling truckers a piece of shit. Seriously? Hanging phone calls on truckers. Seriously? Please check their google page reviews. Sort them out my lowest rating first. 3 people in last 3 months are complaining about the same dispacher/office lady. 3 people + me = 4 people cant be no fault. There must be more truckers who never left them bad reviews.

 Here is their google page - sort it out by lowest rating.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","In 2016, the Chapo hosts used the word ""retard"" every five seconds. Now they're Left MSNBC. They were a comedy show and they flew too close to the sun and decided to become real pundits. I knew once they spoke at the DSA convention that we were about to go to a fucked up place.  Bernie should have never granted them an interview. 

All of these podcast and blogger nerds spent 2 years flipping out on Twitter about how everyone who posts on stupidpol is a Nazi and incel and now that their woke bullshit tanked Bernie 2020, they're singing a different tune. The Left media bubble which gained steam in 2017 insulated us from reality as they pushed nonsense fringe social causes. These dorks played a part in destroying  everything Bernie 2016 built with their awful, ""celebrity"" driven horseshit.

It's easy to blame the DNC for being sneaky fucking cheats, and rightfully so, but Bernie had more money, more momentum, and more donors than anyone. Yet his campaign staffers listened to a bunch of Professional Left media assholes and paid a heavy price for it.

Even Briahna, who I kinda respect for not falling in line, spent more time arguing on Twitter with useless cable news gaywads and powowing with the David Klions and Nathan Robinsons of the world than actually putting a winning message together for the MASSES. Nobody cares about Current Affairs or Jacobin. Nobody cares about the stupid fucking DSA or their intelligentsia. 

If you keep treating these people as thoughtleaders of the Left, we'll never win a single election.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","If I were you I would get into Odyssey over Origins. Origins felt rushed and clunky and I could not really get through more than a few hours of the game before putting it down for good, whereas with Odyssey it overcame the enormous bias that Origins had placed upon it in my mind. Honestly, it feels like a complete game out of the box, while there is an in-game market for whales to drop money into I never felt the need to glance at it throughout my entire first playthrough, I'm now working on my second playthrough and boy did I miss alot in my first 60 hours of the game. 

As for the overarching story, I would definitely say you can jump into it just fine. The last AC game I was able to actually finish was Black Flag, and I believe there was 5 or 6 games in between the two.

I had a metal bucket I had always dumped my ashes into. I thought I had put all ash in there. Get up at 4 am on a Sunday after doing a full of concessions on Saturday noticed a smoldering smell in my garage. Couldn’t figure it out. Got the smoker rolling in the driveway (it was on a trailer) put meat on go, go back to bed. Get up at 7 and realize it was the bucket smoldering in the garage. Take it out front and put it on the edge of the sidewalk. Grab the garden hose and hose it down. Get in the shower get food prepped and rolled out for the day. 

Get home, noticed that half of the siding on the front of my house was melted when I got home. There was a note on my front door to call the local fire department. 

What had happened was, it was a very windy day that day, and even though I thought I had extinguished the ashes the wind kicked them up, they caught a wooden whiskey barrel in the front of my house on fire. Which in turn started to catch the house on fire. What saved me was being lazy and leaving the garden hose on and in the front yard. The guy who drove the local church bus was picking people up for church and saw it and ran up and put it all out and called the local fire department.",1588291292

This is a motivational music video I produced in October of 2018 as a channel intro - planned originally for this channel. As I didn't dare to start my YouTube journey back then, the channel along with this song was deleted.   


Ironically, the original name of this music video is ""The Journey"". However, I've decided to document this as a part of my YouTube legacy and I hope someone will enjoy the song/video as much as I do. Especially when I'm down.

edit: lots of downvotes, no responses. The fact is that at any time a general who can rally his troops behind him can march into DC, execute the president on the white house lawn, shell the capitol building, and go hang every supreme court justice from a lamppost and there is absolutely nothing that the constitution or voting or speech or the press could do about it. The state is founded on a monopoly on the legitimate use of violence, and the true power always lies with the agents of the state who are tasked with using that violence towards the goals of the state, i.e. the military and the police. If they are completely unchecked and uncountered, that is, no one else has sufficient direct capacity for violence to resist them, then ultimate power lies with them, and there is no real freedom. Freedom that can be taken away at any time with no capability to resist is not real freedom.",1588291293

Karthus is just damage, he's similar to Yi in the regard that he can ramp up quite well and take over a game, but his lack of outplay potential (basically zero) makes him extremely vulnerable in the current version of league of legends where every meta champion is just a mountain of outplay buttons throw together.

That said, I don't see a flaw in his champion design. The issue is that the only way for him to function within the current league environment is he just outdamages everything else consistently, because if he doesn't, he's useless.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Ahh it's a shonen and anything that's even a little bit hyped gets a fan base gunning for it that won't accept any criticism. I kinda expect it and you always see it happening. I guess the OST just comes down to personal taste. I just feel like a dubstep/electro pop kinda background is a bit cliche and typical. It doesn't have the eeriness and effect of something like HxH or the absolute badass you find in AOT. While comparing it to those two shows is definitely unfair, It just kinda feels like something you'd find in an opening to a COD youtube video... I think a different genre of music could have definitely done a better job as the music does a lot to support the setting of the story. There is a few individual parts of it I like, I just think the kinda track they went for has no build up, rise or drop, it just feels like a flat strand of audio. 

You are right with the animation just feeling off, but do you think it is the animation or the choreography that is the bigger problem here? I agree that animation is something a show like this needs to get down, but if there was just more experience in regards to the direction of the fights, I think they'd be a much better watch. A theory I have is that for some reason, the show either ran out of time or money. Like why is the OP so bad visually? (it's a minor critique but one I honestly can't get over, I love my OPs). Why does the animation feel like it was slowed down/not finished in places? Why are some areas quite good in terms of movement while others feel like there is no movement at all? It's honestly quite an odd one.",1588291296

I think most people have no idea that the mask is more to protect others than yourself.  So whenever they aren't actively with a customer they pull it down.  Then they are counting pills all day with nothing covering what they're potentially breathing out.  It's infuriating.

"Indiana","t5_2qn7d","I was in elementary school in the 80s.  We rode bikes all over the neighborhood.  Our parents didn't care where we were unless we didn't show up for dinner.  

We played make believe/pretend a lot.  We kept busy with whiffle ball, badminton &amp; other stuff that we could play in the yard.  We played dress up.  We made our own Halloween costumes out of our parents' clothes or our siblings' old band uniforms.

We listened to the radio because there wasn't much good on TV unless it was Saturday morning cartoons or the Cosby Show on Thursday nights.  We listened to the Weekly Top 40 Countdown with Kasey Kasem and booed when the songs we didn't like hit #1.  We learned all the words to our favorite songs and made tapes of ourselves singing.

We were just like kids now...whiny when we were bored or hungry.  Didn't like doing chores.  The big difference is that we didn't play games much because all we had was Uno, Monopoly or three Atari games.

We were dirty a lot from playing outside so a nightly bath was important.  We also played in the snow daily in the winter.  The 80's was a snowy decade compared to now.  Every house had bird feeders and a snow shovel.  We wore moon boots and colorful winter coats.  In the summer, we lived in our swimsuits and ran through the sprinkler in the yard unless a parent would give in to our begging and take us to the pool.

We read great books about Ramona and Fudge and Trixie Belden and Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys.  We had comic books and if you were lucky, a subscription to Tiger Beat magazine.

Best of all, the news was boring and for old people.  We didn't know all that was wrong in the world and we liked it that way.",1588291297

This is fairly standard dream stuff, but it felt SO real and felt like it lasted a whole day.

When I woke up I felt like I literally couldn't believe what had just happened. For the rest of that whole day it honestly almost felt like something real that I had just done the day before and I was recalling hours worth of memories/conversations/actions from the dream, which realistically probably didnt last very long since dreams don't.

If every encounter is a nail biting life or death experience that's tightly integrated into the plot, it can get a little draining.

"TheRightCantMeme","t5_3p1as","&gt; Nazbol is not an insult, it's just a political label.

It is an insult if you're calling someone who hates both parts of that word, that word lol.

We grew up skateboarding and listening to punk rock and going to gigs and fighting the nazi skins and all that. I don't like Nazis or the word 'boi'. 

&gt; I assume you are well-intentioned, but I don't see any arguments to back up the claim that racism nowadays is ""just a scam"". 

It's much harder for me to back up but i'll try to explain.

Academia and media are tools of the real 'ruling class' which just happens to be wealthy. Those are the two major ways people share information nowadays so they have the means &amp; method to control the public social narrative.

People see things in terms of left &amp; right because they've used their influence to shape a false dichotomy.

When it really comes down to it, it's not supposed to be about left or right specifically. It's more like working class versus the owner class, or rich vs poor, proletariat vs bourgeoisie, whatever you want to call it.

People think the establishment 'left' in the US is actually on their side is a mistake. The Democrats act friendly to minorities but they're full of shit. [Malcolm X called them out for that in the 60s](https://youtu.be/T3PaqxblOx0) and he was right.

If you go back and follow the history, the US kind of integrated but then introduced a form of ideologically driven cultural segregation where now you're using words like POC and following rules made up by junk scientists who push beliefs that don't actually help minorities.

The US establishment class doesn't want black people to be integrated and treated like everyone else because the system benefits from them being stuck in poverty conditions where they can be exploited politically, culturally, socially, economically, etc...

I'm in my 40s. The Democrats haven't don shit to help benefit black people except use them as a visual device to divide the bigger 'white' demographic by insisting that racists are rampant and they're all right wing. What they don't point out is how the establishment left is way worse.

Look at this sub for example. It's just a controlled left leaning hub to impose circle jerk group hate mentality towards these dumbasses who get sucked into controlled right wing media.

Reddit being owned by a giant media company, of course they push this crap. Reddit's primary demographic is like 18-35 college educated white people which is historically, an insanely powerful group if you guys were organized. This stuff is all designed to create divisions between young people and everyone else so that you guys don't do anything that upsets their apple cart.",1588291298

These are done by the national parties at the national conventions every four years, but also by the state parties at their conventions.

It was big news a year or two ago when the Texas Republican Party added marijuana decriminalization to their platform, but is still an instructive comparison to the Texas Democratic Party that has full legalization and expungement of all past marijuana convictions. Usually the platforms are full of lots of red meat for the base, rather than anything anyone will implement, but it still tells you what the activists who go to these conventions value.

Mixolydian b7
Aeolian b3 b6 b7
Locrian b2 b3 b5 b6 b7

Learn as them separate things/tonalities and forget about how “one is the whatever mode of the major scale if you start on the this note and blah blah blah!”That’s so confusing and, to me, never really reflected how you’d use it in real life music. Your example hit the nail on the head. What if I want to write a riff in Dorian? Cool your song will sound like it’s in Dorian, not major so in that circumstance who cares how it relates to major?

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","yes, the assumptions are slightly different (in that yearly independence is a stronger assumption than needed to work out the 25 year probability) but *it makes no difference to the numerical value of 25 year probability being asked about*, and that apparent numerical difference was all that I was asked to explain the difference in.

Both approaches must give the first 25 years and the second 25 having the same probability, and *THAT* guarantees p=0.5.

As I said above, if you do ice_wendell's calculation *exactly*, you do get exactly 0.5 and there is no discrepancy. Try it, it's like two lines of simple algebra.

Or if you prefer explicit numerical calculation just carried out to more figures, try this (which emulates ice_wendell's approach):

    &gt; q=1-(0.25)^(1/50)
    &gt; (1-q)^25
    [1] 0.5
    
The only reason /u/ice_wendell ddn't get 0.50000000 is because the one-year value got evaluated numerically and was rounded off to only a few figures, which then carried into the later calculation

To see that it really is just rounding, see what happens when you work out the 50-year probability using ice_wendell's 25-year probability. Do you get 0.75 as the problem specifies?",1588291298

Nope, I completely understand where people with mental health issues are coming from which is why I am able to point them out and call them out when they're unhinged and need help.

Also, that I actually have people I consider acquaintances (which sounds snooty) but it’s more of a casual friendship like with coworkers rather than the tight knit trust I have with people I’ve know forever.

This is kinda dumb and pointless. A waste of time and money, 

MyKad is just a piece of useless plastic if cops do not cross check the chip data with JPN/NRD database. No matter what security or encryption feature you implement, all it takes is a corrupt cop/officer and it is all defeated. Every MyKad syndicate busted has an insider working for JPN and every police roadblock there will be someone willing to take duit kopi. At the end of the day, it is a corruption issue.

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","&gt;. So what about a green fish that suddenly develops a mottled skin within a couple of generations when moved from a sandy environment to a pebbly one? (Such experiments have been done.) That can't be explained by survival of the fittest.

What? That's a paradigmatic case of natural selection. The skin colors which provide better camouflage extend lifespan due to avoiding predators, which means there is an extended period of time for those animals to reproduce, which means they have more surviving offspring. Thus, in a few generations, the allele frequency shifts in the population.

Unless you mean to suggest that these experiments have been done in controlled environments that have been engineered to lack selection pressures like predators. I've never heard of such an experiment. Can you cite this?

&gt;Accidental chemical reactions and random mutations created the world we see? That's absurd.

Here I'm not sure if you're still referring to evolution or if you're talking about abiogenesis. The latter isn't really something biologists have an established theory on. Given the existence of primitive life forms, accidental mutation and selection pressures creating the existing diversity isn't absurd at all. Consider that the mutation frequency in DNA replication is actually kind of high, and that this current biological diversity took more than **three billion** to appear. The oldest direct evidence of a living thing we can find on Earth are three billion, four hundred sixty five million years old. That's longer than I can fathom, genuinely. I cannot really think about timescales that long. What's absurd about mutations and selection pressures compounding to produce biodiversity over that enormous timescale?",1588291303

&gt;EDIT: Arguably one of the inspirations for Alien.
&gt;
&gt;EDIT 2: This is a really great sci-fi B movie I'd recommend to any one. Typically Planet of the vampires gets referenced as the inspiration for Alien but I feel it owes far more to IT! than that movie. The entire plot is the monster climbing up the ship trying to get the crew while the crew use increasingly desperate means to kill it ( including flame throwers, blowing it out of an air lock and a cool electrified floor sequence that mirrors much of the auto cannon sequence in Aliens )If you're interested in the history of Alien, I guarantee you'll have a blast watching IT.

i fucking love space and as a result have been following spacex religiously for years, but this shit is disheartening. he really is that fucking petulant and stupid when it comes to anything but himself.

i get it in a way, his entire life goal is to make humanity a multi-planet species, so he probably legitimately thinks it doesn't matter if a few people die, because he's trying to avoid existential risks to the entire species...but that isn't a very popular or productive mindset when individuals are suffering.

If she is a Valkyrie, how can she believe in a monotheistic religion, knowing other gods exist? It doesn’t make sense. You are kind of ridiculous saying a “whitewashed” story about Norse characters. I like diversity in stories if it makes sense. This made NO sense, and didn’t add depth to the character. Same with long explanations of gender fluidity. For people old enough to know what it is, it’s just an annoying disruption to the narrative. For ages 7-8, which is when I read the Percy Jackson books to my kids, it is sort of like, do I want to introduce them to Norse Mythology in a fun way, or do I want to give them a freshman seminar on gender?

We open the laptop and it looked dirty and worn. Sure enough it doesn’t turn on either. We do normal power diagnostics and end up opening the laptop casing to look inside.

I kid you not, there was a family of ants living in this guys laptop. It looked like he had left it outside in the dirt for a few days but had tried to clean the outer casing before giving us the laptop to make it look fine. Needless the say, it wasn’t fixed within an hour.",1588291306

Her foster mom did a DNA test on one of her siblings that was 1) Australian Shepherd, 2) AmStaff, 3) German Shepherd, 4) Chow chow 5) Boxer. Because she looks like such an outlier the foster mom said we might want to do our own DNA test because a) puppies are fraternal so her combination could be different and b) pups in the same litter can have different dads (I did not know this beforehand!).

That's obviously an exaggeration, but there is some truth to it. Regardless of whether CMC is a worse fit, however, I'd recommend you go to UT Austin because it sounds like you want to go to grad school too (in which case the prestige of your undergrad doesn't matter so much and you'll have to pay off big students loans for no reason).",1588291308

They do this because it allows them to pay themselves (and their wealthy contractor-relatives) whenever a donation is made. They get to gift most of the cash to themselves with your tithing money everytime a donation is made.

This unethical behavior is super hard to document but here is one article where a reporter actually gave an accurate breakdown of how little of a Mormon donation was actual cash compared to commodities, so bookmark it and save it for whenever you see Mormons bragging about their cult donating ""money.""

Well a few minutes later she came in, claiming (not terribly rudely at first) I was wrong and she knew she had a winner. I apologized again, and began to help the next customer. At that point, she got more angry, implying I was trying to keep her winnings. When I finished with the current customer, I picked up the paper-only trash bin, dumped it on the counter, found her ticket, and scanned it again, saying one more time ""it's not a winner, sorry, have a good day.""

Aside from downgrading a lot of the cool cut scenes and background stuff, everything else is smoother and the gameplay is better. The fact that you can still download Teambuilder teams and rosters is another huge bonus, especially since the community has done an *awesome* job at keeping up with current rosters and whatnot.

IF YOU MESSAGE MODERATORS ABOUT THIS YOU WILL BE PERMANENTLY BANNED. I can't be any more clear about that. There won't be any questions, no exceptions, or debate, or appeal.

As for the ""you did get lucky"", well, alright, good 23rd accross all cards for nearly 8000 bench is a level of luck I'll take. But then, I got lucky in all 5 other tests as well.

I was indeed asking in the title if it was a lottery win (hence the question mark) given how well it seemed to compare to other cards, despite being only on the air cooler. (I really am eager to see how it will fare with a waterblock) If it's not a silicon lottery winner, too bad.

Cognitive Behavior Therapy is what helped me most, the therapist did ask me if i would consider psychoactive drugs in addition to talk therapy, which i rejected, based on the long list of malign side-effects many drugs have, and he was totally fine with it and kept working with me without any issue.

That's why i always point out when people think of going to a psychiatrist for their problems, they should instead go to a psychotherapist first.

Finding great stuff is pretty hard, but doable (and worth it).

A great video will partly trick your brain.  It can give a sense that she's actually there, you can even sometimes feel her breath or hands.

But again, this applies to only the best stuff.  There's a ton of crap out there.

Someone else around here once described it this way, and I can reiterate: VR POV is hotter, I get harder, and I cum more.

Here’s what I anticipate happening. And pretty much what I predicted. By June people will be in open revolt and not listen to any ordinance. In fact with entire counties saying they won’t be enforcing anything, including anyone wearing masks, I may have been too conservative in estimating how long revolt will take.  Given today is the 2nd most deaths in a single day it seems that coronavirus is still spreading albeit at a slowish burn. Good! That was the design. 

People will eventually say fuck it and not listen to anything. Some will stay inside. Some will be out and ATTEMPT to socially distance. But the “fuck the gubamint” types will go back to living like nothing happened. They’ll go to Church and shake hands with everyone because “god will protect them”. 

And then we will end up busting out of the curve and more people will be sick. And we may end up needing those beds. So just leave the beds and the curtains and the equipment.

"UCSantaBarbara","t5_2shs9","I feel you. One of the hardest parts that we're having is the fact that every class, and especially every lab, is run by different professors with extremely different requirements and different willingness to fully transition to online methods. So it's extraordinarily difficult to coordinate them to make things run smoothly.

Especially with lab courses, they're required for many things, and getting them online with such short notice was a massive headache. Lots of things can be improved upon but it's hard to fix them to the level that's necessary at this point in the quarter.

My *assumption* on the P/NP debacle is for down-the-line med school/grad school apps. For things like med school (which is a large reason such a huge percentage of students take chemistry), they base large swaths of their decisions on chemistry course grades, where an A- vs an A can make all the difference. It's super hard to know how med schools and other similar places will view P/NP vs grades (even given the circumstances), so they may just be ""playing it safe"".

I'm not trying to defend the department or go against the department, I'm just saying what my assumptions on some of their reasonings are based on profs I've talked to and my experiences as a TA this quarter.

""And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.
The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.
Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes?
He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples?
Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.
We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.
The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.
Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.
Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?
He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?
And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.
And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.
And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.""- John chapter 9 verses 1 to 41.
Believe in Jesus Christ and you shall have everlasting life! Jesus loves you! Get a king james bible and believe. 
Read Matthew. 
Read 1 John chapter 4.

Cool mechanic, but throwing a blessing in the bag is basically like saying someone will possibly, randomly, at some point in the future through an unexpected courage for someone. There’s a good chance it won’t even help when it comes up.

Now there could be more effects that interact with it (we already see some) but I feel like you will have to lean hard into it for it to make any meaningful difference.

I have to assume that most of the curse effects will be dished out by the scenarios, which means cards that are reasonably useful in the new campaign, like that mystic spell, will just be absolutely worthless in ever prior campaign (and likely every future campaign unless they give us these tokens again in other boxes). Although there could be an ultimatum or something to use them in other campaigns (add a curse to the bag each time you succeed a test?)


There’s also an annoying anti-synergy with a lot of cards (especially mystic) from previous cycles. Hitting a bless/curse with premonition or other such cards will feel bad. Ok, you can do the math at +2 or -2 now but you still don’t know what the outcome will be.",1588291311

"Grimdank","t5_3ilna","I’m going to say Tyranids and to a lesser extent Orks are off the hook bc they are essentially animals following biological imperatives. 

As far as the beings that can comprehend morality, I’m going to say Tau are the least evil. Points off for imperialist expansionism and the caste system, but the Tau are the most cooperative, inclusionary faction. The average human probably enjoys a higher quality of life as an auxiliary rather than Imperial citizen.

Next up is Aeldari. Sure arrogant, supremacist xenophobic shit heads who truly fucked up in the past,but they’re nearly extinct so they get points for pathos. Also, they seem to take care of their own and live a high quality of life.

The Imperium is a horrible amalgam of the Spanish Inquisition and 20th century fascism. There are good individuals who live there, but the state itself is a nightmare. The average citizen has a terrible life, and in many cases don’t get a break after death. Even the “good” Chapters are complicit in the perpetuation of this state, and they all take kids, give them weird surgeries and turn them into child soldiers.

Chaos as a faction is cartoonishly evil. No way I can really defend daemons when it comes to morality, but maybe some individual heretics have redeeming qualities? I’ll admit I’m a little biased.

I’d put the Necrons on the same scale as Chaos, but I’m not aware of any sympathetic Necron characters. Wealthy gerontocracy that refuses to die and are willing to use scary ass terminators to take back the galaxy?

Most evil: Drukhari. A hedonistic culture based around torture and sadism. At this point need the suffering of others to survive, which potentially could make them sympathetic (We all got to eat)but they seem to delight in their situation.",1588291312

I liked buying a Luckin coffee. I liked going into their shops. I liked how the staff treated me. I liked the online experience. I liked the taste and obvious quality of the beans.

It's almost like Chinese businesses and their owners lack confidence in the product to see things through organically. Far too many resort to cheap tactics to make a quick buck for it to be a coincidence. As a small business owner in China, I've met clients whose first instinct is always to go down the devious route, rather than the route of best practice.

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","That's a great question! Yeah, I followed the council's shelter tour news closely, and I'm really glad they did that. It was quite interesting seeing Lisa Calderon totally overreact on FB to the existence of shelter chores, and kinda funny tbh (though Chris Conner and I had a good time clarifying things in that thread and I think we were pretty successful), but for the most part I think the councilmembers mostly drew very valid conclusions and got a decently solid idea of the realities.

My rebuttal is pretty simple -- for the hundreds of beds open, there are thousands of us outside, and those are just the ones that have been reasonably well-counted. Just because some resources go unused doesn't mean that there are enough for everyone *if* everyone were actually to attempt to use them at once. (Bear in mind that the shelter services are all downtown except for just a couple in nearby areas, but there's a substantial homeless population all over the whole metro area, not just in Denver proper where the relevant count numbers usually come from.) My criticism of the other commenter centers around their statement ""No excuses to sleep on the streets at this point"", which is a naively idealistic thing for them to believe. I get why they'd want to believe it -- it's comforting to pretend that there are enough resources to help anyone who has hard luck -- but it's not the reality.

Also, for those individuals who are seeking shelter services (which many of us have valid reasons not to -- see my other comments in this thread) it can be incredibly difficult to get involved with a shelter, due to things like long wait lists, prohibitively narrow periods each week to call or wait in line, schedules/curfews that don't line up with people's jobs (since many of us are employed), and other logistical issues. So by all means, I super duper agree that shelters could be better-utilized, and the problems prohibiting many people from using them are nuanced and multifaceted.

The fact remains, though, that hundreds of open beds will not get thousands of people off the streets. That was my main point of contention above.",1588291313

The first part of any addiction recovery group or program I know of is to admit your behavior is out of your control and ask for help. The act of physically speaking words is a powerful one. Occasionally I'll literally kneel, ask for help and express gratitude; even without believing that a ""God"" is listening to you, begging for improvement is a powerful place to begin.

The following part is to develop new, healthier routines in your daily life. Practically speaking, the sequence of events that causes you to compulsively watch porn from 9:00 pm to midnight every night probably starts around say 11:00am every day. The trick is to divert the train before it passes the point of no return, which is probably around say 2:00 pm every day.

You have a mouse a shared room and shared ventilation, do you honestly believe a mask will protect you from Covid19 not really actually a mask will only make you touch your face to fix up all the mess there.
You could have eyeglasses, headphones, and now a mask that could potentially fog up your second pair of eyes, suffocate you while you are already anxious to perform, underperform and waste time !
Let’s do something about this.

We have very reasonable options out there ! But first potential problems.
1) we can wear a mask but given that only 3 people are allowed to leave the exam lobby at one time or use the rest rooms or be at the locker area to use (their own water) all of that wastes time and don’t begin saying it’s only a couple of seconds. Not even close ! 
Masks will be inspected, might be discarded and changed or adjusted before you allowed to enter the room, since it has to be removed for our stupid picture.
All of that is coming out of your own break time and step 2 for example isn’t forgiving at all.

2) Just how dumb is this. I can’t get some napkins into the exam room but I need to go in with a mask on.
As someone with allergies (and don’t tell me use claritine for some reason it drys me up and I’ll need my eyes wet) I might very much sneeze into the mask. And almost on a daily basis I have paroxysm if sneezes, while that’s more reason for me to use the mask it will literal screw me in the butt. I won’t be able to change the mask nor am I allowed to use napkins. Why make life difficult ?

3) Pinna necrosis, which I very much almost had because I use eyeglasses and the sound canceling headphones is such a ***** ! So now I have a mask on top of that how cute !
Just how uncomfortable do I have to be to make prometric happy ?

4) I need my eye glasses, can’t use contact lenses so I need my eye glasses crystal clear having a mask won’t help at all.

5) There was a study done that proved prolonged mask use results in a deteriorated performance, so brace yourself for a drop in your scores while you suffocate for 9 hrs straight !


—————-

Solutions
1) easy no masks and sign a document that clears prometric of responsibility (not smart I know)

2) provide us with an additional 3 mins per block in case one needs assistance to get napkins or change/adjust their masks. In addition provide us with an additional 5-10 mins on our total break time since we can’t leave the room at will as we are limited to have 3 individuals leave at a time.

3) let us have napkins into the room keep your distance and when we leave the lobby we can use the mask which can actually help then.


4) open to more suggestions.",1588291314

Yes, yes, and yes. DA2 is basically an extended prologue to DAI.

"scifi","t5_2qh2z","Farscape had an overarching story that went the whole series.  While many episodes were stand alone there was still a background story going on.

It also was wonderfully weird and funny at times and I sometimes describe it as Star Trek if the writers took acid.    

The first 2/3s of the first season can be a little rough as the show was still finding its footing and the writers and actors were still figuring out their characters.   One character just comes off as a poor Worf rip off but he will get much better.   The use of puppets for some characters can be a a little jarring at first but it wont take long before you forget they are puppets and will view them, especially a character named Rygel, as real.  You'll know you've reached the point where its gets consistently good when Scorpius arrives - he's a weird alien in black fetish type leather.   

It also felt like it had stakes because things carried over to the next episode where too often in Star Trek they do a complete reset each episode.

I assume you know this but they brought the two main characters from Farscape over to Stargate for Stargates last few seasons which is why I called it Starscape SG1.",1588291315

Get some ""shooters plugs"" which are the kind of ear plugs hunters use - they can cut up to 35db.

Or some noise cancelling headphones - or some headphones that block out enough outside sounds, and you can listen to music or tv loud enough to drown out this abysmal instrument, and not damage your hearing.

None of this has anything to do with perfect pitch.

"NFL_Draft","t5_2t21g","The thing that’s frustrating about the love pick is that he won’t play for at least 2 to 3 seasons due to Rodgers contract. Unless Rodgers is moved the packers are wasting a valuable rookie contract. 

The aj Dillion pick is frustrating because he is the 5th running back on the roster. Same with Josiah Deguara. He’s the 4th TE on the roster and will be used more like fullback than a true tight end. 

The players themselves are good players. The picks that they were taken at/ the positions are already having depth is what makes the packers draft poor. 

It’s clear the packers are building lafleur’s run first offense for the future. But the timing is wrong. If they did this a year or 2 from now it wouldn’t be so bad.",1588291318

"batman","t5_2qqt8","&gt;I think Batman makes new fans with every movie. And I think those fans decide that's the way it should be.

I definitely agree. I don't mean to say that you need to take in the entire history of a character in order to appreciate it. My comment was directed at people who claim that Batman doesn't have a no-killing rule because of x example from 80 years ago.

&gt;Other fans, I think what makes them fans something superficial.

Personally, I think that those fans do really enjoy Batfleck more than the pure visuals. They love the darkness and the grittiness because some people equate dark with mature and therefore good. And that can be a debate worth having, but it often becomes an argument that falls apart when critics point out the negative aspects of Snyder's films, whether it be MoS, BvS, or Watchmen, and these fans often default to praising the visuals because the visuals are one of the aspects of those movies that are near universally accepted as good.

Saying Batfleck is the best Batman is a very controversial opinion. Saying Batfleck is visually the best looking Batman is not. And I agree—Affleck and Cavill look great as Batman and Superman, so it makes me that more disappointed they didn't have a good script to match.",1588291318

He could lack confidence in cooking - making a whole meal can feel really daunting if you've never really done it or if you've been berated by others (e.g. parents) for trying. Maybe come to an agreement where he helps in the kitchen - get him to chop the veggies, give input into what herbs and spices you should use, get him to look up recipes he wants to try, talk him through simple cooking tasks.

Personally I don't like the mara/sent play style as much. They have a secondary resource to manage, and it's not overly complex but it's just something else to deal with. Visually the class is fun, though. - by Cosmic_Quasar

I personally like the marauder more. The Juggernaut is fun but I just feel his attacks are too slow and sluggish looking where the marauder looks like you’re just shredding through enemies. - by JMaC_8

I think if you’re just going through solo play, the Jugg’s single lightsaber is used more in the cutscenes, as is their double handed hold on the weapon. Plus, you’ll literally never die as a tank, so you’ll be able to just enjoy the gameplay zero stress. 

Marauder definitely has the flashier moves though, and some of the attacks are probably more fun- but personally I go Jugg almost every time. - by evilrobotlizard

You can buy them on the galactic market, cartel market or rank up your artifice to make them yourself. I usually just buy the crystal on cartel market since you can reuse them infinitely. (Sorry I put it in the wrong spot and didn’t reply by accident lol) - by JMaC_8

In a speedrun where we're mid-level by end game the class really illustrates its full potential. 

Funnily enough most classes end up being 'good' or 'bad' based on one or two key psynergies to the class. Take Ninja, most of the Ninja psynergy set is basically useless, but Shuriken, Death Plunge and Annihilation basically are all you ever need and are all amazing abilities. Same deal with Samurai and Quick Strike, or Mariner and Diamond Dust/Berg, or even the Swordsman class (Venus djinn on Merc adept) which has the earliest possible access to Wish Well (but is otherwise irrelevant).

First they definitely could've met up sooner. There's no real reason they couldn't have. Zach could've found Zorian pretty much whenever and helped him out. I don't think they would've developed quite the same relationship if they did meet up earlier so it's not necessarily a mistake in the long run but it's certainly worth discussing.

Zorian didn't want to take risks when experimenting with dangerous magics that could potentially screw him over permanently. When he left the timeloop he nearly killed himself because of his blood magic. If he screwed up a mental enhancement his simulacrum could turn hostile or he could put himself into a coma or worse. I can't fault Zorian for waiting to get seriously invested in it. If he didn't need it (and he wasn't sure if he would) it probably wouldn't be worth the risk.

We had it explained that compulsions aren't good for making people do research for you. Plus the massive moral implications.

Most of your other points are more down to morals and what is and isn't okay to do. Z&amp;Z were only ever okay with killing enemies and even then not on a whim. I think they were toeing the line pretty closely with regards to ethics of magic as is.

I'm not sure that not doing mass human experimentation for the greater good should really be thought of as a mistake. It's pretty much on the same level of immorality as ripping peoples souls apart to get knowledge.",1588291323

"EDC","t5_2reni","sometimes I feel that I might be printing a little bit. according to my wife, it's because I'm looking specifically for it, etc. I do not yet have a true EDC belt that is purposed for supporting the weight of a gun, and I suspect that would help the claw on my holster do what it's supposed to. 

I'm about 5'10"" and 170 lbs, and can get away with wearing medium shirts while concealing. large shirts are an easy concealment. I've read many, many testaments from folks bigger and smaller than me who say they can carry a 19 comfortably AND well concealed without sacrificing too much in their wardrobe. I believe you could find what works for you! 

keep in mind, there are other positions to carry the handgun, as well as different style holsters that best accommodate those various positions. as well as adjustable cant and ride height. all of these would make it easy to find your groove!",1588291323

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Another criticism I have of Tennant's arc is the character development as the start of his era. 10 is introduced in 'The Christmas Invasion' with the usual post-regeneration amnesia etc, but his character is very quickly established from the following episode.

In contrast, 9 is still finding himself towards the start of series 1, as is 13 in series 11, 11 in series 5, and to a much greater extent, 12 during the entirety of series 8.

Other than the 'time lord victorious' arc towards the end of Tennant's run, I do not feel that 10 had the same level of character shifts and developments as other Doctors have had. I would even argue that 9 had a greater character development in a single series than 10 did in 3.5 series.",1588291324

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt;On the wet market theory: bats were not even sold in that town. They are not native to Wuhan. They are native to south East China which is 600 miles away.

There are bats and bat coronaviruses found all over China including Wuhan (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6466186/ see figure 1). They are not found only in Yunnan, the place you are referring to. The bat coronavirus discovered from Yunnan (RaTG13) is not as close to COVID as you think (only approximately 96% similarity, indicating that the closest related coronavirus has not yet been identified yet).

There are millions of people every year getting infected with all kinds of bat coronaviruses. 
&gt;“If you do the math on this, it’s very straightforward. ... We have hundreds of millions of bats in Southeast Asia and about 10 percent of bats in some colonies have viruses at any one time. So that’s hundreds of thousands of bats every night with viruses,” Daszak says. “We also find tens of thousands of people in the wildlife trade, hunting and killing wildlife in China and Southeast Asia, and millions of people living in rural populations in Southeast Asia near bat caves.”

&gt;Next, he says, consider the data he’s collected on people near bat caves getting exposed to viruses: “We went out and surveyed a population in Yunnan, China — we’d been to bat caves and found viruses that we thought could be high risk. So we sample people nearby, and 3 percent had antibodies to those viruses,” he says. “So between the last two and three years, those people were exposed to bat coronaviruses. If you extrapolate that population across the whole of Southeast Asia, it’s 1 million to 7 million people a year getting infected by bat viruses.”

&gt;Compare that, he says, to what we know about the labs: “If you look at the labs in Southeast Asia that have any coronaviruses in culture, there are probably two or three and they’re in high security. The Wuhan Institute of Virology does have a small number of bat coronaviruses in culture. But they’re not [the new coronavirus], SARS-CoV-2. There are probably half a dozen people that do work in those labs. So let’s compare 1 million to 7 million people a year to half a dozen people; it’s just not logical.”

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","I get what you're saying very well, I used to love playing killer but after playing red ranks a lot, i have slight anxiety when i que up killer. Now im not a bad killer, like to think im pretty good,  but i stress if its gonna be a chill game, a challenging game, or a toxic game. What annoys me the most is when im taking it chill as killer to only then get toxic endgame/post chat bulling me. I dont care but  come on, its so sad that these survivors use their power role as if they are gods.

Its a game and ideally should be enjoyed by both sides, which is what i aim for. i dont tunnel or face camp when i should to get kills because i want to play a balanced game, the way its meant to be played. Ideally i want two good kills after a long good match, dont need the 4k.  i can lose and still have a good time but toxic survivors kill my killers enjoyment. And then when i slug and outplay them seriously, its nice camp, slug op killer.

I recently depipd (into green ranks) to get back into killer and earn bp, get my bbq and then just keep em injured and mind game em.Its been much more fun and lax, but even then. toxic players at rank 1 swf will join to bully a green rank. theyre not even always good, make excuses when they lose etc, but i see why killers stop playing.

I think if the devs made the Killer the power role and actually made it difficult for the better survivors to escape, there would be less toxicity mainly because they wouldnt be able to  be so easy breasy by compare-sin. though then survivor mains would keep complaining instead of getting good. 

Needs a lot of work but not happening quick enough imo, good luck.",1588291325

Very good graphics, story line is incredible especially as you progress through the expansion packs, there’s always something to do. 
Pros: great story, fun graphics, great character customization, very helpful community. 
Cons: ontop of purchasing the expansion packs, there’s a monthly subscription. The monthly sub does give you rewards, but it’s up to you. 

I’m also very dedicated to guild wars 2. The graphics, astonishing. Expansion packs are amazing in regards to story and maps, absolutely beautiful. Almost everything is voice acted, it’s hard to disappoint. One of the best mount systems I’ve ever experienced as well. 
Pros: base game is free, one time buy expansion packs (2 for 1 deal now), currency exchange from gold to gems to buy gem store items, very helpful community, enjoyable content
Cons: Doesn’t have a typical questing system you’re used to, has living world stories which aren’t bad at all.

"nvcc","t5_2spbf","Its important to now that the guaranteed admissions expires, I believe it is after a year. You can still get into schools though.

Also, I recently learned that during financial crisis's, the general public's interest in education goes up.  It might be more difficult to get into schools soonish. You should be fine.

If your not 100% positive about business, and later change your mind, you'll create quite a dilemma. All majors have open electives, so some of your credits might be able to be applied there. You'll have to take lower level classes and might have to retake some for your new major. 

There's also another issue. All degrees requirement a certain amount of upper level classes. So if you change your mind, you might have to extra classes, and financial aid may not pay for it. Some people will advise you to take extra classes to figure out what you want to do, seems like a good idea, but really it isn't.

All of this is very individualized so its hard for me to tell you. What school you choice, what degree you end up with, what classes you have, if you have change your mind before, what classes you'll take before you change, all make drastic differences. 

If your business and you decide you really wanted to do bio engineering they'll be issues you'll have to overcome. If your business and choice accounting, then you should be fine.

Another thing is that the regular associates are pretty generalized. There is not a whole lot of differences between different A.S's and like wise with A.A's. But the math you took could potentially be an issue if you changed your mind.   

Also, upperlevel credits don't transfer well sometimes, depending on the school. Mason is notorious classes transferring poorly. 

Thats just some stuff to keep in mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Now is it normal not know what you want to do? I don't think anybody really knows. I just kinda made it up as I went along, which has presented real complications. 

What should you do? I would talk to your advisor, and your parents. Start conversations with people about what they studied and why they choice it. Research different career paths, as well as degree requirements. Going through a academic catalog but help as well.",1588291326

Do you think they're stupid because they only know a little so far?  Or do you appreciate that they're trying, and want to encourage them. 

For me, it's the latter, and that's likely how her parents feel about you. 

Ok maybe just think about one more thing in addition to the above - you have no idea what they are saying about you. Ok, you already know that.  

But the only reason it bothers you at all is because you are telling yourself a story about what they're saying. 

And that's normal, our brain fills in gaps to make stories make sense. Like the frog DNA in Jurassic Park (I don't know why I said that, I just had to).

"NavyNukes","t5_2xbbp","In 2011-2012, the section next to us in power school got put on ordered “fuck you”. They mustered at 0430 at the checkpoint for PT and marched up the spine to wherever the PT was conducted. Then they marched back and were given until 0600 to shower and meet back at the checkpoint. They had to march with a cadence to the “refueling complex” for breakfast until 0645. They got back in formation outside and had to march up to the Rickover. After class they mustered on the circle and marched all the way down the spine back to the checkpoint. They were given an hour for dinner, then had to remuster and march up the spine to the Rickover for study hours. Even the people on volls were required to stay at least two hours for study hours. They also had to muster on the weekend twice a day at the circle.

I think they ended up doing it twice while I was there...one of them involved a box of truth which was found by a Senior Chief, and the other involved the sandwich game and a poorly executed elbow drop from the stage onto someone’s subway in front of the department master chief.

My section in A school basically got ordered quiet the entire time we were there because of a douchebag Chief with a little guy complex (coughJingstcough). Our section in power school only got it once or twice just because our studying got loud...I do remember them doing a class wide thing once or twice too where they designated a group study room.

Your mind doesn’t understand that these experiences don’t matter—it is latching onto the games like a life preserver; wondering what it would do without them. So SHOW IT what it would do without them.

For us, this is the best long term strategy based on our culture. 

Our government doesn't enforce quarantine by law. They reccomend it. Meaning. ""We won't force you. But you really really should"". And an overwhealming majority of our population follow their advice. You got as much as a runny nose? Go home and stay home. Call in sick. 

Also. daily deaths have been decreasing since April 24:th. 11% of Stockholm got antibodies for the virus and herd immunity in Stockholm is projected for the month of May. (Stockholm is by far the region most impacted by the virus)

Yes. First off, they just built a new grade school in Fargo, and Fargo will need a new middle and high school.    I dont think you realize how fast Fargo is growing. 

The Bison Meadows subdivision will have over 300 new homes alone in the next 2-3 years.

[You haven't been following the news it seems.](https://www.inforum.com/news/education/5037963-Fargo-school-board-to-vote-on-new-middle-school-Tuesday)

&gt; Furthermore, you can only demand so much before homeowners say no. 

Again, you dont realize how fast the south side of town is growing.  Either pay for new schools or pack the kids 40-50 per classroom.   Also, homeowners dont have a say. The city said years ago that FPS doesnt need to have a public vote if they need a new school or other things.  If the school district thinks it needs it, they get it. 

&gt; Maybe, since we've proven that online teaching works, 

LMAO.  My wife is a teacher.  Online classes are poorly attended, kids are less likely to turn in work and parents often are upset because their kids grades are dropping but don't do anything to keep the kids on task and attending class.

It is often Watered down and basic, shallow work the kids are asked to do. Cant go deep into subjects, no projects no cooperative leaning.

Online teaching is a bandaid.  It might work for some adults who actually want to attend online college classes, but for children...yeah, no it isn't successful by any stretch.

&gt; Teachers are always begging for more money.

Well, they certainly deserve it.  They babysit and teach your children during the day and spend their own money buying supplies and ND is not the greatest for teacher pay.


&gt; Do you think a better building makes teachers better?

Yes because it reduces class sizes, meaning teachers can focus on teaching and making sure no one is left behind.",1588291330

1. Any electrical or mechanical device that is designed or adapted to operate the trigger mechanism of a semi-automatic firearm for the purpose of causing the firearm to discharge cartridges in rapid succession.

2. Any rifle, shotgun or carbine stock of the typeknown as the “bull-pup” design, being a stock that, when combined with a firearm, reduces the overall length of the firearm such that a substantial part of the reloading action or the magazine-well is located behind the trigger of the firearm when it is held in the normal firing position.

"rust","t5_2s7lj","You may be expecting that `str` is basically just a `[char]`, an array of `char`, but that is not the case. It is actually just a `[u8]` that is UTF-8 encoded, where each character is encoded with 1-4 bytes. If your string contains pure ASCII, then it will still only be 1 byte per character. But because each character has variable length, you can't just think of a `str` as ""an array of `char`"".

`char` is just a type that can represent any Unicode character, so it needs to be 4 bytes large, but it's not directly tied to the representation of characters in a `str`.

On the note of wasted space, it's not uncommon to use more than one byte per character. Windows programs, for instance, will commonly use UTF-16 encoded strings, using (at least) two bytes per character. I believe Rust's `OsStr` on Windows will do the same, as that's using the OS's native string representation.",1588291333

Today she would come back to the mat and sit for me and would wait. But once I started putting in the downs again, she’s get up and walk away. I’ll look at the other two protocols you mentioned and see if we can take a break from all the downs, because, I guess they’ve got her down! 😅",1588291333

"TheLastOfUs2","t5_2xgtw","One critique I offer is a scene from the hour and half long leaked gameplay video. There’s a camera shot in the Seattle compound that shows Abby’s “home base” and it appears to be an athletic facility or some kind of fitness center. She walks by a massive gym with a dozen lifting machines and what not. So while it would be hard to maintain that physique, she does happen to have all the time in the world. She also is hell bent on revenge which is as good of motivation as anything. 

One thing the devs have said from day one is how everything needs to be rooted in reality, for example, they offer explanations as to how the infected evolve. There is a reason for everything being the way that it is, so I think it’s fair to assume that at some point they will show how Abby got so jacked. I also don’t think it’s fair to say that just because it’s uncommon and hard to achieve, that women can’t reach that level of physique naturally. 

I can respect your hesitation to wanting to play as Abby tho. It’s going to be hard to play as her after she kills Joel, but we also know next to nothing about her as a character. I think it would be best to have an open mind while entering that portion of the game, she could turn out to be an awesome character.

My guess is it'll go a lot better for you if you do get ""exposed"" than if you don't. And that your life will be better if you're just open about it. Fuck it. You have herpes.

"LowLibidoCommunity","t5_33b1b","The compromise should never be to have sex that isn’t mutually wanted. The compromise should come in behaviors and actions outside of the bedroom that can increase the desire for sex to happen.  

I don’t think it’s fair for me to make my HL partner totally suppress their libido and live an essentially celibate life if there are things that they can do and that I can do that will make sex more pleasurable for me, and thus help me desire sex more frequently than I would have otherwise. I also wouldn’t think it’s fair for my partner to just expect me to have sex every time that they want it, regardless of my feelings. 

To me, choosing to be with a partner means trying to take care of each other the best way possible without hurting yourself in the process. I don’t want to emotionally and physically neglect my partner by forcing him into a celibate lifestyle, just like I don’t want to be emotionally and physically neglected by being guilted into having sex every day, multiple times a day. If I can better meet his needs in a way that doesn’t harm me and even makes things better for me, I want to do that. 

I am not at all saying to compromise by having unwanted sex. Been there, done that. It sucks. 100% do not recommend at all.",1588291335

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt; But are you a better musician because of it?

Yes, the emotional connection actually makes it easier for me to hit the right notes and keep the right rhythm. Like most things, it’s most apparent when it’s absent, and when my emotions aren’t conducive for the task I make more mistakes and have trouble keeping time. For drummers it’s called “getting into the pocket”, where your autonomous nervous system kicks in and your technique and rhythm tightens up. It’s a function of muscle memory that’s activated by tapping into the mindset.

&gt; Its the same with Cam if he changed the play to get that TD it's not because Matthew's ""fueled his emotions"" its because he tipped that they were waiting for a certain play OR he didnt change the play at all and knew the one they had called would work if the defense waited for the one mathews referred to.

If you’re thinking of this as sort of “enraged” state in an RPG, that’s not what this is, he wasn’t “set off” by anything Matthews said. The significance of that example isn’t that he made a particularly difficult play, it’s speaking to the mindset Cam was in at the time. He found his rhythm and he was feeling cocky and willing to jaw with a defender on field. He’s in his element. It’s why his play suffers when he gets knocked out of his element. He’s not Tom Brady who comes back like the fucking terminator, Cam’s play is affected by his emotional state. 

In this case, looking at Cam’s history, he tends to bounce back strong from adversity. My two best examples for this are the @NE game in 2017 and the @NO game in the 2017 WC. Both times he was coming off a poor showing, there were reports of him staying at the facility super later and both games he came out and played some of the best football of his career.",1588291336

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","This wasn’t necessarily to fund a start up, but more for some quick cash. Kind of illegal I think, but potentially saved lives. So no remorse.

I went to local mechanic shops, body shops, and tire shops (anyone that sells and installs tires) and told them I will bring in a lot of customers to their store and asked for a percentage of sales. Some agreed, mostly mom/pop ones agreed. They also had to put a sign out and offer free air and tire inspection. Which I provided them with signs. All sales that pull in asking for this service, I will receive a commission if it resulted into a sale of any kind.

The idea is someone will be pulling in to get their tires checked. And almost everyone has something wrong with their tires, many people dont pay attention to air pressure, or the steel belts showing from the i side part of the tire due to alignment, etc. The tire shop will lift the car and inspect the tires and fill air if thats all thats needed.

Anyways, how I got cars to pull in to the shops. In early mornings (4-5 am) when no one was around and everyone asleep; I used to strategically put clear packaging tape on the roads near these shops. When the cars passed over it, it sounded like a flat tire or something wrong with it. They would pull into the shop and their salesmen will notice all types of stuff; unbalanced wheels, needing tire rotation, alignment issues, nail in tire, worn out tire, damaged rims, etc.

Did pretty good. Then I grew up and had better things to do.",1588291337

"Fencesitter","t5_38fvu","Think the real question is do you want to be a parent or not. There are so many reasons to have kids and many reasons to chose to be CF. Either lifestyle can be fulfilling. 

Truthfully there are alot worse things for the planet then having a child. 

Seems like you initially wanted to be a parent by actively choosing to stop birth control. Perhaps your 'what happens attitude' is based on not getting your hopes up/ too fearful to make a decision. There is no such thing as a wrong decision in this scenario, the answer is what will be best for you life now and in the future.

If you're unsure it is probably best to resume some form of birth control until you know what you want. Be in charge.

It's understandable to be frustrated when it appears another couple conceived in a shorter time frame. Eff social media and don't mind other peoples situation. Focus more on your own life and needs.

It seems from your post theres lots of things running through your mind. Give yourself time to think things through and you'll ultimately feel so free and empowered just by making a decision.",1588291338

My eStep dad gets more upset about that, but I think my nmom is fine with it because it keeps up the illusion that I'm so dependent on her and can't even get a gift without her help.

He was arrested, but later released—probably because his mom, a famous actress, gave the hotel worker’s lawyer a blank check. 

He was released without charge and all is right with the world. He—like the story—disappeared. There is a story here; at least, the story that a rich mom means you don’t have to abide by the rules the rest of us have to.

Morrison and Berejiklian and well known incompetents after their failures during the bushfires. It's not a surprise their people ignore their pleas.

Meanwhile, Marshall and Spurrier just calmly and effectively kept control and because they have credibility as a result of their sane previous behaviour, we listened and it worked.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A proposta de divisão dos recursos federais para socorrer estados e municípios feita pelo presidente do Senado, Davi Alcolumbre (DEM-AP), desagradou a governadores do Sudeste e do Nordeste -- uma rara convergência quando se trata de repartição de verbas da União.

 O secretário de Fazenda de São Paulo, Henrique Meirelles, afirma que o critério de divisão proposto faz com que o estado receba bem menos do que prevê perder na crise do coronavírus.

 Em seus cálculos, São Paulo deve perder R$ 12 bilhões e, caso seja aprovado o texto do Senado, receberá R$ 7,5 bilhões.

 ""A proposta é altamente prejudicial a São Paulo e enviesada para o Nordeste"", disse Meirelles.

 Além disso, diz, direciona uma parte desproporcional da verba aos municípios.

  Tampouco os vizinhos aprovaram a ideia de Alcolumbre, que mesclou diferentes critérios, como população, perda de arrecadação prevista e fatia no fundo de participação dos estados, para chegar a um valor para cada ente.

 ""Somos gratos pela evolução dos valores, conquistada pelo Davi. A proposta do governo começou com R$ 30 bi e chegou a R$ 60 bi. Mas o critério é sem lógica. Tem estado que vai receber mais do que toda a receita de um ano"", afirmou o governador do Piauí, Wellington Dias (PT).

 Os governadores do Nordeste decidiram, em consenso, apoiar o retorno do critério de divisão aprovado na Câmara, que é o da perda de arrecadação em relação aos números registrados em 2019, aceitando um valor fixo de compensação como deseja o Ministério da Economia, além de uma contrapartida.

 ""É uma proposta que não altera o que o governo quer, não altera o que Davi construiu e mantém um critério de divisão que já foi alvo de acordo de todos os governadores e prefeitos durante a tramitação na Câmara"", afirma Dias.",1588291341

Have you tried Kratom before?  I have been using that in small doses pretty much every day for awhile now.  I think it’s awesome!

Meteor and BP as DPS Snipers. Simple but effective, not to mention I like Meteor's personality the most after Exia's.

Gitano and Catapult for AOE. Don't have better alternatives.

Silence, Perfumer, Gavial, Mhyr, Warfarin, Ptilopsis, Hibi, Ansel, Lanset-2, if it heals, I will put them on the map.

Besides Saria, Cuora and Gummy look after the front line. Not to mention they are adorable.

Sige, Texas, Zima and, as of late, Myrtle, take care of punching stuff. The last one specially, so freaking OP without having to punch anyone.

so my ignorant, non-halachic, non-academic interpretation is that the ark was indeed lost in battle to the philistines - but never really made it back on a driverless cart - that second part is made up. it may also be the reason nobody was allowed to see it in the holy of holies inside the temple apart from the cohen rashi - it wasn't there...

Israel isn't ""the Jews"". Israel is a country, and both us and them should stay the heck out of the other's politics. Especially because those actions harmed the Jews in America, there's a reason we voted so strongly against the guy. Does Bibi think their blood is redder than ours? 

The two state solution isn't anti Israel and if that's the ludicrous position you are taking then I'm done here. If that's the case then 99% of the world and most Jews are anti Israel and that's just utter nonsense.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O ministro da Saúde, Nelson Teich, disse nesta quinta-feira (30) que uma flexibilização do distanciamento social não deve ocorrer enquanto [casos do novo coronavírus estiverem em “franca ascensão”.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/brasil-ultrapassa-a-china-em-numero-de-casos-de-coronavirus-e-e-o-10o-no-ranking-mundial.shtml)

 A flexibilização do distanciamento social é defendida enfaticamente pelo presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido).

 O assunto foi [um dos pontos de tensão entre o presidente e o ex-ministro da Saúde Henrique Mandetta](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/bolsonaro-busca-nova-politica-contra-coronavirus-com-demissao-de-mandetta-e-entrada-de-teich.shtml) e é constantemente usado pelo chefe do Executivo para criticar prefeitos e governadores.

 “A gente tem uma diretriz, a gente tem um ponto de partida, mas algumas coisas são básicas: não dá para você começar uma liberação quando você tem uma curva em franca ascendência”, disse.

 “Neste momento, a gente tem uma definição clara: o distanciamento permanece como a orientação”, completou.

 Ele voltou a frisar, no entanto, a intenção da pasta em fazer uma diretriz que deve recomendar parâmetros de análise a estados e municípios para o distanciamento social.

  A decisão por fazer mudanças, no entanto, deve ficar a cargo de estados e municípios, afirma.

 ""Estamos trabalhando a parte de teste, melhorando a infraestrutura, acompanhando a evolução dos casos, tentando buscar um ponto de inflexão da curva. O dia em que todos esses critérios estiverem preenchidos, a gente vai estar dando dentro da diretriz um ok para que se possa fazer uma tentativa de flexibilizar"", disse. ""Mas, neste momento, ninguém está pensando em flexibilizar nada.”

 O ministro reclamou ainda do que chamou de “polarização” sobre o tema. “Vejo isso muito mais como uma discussão política do que como uma discussão social. Se a gente não parar para olhar o que está acontecendo para tentar entender o que isso representa para a sociedade, e ficar polarizando para dizer se é bom ou ruim, isso não vai levar a nada.”

 Em seguida, fez um apelo à imprensa para que o tema “seja tratado de forma equilibrada” e não tratar “como uma forma de questionar quem está fazendo as coisas”

 “A gente conta, inclusive, muito com a parte dos repórteres para que isso seja tratado de uma forma equilibrada, de uma forma serena, e não usar isso para criticar pessoas e criticar posições.”

 Questionado sobre a ocorrência de aumento de casos em regiões que flexibilizaram o distanciamento social, Teich disse ser difícil dizer “se isso é uma relação de causa e efeito”.

 “Isso é uma coisa que é um trabalho de um país inteiro. Tudo o que está sendo feito, mesmo nestes lugares de hoje, que tentam flexibilizar, eles não estão fazendo isso de uma forma irresponsável. Eles fazem planejamento, veem o que está acontecendo e vão acompanhando”, disse.

 Segundo ele, a pasta deve usar exemplos de outros países, mas não deve haver uma “medida milagrosa”.

 “Você vê várias cidades, inclusive aquelas que nem estão ainda com a curva caindo, que já estão começando a ter algum tipo de flexibilização, você tem exemplos no mundo inteiro de iniciativas que estão acontecendo. A gente vai acompanhar isso, não é uma coisa nova, não é uma coisa Brasil”.

 “Quando a gente fala em ter uma diretriz, não quer dizer que amanhã você diga 'agora pode fazer o que quiser, deixa todo mundo ir para a rua'. Não é isso.”

 A respeito da diretriz, o Ministério da Saúde informou que o documento está pronto, porém, não será apresentado no momento, pois é necessário “cautela”.

 “A diretriz está pronta sim, mas ela tem que ser utilizada de uma forma correta”, disse Denizar Viana, ex-secretário de Ciência, Tecnologia e Insumos Estratégicos na gestão passada e que se tornou assessor de Teich. 

 “Nesse momento, onde temos os grandes centros urbanos brasileiros, ainda em uma fase de ascensão da curva, não é o momento adequado de se colocar isso. Se não vai criar uma expectativa na própria população”, completou. 

 Viana acrescentou que a nova diretriz trará parâmetros para que municípios e estados possam classificar o seu grau de risco, além de sugerir um tempo necessário para se avançar para uma nova etapa do processo de flexibilização. A estrutura de saúde das cidades principais de cada região é outro fator considerado na diretriz.

 “Isso é muito importante porque a decisão é multifatorial. Ela depende da capacidade instalada, por exemplo, de leitos de UTI, de recursos humanos, de como é que está a evolução da curva, se já é realmente uma tendência de queda do número de casos”, completou.",1588291346

 If problem is incelibacy (no sex) and these men have a system and practice with which to become more attractive to women in a direct manner, thus getting sex, I’m really struggling to see where the problem didn’t get solved.

They also end up only doing what works in the long run.  Yes, many bad ideas are passed around there, and a lot of the theories fail, but the core things (which are often what get them into hot water as well) are proven in the field again and again.  If these things you mentioned are distasteful, perhaps we should be questioning why women respond to them so well.  

It’s worth mentioning that TRP does not advocate your second point (women being slut shamed).  The red pill itself is mostly about embracing women’s sexual liberation instead of fighting against it.  That’s why committed relationships are discouraged (but certainly not forbidden), that’s why spinning plates is encouraged.  It is to closer reflect the habits of tendencies of modern women instead of fighting against them on antiquated principles. The traditional values of loyalty and slut shaming are gone and no longer apply to modern sexual strategy.",1588291347

Sure. Of course. Why would not it have mass?

Mind is a configuration of neurons in your brain. That configuration has a mass.

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","So I know this post is old, but I've been doing OCM for 8 years and thought I'd give my take. 

The CCMP from ACMP and Prosci certifications are industry standard. 

Go to LinkedIn Jobs and search ""CCMP"" and you'll get dozens of job postings. ""Prosci"" returns even more. 

The CCMP will set you back $600 for the test and anywhere from $500 (Acuity Institute) to $2k for the training hours. 

Prosci will run you like $4k. It's pricey. Generally it's an in person only training but they're piloting online programs right now. 

I agree the CAPM isn't terribly valued and it's worth the effort to just grab your PMP. There's several Udemy classes you can take to meet the education requirements (watch for sales!) Then it's a matter of your experience hours. They don't have to be as a project manager, as the other commenter said.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I get the injury hesitation, but 15 years ago, the Saints were the only team to give Brees a shot with the same injury Cam is coming off of. Cam has also had more time to heal than Brees did. 

Dalton's playoff records don't look great, but he also had a HC who is notorious for being one of the worst playoff coaches in NFL history. And the team looked and felt different leading up to the playoffs the year he was an MVP candidate until he broke his thumb. After that, the defense regressed hard, and he lost all the good offensive linemen he had. He still held a starting job 8x longer than Foles ever has, and Foles has tried his luck with 5 different teams (yes, I'm counting Philly twice). 

As for Rivers, yes, he is getting old and obviously not in his prime anymore, but Peyton won the SB when he could barely throw the ball 10 yards after they found his wife's HGH. His decision making paired with an elite defense allowed that to happen. I'd trust the 15 year starter over the 10 year backup if I was looking to get over the hump with a team who had all the other pieces. I think Indy agreed with that thought process too.",1588291348

1) As stated by others, you can do a TD Direct Investing account, but there will be fees, as well as transaction costs. Questrade/Wealthsimple/Interactive Brokers are other options typically recommended here and will likely have lower transaction costs.

2) The 80/20 split you've highlighted doesn't work in practicality. Before you come up with a split, you'll need to think about your goals - if you are looking at reliable returns within 2-3 years, then you should be looking at HISA or GICs. If you had them in typical investments/equities and we were in a bear market (like what is happening now because of COVID), you'd likely be forced to sell at a loss or wait until the market bounces back before you would want to make a purchase.

3) CanadianCouchPotato, Ben Felix's youtube videos/podcast - I personally started with a book called 'The Four Pillars of Investing', but would encourage you to read a multiple books to gain as many perspectives as you can. You will find that different investment strategies can all be successful, but you have to figure out what makes sense to you, and what strategy you can realistically stick with.

"nudism","t5_2qs47","&gt; Some people give answers based on what they think you want to hear or what they think is the right answer. 

There's no right answer when you're talking about behavior though. 

You're talking about a social desirability bias. And it's true if you ask someone ""Do you support nudism?"" they might say ""no"" because they think as a morally virtuous person they're supposed to say no even though they're secretly fine with it.

But if we're asking someone to participate then the yes or no is necessarily going to be what they'll actually do or not do. You're not going to say yes to do it if you actually don't want to, and a no is a no regardless of their reason for saying no.

&gt; I'd like to know if you've ever tried this. 

Well no, because it would be strange to invite someone to my house and *then* try to get naked with them. That would be misleading to have invited them there expecting one thing and then try to change it on them once they're there, and in either case I've never felt that such a one-on-one interaction is the best way to introduce someone to nudism, unless you're talking about a significant other. 

But I do invite people to go hang out at the local nude club all the time and many of them say yes. I also invite people to nude parties at my house and again many of them say yes. Plenty have said no too, but it's not like anything bad has come of it. It's just not something they were interested in partaking in.

Though I usually have a good sense of how interested someone will be, I've been surprised in both directions. Guessing would have served me much less well over the years.

&gt; There's also feeling people out and making conclusions based on what they've said or done in the past. There's reading body language. There's weighing all of these things and coming to conclusions.

That's literally what guessing is. Trying to base your guess on non-verbal cues and indirect communication doesn't make it any less a guess.",1588291350

I really struggle with kanji, i'm not even good at N5 kanji to be honest but except kanji I'm good at other stuff &amp; if i work hard enough i can do well in vocab, gram &amp; listening for N3 but kanji...



Also, considering that July's test will be postponed to around December of this year, i might or might not take it as I've a competitive exam around the same time in December. So would it be wise to self study N3 totally &amp; start studying for N3 then give it in July 2021?",1588291350

I could take anything, anything
Always stepped in time,
Regardless of the beat,
I moved my feet.
I carried weight,
When I could not do a thing,
And I'm done seeking treasure,
Just to wake up 
In an early grave~
So I stopped right then and said

""Go on alone,
'Cause I won't follow.
But this isn't giving up,
No, This Is Letting Go.
Out with the old, dreams I've borrowed.
The path I carve from here on out,
Will be my own.
The path will be my own~.""
...........
This is the part when the needle skips,
And the chorus plays,
Like a sink that drips,
A syllable repeating,
Like a warning we aren't heeding,
Until all of a sudden we noticed it,
When the wheels brake and the tires grip.
A map we've been misreading,
A defeat we're not conceding,
Until now~!
There must be some other way out!

""Go on alone,
'Cause I won't follow.
But this isn't giving up,
No, This Is Letting Go.
Out with the old, dreams I've borrowed.
The path I carve from here on out,

The path to take me home.

---

We've been getting a lot of complaints about horny-posting lately, so this month, we're trying something out.

We're placing a few extra formatting restrictions on lewd memes. Namely, they must contain ""[NSFW]"" in the title, and they must use Reddit's NSFW and spoiler tags.

Luckily for you, Reddit automatically tags things as NSFW when ""NSFW"" is in the title, and we've set up automod to automatically spoiler tag them as well. All you need to worry about is putting ""[NSFW]"" in your title if your post is lewd.

---

## Why are you doing this?

[Horny-posting has been a problem for a while](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/567917508573528092/705513686818750525/HornyPostingDoge.png), and is a common issue brought up both in modmail and meta threads. Posts are getting popular not because they're good memes, but because OP used some sexy artwork. These extra formatting restrictions should combat this issue in two ways:

1. Make it easier for those who don't want to see NSFW to avoid it.
2. Hide lewd, attention grabbing thumbnails that may be contributing to these posts blowing up.

## If people don't like NSFW, can't they just change their settings to hide it?

Doing so would hide it site wide. Many people want to see NSFW posts on Reddit, *but not on a sub for memes.*

## How can I tell actual spoilers apart from NSFW posts now?

Actual spoilers still need to follow our spoiler tagging rule, meaning they need to have ""[Name of Series]"" in the title. If you see an actual spoiler that only has ""[NSFW]"" in the title, please report it, and we will remove it.

## Is this permanent?

Currently, this is just for May. At the end of the month, we'll assess whether this was an improvement to the subreddit or not. The June meta thread will likely include a survey so you can share your thoughts as well.

---

"NJTech","t5_2s9ey","Cypress: (lived in freshman year)

\-Private bathroom shared between 4/5 people (2 rooms, suite style) 

\- More privacy. 2 doors between room and hall, thick walls so noise isn't much of an issue (pure brick)

\-One public bathroom (single toilet) per floor

\-rooms codes, no keys

\-vents have a lot of dust so watch out for that

Redwood:

\-1 male, 1 female bathroom per floor

\-Single door between hallway and room, walls are paper thin

\-room keys

\-is much newer cosmetically 

&amp;#x200B;

You have to decide whether you want the ""freshman experience"" of communal living. If you want more privacy in the bathroom and fine with cleaning the bathroom, go with Cypress. If you're comfortable walking down the hall to take a shower with others in the bathroom, live in Redwood. 

The social part depends mainly on your floor. People leave their doors open as they choose. There will be a group chat for the floor where people can ask to borrow things, tell people to turn down music, stuff like that. Basic floor rules will be laid out at the beginning of each semester in an open forum, town hall like meeting. RA's are required to host 2 events per month (ice cream, study habits, etc) and trust me, you'll know about them. I felt both Redwood and Cypress had the same amount of socializing going on but you have to put yourself out there. Cypress people can go to Redwood events and vice versa too.  

You'll be able to use an app called RoomSync to find a roommate if you choose. You put in some information about yourself (morning person/night person, bedtime, people in the room when i'm not there, room temp, etc) and you'll see a list of people with your ""\_\_\_% match"". Basically tinder for roommates, no joke. 

Set ground rules with your roommates/suite mates right away. If something bothers you, tell them about it. My roommates became some of my best friends doing this.",1588291350

*****
&gt; April 30, 2020, 7:02 p.m. ET.CAIRO - Sudan&amp;#039;s new government has outlawed the practice of female genital mutilation, a move hailed as a major victory by women&amp;#039;s rights campaigners in a country where the often dangerous practice is widespread.The United Nations estimates that nearly nine in 10 Sudanese women have been subjected to the most invasive form of the practice, which involves the partial or total removal of external female genitalia and leads to health and sexual problems that can be fatal.

&gt; Genital mutilation is practiced in at least 27 African countries, as well as parts of Asia and the Middle East.

&gt; In Egypt genital cutting was banned in 2008 and the law amended in 2016 to criminalize doctors and parents who facilitate the practice, with prison sentences of up to seven years for performing the operation and up to 15 if it results in disability or death.

"DeepRockGalactic","t5_3iufz","Here, take an upvote pal! Didn't see you complaining about pheromones though.. Jokes aside this wasn't aimed at you as a person but the subreddit itself. You never replied to my comment after you ""facepalmed"" yourself to oblivion because I'm using tools that you deem inefficient.

Now that I got you here, explain what's inefficient with the build I am using please and don't use the childlike rhetoric like you did last time. Just commenting that something is bad without any real solid counterpoint or suggestion for improvement to a build doesn't prove anything. You did elaborate a bit when you talked about Electrocuting Focus shots but then again the things you mentioned were only negatives for a sniper M1K build, which I don't use.

I have tried a lot of builds for Scout and this one has the greatest synergy so far, it works very well in combination with my friends characters and more importantly; it is loads of fun! You play games for fun right? Why would I use something that is less fun and not very engaging when I can get the job done with something more fun? Just because you need perks like Iron-Will doesn't mean I do. If you want to be a meta try-hard no one is going to stop you, but don't assume that everyone needs the same training wheels as you do to make it through a mission.

The fact that you think this is complicated puzzles me as well, Deep Rock might be a complicated FPS for you but to me this is really basic stuff. I am thankful that there actually is depth to this simplistic shooter because it makes it so much better.

Show me your top tier meta build, explain to me why it's so efficient and fun. I really am interested in having a civilized discussion about Scout builds but something tells me you don't have any interest in that for some reason.",1588291351

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","My parents &amp; theirs were from a generation where only the male (in most cases) worked &amp; the women kept house &amp; controlled the kids. For my parent, my father worked in the same job from 14yo until forced retirement due to age as it was Government employment &amp; no variations in retirement age. With 4 boys, in the early 1950's, life wasn't easy &amp; it took time before we had our first car, TV &amp; even the telephone, but we always had a 5-6 week summer vacation at the seaside, camping out.

Sure my mother worked from sun up to sundown &amp; my father worked 5 days a week, various times &amp; days, often at first weekends to get overtime &amp; shift penalties  to help &amp; he gave my mother most of his pay to keep the house running, keeping enough set aside for bills due to come in &amp; also save a little all his life, to make sure my mother would be looked after all her life, as he expected to die before her.

We were always well fed, clothed &amp; clean &amp; neat when out visiting, shopping etc. but allowed to wear older worn clothes when playing or gardening. We all had tasks around the house to do &amp; each year for a couple of weekends we would go out to forests to collect firewood for winter &amp; would help cut it up &amp; stack it, all with hand saws, no chain saws. We had a wood fire/heater until my parent hit their 70's we my 3 brothers &amp; I had a reversed cycle air-con system installed when they were away for a couple of months on their annual caravaning trip with several other couples that were their friends. They would take off for 3-4 months (winter) each year, all with CB radios &amp; travel up to several kms apart, especially in outback Australia due to dust with the lead car finding a spot they could all stop for regular breaks for snacks/meals &amp; sometimes camping, although most nights were at caravan parks, so they had electricity &amp; bathroom facilities.

In my perfect fantasy world I would want to be a natural insemination sperm donor. If a couple can't conceive on their own, say if the man is infertile or it's a lesbian couple, I would have sex with the partner who wants to get pregnant until she is. I would somehow sign away all my parental rights and let them have their baby. They get to have a baby and I get to live my fantasy and feel good that I'm doing some good by doing it. In reality I know that's not really possible. Where I live it's impossible for me to sign away my parental rights completely. I'd basically always been potentially on the hook for child support. If I had Jeff bezos money I'd be ok with that but I don't.

The way I've played it out so far is through semi roleplay and a bunch of risky decisions. The first time I really learned I had this ""kink"" was when I had a condom break with a girlfriend. I was so excited and turned on that I just pumped her full while she was possibly fertile. We went and got Plan B but had a couple more rounds of unprotected sex before she took it. There was another time with the same woman where we were having sex and forgot the condom and she just asked me to cum in her so I did. Again, Plan B afterwards. With her we did a lot of pullout as our birth control for a bit and that did the trick. Eventually she got on BC and our sex life went down hill from there. After we broke up I met a girl ok OkCupid who had somewhat recently miscarried. We talked a good bit about it and she basically told me she just needed someone to fuck her brains out. I told her about my kink and she felt it would actually help her work through things a bit and told me she couldn't get pregnant that soon after her miscarriage. To my understanding that's not true but either way that belief is what made cumming in her so hot. We had a really intense and really therapeutic for both of us one night stand. Next was a woman (friend of a friend) who needed a lot of help with something and basically said she would have sex with me for it. I told her under the condition that we play with my kink. Basically the plan was that I would bring Plan B with me and we would have unprotected sex then she choose whether or not to take it after. She took it as we were sitting and talking afterwards. Another was a woman (one night stand) said that because of health reasons she had a very very low chance of conceiving but could still possible get pregnant. I came in her again and again knowing there was a chance despite how low. Finally I met my now girlfriend. She's in birth control now but still begs me to give her a baby fairly often. Early on we did the tip game, pull out method, and eventually full on cumming in her  with Plan B not far behind.",1588291353

Carriers-Move where and when you want them with no limitations other than permit locked systems, can store ships, modules, can sell any module or ship in the game, can trade with other players, can store tradable goods and theoretically can generate income for a player.   This comes at the cost of upkeep and cost for modules(which is a stupid system and should be removed but that's beside the point right now).

&amp;#x200B;

The Gnosis-Jumps once a week to where Frontier decides(Canonn can make suggestions but Frontier decides where it goes at the end of the day), can't store ships, can't have a black market, can't generate income for a player directly, can't change what modules are sold and a few other things carriers lack.

&amp;#x200B;

The weekly timer with no final say on where it goes is the balance for it already.

&amp;#x200B;

Adding a system to pay for it weekly and fuel it weekly(since it can't jump faster than once a week) would require systems the game doesn't have which means development time and testing which means less spent on carriers.",1588291353

You also have to carry power for things like security cameras over ethernet cable, and therefore there has to be specific sizes to carry power and data.  There have been improvements, but until someyhing new is slowly phased in that doesn't threaten entire infrastructure already in place, we're stuck bud. HDMI was a perfect example of a technology that was way behind. We had DVI 3 years before. We saw pixel density skyrocket and knew that hdmi would only be able to carry so much. Rather than adopt Displayport technology early, now we have to use multiple hdmi cables on 4k 8k tv and monitors. So what did they do? They mane 1.2, 1.3a and a bunch of other iterations of an already obsolete interface.  You can either be ahead of the curve and be patient and wait for bigger money to roll in or you can hop on the bandwagon and make a whole bunch of money now but be held back when tech changes.",1588291353
"AusSkincare","t5_310nr","I also have combination and blemish prone skin. I initially really liked the Innisfree Foaming Green Tea Cleanser as well! In fact, I was on my second one until I started breaking out a few weeks ago. It might have been a combination of factors (like working from home etc.), but the drier and cooler weather definitely exacerbated things.  At the time I was also using TO Glycolic 7% toner. I suspected a combination of those two compromised my moisture barrier and caused me to break out on my forehead when my skin was pretty clear. The first symptoms were how drying and tight my face felt and how nothing seemed to sink into my skin.   


I actually did some research and later found out that the Innisfree cleanser has a pH level of 8-9!!! That is way too harsh, especially for autumn/winter skin! I've now switched to a creamy cleanser that has a pH level of around 5.5 and the difference has been huge.  So my advice is to use with caution!",1588291353

Whether 'tis nobler in the butt to suffer

The dicks and dildos of outrageous fortune,

Or to take arms against a sea of assholes

And by opposing fuck them. To lie—to stand,

No more; and by a fuck to say we end

The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks

Devoutly to be wish'd. To fuck, to be fucked;

To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:

When we have shuffled off this sexy coil,

Must give us pause—there's the respect

That makes calamity of so long sex.

For who would bear the whips and chains of bed,

Th'oppressor's wrong, the proud top's contumely,

The bangs of dispriz'd love, the cum's delay,

The insolence of orifice, and the sperms

With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bare,

To grunt and sweat under a weary life,

But that the dread of something after head,

The undiscovere'd section, from whose bourn

No prostitute returns, puzzles the will,

And makes us rather bare those ills we have

Than spray to others that we know not of?

Thus conscience does make hookers of us all,

And thus the pinkish hue of resolution

Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thot,

And enterprises of great bitch and movement

&gt;There are some signs, however, that Biden is shrugging off anyone vocalizing discontent with Warren. He is plowing ahead with appeasing progressives who backed her campaign while possibly looking to bring her into the fold. The Washington Post reported that Biden’s team hired two of Warren’s fundraising advisors and channeled some of the Massachusetts senator’s progressive views at a virtual donor event last week. 

&gt;“Look, you know Wall Street is – they’re good folks. But guess what they didn’t build America. Ordinary Americans, middle class built America,” Biden said, while noting that he believes the pandemic has shown “the institutional racism, the institutional difficulties that are set out there for ordinary people.” 

&gt;Another move that suggests Biden is trying to appeal to Warren and fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, is his appointment of longtime advisor Ted Kaufman to help put together a presidential transition team. During his short stint in the Senate, Kaufman introduced an amendment to the 2010 Dodd Frank reform bill that could have cut down the size of a few of the big banks. It failed to pass in the Senate. Still, some progressive activists are happy that Kaufman, a Wall Street critic, is assisting in crafting a group of advisors for Biden. 

&gt;“The Ted Kaufman news is encouraging. Kaufman has an excellent reputation as a committed opponent of Wall Street banksters and financial fraudsters more generally from his two years in the Senate,” Jeff Hauser, an executive director at the liberal Revolving Door Project, tweeted in reaction to the developments.

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

for style, try a style challenge and mimic different styles, but style is basically a series of shortcuts, so draw a lot and see what type of shortcuts are natural for you. really, style isn't that big of a deal, plenty of comics change their style over time. if you want to keep things more consistent, try making a ""style guide"" for yourself

for webtoons, getting your hands dirty is the best way, there's a short story contest right now on Webtoons.com. short stories are great because you can practice without commiting to a super long story

also, I like to learn from videos on YouTube

"USF","t5_2r3i8","I lived in Baltimore for 8 years and then moved to USF for college so I might be able to give you a somewhat relatable perspective. I'm someone who really believes that you should move somewhere new for college. It really helps you learn about yourself if you get in a new environment, make new friends, start new hobbies. It really gave me a new perspective that I'm extremely grateful for. In the dorms there are a lot of people that go home every weekend, but there's also a lot that don't. The ones that don't go home ended up becoming my main group of friends. 

It is very different being here that's for sure. I love being here in the winter when it's beautiful out and mid-70's every day. I'll go up north for a few weeks of winter break and then come back to the warmth. 

This school is pretty massive and there's so many kinds of clubs. You can find any kind of club you can think of and many more that you can't. You're also close to downtown Tampa so if you don't find anything at the school you'll be sure to find it in the local community.  If you have any interest in theme parks busch gardens is a 10 minute drive and disney is about an hour away. Florida residents get discounts at disney. 

I do think it's very useful to have a car after your first or second year, expecially for biology-related majors. With a car you can intern at the zoo, or with florida fish and wildlife doing stuff with manatees or sea turtles. Florida is a really good place to learn about field work because the weather is always nice and it can be done year round. Up north it's more limited because you can't really count animals or take water samples when there's snow on the ground. I've done all four years with a biology related major without a car. It works if you find an animal-related lab on campus to volunteer in.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Apoiadores do presidente Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido) compartilharam intensamente nesta quinta-feira (30) uma [reportagem publicada pela **Folha **em dezembro de 2019](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/ouca-grampo-em-que-moraes-trata-de-lobby-no-stf-com-desembargador-investigado.shtml) sobre interceptação telefônica feita pela Polícia Federal de uma conversa do hoje ministro do STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) Alexandre de Moraes com um desembargador que vinha sendo investigado.

 A reportagem fez parte da lista das reportagens mais lidas na **Folha** durante a maior parte desta quinta-feira (30). Ela foi compartilhada milhares de vezes nas redes sociais de perfis bolsonaristas.

 Revelada pela reportagem em 2019, uma gravação realizada pela PF em novembro de 2015 com autorização do STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça) sugere que Moraes atuava informalmente como advogado do desembargador Alexandre Victor de Carvalho, do Tribunal de Justiça de Minas Gerais, no mesmo período em que ocupava o cargo de secretário de Segurança Pública de São Paulo.

 Por lei, o exercício da advocacia é incompatível com a chefia de órgãos públicos, cabendo, em caso de descumprimento da regra, a abertura de procedimento disciplinar na OAB (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil) e de processo criminal por exercício irregular da profissão. Procurado, Moraes não se manifestou sobre o assunto.

 O desembargador respondia a um processo por ter empregado em seu gabinete uma funcionária que não exercia ali suas funções. Segundo a PF, havia a suspeita de que a servidora devolvia parte do salário para o magistrado.

 Moraes virou alvo de bolsonaristas depois de ter [suspendido a nomeação de Alexandre Ramagem](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/alexandre-de-moraes-do-stf-suspende-nomeacao-de-ramagem-na-policia-federal.shtml) para diretoria-geral da Polícia Federal. Ramagem chefiou a segurança de Bolsonaro durante a campanha de 2018, tornou-se amigo da família e virou diretor-geral da Abin (Agência Brasileira de Inteligência).

  A decisão de Moraes se baseou, principalmente, nas afirmações de Bolsonaro de que pretendia usar a PF, um órgão de investigação, como produtor de informações para suas tomadas de decisão.

 O ministro concedeu liminar (decisão provisória) a uma ação protocolada pelo oposicionista PDT, que alegou ""abuso de poder por desvio de finalidade"" com a nomeação do delegado para a PF.

It was revealed in Chapter 0 that Kuina was born two years after Roger's death (that happened 24 years ago). It's also revealed that she was 11 years old the moment she died. Putting two and two together, she died 11 years ago, so give or take one year after the revolutionaries visited Shimotsuki. Would this theory be possible? Maybe, but the times are slightly less accurate than what I wanted to take a theory like this at face value.

I personally think that Orochi's assassin sent to Shimotsuki Village to kill survivors of the Shimotsuki clan, former ruler of Ringo, would be a lot cooler as a way to reincorporate them in the story right now and bring a lot more meaning to this arc for Zoro. Imagine if he faces the killer of Kuina right now in the story! That would be dope!",1588291356

Refusing to vote for the Democratic candidate and having that candidate lose as a result isn't going to tell the DNC that they need to court the left, it's going to tell them that they need to court *centrists* harder, because, and I want to make this clear, *the DNC establishment would rather lose with Biden than win with Bernie*. They already see far-left voters as unreliable, and refusing to vote will just confirm they should stop trying and focus on voters that more closely align with their corporatist views.

You know what you *can* do? Go out and vote for more far-left candidates in state and local elections, where they actually have a shot and where we've actually made strides in recent years. These are achievable goals, and the end result is going to be dragging the party left over time through actually having direct power and influence in the form of elected representatives. The presidency is simply not attainable for leftists right now, so we need to go with the option that's going to fuck our values the least. You know what happens if you spend all of your time refusing to compromise with reality and just trying to force things when you have no actual power? Ask the Communist Party of Germany during the 1930s, who spent all their time attacking the social-democrats...right up until 1933, when Hitler took over and fucked *everyone* even slightly left.

This is just one example and does not describe all non binary people as many do wish to have surgery on their genitals.

This is pretty entry level stuff. I never took gender studies either.  It’s worth a google if you’re still confused.",1588291357

Using the same report, in Australia, it is only about 1.4%. This is because of the measures we have implemented to protect our most vulnerable communities (no physical visitors to retirement homes etc...) and because we are not overwhelming our hospitals (which are too small anyway).

I rounded up from 1.4% because by without the social distancing measures, these people would be at a greater risk and we would overwhelm our hospitals, increasing the death rate.

Much larger investments come from international and national investment firms spreading their bets into indexes. I think the fluctuations we're seeing is a correlation with the main US markets. If you look at 5 year graphs it's pretty much the same curve.  
I am on the side of the fence that says the market will crash again, harder than it did, because I think the US will crash again. I think this will happen regardless of NZ coming out well because of how much of an international web we're tied it. I'm no expert but those are my two cents and I'm open to further discussion.  
With specific regards to SKC, I have had shares in them for some time now, and I agree that it's overvalued at 2.50. Because a lot of their money was from Chinese gamblers coming to NZ and Adelaide and that's pretty much dried up. They do have an online casino which I'm not sure how popular it is, but seems lucrative (and also abhorrent)

I bought into SKC many years ago because of their monopoly on gambling, their restaurants and tower which to me reflected an investment in Central Auckland and also the new build of the convention centre.

She introduced me to games and really loved sharing her love of gaming with me. She even paid for a Nintendo Power subscription for me until it was discontinued. 

Growing up, I played Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and a few other titles. It was always a staple to my gaming life and she was always there to talk about it with. 

She passed on January 14th, 2018, and a little bit of my heart went with her. In her memory, I decided to play every single Zelda game in order, and then polish it off with A Link to the Past. 

I insisted on playing them all the original way - on their original console. Accomplishing this required buying every game - and a few consoles along the way. 

Some games, like Minish Cap, were a little frustrating. Other games such as Twilight Princess or Skyward Sword made me so happy that I was doing this.

I work so much now, and this endeavor would have taken me a few months tops when I was younger. It was occasionally frustrating finding the time.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Your argument was that restricting access for the general public doesn't affect access for criminals, which is nonsense. The more legal guns there are out in the wild, the more will be lost/stolen/sold and end up in criminal hands, period. Nevermind that many people who are not 'criminals' in the eyes of the state are, in fact, criminals, and more that become criminals after the purchase of their guns.

And you invalidate your own point about background checks with your stories of straw purchasers getting caught. Again, these people will never disappear as long as it is easy for them to obtain guns and sell them for a healthy profit, even if they get caught all the time the barriers are still low.

&gt; If you're going to argue based on ""simple math"", then simple math should tell you that banning a firearm used in less that 0.001% of gun crimes isn't going to change much.

I agree that these hyper-specific laws are stupid. They should move handguns from restricted to prohibited, and classify all semi-auto rifles as restricted, IMO, but you didn't ask my opinion and your argument was more general than speaking in the Canadian context.

&gt;  Especially since there's a wide open border to your south where these guns are legal.

"titanfolk","t5_ioe0d","It’s not about “fast moving”, S1’s awkwardly slams on the accelerator in some parts and is crawls along at others. Pacing and plot developments are seperate items and S1 fails at both. Its great at creating the setting, world building and technical quality is like I said, “art”, but in terms of isayama’s early writing it starts off incredibly well (first arcs are unquestionably great) and then it trips over by dragging out melodrama, killing characters left and right (only for the story to develop extreme plot armour later anyway), both not developing the characters and plot (just through sheer inefficiency) and trying to play off characters that had their entire phases of character development skipped. Notable exceptions to this being Jean, Eren and to some extent Mikasa and *maybe* Levi.

IMO the best parts of season 1 (and S2 and S3) was learning more about the world, and the characters in them and THEN seeing actions and consequences, not being conditioned to not give a fuck about half the cast because they’d die in some horrible way a few episodes into their introduction.

It’s okay to acknowledge S1’s flaws, Isayama did for sure because they mostly don’t exist in S2/S3.",1588291361

But if protesting is not the answer (and mind you I think gathering out in big crowds is a dumb idea as well) then what is the answer? The main reason people are getting upset is because while people are losing their livelihoods, no answer is forthcoming. Coming up with that answer is quite literally the government's job in cases like this. People need to stop treating this like it's a one side or the other issue. Both maintaining the lockdown and letting everyone out have costs and anyone who tells you it's not a tradeoff is not being honest.

Crisis creates the perfect opportunity for governments to seize permanent power. That's why the plan for how these restrictions are removed is so important. If there's no plan to ease the restrictions, when do we stop telling pastors that they can't have drive-thru services? The issue most conservatives have is we're worried not just about making sure coronavirus doesn't kill us, but that when we come out of this crisis we're haven't been permanently changed for the worse. That's what a lot of the protests are about, they're letting the government know when they think they're overreaching.",1588291362

You cannot be in a monetary union only for the things that benefit you and laugh at the face of the problems if they are being suffered by others. 

In the end everybody would understand the NL defending their interests, but nobody understands the lack of empathy and the aggressive approach for pushing their position.

The approach of other countries is ""no, we don't want coronabonds because they could hurt our economy"". The approach the Netherlands is communicating is ""no, we don't want coronabonds because the South doesn't deserve them"".

And in general Dutch people, even people formed in economics, don't know how the Spanish economy works and what has happened with it over the last 15-20 years. But all those people have an opinion based on stereotypes. I've heard things like that we don't know what's austerity and that one is specially insulting. 

Spanish economy had a consistent budgetary surplus before the 2008 crisis and the debt was pretty low, unfortunately Spain had a real state bubble st the moment so the crisis hit badly and then the Eurozone reciped austerity and everything got worse, deficit and debt skyrocketed because the austerity destroyed more and more pillars of our economy and finally when the unemployment skyrocketed people had to default on their mortgages so banks started having problems. And as we had systemic banks, Spain had to rescue them to save the European financial sector, so all that private debt became public Spanish debt. Rather than helping people to pay their mortgages in one way or another to save the banks and help people at the same time, people where evicted, banks failed and the same money had to be introduced in our financial sector.",1588291363

&gt; Asked whether Trump told Saudi Arabia it could lose U.S. military support, U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told Reuters the president reserved the right to use every tool to protect U.S. producers, including &amp;quot;Our support for their defense needs.""

&gt; After the conversation with the Saudi crown prince, and another the same day with Putin, Trump tweeted that he expected Saudi Arabia and Russia to cut output by about 10 million barrels, which &amp;quot;Will be GREAT for the oil &amp; gas industry!&amp;quot;.

It's okay to trust your body and eat when you're hungry and/or when you feel like it. Including during the week before menstruation.

This can be particularly difficult, especially at the start, for anyone who has become used to the cycle of restrictive diets and the lies of the health industry. I say this from research, but even more so from personal experience.

Rest assured, it's not actually possible to gain 15 lbs over night, it's water weight. 
The bloating won't last forever. Yes, even in your tummy.
You won't want to eat just the foods you've been denying yourself forever, you'll get your fill eventually and tire of them, then moderation feels natural.
Food has no moral value. There is no such thing as a good food or a bad food, and as such, you can't be a bad person for eating a certain food. 
I repeat, food has no moral value.
It's okay to listen to your body, it knows what it needs. If you're hungry and have the means, eat. You are not required to spend all your energy trying to take up less space. You have permission to eat food you enjoy AND food that makes you feel good.
There are lots of reasons to eat. Food is not just fuel. It is also social, it is comforting, it is a way to explore.

These are all things I wish someone had told me sooner.

There comes and immense feeling of freedom and space when you make the choice to let go of the need to be in control of your body and just let it exist, instead of counting and planning and restricting. It frees up so much time, and space in your mind and your life. This is really tough when it can feel like that's the only thing you can be in control of.

You deserve to feel good about yourself, as you are now, and as your body naturally changes throughout your life, as bodies do.
If you're struggling with your relationship with food in any capacity, you deserve help. Even if you think people wouldn't take you seriously, there are lots of people who will and you deserve the care that they can provide. It is not an easy road but I deeply encourage you to reach out. You deserve to think about something other than food.

So in answer to the initial question, I would increase it by however much my body tells me it needs by eating when I feel like it, (and even if you don't feel like it, you still need to eat) but try not to worry about the calories. Show your body the compassion it deserves because going through a menstrual cycle is already a rough enough process.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O [governo Jair Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/especial/2018/governo-bolsonaro/) (sem partido) excluiu cursos de humanas do edital de bolsas de iniciação científica do CNPq (Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico). Com a medida, estudantes de graduação de áreas como educação, direito, economia, ciências sociais e filosofia não poderão acessar as 25 mil bolsas oferecidas pelo órgão federal.  
   
 O edital foi anunciado no dia 23 de abril. O financiamento para pequisa nos cursos de graduação terá vigência de agosto deste ano a junho de 2021.  
   
 A diretriz da órgão de fomento de pesquisa atenda uma portaria que priorizou as áreas tecnológicas em detrimento de humanidades e ciências básicas, como matemática pura e física teórica.  
   
 Essa medida foi [publicada em março](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/educacao/2020/03/em-meio-a-pandemia-governo-bolsonaro-investe-contra-pesquisa-em-ciencias-humanas.shtml) pelo MCTIC (Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia, Inovações e Comunicações). O CNPq está submetido à pasta.

 Todas as linhas de incentivo à pesquisa --de iniciação científica, mestrados, doutorados ou financiamento de projetos-- devem seguir essa orientação. Após a repercussão, humanidades e ciências básicas foram parcialmente restabelecidas, mas apenas como subsidiárias às tecnológicas.  
   
 As determinações do MCTIC e do CNPq vão ao encontro da visão de ciência de Bolsonaro.  
   
 O presidente defende investimentos com retorno imediato. A postura é considerada equivocada e tem sido criticada por pesquisadores e especialistas.  
   
 O edital para os cursos de graduação integra o Pibic (Programa Institucional de Iniciação Científica). Trata-se de uma ação reconhecida do governo federal de incentivo à ciência, aproximação dos universitários com a pós-graduação e formação de novos pesquisadores.  
   
 De acordo com a divulgação do CNPq, as bolsas de iniciação científica ""deverão estar vinculadas a projetos de pesquisa que apresentem aderência a, no mínimo, uma das áreas de tecnologias prioritárias"".  
   
 Projetos de pesquisa básica, humanidades e ciências sociais devem contribuir, em algum grau, ""para o desenvolvimento das áreas de tecnologias"" para serem contemplados.  
   
 O CNPq informou que essas são as linhas gerais para seleção. ""As chamadas estão sendo discutidas e adequadas para lançamento na próxima semana, quando serão divulgadas informações mais detalhadas"", disse, em nota.  
   
 A iniciativa é criticada. ""Essa determinação de aderência às áreas de tecnologias prioritárias afunila a cadeia de formação dos jovens desde o início"", diz nota conjunta da SBPC (Sociedade Brasileira para o Progresso da Ciência) e ABC (Academia Brasileira de Ciências).  
   
 ""No início da carreira, esses jovens serão levados a desistir de certos temas de pesquisa porque eles não estão vinculados diretamente às áreas de tecnologias prioritárias"", diz o texto.  
   
 Outras 71 entidades assinam o documento.  
   
 Segundo o presidente da Anpof (Associação Nacional de Pós-graduação em Filosofia), Adriano Correia, o novo edital é uma catástrofe para a formação universitária.Ela ainda afeta, de acordo com ele, a formação de excelência na área de ciências humanas, letras e artes, que inclui a filosofia.  
   
 ""Toda pesquisa sobre ética terá de se restringir à ética aplicada?"", questionou Correia. ""[Há] uma compreensão tacanha do conhecimento, que não compreende não só o diálogo entre as áreas do conhecimento, mas a relevância de cada uma delas para a democracia, o desenvolvimento econômico, a cultura e a formação.""  
   
 Entidades ligadas às ciências sociais divulgaram nota em que afirmam que o governo ""escalou na perseguição"" às humanas e sociais.  
   
 ""Em um misto de ignorância e má-fé, desde a campanha eleitoral de 2018, Bolsonaro e seus asseclas desqualificam profissionais que dedicam sua vida à compreensão dos problemas brasileiros e a busca de alternativas para sua superação"", disse o texto, assinado pela Associação Brasileira de Ciência Política, de Antropologia, pela Associação Nacional de Pós-Graduação e Pesquisa em Ciências Sociais e pela Sociedade Brasileira de Sociologia.  
   
 A mensagem ressaltou que as pesquisas têm contribuições em um momento de pandemia do [novo coronavírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/).  
   
 ""As pesquisas que realizamos também permitem compreender os efeitos diferenciados da Covid-19 e das políticas públicas adotadas sobre populações diferenciada"", afirmou o texto.  
   
 Um quarto das cerca de 25.000 bolsas de iniciação científica ativas é direcionado para estudantes de cursos de humanas. Só cursos da área de saúde tem o mesmo volume de bolsas, as engenharias respondem 12% e alunos de cursos considerados ciência básica, como química, representam 10% dos benefícios.  
   
 A portaria do MCTIC mira em tecnologias, que são classificadas como: estratégicas (de tecnologia espacial a segurança pública), habilitadoras (inteligência artificial), de produção (indústria, agronegócio, serviços), desenvolvimento sustentável e qualidade de vida (saúde, saneamento básico, por exemplo).Ao definir essas prioridades, a portaria do MCTIC defende que o objetivo é a contribuição para alavancar setores que teriam maiores potencialidades ""para a aceleração do desenvolvimento econômico e social do país"".  
   
 Entre os objetivos da definição de prioridades está, também, o de ""racionalizar o uso dos recursos orçamentários e financeiros"". Com isso, as humanidades deverão ter perda de recursos.",1588291363
"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Hey there! I'm really sorry that you are feeling this way. I think you've got the first step right already: recognizing that you aren't inferior and that this is a mental habit you would like to change.   


Maybe it might help to recognize that this isn't any better a sign of success / maturity than anything else is. There are mature, reasonable people in marriages and single, with their own homes and renting, with children and without, with new BMWs and with decade-old inexpensive compacts cars (i.e. the Wombatmobile) or with no car at all. Can you help yourself to see that all of those things can be achieved in good and bad ways, and that their mere possession doesn't say anything?   


You also sound a bit worried about what people think of you - or at least, that's how I'm interpreting your concern about what typical image people might see, whether boss ass bitch or left-behind loser. It might help to remind yourself now and then that other people's images of you aren't something you can control and also aren't something you need to control. Their images are largely based on who they are and not on who you are, so give yourself permission to just go enjoy your life, be satisfied with your work, and be at peace with who you are. &lt;3",1588291363

"SpiritualAwakening","t5_31579","A really amazing book a student and friend gave to me is called First Breath, Last Breath by Ma Jaya Sati Bhavagati
Lots of different kinds of meditation techniques. 
I practice Kriya. What my guide has told me, and which I had read from a book is “God first, spirit guides second.” 
God meaning whatever highest power you can sense or accept. I feel spirit guides work on higher vibrations than most humans, but they too are still reaching for the highest power. I don’t truly understand the depths of karma, it feels like a concept like infinity to me personally, but I also believe that through helping us on this plane, they are burning through old karma on their plane, something like that. 
Anyway, what I feel through Kriya meditation is that it is my time to focus my mind and ground myself, it’s less common for me to have deep comnection with the spirits at this set aside time when I am focusing on my breath and devotion to God and the gurus (who are like master spirit guides, like Jesus for an example).
Then I try to meditate again later in the day and spend this time communicating with my guides. It can be things like automatic writing or drawing, youtube guided meditations, tarot cards, going for a walk, playing guitar, or sitting and focusing on a question, idea or just the breath and seeing what happens! 
Now the biggest part I want to tell you is this is MY STORY and yours will be totally different!! What a beautiful thing!! 
I have found for myself that now that I have a meditation to help me focus on different energy centers in my body, and on the highest power, that connecting to my guides has become easier, though it is a very confusing process sometimes, but confusion is part of learning anything new! 

So based on my experience I’d recommend finding meditation techniques you enjoy, they don’t have to be long, the kriya techniques take me over a hour usually (because my mind still wanders like crazy) but sitting for up to 30 minutes is fantastic!! It’s all about trying to observe the breath and observe until there becomes a sense of love and peace. Spirit guides aside, just try to focus on one of anything, candle flames, concepts, pains in the body or mind, the breath...
Then, maybe after 10 minutes in your meditation, when you get really relaxed, you can bring the guides in? Unless you prefer to always involve them in your meditations? I get too curious currently and have too many questions that I feel distract me from my routine of techniques. 
Setting a time for yourself, maybe after you wake up is a great way to dedicate yourself to the practice of meditating. The devotional aspect of kriya and the amazing benefits is what really got me hooked- OH and a community that encouraged me!! If you can find some daily/weekly live meditation groups in times like now, that would be great! 

if you’re interested in kriya please check out Kriya.org!! 
I cannot teach these techniques, it’s important to learn them through someone of better ability, the guru knows, it involves a lot of trust and devotion but is also a very free and open practice. They have guidelines, but it is all up to you on how much you want to do. ^_^",1588291364

"NatureIsFuckingLit","t5_3gdh7","Hi /u/Ebyy0_0, have you read [our community rules?](https://www.reddit.com/r/NatureIsFuckingLit/about/rules/)

 We have one main rule that the subreddit was founded upon: *Every post title must start with the fire emoji and a space.* 🔥

This works as a spam filter for those that do not read the rules and keeps our community high in quality.

If you don't think your post can justify using a fire emoji in the title, it probably isn't right to post here.

Try resubmitting your post with the fire emoji at the start your title.

You can copy and paste it from this comment or the sidebar if you're on desktop, and if you're using a phone your keyboard likely has it too!

 Thanks, and stay lit

 Here is your suggested fixed title:

If you do so, you automatically fail the mission, but honestly, I disagree with this assessment.

I’m selling my set of Phoenix manga on ebay right now. Before the pandemic it was going for around $200. My auction is at $400 already and still has 3 days left.... But I am selling mine since I saw a set finish at $500 just recently. From Far Away also spiked to $375, up about $70 in just a couple weeks.

Edit: I also think many people who didn’t need their stimulus check are spending it on manga. Used prices for Dororo spiked just this week from $20 each for the singles to $50+ each as well. There was never this much demand for Dororo before.",1588291367

Does your restaurant provide a ""preferred"" script for greeting/confirming orders?  Mine did but if yours does not, it might benefit you to come up with one and just focus on sticking to it like a robot.  (=

Mine was something along the lines of -

**Hi, welcome to {RESTAURANT}, my name is {NAME}.  Would you like to try one of our {PROMOTIONAL ITEMS} today?***(We were required to upsell promotional items, could also just be ""What can I get for you today?"")*

*\[Customer probably says no thanks to the promotional items and gives their order.\]*

**Okay, so that's 1 {MEAL ITEM}, with {DRINK}.  Your total is {TOTAL AMOUNT} and I look forward to seeing you at the window.**

*\[Customer pulls up to the window.\]*

**Hi there, here is your {ITEM THEY ORDERED}.  Do you need any condiments?**

**Thank you, have a great day!**

"alberta","t5_2qxon","I'm not personally convinced it's higher risk than golf.  I'm not a golfer myself but most treat it as a social thing as much as a sport with people going in groups of 3-4 people.  I imagine we'll see a lot of people getting together for a round from different households.  Doubt they'll maintain social distancing the whole 9 rounds despite even best intentions...  Ultimately though neither of these seem like high-risk activities.  I have to agree that the golf lobby probably had a lot more high-powered influence than other sports with similar risk profiles. :P",1588291368

 Em relação aos casos, o aumento foi de 10% no período. Até esta quinta-feira, São Paulo confirmou 28.698 casos (26.158 até o dia anterior).

 Entre as vítimas fatais, estão 1.390 homens e 985 mulheres. Os óbitos continuam concentrados em pacientes com 60 anos ou mais (73,2%).

 A capital paulista tem 18.438 casos da doença e 1.514 mortes. Os casos confirmados aumentaram em 15,8% entre os dias 29 e 30 de abril.

 A taxa de ocupação de [leitos de UTI no estado](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/mesmo-com-novos-leitos-para-covid-19-utis-brasileiras-tem-alta-taxa-de-ocupacao.shtml) está em 69,3%, com 1.744 internados. Outros 2.138 permanecem em enfermarias. Na capital paulista, os hospitais se aproximam da capacidade total, com 89% dos leitos de UTI ocupados.

   

 Com a situação perto do colapso, a partir deste final de semana a Secretaria de Estado da Saúde começará utilizar leitos do interior para internar pacientes da Grande São Paulo. A medida valerá por alguns dias, segundo o secretário estadual da Saúde, José Henrique Germann.

 A distribuição dos leitos disponíveis será feita através do sistema Cross (Central de Regulação de Oferta de Serviços de Saúde), com base na disponibilidade de vagas e no quadro clínico do paciente.

 Apesar de ver um achatamento da curva, o estado está no início da fase de ascensão da pandemia, segundo Dimas Tadeu Covas, diretor do Instituto Butantan.

 A taxa de isolamento social desta quinta-feira foi de 47% no estado e 48% na capital paulista.

 O governador de SP, João Doria, o vice-governador, Rodrigo Garcia, e os membros do Centro de Contingência de Coronavírus se reuniram nesta quinta-feira com o ministro da Saúde, Nelson Teich.

 De acordo com o infectologista David Uip, que coordena o centro, o ministro apontou suas linhas de atuação, como a manutenção do programa de isolamento social. A pasta demonstrou preocupação com a dificuldade de comprar insumos, o programa de testes e o surgimento de novas ondas de infectados no país.

 Teich também se mostrou preocupação com a agilidade dos procedimentos, porque São Paulo está numa curva ascendente com novos pacientes e óbitos e necessita de aparelhos e insumos.

 A Secretaria de Estado da Saúde solicitou a Teich 1.600 kits de carro-monitor, 20 milhões em insumos de coleta do PCR (como tubos de ensaio), [EPIs para os leitos ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/deputados-aprovam-fornecimento-gratuito-de-epi-a-medicos-coveiros-e-policiais.shtml)de UTI (4,2 milhões entre aventais e máscaras cirúrgicas N95), 2,6 milhões de medicamentos emergenciais como oseltamivir e [cloroquina para os protocolos do próprio ministério](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/04/o-que-se-sabe-ate-agora-sobre-cloroquina-hidroxicloroquina-e-coronavirus.shtml) e 4 milhões de testes rápidos para a população.

 O Ministério da Saúde já tinha enviado 400 mil testes, que foram destinados aos profissionais de saúde.

 A pasta também pediu ao ministro cem respiradores, que serão destinados ao Hospital das Clínicas da USP nos próximos 15 dias. O [HC destinou o Instituto Central](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/03/complexo-do-hc-em-sp-sera-transformado-em-centro-de-tratamento-de-coronavirus.shtml) para atendimento de casos de Covid-19. Além dos 200 leitos de UTI, estão sendo abertos mais cem e outros cem devem ser abertos, totalizando 400.

 Outro pedido foi o credenciamento de 2.783 letos de UTI específicos para Covid-19. Até o momento, 734 foram habilitados.

 Nesta quinta-feira, o [presidente Jair Bolsonaro ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/04/filho-de-bolsonaro-jair-renan-diz-que-coronavirus-e-tossezinha-e-que-prefere-morrer-transando-que-tossindo.shtml)voltou a criticar os governadores que determinaram isolamento social e afirmou que o estado de São Paulo infla os números de Covid-19 para uso político.

 Em nota lida durante coletiva de imprensa, o secretário estadual da Saúde, José Henrique Germann, disse que a declaração do presidente foi irresponsável e que Jair Bolsonaro ignora o fato de que o isolamento social em São Paulo é fator determinante para o achatamento da curva e, consequentemente, diminuição do número de pacientes infectados e de doentes que precisam de UTI, evitando um colapso no sistema público de saúde.",1588291369

"Watches","t5_2qls5","This is an Armitron - a much neglected American watch company. And for good reason. They make mostly crap. But this one caught my eye. The blue dial is very, uh, blue. But it also has a trick up its sleeve - it’s a full-lume dial. It’s something called [visible247](http://www.visible247.com). They’re a legit, standalone company. Their thing is plastic impregnated with lume. It’s not just paint. So the dial doesn’t look luminous, but it sure as fuck is. 

It came with a lame, flat mineral crystal. I just installed a 3mm thick domed mineral from Esslinger. In the dark from the side, it looks like a UFO or something. I also have a sapphire on the way. I’m thinking of hydro-modding it once I get the sapphire. 

I also removed the chapter ring. It made it too busy and visually too large. Speaking of large, this mothertrucker is 46mm. And it has the same Miyota quartz movement as the lauded Casio MDV106.

*****
&gt; President Donald Trump and senior officials in his administration have been exploring different ways the U.S. can hold China accountable for the nation&amp;#039;s botched handling of the COVID-19 coronavirus, one of which is legally stripping the nation of its sovereign immunity, the Washington Post reported Thursday.

&gt; According to the Post, several of the president&amp;#039;s advisors have championed the notion of stripping China&amp;#039;s sovereign immunity or cancelling a portion of U.S. debt obligations to China as a smart move politically.

&gt; While stripping China of sovereign immunity would, theoretically, open the door for the federal government, individual states, or victims of the virus to sue the Chinese government for damages, it&amp;#039;s not that simple.

Your first daughter's pregnancy was not ideal. And you describe all the ways it wasn't,  but you NEVER address how scared your daughter must have been. She didn't want it to happen the way it did either. But it did and in a time when she desperately needed support, you weren't able to give it to her. While I don't know what your health issue was at the time, I do know that your daughter probably feels you could have been more supportive. And I agree. Maybe you physically couldn't and weren't mentally ready, but neither was she and you didn't acknowledge that in your post and I am guessing you didn't to her. No matter the reason, she was scared, alone, and hurt and now you need to acknowledge that. I am not saying to not support your youngest, you should absolutely throw her a shower and be as supportive as humanly possible. But you need to talk to your oldest and acknowledge, without excuse, that you did not support her the way she needed and you are sorry. Remember, nothing ruins an apology like an excuse, no matter if it is valid or not.",1588291372
"space","t5_2qh87","&gt;	You’re still ignoring that starship was not designed for this.

Yes it was. Elon tweeted 1-2 years ago “First the moon, then Mars!” This ship is designed to go anywhere, including the moon. That’s the point. It’s been the explicit goal of the rocket for a while now.

Elon loves to talk about Mars because it’s exciting and shows the true capability of Starship. But that was never intended to be interpreted as “Mars and nothing else ever.” It’s going to see most of its use in LEO. 

&gt;	And it was not made to integrate with Orion, a program that has enough red tape as it is

But NASA is in charge of that red tape and they selected Starship anyway. 

&gt;	NASA isn’t going to let space x launch 4 humans on a BFR in 2024, orion is a mission requirement.

From my understanding, Starship would dock with the Gateway and receive astronauts after they arrive via Orion. The benefit of Starship is the payload capacity *besides* the astronauts themselves. It’s not going to launch or take people to lunar orbit, only to the lunar surface.",1588291372

Stop punishing me” “I know I was selfish in the past and put my needs above yours but why can’t you keep giving and giving to me anyway ?! Stop punishing me!” The entitlement is  incredible. If you treat someone badly, they will have less esteem for you and will treat you worse in return. This isn’t punishment. It’s the foundation of our society. We share resources, such as emotional investment, in people that do the same for us. No one is entitled to someone else’s love or endless patience. We have to earn the respect of others. If our actions make others lose their ability to have endless compassion for us, that’s a consequence of our actions. It’s not them punishing us. Every decent person with character who believes in equity in human relationships knows this. Claiming you’re punishing him is just a pity ploy actually - an attempt to make you feel guilty.

They’re protesting because, like the overwhelming majority of Americans, they live paycheck to paycheck and have little to no savings. In their eyes, the government ordered them to stop making any money by forcibly closing their business and cutting off their income. This same government, since then, has provided them with exactly one (1) $1200 check to cover their losses. 

Given the choice between trying to convince the same government that gave them breadcrumbs for killing their business to systematically reform their pandemic response, and just saying “fuck you, I’m opening back up”, their response seems much less unreasonable.

You can argue about whether they’re right or wrong all day, and you can armchair quarterback the federal government on how they should be responding, and that’s not really a discussion I’m looking to have. But to frame the issue as “we’re staying closed and if you think otherwise you’re entitled and racist” cuts a myriad of intellectual corners and does nothing to further the discussion, understand the protestors, or solve the underlying problem.",1588291372

Majima had far better and quicker upgrades than Kiryu, all of his styles are also faster, and two have CC, which in later stages is extremely helpful, while Kiryu can only pose like a big thin Gorilla with his third style if you dont max it out. In the end, it was a blast to play, a hidden gem for sure, and im happy we will be getting the rest on PC too.",1588291372

"WorldOfWarships","t5_2t8uj","&gt; I can fully understand why they decided to ditch Reddit. It's toxic 

That wasn't always the case. 2019 pissed off a lot of players due in large part to four factors: CV rework being rushed out the door; the Benham grind-pocalypse; the Smolensk; and the PR disaster. All of these were self-made issues. Instead of owning up to their failures and trying to make amends, they shifted the blame to redditors for being ""toxic."" They failed in community relations 101: first, never pretend like you have a better understanding of the player experience than the players do; and second, never ever ever *ever* lie to the players.  

&gt; Reddit is why the Discord was needed

Discord is at its core a chat client. The reason you need forums like Reddit is so that people can make posts that can be discussed as a self-contained unit. Posts can foster ideas and debates that are much richer than anything Discord could ever offer. Players and developers are worse off by shifting the discourse about the game from a forum to a chat feed. 

&gt; And I cannot fault them for it.

Obviously we redditors don't have our house in order, we have to do a better job of suppressing toxic comments. But putting the blame entirely on us is swallowing WG's narrative whole. They are far far far from blameless.",1588291373

There's also a threat of a second wave of this, but hey, let's see if people will still die. 

Questions that directly affect us here go unanswered. Instead, news outlets are reporting on death tolls and offering condolences (I mean that in a metaphorical sense) while we've got nothing to do but to absorb information the media offers.

A product's value is equal to the labour that went into it: this old Marxist canard is completely misleading and unhelpful. A products value is the price negotiated by the seller and buyer and is determined by many factors, primarily supply and demand. 

Profit is inherently exploitative: this is another bullshit Marxist idea that makes no sense in practice. The worker is entitled to the pay he negotiated for when he signed his contract. Profit may be shared between employees, but that's a matter for the business owner to choose whether or not to write into employee contracts.

When you take a salaried job you sell your time and your labour. These are your products and you are entitled to whatever recompense you can get through negotiation.

I am not here to lick any billionaire boots. I happily acknowledge that there are many, deep flaws within the economic system, particularly globalised supply chains that stamp all over worker rights.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O ministro da Cidadania, Onyx Lorenzoni, afirmou nesta quinta-feira (30) que espera redução nas próximas semanas do [número de pessoas em frente a agências da Caixa por todo o país](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/grana/2020/04/fila-do-auxilio-emergencial-da-caixa-leva-da-frustracao-a-surpresa-com-saque-de-r-1200.shtml). Mesmo assim, ele disse que as filas vão continuar existindo e deu como justificativa para isso a cultura da população.  
   
 “Tem uma parcela da população que não tem aplicativo, que não usa o sistema digital, que precisa ir à Caixa ver e pegar o dinheiro. Essa é uma dificuldade que, com bom senso e equilíbrio, vamos enfrentar”, afirmou. “Algum grau de fila nas agências da Caixa vai ter porque é da natureza nossa, da nossa cultura”, disse.

 Onyx disse que o governo está trabalhando [para acelerar os pagamentos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/julianna-sofia/2020/04/demora-no-auxilio-emergencial-de-r-600-sangra-guedes.shtml). Segundo ele, no começo eram usados dez dias para processar os pedidos e agora essa espera diminuiu para seis ou sete dias. Por isso, disse, a tendência é que haja uma redução das filas ao longo do mês de maio.

 Ele alertou que o auxílio de R$ 600 para informais vai se somar a outros pagamentos, como o Bolsa Família. Também será pago o benefício emergencial a empregados que tiveram redução de jornada e salário ou suspensão de contratos. Segundo Onyx, isso pode aumentar o fluxo de pessoas à agência.

 Em relação à população de rua, Onyx disse que o objetivo é dar recursos aos municípios, que, através de suas equipes, desenvolvam alternativas.

 Onyx disse que o governo trabalha para identificar, até a noite desta quinta, todos os inscritos no aplicativo até 26 de abril. Ainda segundo ele, os dados apontam [que mais de 32 milhões de pessoas tentaram burlar as regras.](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/grana/2020/04/metade-dos-inscritos-tem-direito-de-receber-auxilio-emergencial-de-r-600-da-caixa.shtml)

I liked my regular job before all this happened, but now I’ve been forced into this arrangement and have daily meetings and we do the Zoom happy hours every week for anyone who wants to go. Plus other forced bonding activities on Slack. I’m just burned out more and find myself wishing we could go back to the office, but that’ll be security theater on full display when we do go back because CDC GUIDELINES. I find myself doing enough to stay in good graces and look productive, but it’s not a great arrangement. I’m taking tomorrow off to sleep in and recharge; hopefully it helps. 

I feel like it’s possible I’d like work from home better if things were open and I could look forward to doing stuff in the evenings and weekends but we all know that fun is cancelled until further notice. 

I also worry more about the future as states start to reopen. Will we still be expected to social distance at Thanksgiving and Christmas and eat turkey on Zoom? When baseball returns in 2021 will I have to wear a mask while walking up and down steps and around a stadium in 90 degree temps while doing my job?

It's busy. People sit in them. A lot of people talk about women who don't LOOK pregnant, and them being too shy to ask for the seat. So no one should ever sit in the seat.

Look, if you're too shy to ask, you don't get a seat. Plain and simple. Shy people don't get what they want, that's on them, you know?

I mean when he helps Arya escape harrenhal he kills all the guards stealthily, which sorta flies in the face of “assassins are warriors”. 

The problem with Arya and why I characterise her as a Mary Sue, is because not only does she have ridiculous fighting skills that she has in no way trained for, her “flaws” her list for revenge and brutality are portrayed as STRENGTHS. So when writers turn a generally accepted flaw into a strength to sell some “Not Today” T-shirt’s, is say she’s a Mary Sue.

Explain it to her, and then just change the order each day. Spell the words with an arrow showing what to do. She learns to spell, learns her numbers, it takes her longer, makes it fun, and hopefully brings down the stress.

I think when I read these I thought of the first one as the introduction of Merlin and Arthur's relationship, so I did not notice the lack of female characters. The series focuses pretty heavily on Merlin and his perspective rather than a full story of all character motivations. That it was I recall from years ago, but it may be completely wrong.

"Hunting","t5_2qlkx","Animals only show symptoms towards the late stages of the diseases. Some regions have 50% of the deer infected in the USA. Additionally, one of the tests they do to see if the disease can cross the species barrier is try to inoculate mice with different stands (if mice can be infected, it's reasonable to assume humans can). With one new strand discovered... they can. 

My opinion.... given the prevalence of CWD and the history of this family of diseases.... **it will** eventually cross to humans. Naturally, this will start a panic. And the panic will lead to the end of deer/elk/moose hunting as we know it. Why? Because these deer are constantly around America's food source and very few Americans actually hunt. They are going to demand action and that action will be forcing these populations back to their 1900 levels. In other words, the public will support measures to eradicate these populations outside of national reserves (and keep the populations within national reserves no bigger than necessary).",1588291376
"Guitar","t5_2qi79","First, to be pedantic,  all classical guitars \*are\* acoustic guitars.  The difference you want to make is between steel string acoustics and nylon string classical / flamenco acoustic guitars. 

Fender unhelpfully doesn't list dimensions for the CC-60 but it appears to be what's often referred to as a OOO or OM (Martin terminology, the OM is Orchestra Model;  the OOO is  their largest body size before the D body, Dreadnought ).    These are pretty close to the size of standard classical bodies.  

The Ortega R122 looks to be a 'standard' full size classical.   

The Fender has a scale length 7mm shorter than a standard classical,  at 643mm vs 650 standard Classical.  

So you can compare with your Fender, here are the basic body dimensions of the Ramirez 1a concert classical, which many other classicals are patterned after: 

Body length	19 1/4″

Upper bout	11 1/8″

Waist Width	9 1/4 “

Lower Bout	 14 5/8″

Body depth	3 7/8″ Upper Bout &amp; 4 3/16″ Lower Bout",1588291376

They consistently listen to the community and try to implement changes in regard to such just as well if not better than PoGo.

Over complaining is definitely unjust, but I don’t think they deserve pats on the back when after almost four years the game is only now to a fully stable state that you could call out of beta quality.",1588291376

"MonsterHunterWorld","t5_3lry9","As u/LeduanX said, it’s a rotating event quest that comes up for usually 2 weeks at a time and cycles out. Then we get Kulve Taroth for 2 weeks and that continues. 

However, the event quests on their website have been suspended due to Covid, so we’re not sure exactly when Safi will return. This has also affected title update 14.0, which was originally due in May.  

The Recon is just the tutorial for the main quest which for 99% of players requires a full hub hunting it. The reason being that you need as many people as possible to deplete the energy from each level. The sooner the energy is depleted at each level in the session, the more points you get and the quicker Safi moves on to the final area for you to slay. 

It sounds more complicated than it actually is, but [this](https://youtu.be/nXwG2svJmao) might help.

Break as many parts as possible. Go for the big-ticket parts like Back, Head, Wings first and Chest in the final area only. Legs are only 20 points so only break them when everything else is broken. The tail gives a lot of points but it has the lowest HZV and can take a lot of time to break, especially on your own. You don’t actually need to break that for max rewards anyway. 

Basically: more parts broken and more levels fully depleted in the hub = more dracolite (used to upgrade Safi weapons) and more weapons to select.",1588291376

\-OP responds by pointing out exactly how their proposals *are* incremental; some of the steps towards nationalizing incrementally are being carried out currently by local governments

\-Accuses OP of starting a legislative war by attempting to nationalize businesses at a state level. Argues that nationalizing is impossible in the current political climate

\-OP has to point out that isn't what they were arguing for, makes accusation of gaslighting

Hell if things were purely damage maybe it wouldn't be so bad. There are tons of idiots surrounding this debate parroting things like ""its just a couple % dps"", completely ignoring the extreme utility some of these offer.

Prot Paladin is a good example. The Kyrian ability is an *amazing* tanking tool. 5 Avengers shields flying out at once, each of them interrupting, silencing, and bounding like a normal one. That could do zero damage and still be a godsend in M+. 

This system, as is, will just shoehorn players not only into whatever spec they main, but also into the type of content that they typically do. 

Sure, maybe its a ""meaningful choice"", but when that choice is ""would you rather your class be fun in M+, Raids, or PvP?"", its a shitty choice to have to make.

"running","t5_2qlit","I did 4/4/48 last fall. If you’ve been running high mileage for a while the running is going to be the easy part. Fueling is moderately difficult. I would prep food before I set out so I could eat as soon as I got back. For me, easy digesting carbs like oatmeal, fruit, and things similar are best so you don’t feel heavy on the run. I’m a big protein guy and I think I probably only had 75-100g across the two days. It just didn’t agree with me while doing that much activity. 

The absolute hardest part of a challenge like that is the sleep deprivation, though it could be easier since your challenge Is only across 24 hours. I’d hit a power nap between your 1 am and 5am runs then just push to the end. I like caffeine before runs too so coffee would probably help. Good luck.",1588291379

You can hit the tab key next to any ""select *"" and it will populate all the table columns for you, table aliased and everything. 

It has intellisense for joins so after you type ""inner join [table1] on "" it will populate a list of matchable columns that can be joined from either table. It makes writing multi table queries so much easier. 

You can do cool things with result outputs such as ""Copy as IN clause"" if you want to use some values of one query as the IN clause of another. Another useful option here is ""copy as insert"".

You can type ssf and then hit tab and it will autotype ""select * from"" which might not be a big deal for most,..but my job requires me to write a fuck ton of adhoc queries so I use that all the time. 

This just scratches the surface of its capabilities but I think you get the idea and I don't want to seem like too much of a shill.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Context/disclaimer: I have a $200 keyboard

A normal keyboard works via a rubber membrane (Google it if you want to see images). The key is held up by a rubber nub, which when pressed down, provides some resistance and springs back up. It works OK, and it's cheap because the membrane can be manufactured as one big piece of rubber with a bunch of nubs on it. 

Mechanical keyboards instead use individual ""switches"" on each key. Lots of higher end laptops actually use butterfly-style (low profile) mechanical switches - if you've ever been impressed by a laptop keyboard, this is why. Mechanical is better because the feel is more consistent and less mushy (more ""spring"" to the keys). Additionally, you can customize type of switches you get; softer typers may prefer keys with less resistance, whereas harder typers (like me) like keys that I can bang on with a lot of force without them feeling weak. The type of switch also affects the haptic feedback a keypress gives you. Some even go ""click"", which some people like (I don't, so I got a silent-type switch). 

If you're a half decent typist, you notice the difference. It's up to you whether that difference is worth the price.",1588291379

"BanPitBulls","t5_3d2z7","I really don't see what you could've done different / fundamentally better, even from the most theoretically pro-pit, anti-gun stance I can take. (And I'm anti-gun ownership, so the latter comes easy to me, haha.) I'm analyzing this from a moral/ethical perspective, not a legal one. I will also assume everything you say happened as you describe it, since your lawyer won the case.

The police wouldn't come; two animal catchers wouldn't come. Out of interest: did they say why no pitbulls? Do they consider them too dangerous/too legally complicated/...? So, you did your duty of attempting to place this matter into the correct hands, i.e. executive power of the state and people who are professionals in catching animals. The next best option would be to somehow get them to leave you. We all know how pit types can be when they have found a victim they want to hunt down, so we can exclude this option.

The **next** moral duty then would be - imo - self-defense, in this case expanded self-defense to defend others, the cats, who seem to be in danger. The preferable course would be to eliminate the dogs' danger while keeping them alive... shooting their legs or something like that. This is virtually impossible with a target like a pit type. Since you cannot make reasonably sure that you will only incapacitate them, and since they were, for all appearances, stray dogs - which excludes the possibility of their owner coming and quickly ending the dangerous situation - the better method would be to attack with the intent to kill as quickly and painlessly as possible. Guns are better than all other things in your household for that, and you have a license, so I see no problem in you using a rifle either.

You were cooperative (you called the police back...!) so I do not see why it was necessary to detain you for this, wtf, what an abuse of power. (Unless you have some history of fleeing the country if not detained... but I think we can assume that's not the case.) You obviously did not pose a threat to the public - only to threatening dogs after attempting three other options of dealing with them. I'm sorry, I don't see how this would make you a public danger... The only thing I can kind of understand is seizing the guns, as the case was still pending and it was not entirely clear to the legal system that you were in the right. As a risk-minimizing legal mechanism, that's fine, I suppose. However, in that case, they should be given back the very day of the successful trial. I know it's likely not like that because bureaucracy takes a long while, but still - that's unjust.

The charges don't seem just either. Apart from the noise violation, which, lmao - well, you obviously did violate noise limits, but that should be completely okay if there's a good reason for this, which you obviously, obviously had - they seem very blown out of the proportion. Improper handling of animal remains? Well, you called the cops! What else do they expect you to do?! You could have avoided the other charges by not using guns and rather another weapon, but... Morally, I would expect a person in that exact situation to make sure the dogs' death is quick and painless - that would be the *only* duty towards the aggressor in that case. And *that* is best achieved by using guns, which are in your legal possession. Did they expect you to swing at the dogs with a bat?! Come on. That is less humane for the dogs and puts you at added risk. It was the most humane option to use guns, for both your own safety and the dogs.

tl;dr: Moral analysis of the case, no idea what OP could've done better,  even if one wants to take a very pro-pit stance.

&gt; WASHINGTON - The top U.S. spy agency said for the first time on Thursday the American intelligence community believes the COVID-19 virus that originated in China was not manmade or genetically modified.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,&amp;quot; the Office of Director of National Intelligence said in a statement.

&gt; U.S. officials familiar with intelligence reporting and analysis have said for weeks they do not believe conspiracy theories that Chinese scientists developed the coronavirus in a government biological weapons lab from which it then escaped.

Characters in fiction can say things you disagree with and you can say ""i disagree with this character"", but it doesn't always mean it's some slight against the fanbase, sometimes, they know that people wont like this and use that to make a character unlikeable on purpose.

If suddenly every character in star wars was saying this, then yeah i can see you coming to your conclusions, but literally one movie said ""hey Luke isn't perfect and is still dealing with some shit"" and people take it as if there is some sort of character assassination going on which i really don't believe in.",1588291381

"HardcoreHentaiBondage","t5_2vdbv","An attempt to challenge the law was brought to the Supreme Court in 2010 by Dwight Whorley after comic collector Christopher Handley was tried for the possession of lolicon manga. The court dropped the charges for possession of lolicon manga, but still prosecuted him under broader obscenity charges. The Supreme court denied to challenge the law by dropping charges before that could happen, so drawn pornography of minors is still illegal.

It is believed that freedom of artistic expression protects lolicon and shotacon works, and that's partially why it's so rare for law enforcement or courts to make a real attempt at pressing charges. If they try to nail someone for the possession of drawn pornography alone, it will likely end with the law being deemed unconstitutional. So they never bother, and it remains in the books that it is illegal. Whenever they've nailed someone for the possession of drawn pornography of minors in the past, it's always been in combination with other charges like kidnapping or creating real CP so the charges are never appealed.


tl:dr - The Supreme Court dropped charges before they challenged the law, so it is still in effect. It's unlikely anyone will get targeted for the posession of drawn pornography of minors alone, as that opens the doors to the law being struck down. You can still be prosecuted for it, but it's only likely to happen if you've committed some other crime alongside it.


EDIT : I've done some extra digging, and it seems like the most recent case where someone was tried for drawn pornography of minors was in 2018 with the case [United States v. Eychander](https://casetext.com/case/united-states-v-eychaner-1). He ended up being charged with ""Attempted Receipt of Visual Depictions that Depict Minors Engaging in Sexually Explicit Conduct and are Obscene"" (see count two in the linked court case), but that was alongside other charges like evidence tampering, destruction of evidence, and ""Penalties for Registered Sex Offender"", whatever that means. So it is still illegal, but they are only nailing people for it if it's combined with other charges.",1588291382

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","I have pondered this much.  I think this is one of the biggest issues I have with a more ""hierarchical"" church structure. It puts far too much pressure on the church leaders to live what the flock feels a ""perfect"" example.  As Christians we should all be striving to live godly and holy lives for sure.  But when someone in the church falls into sin, there is more support, grace, and the chance to be open and transparent about that sin.  When a leader falls, especially in a church setting where they are held to a higher standard AND their paycheck and family's well being is tied to that as well, there is very little chance the leader will choose to be open and transparent when they fall.  Plus, the way the church puts their leaders up on that pedestal causes many in the church to fall too, because they are trusting in their pastor and not Christ as the perfect example to follow.

I had to hold myself back this past week and not post on someone's Facebook post.  The comment was a great one.  He simply said that we are not suppose to follow Christians, we are supposed to follow Christ.  I was thinking of ""liking"" it and commenting a big ""YES!""  When I looked at the comments there was one from one of my former associate pastors there.  As expected, he was saying, ""Well...  we leaders are actually supposed to disciple...""  I have already had some disputes with our former church about how they are more hierarchical and desire for the congregation to ""submit to the authority"" of the elders and this led to some problems.  I discern it still does.  God sees though, but it grieves me because it can lead to so many unhealthy things, specifically putting our pastors in a position of an idol to the congregation and it leads to lack of freedom from their own struggles and sins.",1588291382

I can only describe what I felt in those days as if the sky was falling down on me and the ground was rising to meet it. I was 14 at that time and left an orphan, but was adopted my maternal grandparents who were also experiencing the loss of their child. It felt soo unfair, her being very young and me being a teenager. 

For nearly a year I cried myself to to bed everyday, the year after that maybe 2-3 times a week. Its been 13 years since, and only now I feel as if I’m not shackled by my grief. I couldn’t see her picture, or talk to anyone about her lest I breakdown.   I didn’t talk to anyone, didn’t accept it and I think that is why it took so long for me to stop grieving.

And I wouldn't call funding gang units, or mental health counselling (despite the fact this is needed) a reaction to this incident, nor a viable alternative to the already inefficient ban; what you've suggested is, at best, what people of a certain ideological slant associate with gun violence. The fact of the matter is what you've recommended (except perhaps tackling smuggling operations) wouldn't have done anything to stop this massacre from happening. Mental health is but a convenient scapegoat, and gang violence is a different problem altogether. 

If you want to address problems like this one, you need to understand how violent psychopaths work, how serial killers work, and how our culture contributes to their creation. Preventative measures are the only thing we can count on because these are largely the type of people who won't go to a therapist if something feels wrong, who'll take every precaution to hide what they're doing from loved ones and people close to them, who glorify-- and, no one likes hearing this but, especially when it's far right-- political violence, and ultimately seek to make some sort of impact with their actions which to them feels satisfying. But, again, no one wants to have that discussion. The idea that anyone's political sensibilities could be tied up in murder makes people feel shitty, and we like thinking we can believe whatever we like with no real world consequences.",1588291385

"FinalFantasyXII","t5_2uwc8","A good setup is for 1 character to have 
Foe: &gt;=90% -&gt; Steal (make sure this character is your party leader)
And for another to have 
For: &gt;=90% -&gt; Attack 

This causes your party leader to steal only while the enemy health is above 90% and the second character brings enemies down to 90%. This gives the party leader 2ish chances to steal an item. You probably want to turn this gambit off during certain boss fights (especially late game where bosses start having invulnerability until certain targets are dead or summon additional enemies as the fight goes on) 

Also, for reference when you reach it, without spoilers, when you get to the next ‘major’ part of the game (you will 100% know when you get there), the enemies there are great to grind out since you can cause them to spawn quickly and they can be chained for extra loot.

&gt;To get an idea, I am 5'4, 135 lbs
To be honest, I'm a bit taller and weigh a bit less so I'm assuming you're a bit chubby. It would do you a lot of good to start a workout routine. HIIT workouts are amazing because you can do a short YouTube video and the after burn (calories) is great with HIIT. Free. No need to leave your home. Very short. You can do one in under ten minute. No excuses. 


&gt; I have a big head, extremely dry unkempt hair
Try the Curly Girl method r/curlygirl can help. Since you're black - a good start might be Shea Moisture. They are CGM approved and VERY moisturizing. Theye aimed at black peoples hair. They have a great deep conditoning mask and a leave in conditioner. Deep condition once a week. Put leave in product in every day.

&gt;uneven skin all over my face and body

Check out r/skincareaddiction - they have resources to help you with a skincare routine. Make sure to get a good lotion for the face so your face isnt dehydrated. I really like CeraVe's daily lotion. Its pretty inexpensive and is am excellent lotion. For the texture - definitely ask r/skincare addiction for help!


&gt;a large yet masculine looking forehead, big eyes with tiny irises, which makes me look scary and mean

When  you visit your hair stylist - ask about fringe/bangs if that's a possibility. I also have a larger forehead and the fringe goes a long way. Its also been shown that fringe makes you look younger and softer 

&gt;curly eyelashes (the only good thing about my face)
Put on some mascara then to bring these babies out!

&gt;bushy straight thick eyebrows
You should get a wax to shape them at a salon / spa and purchase a pair of tweezers so you can clean them up yourself between visits. An eyebrow tweeze near me costs around $10. Not sure what it costs near you though.

&gt;a long nose with huge nostrils, slightly big, unevenly and weirdly shaped lips,

This is out of your control though I'm doubtful your lip shape is really all that bad - when you do your makeup - draw the attention to your eyes instead. Theres nothing you can do about these features unless you get surgery so its best to just use makeup to enhance the features you do like and just be easy on the rest.


 &gt;above average but slightly sagging breasts, a protruding belly (I gain weight here), average legs, a small butt

Men care about NONE of these things. ALL breasts are acceptable. There are HUGE women with men. But if the big belly is that bothersome then start cutting back your calories a bit and/or getting some exercise. Stop making excuses and just DO IT. FORCE YOURSELF. 

As for the booty - check out Bodibiday at home booty workouts. No equipment and its free on YouTube. You just need to actually DO IT.

Seriously, though. Think about it for 2 seconds. Just use logic, like this sub say they're so good at. 

Viking, as a word, didn't even exist back then. Come on, mate. 

It was a group of tribal raiders, who went up on their boats and traveled pretty far to trade and plunder. 

There's ""Evidence"" of Viking activity as far south as [South America](https://snr.org.uk/snr-forum/topic/the-danish-viking-presence-in-south-america-1000-c-1250/), for god's sake. They raided Nigeria. 

Plus, on my *snark*, in case you missed it, I said that Blacks moved around. That means that their presence was noted as far as Spain, which there is more than ample ""evidence"" of. There's also more than ample evidence that Vikings raided Spain, Portugal, the Balearic Islands,  etc. 

You really need photographic evidence of a White Norse dabbing it up with a Black guy in order to make it ""reasonably plausible"" that there were Blacks among the Vikings? 

Nobody said the Vikings themselves were Black. All I'm saying is that there almost certainly were a couple of them working them boats.

Yes there's a shop, it's not obtrusive at all and the bonuses are really not at all necessary. Levelling is very organic and if you're playing and exploring you will be hugely overlevelled on no time.

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Im a woman, and it’s interesting to hear a guy say this, because I’ve always had this experience too. Dudes will initiate by saying something, or just touching my butt or whatever. Then it’s i blow them, and then we have sex. It’s definitely frustrating to not feel ready to go, or like your excitement matters. Or as if you are responsible for your OWN excitement. Ugh. 

What’s worked for me to change that (beyond an initial convo) is to just sloooow it down. All parts of it, not just the ones that are about me lol. 

While kissing you can move her hands around a bit (gently). Or pull back a bit and make her come to you. After you go down on her roll to the side and lay on your back. You can still touch her a bit, but the ball is in her court in a sense with you being passive for a second. I think of this as ‘leaving some space,’ without shutting things down. Just slowing the momentum so the other person has to pick it back up. Maybe try touching her hair? Personally I associate someone playing with my hair with blowjobs, so could work for others maybe (don’t push her head down though... super rude). Or if she sits up/rolls over to you at all you can her guide her hand down, and she’ll at least get the picture.

Personally, I get irritated enough about having to ASK for this that it kills my mood in general and I get a chip on my shoulder for a bit. If you CAN try to work it in without the need for a convo it feels mentally nicer! But obviously open communication is the way to go if nonverbal means don’t work. 

Hope it works out for you!",1588291390

&gt; Vietnam had detected its first two cases of the new coronavirus days earlier, and the government was contacting companies with experience of medical testing for urgent help.

&gt; &amp;quot;The official said Vietnam needed to act quickly,&amp;quot; said Viet, whose medical equipment company, Viet A Corp, makes test kits and has been central to Vietnam ramping up its testing programme in response to the outbreak.

&gt; MASS QUARANTINE. Vietnam&amp;#039;s testing ramp-up took place in tandem with a thorough contact-tracing programme and the quarantine of tens of thousands of people, many of them overseas Vietnamese returning home to escape worsening outbreaks in Europe and the United States.

"lexapro","t5_31mz6","I honestly think most people who need lexapro have a lower threshold for bodily sensations, our fight or flight response activates much more easily than most people. Hence why we are most easily upset by worry, more easily panicked, in general are more highly sensitive. A consistent thing I see on this board is people who are incredibly freaked by reactions to a small dose of lexapro. Some may be due to the drug, some may be psychosomatic, and some may be your ability to hyper-focus on bodily sensations.

Lexapro can absolutely be a miracle treatment but you need to accept that there’s going to be initial side effects and they most likely aren’t going to be long lasting or harmful. They also can be amplified by the type of sensitive person you are. But if you throw in the towel you may never get the benefit. My suggestion is try to calm down and realize this is part of the process. Give it a fair shot of 6-8 weeks. The next day might be totally different if you hang in there.",1588291391

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I hate to say it but I think that our politics have become so divided and tribal that there is really nothing that could significantly sway the electorate in any meaningful way. Although polling always seems to indicate ups and downs in Trump's approval ratings, at the end of the day Americans vote based on what team they align their personal views with the most. Trump bungled the pandemic response, and will continue to do so, but he is almost assured to win re-election in the fall because the narrative in the media that one side cosumes will remain always the polar opposite of the narrative in the media the other side consumes. 

This of course only adds to the fact that Joe Biden is an objectively terrible candidate with a lot of baggage that not only alienates Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, but also the progressive voters (who actually vote) that Democrats really need to wrangle in to start winning elections again. And no matter what Biden says, or what he does, progressives just don't trust Biden or the Democratic Party. This is only compounded by the fact that the recent sexual assault allegations against Biden, which are seemingly credible, wouldn't necessarily alienate Republicans but it will definitely alienate progressives and entrench the Republican view that Democrats are out to get them with their ""deep state"" and they are hypocrites after the spectacle with Kavanaugh.

For the record, I'm a far-leftist who supported Sanders but will begrudgingly vote for Biden in the fall. And nothing will change my mind because the only viable alternative is Donald Trump, who I think is patently unfit for office. But the Democratic Party is increasingly non-viable for the presidency and the Republican Party benefits from the intense infighting that happens there.

The only outcome I foresee is a Trump re-election, a hard-fought but slim majority for Democrats in the Senate (though I think a 50-50 split is more possible than it's ever been), and a relatively unchanged partisan composition of the House, with Democrats not losing their majority but it narrowing. 

Needless to say the next 6 months and the next 4 years are going to be a harrowing experience for the political climate in the US, the most harrowing since the Civil War (but not quite that intense, I don't think), especially as we head into an extremely deep global recession/possible depression.",1588291391

Operation ~~Fortunate~~ [Eldest Son](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Eldest_Son) involved taking a single round out of a case of ammunition, pulling the bullet, dumping the powder and fill it to capacity with high explosive.  Special Ops would drop one resealed case when they come across an enemy weapons cache and the result is an enemy eventually chambering and firing the modified round causing an extreme failure of the firearm.  It would most likely main or kill the shooter.  

The aim wasn't to take out enemy combatants from the inside, but instill a sense of doubt in the quality of the firearms and ammunition they were using.  They would pepper caches with anywhere between 1 per 25k-250k rounds, no more than one per case to make it hard to trace.  PsyOps if you will.

If you're in the mood for an audio book, one of my books that just came out today, [How to Defeat a Demon King in Ten Easy Steps](https://www.audible.com/pd/How-to-Defeat-a-Demon-King-in-Ten-Easy-Steps-Audiobook/B086R2N27Y), also has ""the main character isn't the chosen one"" as a premise. It's an Audible Original, so if you're eligible for Original Member Benefits, it should be *free* right now.

This book is my loving and comedic homage to NES games like the original *Zelda*, *Final Fantasy*, and *Dragon Quest*. You've seen a lot of those influences in my previous works, but this one gets more into parody territory. It's a lighthearted LitRPG with a lot of references to those works, as well as some gamier stuff that may feel a little more D&amp;Dish. It plays with a lot of the tropes those stories created, similar to works like *Maoyuu Maou Yuusha* or *Rokka no Yuusha*.

It's a comedy, and it's about someone who is very definitely not the Chosen One going off to try to defeat the Demon King anyway. It's a bit of a parody/deconstruction.

It's very gamey - I'd consider it a LitRPG, for those of you that are familiar with the concept. This is 100% deliberate, but if you don't like game-like fiction, you may want to avoid it. (For those of you who have read *Arcane Ascension*, this is \*more\* game-like than that.)",1588291392

Richard Rohr and his notions of the cosmic Christ might be a simpler break down on this that you might find to be more digestible to you. I do question if his Christology always on point with regards to the personhood of Jesus Christ, but that might be  different conversation.

I think this is a fairly feeble excuse. Yes, film 'feels' better, I wouldn't argue with that, but there are still some pretty impressive digital 4K+ cameras/projectors out there which have remarkable image clarity. In the hands of a competent film grader, they can look just as good as something shot on 70mm.

As for seeing a film on the big screen -- there really isn't much to rival that. Something like Blade Runner 2049 (whatever, I *loved it*) was mindblowing on an IMAX screen. It's not quite the same on my laptop or TV.

I don't wish for the death of cinema. I like it as an occaisional 'experience', but I'm also not the type of movie goer who goes to watch the Marvel tentpole films (nothing against them, but I don't feel like I am missing much when watching those my laptop... I know that statement will rile some people up). Either way, Universal's decision here is an absolute no-brainer, and AMC is only hurting itself with this move.

Since his active is coupled with a buff, for my purposes it be most useful in the later stages of a dungeon anyway. Hopefully hes up for say, ragnorok dragon in colo 2. Also his buff is way handier now that arena are Debuffing us. And while claiomh offers probably way more useful time and rcv debuffs as the arenas and hard content sit right now.

I still, to this day, am mad that my mom wasn’t a black lady who was a young lady in the 60s and 70s. How come I didn’t grow up with Harold Melvin records? I heard those bass lines, saw those little houses in the videos and gangster movies, and I wanted to be in it. We were white midwestern poor, and that was so boring. 

I don’t really feel all that anymore. I love Harold Melvin (and Teddy), and I picked up the bass in 6th grade and still play today. Ready to Die is the best hip hop album in my life. I do love LA, but more of that Echo Park side of things.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;Don't just compare tflops and fail to take into account that AMD and NVIDIA will replace current SKUs

I was very careful to explain that I was comparing teraflops because both the Series X and my 5700 XT are AMD RDNA. Of *course* AMD and NVidia will go on releasing GPUs, and *of course* PCs will outclass consoles for a little more money later on (as they always do). My point was specifically about the console launch.  

&gt;the consoles will sit on the lower end to mid-tier at best

Seriously? Digital Foundry [saw performance comparable to a 2080 Ti](https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2020-inside-xbox-series-x-full-specs) on *Gears 5*. You think a console that can match an RTX 2080 Ti will be ""low to mid-tier"" at *launch*? I know AMD and NVidia will react competitively to the consoles -- that was a key part of my original reply -- but since when does the very next line-up of cards make the last lineup's godlike $1K GPU performance ""low or mid-tier""? That just does not happen. The four-year-old GTX 1080 is still a $500 card. I mean, I get it -- *rara master race,* I get it -- but it observably does not happen the way you're saying it does.

&gt;The thing that will knock the 5700xt down in price is its successor,

I also don't get the point in trying to pretend that consoles have zero effect on the market or arguing over whether AMD's new card deserves the ""credit"" for disrupting prices or the consoles (which have the new AMD architecture inside them lol) do. But the great thing about this argument we'll see in a few months.",1588291394

Currently we have neither that’s why we have a 1M+ with the virus and 63K+ dead. The shutdown has helped curb the spread drastically but if we end it too early we are going to cause a lot of deaths. It has been crystal clear that half of the country does not take it serious. So even if this business opened, everyone is not going to stay distant from each other nor will they wear face masks. With no real treatment opening this place can cause the virus to spread more and kill more people. If the business owner was given a choice to open and contract the virus or stay closed I assume they will stay closed... this just seems like caring about money over people.

Both combos managed to damage a TSB. On top of which edo Minato can regenerate and use teleportation to outspeed him. Sasuke can't really out him down and he might as well never get Minato. Chances are Minato can counter Amaterasu too, as Naruto could do it using Kurama's Chakra Cloak. 

Hiruzen? Sure. I guess you can say that for him.

Tobirama? He should be way faster, has far better Chakra kneeting, has regeneration, and multiple Jutsus, such as the Infinite Explosive Tag Jutsu. It can go either way. Sasuke can't quite seal him, but Tobirama can't get through Susano'o. If Tobirama can get to Sasuke before he activates Susano'o, then it'd be his win. Would give him the Izuna treatment.

And Orochimaru can't control all. Tobirama was also someone he couldn't control. Likely Minato and Hiruzen too.",1588291395

**OpenShot Tips**  
Project Profile - The default project profile is “HD 720p 24fps”. It is best practice to always switch to your target profile before you begin editing. For example, if you are targeting 1080p 30fps, switch to that profile before you begin editing your project. Menu &gt; File &gt; Choose Profile.  
Clip Properties - The properties for an entire clip are set in its first frame, to move to that first frame select the clip and click the Previous or Next Marker orange arrows above the Timeline.

"news","t5_2qh3l","To look at just reported numbers, you would be fully correct. However.....

That first big shot of layoffs was due to stay at home orders, shuttering business that cannot be conducted under such orders. Many of those folks are not yet processed by all unemployment systems, there are still many millions to go. Those people alone will increase the numbers. But they are not alone.

You see that group was the ""knee-jerk reaction."" - Here is a thing, businesses all over the US are starting the second month of their second quarter, tomorrow. Today they are laying off people. (End of the month and closing books.) So I predict that the unemployment numbers that will go out next week will actually go up, as compared to this week. And these layoffs are not knee-jerk reactions, these layoffs are permanent. I would not be surprised to see numbers in the 5M to 6M reported next week - As long as the systems can handle the load. Which they may not be able to. In that case, all those people still lost their jobs, it's just going to take several weeks to report it. Either way - it doesn't matter if reporting can be accurate in the short term, or if we must wait for long the term to get accurate numbers, either way, those numbers will be growing. Nothing is going to stop that at this point. Businesses in every sector in the country are in triage. They are hemorrhaging cash. And payroll is the fastest, most effective way for most of them to stop that loss. It's not that they want to, it's that they must. And then, once you have enough people out of work, the downturn and even more layoffs become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Yes, parts of the economy are going to open back up. Some people will get back to work. Those are the knee-jerk folks getting back at it. But it won't be all of them. Their businesses will have less traffic, by either law or the fact that there is a significant portion of the population that does not want to be around public crowds right now. They will not need the full staff that they once did. Those people will stay unemployed.

Then comes the next wave of fun - How many of those businesses will be able to cover their rents with the reduced traffic? I would be willing to bet than many, many businesses needed to keep a packed house just to cover the costs of running the business. They will not have packed houses in the near term future. Basically, if they were on the struggle bus at full capacity, what hope do they have when they cannot fill their space greater than 50% (or 25% in many places)? Then let's talk about all the money they owe in rent. I'm sure many landlords will try to work with their tenants, however, if you don't have the money, you don't have the money. My landlord does not accept ""thoughts and prayers."" He only takes money. That's going to be the death of a crazy amount of businesses.

But wait! I'm not done yet! 

You see this economic issue is not just with one single industry. I mean, it would be absolute devastation if JUST the cruise industry got fully wiped out. (Which is has.) Now ask yourself this; You gonna take a cruise anytime soon? Get yourself quarantined on a boat for weeks and weeks when an outbreak happens? I think not. And I believe a lot of other people feel the same way. Now, think of all the business that supports that industry. From food, to merchandise, to entertainment, to fuel - ALL of those industries are reeling as well. It's not just the cruise lines that are wiped out. It's every business that depended on that industry. The same for air travel. The same for sports the industry. The same for the music industry. The casino industry. Convention industry. I could go on all day......

But wait! There is still MORE!

The reality is if a second surge happens, and it very well could, we will go back to months-long lockdowns. I don't have handy any trusted statistics on the chances of a resurge, that could overwhelm hospitals, but I do know that health officials will be monitoring this like white on rice, and the moment it looks like hospitals are going to get overrun, not actually GET overrun, but if numbers start to ***look*** like they will be overrun, it's back to lockdown. I believe, that if the US sees a second lockdown, there will be another wave of layoffs. I really don't see any way it would work out differently.

 Just because you put the sign out that you are Open For Business, doesn't mean customers will come to do that business.",1588291395

But my bathroom is visibly moldy and there’s cracks in almost all the rooms/ceilings (from really bad water damage many years ago) so I’m fairly certain there’s just mold all over my house and that’s what’s messing my immune system up lol.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

"programming","t5_2fwo","It's called [DropShock](http://drop-shock.com/).

The developer started to abandon it about 10 years ago. Updates were becoming infrequent. He asked people if he should open source the game. There are about 150~ tickets that were pushed to the game. Eventually, he started getting bored of that. He began asking people if they wanted to buy the rights to the game.

He **completely** stopped developing the game in 2013. People tried to buy the game, but eventually he decided it's too sentimental to let it go to someone else. He peaced out without saying anything to anyone. Then, he logged in April 2017 and made a tiny update and then peaced out for 3 years.

Then, out of the blue, he logs (several times) in this month (April 2020) and he essentially said he would rather let the game die than sell it to someone else and see it flourish. But he's ""so happy"" that people still like the game and play it. He agreed that if he makes $100/wk in the game, he will spend ""one hour"" to make small changes to the game that the community wants. I think it's just bullshit playing on people's nostalgia strings like that, but whatever. 

It has always been my dream to take that game and make it more than it is now. With some updates to the UI and Android/iPhone app integration, this game could be a big money maker. But given that the entire game is written in PHP/JavaScript/HTML, it would take a lot of work to get it to be compatible.

No other game fills this niche - turn-based, grid-based, control and modify your own units, build your own units, MMORPG, etc. There are games that fill part of this niche, but I haven't found a single thing that fills the entire niche.

The players don't seem to mind the game hasn't been updated in 7 years and there are currently 32 players online right now. Most of them, including myself, have been playing the game since 2005-2006.

The game was barely 5 years old when he started to abandon it. It has been abandoned (7 years) longer than it has been developed (5-6 years).",1588291398

I find him, and people like him, kind of fascinating, and since I was one of the kids on DA at the time, I had a front row seat to the shitshow. He also ruined Gravity Falls, Steven Universe and Miraculous Ladybug for me :( Korra was already a lost cause, but his art for it made me wish the show didn't even exist.

To be clear, I do kind of feel sorry for him; I was probably a little too harsh in my summary, which is on me. It's obvious that he's a very unhappy person who has dug himself into a hole and can't get back out and I am empathetic to anyone in situations like that. God knows that I've fucked my life up on more than one occasion. On the other hand, he is an angry person who lashes out at anyone he perceives as an enemy and blatantly sucks up to people he thinks have ""proven themselves,"" which makes it difficult to sympathize with him. I'd like to see him get his life back on track but it'll have to come from within. You can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.

Honestly, he should just go back to drawing inflation porn. It's a niche fetish and he could make decent money from the commissions. If he really tries, he can actually draw relatively decently; he had a Metroid fanart that was actually quite good in the early days. He could even start making a living off his art again.",1588291400

&gt; The top US spy agency has said for the first time that the country&amp;#039;s intelligence community believes the COVID-19 virus that originated in China was not man-made or genetically modified.

&gt; &amp;quot;The Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the COVID-19 virus was not man-made or genetically modified,&amp;quot; the Office of Director of National Intelligence said in a statement.

&gt; While Trump and Pompeo have made public statements speculating about the lab, a US intelligence official disputed the notion that there was any pressure on agencies to bolster a particular theory, the Associated Press reports.

1. Download the 64-bit and 32-bit dll file. It will be in a compressed zip folder. Optional: Rename both zips to 32-bit and 64-bit just in case.
2. Open both compressed zip files.
3. Open File Explorer.
4. Go to your drive you installed Windows on if you have multiple drives.
5. Go to Windows folder. or C:\\Windows. (copy and paste)
6. Drag the 64-bit version into System32 and put the 32-bit version into SysWOW64.
7. Restart your computer.
8. Reinstall the program.
9. Open the program to see if it works. If it works, Congratulations! you have fixed you computer for all games that run with d3dx9\_43.dll. If it doesn't work, wait a few days like me. If it still doesn't work, reverse ALL steps and try again. The only way to reverse dragging the .dll files is to get in the folders and delete it.",1588291402

Yes, military failure and invasions played a significant role, but you failed to mention the [financial struggles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire), [incompetent leaders](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.history.com/.amp/news/8-reasons-why-rome-fell), and [new ideals](https://www.ushistory.org/civ/6f.asp) being presented, especially Christianity. How are they related, you ask? Let me tell you. Today, [everyone's economy is doing poorly](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/brianmenickella/2020/04/08/covid-19-worldwide-the-pandemics-impact-on-the-economy-and-markets/amp/) because of COVID-19; financial struggles weren't as bad in 2017, but [postcrunk](https://twitter.com/postcrunk), the account that tweeted the above post, was probably more focused on the leader(s) and ideals. Trump was sworn in on [January 20 of 2017](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inauguration_of_Donald_Trump), and within the first 100 days, he had begun to [repeal Obamacare](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13765), [signed executive orders banning and restricting travel](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_100_days_of_Donald_Trump%27s_presidency#Pledges) from dominantly Muslim countries, and [increased efforts to deport Mexican immigrants](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_100_days_of_Donald_Trump%27s_presidency#Pledges), such as broadening the spectrum of who qualified for deportation. Finally, the new ideals. To me, the ""new"" ideals being presented to us in this time and age are equality, both race-, gender-, and sexuality-wise and different political opinions. I feel that our government and our president are seeing things in red and blue. Now, especially during this pandemic, we should set our differences aside and see each other not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans.

&gt;I'm not interested in debating with you if all you're going to do is try to excuse the behavior. 

No excuse, just qualifying and giving context. Debate should be based on at least reasonable assessment to be constructive, and reasonable assessment can hardly be reached without context.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Because these things happened. You're entitled to your own opinion, but I can't say the south vietnamese government was some innocent bystander while the US and the north did all the dirty work, as that would be a disservice to the people who died as a result of the cruelty done to them by the south.

Again, context matters. Please tell me some massacre committed by South Vietnam with even 1/100 of Ho Chi Minh's magnitude of a bloody work for a death toll, or any invasion of North Vietnam by South Vietnam during any of its 20 short years of history, I would find your assessment at least reasonable. I am waiting.

FYI, Vietnamese Commies from Northern Vietnam, supplied heavily by Commie giants Soviets and Chinese, repeatedly violated international and national treaties (Geneva Conference 1954, truce 1968, Paris Agreement 1973) to invade peaceful and prosperous South Vietnam and brutally massacred its citizens. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The vietnam war was a cruel and violent affair, and no group involved got out unscathed. Everyone got their hands dirty. Rewrite history elsewhere, because I won't participate.

Both war and peace are inevitably human choices, and for many, the offers are limited, often narrowing to having the former just to win the latter. It's one of those times that one can really say it's a dirty job but someone got to do it. Again, context matters. No history revision should even be contemplated if one is intellectually honest. By the way, where do you think South Korea would be today without USA's defending it from Commies?

Mainly, you just need to think about what combo you need ahead of time so that you can have it ready to go instead of fumbling around. 

I would encourage you to go into practice tool and see if it comes naturally. The combos are:

EQ (basic)

EWQ (root)

WEQ (slow + damage)

EEQ (speed boost)

QEQWQEQ (full DPS; the most important thing is the order to get Q resets, you do NOT need to hit the buttons faster than in the other combos). Any part of the full DPS combo can be used on its own. 

Try running around, stopping within range of a target dummy, and unloading a combo super quick before kiting away. For the full DPS combo, you can do it like QEQ (kite) WQ (kite) EQ (kite). 

Honestly, even if you're bad at it, it's a game in the end and you should play Ryze if you find him fun. That said, I have a few suggestions for what I like to play (in various roles):

\- Sion. My second favorite champ after Ryze, with very low mechanical requirements apart from Q timing. 

\- Nunu. Fairly easy champ to play, just practice the Q + smite combo and you're good. 

\- Yuumi. No explanation needed. 

\- Soraka. Harder than Yuumi, still super easy to pilot. Another pick like this is Sona. 

\- Twisted Fate (only if you can auto well). He's a pretty safe laner who can nullify a lot of lane matchups by roaming around the map. 

\- Malzahar/Lissandra. I have more experience with the latter pick. These are the great skill equalizers of midlane. 

\- Singed. I'm terrible at Singed, but I can comfortably say he has near-zero mechanical requirements. The main barrier is that a lot of people don't enjoy the playstyle.",1588291405

If vicodin worked for you OP, Kratom is pretty comparable to that.  It won't be as good, but pretty close if you find the right dose.

I'm on a relatively high dose of it compared to most, and I still only spend about $1-2 a day on it as a high estimate.  You can find kilos online for under $100, a good starting dose is 2 grams.  There is a good chance 2g isn't enough, but you want to start low because if you take too much, you will get sick, and in my experience, it's worse than typical opioid sickness.

There is a r/quittingkratom forum... I've come off doses that again, are high, for T breaks or for surgeries, because you will have a small opioid tolerance if you take this enough, but in my opinion, they blow the withdrawals out of proportion.  Suffering is relative though, so who am I to tell someone they're not in pain.

My withdrawals from long term use, begin around 24 hours last dose, until 120 hours after last dose.  Excessive yawning, runny nose, teary eyes, not diarrhea but in the bathroom a lot, and restless legs, so the same as typical opioid withdrawals, but much more minor.  Like, my legs are restless but I'm not trying to break out of my skin, or I'm sniffling but don't have ""the worst flu ever.""

Oh, and of course my hips and back hurt, but they hurt after 120 hours, they'll always hurt to a degree.

May take a week or 2 to find your sweet spot, but it's seriously a life saver for me.  It's not healthy to tout things as miracles, MJ certainly isn't a miracle for me (it helps a lot, but not like kratom), but for me, it's a godsend.  Worth a shot.

Oh, it tastes... bad, like, horrific.  I take it in capsules, which does delay the onset of it, but no matter what I tried mixing it with i can't stand it!",1588291405

* Every existing resource is wrong; the correct conversion factor is actually 1mm = .039 inch.  
* When rounding, numbers ending in 5 are always rounded down.  

For those who don't know, AutoCAD will automatically create a ""smart"" dimension block with the correct dual dimensions. We then had to explode that block, manually calculate his incorrect conversion, change the numbers, then gather up the pieces and make a new ""dumb"" block of the resulting dimension. For every dimension, on hundreds of drawings.

During April I probably put about 400+ bait in/around the pier and didn't see a single Giant Trevally, with the Giant Trevally no longer in the Southern Hemisphere as it's now May 1, I'm a bit tempted to spend the upcoming weekend playing a bit fast and loose with time, as it was the only thing I never obtained in the list of April bugs/fish, to see if I can get one. 

I've seen a lot of things about rain or nook islands providing a ""higher chance"" of rarer fish spawning (Marlin, Trevally, etc), I'm aware there's the ""big fish"" and ""shark"" islands, but apparently having it rain, or just being on a nook miles island boosts the chances of better fish. 

If rain or islands have no effect, then I know that I've just had the absolute worst luck with RNG and will just try and grind it out, but if it does boost the numbers somehow, then I can kinda aim in that general direction and hop around until I get a rainy day, hoping for the best (or for a Big fish Island to show up on my nook miles adventures). 

tl;dr, do rain or nook mile islands boost the rare fish rate, or is it a perceived thing with no basis in code. Thanks.",1588291406

Also has good synergy with Watcher's starting relic- we've all had those moments with other characters where you draw something you really need to get into play but don't have the energy to play it. With this card and a [[Miracle]], you get to do both.

"AskNYC","t5_2uqch","It was in australia too. the sections of the school were for different grades and each had a few buildings. Like the primary school shop class was just an empty double wide, it was really nice but they clearly just plopped it down on the property so they didn't have primary school kids working around band saws and drills. The school was sort of inside out. The hallways were all walking paths outdoors, bathrooms and classroom doors were all on the outside of the buildings so the shared space was easier than if the halls were interior, but even so I very rarely saw kids from the middle or high school except when some middle school boys rolled up on me sitting alone and tried to take my lunch because i'd sat within view of their playground (it was pretty snack heavy that day) And the few times I caught the HS kids spray painting the bathrooms that told me to fuck off. (jokes on them, one time i told a teacher and watched from a distance as they got caught and dragged off to the lead principals office while I waited in line for french class, don't curse at me or make me miss my bathroom break!)

I'll look into the different school types. The main character is really good at chemistry and science and wants to make something of herself. Her sister is already in medical school so a an elite school makes more sense. And she's really the sort to keep trying and work at things.",1588291406

"videos","t5_2qh1e","It's light but it's still several years of any life plans she had whatsoever wiped out, alongside all of the other consequences she'll face when she's out.  First of all, her name is incredibly well known and she's unhireable as a cop.  Maybe some psychopathic racist dipshit gets themselves elected Sheriff of some nowheresville and hires her, but I'd imagine that if/when that happens there'd be a hell of a stink.  So realistically her entire career is fucked, which means so is her retirement.  She's starting over, especially if she majored in something related to law enforcement in college.  On top of that, nobody likes hiring felons anyways.

And beyond that, what could more than 5-10 years actually do?  Don't forget, at least ostensibly our prison system is meant to be rehabilitative, not punitive.  Prison time served isn't about the crime, it's about the inmate and hopefully instilling in them some sense of just how badly they fucked up.  It's not good at that but we can still try with every conviction to make it happen.  Sentencing her to 50 years or life feels good but for a first time offender, this is the person for whom prison is most likely to have the desired effect.  Heavy sentencing for first offenders is absolutely the wrong way to go about things.

Yes, if she serves 5 years and gets parole then she's in the [bottom 20% for time served for the crime of Murder in Texas](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/tssp16.pdf) (see page 3).

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I'm just feeling in a total rut.

""Work"" from home, get absolutely nothing done because I am jumpy and cannot focus.  WFH has never suited me even for short periods, it feels like I have an arm tied behind my back and it's just *boring*.  This cannot go on; I am feeling genuinely burned out and a small victory would be for my office to reopen.  It's not completely unreasonable to suspect that there will be a productivity hit to the economy caused by people affected by lockdown fatigue and who cannot focus or work effectively from home.

The ""let's all work from home"" and ""work is something you do, not somewhere you go"" circlejerk has now gone mainstream and become even more obnoxious than usual, whereas previously it was confined to nonsense hitpieces on LinkedIn written by hippies.

Being cooped up all day has occasionally led to me feeling stressed and headachey, woolly headed and run down etc., primarily due to cabin fever, lack of fresh air and the monotony of it all.  I now think I need an eye test, place your bets on when that can happen.

Then go out in the evening for your state approved exercise (during which all social distancing is now more or less gone because people no longer care), back home to try and chill out in the same room that all your work equipment is in, knowing that soon you must go to bed and repeat the same fucking cycle.  Weekends are only of limited joy because there's nothing to do.

This is no good.  I am really getting a sense now that the government have fannied about so much that big business are announcing restart plans to see if Boris blinks first.

\-----

But one thing I *have* learned from this is how precious freedom is and how much I normally take for granted.  It is now becoming very clear what happens when that is taken away and how saddening and frustrating it is.  I am a grown adult who is arbitrarily being told what he can and cannot do by some blonde haired oaf on the TV whom I've never met.

I am now getting a stronger flavour for how truly awful it must be to serve a prison sentence, especially right now given prison regimes have tightened and most are on 23 hour lockdown due to staffing issues and trying to contain the virus.

My life of 35 years feels extremely long and I don't know anything different.  I have had a whole heap of opportunity, like to think I've done alright in life, been successful enough.

Now, imagine the same 35 years just cooped up in prison for murder and having none of the basic freedoms I have enjoyed during 35 years on the outside... it gives me the chills.  You don't even get the comparative luxury of the current lockdown measures.

I am honestly now torn about whether long prison terms are truly worth it, because there must come a point where enough is enough and the law of diminishing returns kicks in.",1588291407

So I have a number of ideas here.  First, yes missing that critical period has caused me issues.  In a way I have to prove things to myself because of it.

Miracles suck mainly due to the fact that early game you have no offensive power besides you literal weapon and you need to beat a minimun of 2 bosses to get your first offensive spell.

What I was trying to say was that while I would love to see her make a big move her current gameplay leads me to believe it’s unlikely. She can absolutely become a threat by then leading her to be taken out by fire. I actually told my fiancé that a couple weeks ago. If she becomes a threat and gets put in the FMC, with the purpose of keeping her from FTC, it would be a fitting end to her deserving winner story. It’s just that as of now she’s set up perfectly to be a goat. You’re right that it’s impossible to predict the gameplay from here on out, but we can make guesses based on what we’ve already seen. IMO while Ben/Sarah/Tony seem like the likely final 3 I think Ben is still a question mark. Tony turning on Sophie lead to Ben no longer trusting Tony. Instead of Tony voting Jeremy to gain back Ben’s trust he basically forced Ben to vote for Kim, which Ben didn’t seem too happy about. They seem to be setting up the downfall of that trio right now. Once someone becomes a threat to Tony they have to go and with Ben no longer trusting Tony he’s starting to become a threat. Obviously I could be totally wrong it’s just how I see it right now. I honestly don’t see Ben making it to the end.",1588291407

Assuming you go with Kickstarter, where great deals are expected, I would avoid releasing the PDF for free until a while after the Kickstarter. This assumes the fundraising was a success.

Edit: I spaced and gave you an opinion on why it’s important without saying when.

Releasing parts of it are important throughout the whole process.

You’re going to want to match the seat on the pad to the tone hole. These palm keys are usually pretty sturdy but I cannot stress enough to GO SLOW. Use your thumb against the wall of the key, mid way between the hinge tube and the key cup. Little pressure at first, check to see if the seat matches the tone hole.

They talked to a Google spokesperson about the diffrent rate of discharge.

A Google spokesperson said that this behavior is expected. “Because the two earbuds serve different functions at different times to maximize battery, one earbud may consume more battery than the other. The algorithm monitors the state on both earbuds and can switch either earbud to support more power hungry functions, while intelligently prioritizing high quality connectivity and playback performance,” Google told The Verge by email. “On voice calls, the algorithm is more conservative to avoid any dropped audio. So while a difference may be noticeable after a long call, if you switch to streaming audio or other functions after, you will likely see the battery level out.”",1588291410

"kotakuinaction2","t5_3400v","I guess that sounds simple, but I think in reality solving those problems are very difficult just due to the nature of human beings.  I think right wing people in general are better at solving that stuff - in reference to the Naughty Dog thing going on, there were lots of people inside who were unhappy about he direction the game was taking, probably thought it was opposite to their personal beliefs, or just a bad move in general because of the political climate - but they still did their jobs.  Left wing people have a much harder time doing that in my opinion - they’ll argue to death, start drama, quit for their beliefs no matter how rational or irrational.

Solving crunch is something I don’t understand much either.  It should all be planning, but I guess like battle, plans kind of go out the window when stuff starts happening.  Better planning and adherence would be part of it, but the game development cycle these days, especially for the bigger games, can take too many years - that’s something really difficult to manage, especially when you’re going into the third or fourth or fifth year.  While managing expectations, containing leaks, drama, etc.  I think that’s why people are generally OK with “Hey, we’re delaying the release four months, it’s not quite going to be ready on time.”  We understand that (and sometimes it gets used as an excuse to cover up other problems, which makes us feel taken advantage of or lied to).  

I have no clue how you solve getting rid of bad actors today.  You can get rid of people for doing illegal stuff, but barring that, it’s all a mess, more so now than ever before.  It’s one of the reasons identity politics is so rancid and toxic, and you know it’s rancid and toxic, but removing people trying to put serious identity politics just garners bad press to a large degree - honestly, there aren’t that many people I find outside of our niches who are “in the know” and care enough.  They just want fun games, if the game isn’t fun and entertaining, that’s really all that matters to them - not the why.  They don’t care that there was a clique of SJWs who pushed out an amazing writer who didn’t agree with them, or got a lead dev to change things to their liking so they don’t get fired.  It’s the equivalent of inside baseball to them, and they don’t care (which is totally fine and understandable, but fucking frustrating).  Voting with your wallet is the best way, so in that sense, they’re strong allies - they won’t by shit, and if SJWs keep producing shit, eventually they’re going to run out of money.  Christ though, I mean, look at Kathleen Kennedy.  If Disney can’t get rid of her, wtf do I expect from Naughty Dog?",1588291410

*****
&gt; Economic lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic look set to cut global energy demand and carbon dioxide emissions by record amounts, says the International Energy Agency.

&gt; Global energy demand could slump by six per cent in 2020 due to the restrictions placed on homes and industry in what would be the largest contraction in absolute terms on record, according to the Paris-based agency, which advises industrialised nations on energy issues.

&gt; The slump would lead to a drop in carbon dioxide emissions of eight per cent, six times larger than the biggest fall of 400 million tonnes recorded in 2009 following the global financial crisis.

"smallbusiness","t5_2qr34","Applied with SunTrust (Truist) 4/5. Got nowhere fast. Applied with Amex at the end of last week, signed the Docusign a day or so later. App # 8\*\*\*. A couple of generic emails back from them, submitting to SBA, etc. Then SunTrust calls me today and says the SBA rejected their PPP because the SBA has already issued a number to another lender. Shortly after, I get an email from Bluevine (the other lender I applied with only yesterday) saying their PPP was rejected for the same reason. So this had me thinking Amex had to be the lender that got their PPP through the door first. I called them up, no hold time, helpful guy, he said my PPP had gone to SBA, been processed with them and is approved. I explained that the Amex PPP portal still says PENDING but he said just wait because Amex will be in touch with docs to sign and the portal will update at some point. I guess they are focusing on getting the PPP's into the SBA first, get them approved, then deal with the rest of the work after that. A couple of minutes ago I just got an email that says...

We have received confirmation from the Small Business Administration (SBA) that your application was successfully submitted. We will contact you via email and/or phone with next steps.

So Amex seems to have done well. Anyone still waiting, I suggest filing a PPP with Bluevine. Took me a few minutes to complete the PPP app, then they submitted to SBA in 5 minutes (5 minutes!) and today they said it had already gone through SBA. Yes, it was rejected because Amex got there first, but proof Bluevine did the whole process 100% in less than 24hrs! By the way, I am thinking Amex only took about 10,000 PPP apps because they shut down the site after a friend of mine applied App # 9\*\*\*.",1588291412

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Here's an unpopular opinion:

I got my z270-E mobo a few years ago because it had built-in wifi and I didn't want to buy another PCI-E card to have WIFI. It's really not as bad as people make it out to be as game lag for me has usually been an issue with ISPs more than WIFI; I even did tests with ethernet vs. WIFI and issues more often than not a factor of ISP network latency rather than WIFI. Later on, I moved to a new apartment that didn't let me run a line so I'm stuck with using WIFI.

If you have the option to run an ethernet port to your PC, do it... no questions asked, but it's not the worst idea to get a mobo with it built-in to save some space.

With that being said, a USB adapter does let you use it for your next upgrade so that's something to consider.

Unlike the movies, Norse funerals have the body cremated first before placed onto the ship. Assuming you have the right permits, you too can dispose of cremated ashes in the water, and you might even be able to set fire to a small raft with the cremated ashes and a few personal trinkets on top. The matter of cremation is done in a pyre which is outdoor cremation. You will have to look up places that offer that in your area.

You will have to talk with local officials and funeral service providers to make sure you’re  meeting all local regulations regarding safe body disposal. Contamination issues and fire hazards have to be kept in mind. You also need a lawyer to help with your will which will explain how your body is to be buried or in this case cremated and spread out in a body of water.

"askMRP","t5_39iug","*LTR for 13 years, married for 12 years. 3 children between 3 and 11. Secure environment with big house, good jobs, etc. Looking from the outside, everything seems perfect.*
- Lifts and stats not included. Listed literally all beta qualities. 

“*Problems:*

*Passion deteriorated over the years. Life with 3 children is demanding. For more than 10 years, there's almost constantly a baby/infant in our bedroom at night. Before child no. 3, we at least had sex once a week (more or less scheduled). Since then, no sex for 3 years. Wife always was ""tired"", ""not feeling well"", ""not in the mood"".*
- Life with 3 kids is demanding? Welcome to life. On top of this, you should have planned this before you jumped all in to the deep end. But you didn’t plan. The child in the bed, against your wishes, is a result of your lack of leadership and setting boundaries in the house. You wife is okay with it, because this serves as a barrier between you two so she doesn’t have to fuck you. 

“*Half a year ago, she started working out. Lost lots of pounds. Got in great shape (contrary to me...). At the same time, we managed to get the little one into a separate room at night. Sex life was better than ever. In certain weeks almost daily.*”
- She started working out and got hot. She got into great shape to test the SMP and to establish plates/ a potential branch swing. That branch swing attempt failed, resulting in her hysterical bonding.. hence the sex being “better than ever” in “certain weeks”. 

“*She asked me to get in shape as well, change my clothing style, etc. I was rather reluctant, passive and had excuses for everything. I did sports regularly, but clearly not on her level.*”
- She extended an olive branch to you, giving you the chance to raise your value so she could stay with you. You were a passive, indecisive, non-assertive faggot who doesn’t “just get it” and instead; double-down on your unattractive behaviours (such as making excuses for your lack of value, inaction and laziness). 

“*That state lasted for about 2 or 3 months. I wrongly assumed that we turned around our marriage. Life seemed perfect to me, in hindsight, probably not to her. But at least, she seemed to have energy and was in a good mood for most of the time.*”
- Those 2 or 3 months consisted of you doubling-down on unattractive behaviours; solidifying in her mind that you are not the alpha she genuinely desires. 

“*About 2 months ago, however, it started to go to far. She posts her progress daily on several social channels. Almost obsessively. Mentions her kids, but not me. I guess working out while raising kids emphasizes her image as a powerful woman (which she clearly is). She made it clear that this is her private space to connect to the world and I should stay out of this.*”
- Attention is the coin of the realm in girl world. She started to receive some as a result of her increased hotness and wants more. “Daily. Almost obsessively”. “Her image as a powerful woman (which she clearly is)”. You are putting your wife on a pedestal and making her into the prize. YOU must be higher value than she is. How can you accomplish this when you bow at her feet, give her praise, and allow her to cheat on your ass. You are the beta. She wants you out of that world because if you read her DM’s (recruiting center for Chad, aka your replacement), you may threaten to leave her, and you would be a liability to her sense of security (since security and comfort is all that you provide). 

“*The other guy:”*
- No shit.

“*I found out that she goes running with a guy she knows from the gym for like 6 weeks (1-2 a week). She lied about this to me (""a girl from the gym""). I don't think she physically cheats (of course, I don't know). First, there's simply no time for that in her life. Almost always children around her. Second, we track each other with an app and can see where the other one is. And when she's away, she clearly \*is\* running. But she admitted last month, that she has ""a little crush"" on him and needs a little distraction from this whole family mess/prison she is in since about a decade ago. It's not only about me, but the whold family chores/situation. Caring for the children is extremely exhausing for her. She does this for more than a decade and needs to have a break from that.*”
- She finally let you in on a potential branch-swing to Chad. She is testing to see your reaction. Will you put your foot down, state and enforce a boundary? Or will you be *passive* , just as she knows you to predictably be? “She admitted she has little crush on him”, so she fucked him and you’re getting the trickle-truth. Next week, she’ll tell you about the time they kissed and more truth about their relationship will be revealed to you, incrementally, over time. “She needs a distraction” is her attempting to hamster that she needs a break from the beta and lack of leadership in the household, by getting her holes filled by a man who’s in charge and attractive (Chad) every Tuesday and Thursday evening “running” session. “Caring for the children is extremely exhausting for her” is your beta NiceGuyTM excuse for offloading responsibility/accountability and excusing her indiscretions. You don’t want the responsibility of enforcing the boundary, and holding her accountable. On top of this, you currently are not a man of value (besides for providing a pay-check (and “safe, secure environments”), that even if you did enforce the boundary she still wouldn’t care. 

“*I'm embarassed that over the last decade, I have degenerated into a beta faggot. Putting the happiness of my wife in the center of my life (without actually achieving it). Making life-altering choices, because I thouhgt that it would please her. Everything you read about betas, I did it. She, on the other hand, clearly was a master of framing right from the outset. Made sure she had her plates. Never apologizes. Always held smalltalk-connection to her ex-partners via social networks (downplaying that to me). I, on the other side, was always fully commited to her, which made me the needy one.*”

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","It would strongly depend on what you think ""socialism"" means, as you give examples of literal communism (which would never work as it is an utopian concept) and then confront them with Bernie's ideas which have really nothing to do with socialism, but rather with social welfare.  


&gt; I have always thought what if there is someone who has tirelessly worked to Accumulate their wealth and then socialism comes along and takes it all away. However I understand how we should all take care of our fellow citizens I don’t want my money to go to someone who has never worked a day in their life. 

There will always be fringe cases. If you go full capitalism, there will be people hurt by it by no fault of their own and when you go with major social policies, there will be leeches on society.  


However, those two are not equal. Leeches aren't a major part of society and keeping them on social with would actually benefit all. If they can lazy because they ""cheat"" the goverment by exploiting the state then it means that they will not exploit other people. Their children may easily be made into fully functioning adults and with social safety net can go away from their parents ways. For a society it's a net positive as you keep leeches fed on bare minimum and you can help their kids be more than leeches.  


&gt;  A quote that I think describes socialism well is by Margaret Thatcher ""is that you will eventually run out of other people’s money"". When you take from the rich they are not gonna want to be incentivised to go make more money. 

It does not work like that. If you have 1000$/month then 50$ mean much to you. If you have 5000$/month it means less. And if you have 15000$/month then 50$ is barely noticeable. The trick is to find a balance and tax rich higher, but repay them with good opportunities and society.  


Reasoning for Thacher words was simple - she saw causes of socialism which aimed for redistribution of wealth ""robin hood"" style. And that style would cause rich to flee, while a reasonable policy of ""you amassed such wealth that paying more would not hurt you, so we will have you pay more - here are reasons why it will benefit you"" will make them pay and enjoy the society.",1588291415

Thanks!  You just proved to everyone  that you make claims that you know you have no basis for making. You neither know me , my age or  my credentials. So claiming you do just marks you out as fraudulent and untrustworthy. It proves You'll claim anything to save face.

Try something else less transparent.  . Anyone can claim expertise on an anonymous online  forum  after showing they don't have it.

&gt;In any company that has more than a couple of dozen people, managers who grab projects from other teams in the same company get shown the door. 

Irrelevant. That has nothing to do with the issue you raised in your OP. You are just moving the goalposts because the premise that  IS in your Op has been dismantled. 

&gt;The same happens to people who delete their files from the Git repository became they've moved to the manager who grabbed it (leaving aside how difficult it is to do that with Git) These issues don't always come up at tiny companies

Again Irrelevant. If your Op stated that the  runnings of that   business were irregular I would have agreed.  That wasn't your point. It was that coding wouldn't begin for many weeks.   You are clueless and everything you have written  indicates you are.

You can claim to have worked anywhere and claimed I have worked at small companies because a claim is  worth  a  half a penny on reddit. Instead you have demonstrated you have no idea where the technology presently is and the issues involved. Why? Because you can't fake knowing.

&gt;Agreed, for something like Chirp, you'd want a proof of feasibility early. 

Glad you  finally figured that out. 

&gt;My impression was that the product would require a reasonably good view of the subject to do an identification. I may have missed something.

or better yet you missed everything. Such an app would have to work in all kinds of setting with all kinds of different lighting and on multiple  phone cameras. Unlike displaying text or image - image analysis has to take the  varied qualities of the images into account

&gt;If they were talking about identifying people in a crowd, yes, that would be excessively difficult, but I don't recall that being mentioned

so let me get this straight you think an app where the people would have to  step out and stand my themselves would be practical and useful in umm real life  situation?  You are funny.

&gt;Various cameras? We're talking about just the cell phone camera, aren't we?

and you are of the opinion that all phones have the same camera in them?    How many ways are you going to prove you are clueless of whats involved?. 

&gt;Real-time facial recognition is under development, even if it's not on the shelf yet

They are already ""on the shelves"". Thats  why I know the issue involved unlike yourself just pulling things out of your ear.   They are designed to work on standardized cameras, usually only have a few possible  faces to identify and have been hit and miss based on lighting (especially prone to fail with people of color) As is becoming your habit you missed the point entirely. Its not that face recognition perse  is impossible but that the technology isn't there yet to work under the conditions the chirp would need it to work under.

Your cloud based system suggestion obviously wouldn't work either.  You would need  to send a high definition image to  a server , It would have to then analyze the image and isolate the  part of the image snapped  to a prexisting  saved image, then send the data back to the  phone and the phone would then have to have voice assist whisper the name to you - ALL IN ABOUT 2 SECONDS IT TAKES For a person to present themselves to the user.   Not even using 5g will that happen and especially not a public system with tens of thousands if not millions using the system

The chirp is OBVIOUSLY meant to be a fictional app not a serious proposal of whats possible. Your suggestion would just make the show even more unbelievable.

&gt;ou come across as having a desperate need to prove yourself a top expert where you aren't.

nope. It I wanted to  show myself a top expert I'd go to a programming sub where there are experts that I could be ""top"" over. You are just angry   because anyone who knows modern  programming can dismantle your claims. I don't need to be a top expert to  unmask someone pretending to be a modern developer.  

You directly stated that the show runners  either didn't bring in a consultant and/or  didn't listen and yes that would have been dumb if they  set their story with programmers. They obviously did but the show takes license because its not about the  CLEARLY  fictional app capabilities.",1588291418

The basic gist is, there’s two secret organizations that have been in conflict since ancient times, fighting for control of both the world and also technological pseudo-magical artifacts from a pre-human race. 

One side is the Templar Order - Goal? Complete control of the human race. Upside? No war, humanity pulling as one. Downside? No freedom, complete authoritarianism. [Edit] I mean **COMPLETE** authoritarianism. As in, keep control by using said technological pseudo-magical artifacts to mass-brainwash/mind control **ALL OF HUMANITY**.

The other? The Brotherhood of Assassins. Their goal? Thwart the Templars, and allow humanity to chart its own course. Upside? Freedom. Downside? Well, look at how life is,and how a lot of bad people choose to use that freedom.

Odyssey has almost nothing to do with this conflict since it takes place before the Assassins were formed and the group that would become the Templars is still new.",1588291418

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt;  **Article:**

Liberals and their media friends assert that GOP governors will have blood on their hands if they ease their coronavirus economic shutdowns. Don’t look now, but even a couple of Democratic governors are making plans to reopen.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis quietly let his state’s stay-at-home order expire last weekend. Retail curb-side deliveries are now allowed, and personal services like hair salons will be given an all-clear on Friday. Mr. Polis says he hopes to let bars, restaurants and clubs open by mid-May if the health-care system isn’t stressed.

Recall the initial aim of state lockdowns was to flatten the infection curve and ease pressure on hospitals—not eradicate the virus—which Colorado and most states have achieved. Nearly 15,000 Coloradans have been infected, and 2,700 have been hospitalized at some point. But only 960 people are currently hospitalized, and the state has nearly 5,000 available beds.

Mr. Polis is accepting that most people will probably get infected without a vaccine breakthrough. “Basically this is a really tricky balance between trying to continue to keep the disease transmission at a level at which it won’t overwhelm our hospital systems and allow people to still try and earn a living, frankly,” said Jill Hunsaker Ryan, executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.

The bet is that Colorado has a relatively young and healthy population, so most probably won’t get severely ill. Meanwhile, restaurants and other hospitality businesses risk getting crushed if the shutdowns bleed into the summer months.

The same is true in Rhode Island, which was one of the slowest states to recover from the 2008-2009 financial panic and now has half of its hotel and restaurant workers unemployed. Which may be why Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo—who directed the National Guard to enforce a 14-day quarantine on New Yorkers entering the state—is now preparing to reopen.

Her plan is to first open parks on May 9 and then gradually allow some child-care centers, barbers and dine-in restaurants to operate if they follow social distancing guidelines. Hospitalizations in Rhode Island have been flat for two weeks, and nearly three-quarters of fatalities have been nursing home residents.

Like Mr. Polis, Ms. Raimondo is accepting the reality that the coronavirus will be with us for some time, and the state needs to focus on protecting the vulnerable while mitigating stress on health-care providers. “Just because we may reopen the economy with the stay-at-home order doesn’t mean people are going to stop getting sick,” she said recently.

Note that their plans for phased-in reopenings are similar to approaches that GOP governors in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Tennessee are taking. But the Republicans have been denounced even though many areas in their states have had few fatalities, and hospitals aren’t being overwhelmed.

This is true of most states outside of the Northeast. California’s per-capita death rate is more than 95% lower than New York’s. San Francisco in the last two months has recorded 25 deaths, less than the number of drug overdoses in a single month last year. Los Angeles accounts for half of the state’s deaths, and almost half of those were nursing-home residents and prisoners.

Gov. Gavin Newsom nonetheless closed beaches in Orange County on Thursday after people flocked to them last weekend during a heat wave. Orange County’s per-capita fatality rate is among the lowest in the state, and local officials say visitors were keeping appropriate distance from one another. There’s also no evidence that people are spreading the virus through casual contact outdoors.

Every Governor will have to decide whether the health benefits to the state of keeping all businesses and workers locked down justify the escalating human and economic costs. Credit to Mr. Polis and Ms. Raimondo for bucking what seems to have become unfortunate liberal dogma about lockdowns.",1588291419

"civ","t5_2rk3b","I know that, to an extent, all nations and empires in the world were cruel at some point, and I'm not saying that Europeans were not cruel. However, the image of the Spanish Empire has been very damaged over time due to hurtful propaganda and agendas. 

I recognize that the first waves of conquerers were brutal, but that's because, well, they were conquerers. I'm not saying those atrocities weren't bad but that type of violence occurred everywhere around the world, and it was normal. So the conquest of the Americas weren't any more cruel than the Ottoman invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the Mongolian invasion of China, the Japanese invasion of Korea, or the Aztec invasion of the surrounding nations. However, even after that, and in contrast to British and Dutch colonizers, the Spanish really cared about the indigenous populations. Even if the first waves of priests were cruel and promoted the Inquisition, the next waves were in charge of protecting the indigenous from abuse. For example, when the Laws of the Indies were written, which prohibited indigenous slavery (it was actually the first declaration of human rights in the world). Also, the Spanish thought the indigenous people had souls and were capable of being Christianized unlike the British, whose colonization strategy was arriving somewhere, eliminating or displacing the Indigenous populations, sending some White colonizers and Black slaves. Rinse and repeat. 

The Spanish also let many Indigenous people live in their separate communities away from the cities if they wanted to, and they were protected there. As I stated before, the later waves of priests cared about the Indigenous populations, teaching them Spanish, reading, writing, science, literature and Catholicism. And also, there is proof that the Spanish Inquisition was not as bad as it's portrayed to be, and that the numbers of people who died from the Inquisition were purposely exaggerated by Dutch propaganda, which then spread onto all of Europe. So no, the Spanish weren't really that cruel.",1588291419

So that tweet listed Nkeal with 2.21 and looking at that link for the whole season for the top WRs in the league you can sort by their separation stat and you'll see other WRs around that 2.2 number include:

* Julio Jones
* Terry Mclaurin
* Golden Tate
* AJ Brown
* Juju

And that is just picking a couple stand outs.  Hell that site has Golladay with 1.9.  Basically I think that stat is stupid.  That isn't to say Nkeal shouldn't work on that, but I also think we threw a lot of sideline back shoulder type throws to him and those generally won't get separation.  And from what I've seen that is one of his better routes so I think we will see us continue to see that trend.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","\&gt; Did they purchase PPE? No, 

The source I literally posted in the comment you replied to showed that the government did in fact buy PPE.

\&gt; they decided to actually reduce the national stockpile 

Citation?

\&gt;  So yes, the PPE shortage is absolutely their fault. What appear to be  small instances of PPE theft don’t come near to abdicating the govt. 

You think enough PPE to equip a third of the NHS medical staff is 'small'? My god, you leftists will do anything to bitch about a non-left wing government, wont you?

Why aren't you ultimately blaming China and the WHO for their incompetence in handling the disease? Why aren't you placing any blame on them due to their coverup either?

Instead, you are pointing fingers at the government who, by and large, listened to their medical advisors and did their best.

Maybe they were advised there would be a PPE shortage, but one mistake regarding PPE does not counter all the hard work they put in that led to Britain's infection and death rates peaking and beginning to decline far earlier than most other nations.

Whats also ironic to me, is that nations that followed a herd immunity strategy (like the Tories wanted to follow initially) have done far better than us. Japan, South Korean, Japan, Taiwan, most of South East Asia, Australia, New Zealand and I think even Germany all followed the type of strategy the government wanted to do (but was shouted out of by leftists screeching about how the Tories didn't care to enact a 'sensible' strategy) and saw far better results.",1588291421

"COVID19","t5_2f4l19","&gt; This study has several limitations. The primary limitation concerns sample selection biases. Our sample may be enriched with COVID-19 participants, by selecting for individuals with a belief or curiosity concerning past infection. We discuss further and attempt to quantify the potential impact of this bias in the Additional Data and Response to Comments section. Our study may also have selected for groups of people more likely to skew our sample against COVID-19 participants. For example, our sample strategy selected for members of Santa Clara County with ready access to Facebook who viewed our advertisement early after the registration opened. Our sample ended up with an over-representation of white women between the ages of 19 and 64, and an under-representation of Hispanic and Asian populations, relative to our community. Those imbalances were partly addressed by weighting our sample by zip code, race, and sex to match the county. Our survey also selected for members of the population who were able to spare the time to drive to the testing site, which may have skewed our sample against essential workers. Our study was also limited in that it could not ascertain representativeness of SARSCoV-2 antibodies in other communities with possibly high prevalence, such as homeless populations and nursing homes. The overall direction and magnitude of these selection effects are hard to fully bound, and our estimates reflect the prevalence in our sample, weighted to match county demographics.",1588291421

"ich_iel","t5_37k29","Es steht nicht nur eine halbzeit vor uns, mit einem impfstoff ist wohl erst in ein bis zwei jahren zu rechnen. Sollen wir noch zwei weitere jahre weiter alles zumachen? Wenn wir öffnen ohne dass es einen impfstoff gibt wird es zu einer zweiten welle kommen, dass ist leider unvermeidlich. Wir haben zwei optionen, uns monatelang weiter zu verbunkern oder zu akzeptieren, dass es sich eine infektionskrankheit nun mal leider um etwas handelt was zum großteil außerhalb unser doch sehr begrenzten macht über die natur steht und wir nicht in der lage sind jeden tod durch corona zu verhindern. Die prämisse, dass wenn wir noch einen monat weiter stay home machen corona plötzlich so schnell von der welt verschwindet wie es gekommen ist ist naives wunschdenken. So hart dass klingt, corona kontrolliert über die erde wüten zu lassen bis herdenimunität herrscht oder endlich ein impfstoff entwickelt ist, ist vermutlich die beste option. Bei  40.000 infizierten mit einer mindestens dreimal so hohen dunkelziffer und dass nur in deutschland (viren machen vor grenzen keinen halt) wird corona auch in 3 monaten nicht besiegt sein, unsere wirtschaft aber komplett in trümmern liegen. Und nein wirtschaft heißt nicht nur wohlstand und geld für reiche bonzen, wirtschaft heißt überleben. Nicht jeder kann es sich leisten in seinem eigenen haus mit garten monatelang gemütlich von seinem ersparten oder homeoffice zu leben und wenn nach monatelangem lockdown irgendwann keiner mehr arbeit und geld hat, keine miete mehr zahlen kann oder lebensmittel kaufen kann hilft es einem nix seine zwangsläufig erfolgende corona infektion um ein paar monate hinausgezögert zu haben. Die weltwirtschaftskriese 2008 wurde im nachhinein mit hunderttausenden zusätzlichen toten durch ihre folgen in verbindung gebracht und wenn die corona maßnahmen wie es sich hier auf reddit die meisten wünschen noch monatelang unverändert so weiter gehen wird die daraus resultierende wirtschaftskriese die wirtschaftskriese 2007 um welten übertreffen. Ab einem gewissen punkt müssen wir wohl zwangsläufig corona tote gegen wirtschaftstote abwägen und bei einem durchschnittlichen alter von 80 jahren bei coronatoten sehe ich aus utilitaristischem standpunkt corona als das kleinere übel. Das ist hart, ist aber bittere realität. Übrigens, wenn keiner mehr was verdient gibts auch keine steuereinnahmen und kein geld für kliniken und corona sozialhilfe. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.spiegel.de/gesundheit/diagnose/krebstote-durch-finanzkrise-zusaetzlich-starben-500-000-menschen-a-1094316-

So wie die grippe wird sich corona wohl leider in die reihen der infektionskrankheiten einordnen mit denen die menschheit jedes jahr zu kämpfen hat. Dass die reproduktionszahl gerade unter 1 liegt, liegt nur am lockdown der sozialkontakte und damit die virusverbreitung temporär einschränkt, sobald der lockdown zuende ist wird die zahl sich wieder erhöhen und die corona fallzahlen wieder steigen bis herdenimunität unter der bevölkerung herrscht und die pandemie auf natürlichem wege zum erliegen kommt. Warum haben weniger leute im jahr die grippe als jetzt corona? Weil jeder in seinem leben schonmal eine grippe hatte und somit zumindest teilweise immun ist, würde die grippe heute als neue nie gesehene infektionskrankheit auftauchen wäre sie wohl ähnlich verheerend wie corona, man bedenke wie es den ureinwohnern amerikas ergangen ist als die europäischen eroberer für die atzteken nie erlebte krankheiten nach mittelamerika brachten. 

Und jetzt viel spaß beim runterwählen aber vielleicht erinnert sich in drei monaten ja jemand an diesen kommentar und ich wette, dass wenn er die aktuellen corona fallzahlen googled er sich wundern wird warum die kriese immer noch weit weg von vorbei ist und warum #stayhome das virus nicht von der erde weggezaubert hat.",1588291422

"piano","t5_2qnw8","There are many different 'grading' systems for piano music out there; I really like Jane Magrath's [Pianists Guide to Standard Teaching and Performance Literature](https://www.amazon.com/Pianists-Standard-Teaching-Performance-Literature/dp/0882846558), which uses a 1-10 scale.  By her scale, the Clementi and the Bach are both level 4s, while the Chopin is a level 6.  So I would browse the book for pieces at level 4 or 5 that look interesting.

There's also the free option of the [Piano Syllabus](http://www.pianosyllabus.com/) site, which lists difficulty ratings from a bunch of different systems.  So, if you look at the page for the [Chopin](http://www.pianosyllabus.com/detail.php?ref=2162), you'll see ratings between 4-7, as well as the site's averaged rating of 5.

You could also look for a graded repertoire collection; I like the Celebration Series a lot.  You'd probably be around [level 3](https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/title/piano-repertoire-3-sheet-music/20063169) or so?

"synthwaveproducers","t5_39rwz","As other people have expressed, it’s going to be hard to get the sounds you’re looking for all with stock plugins. Drum samples are found online if you know where to look. For pads and other various synth sounds, I strongly suggest looking into learning how to use Alchemy well — it does have a decent Virtual Analogue synthesizer, plus it has a massive amount of versatility beyond that if you ever decide to get deep into sound design. Also useful are Retro Synth (although I will say, as time has progressed, I’ve become much less impressed with the quality you can get from Retro Synth) and possibly ES2, which is less intuitive than Alchemy but also less overwhelming and probably a lot more straightforward for your purposes.

Now, while you can certainly do a *lot* with the default synths, and I do recommend learning at least a couple of them, I have to echo the recommendations to buy something like TAL UNO or uHe Diva — the difference in emulation of sound and intuitiveness is massive and will make your life much easier when writing synthwave.

But don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t pull this off with stock plugins — the Logic stock plugins are massively versatile and you can do basically anything with them if you put in the time and effort. They’re just not explicitly made for classic synth emulation (sans Retro Synth) and will be harder to work with for your purposes.",1588291422

"Catholic","t5_2qo4z","Thank you for sharing your thoughts and opening your heart. Your love for her is not wrong. It is a good thing. God made for us to love and be loved. However, as you mentioned, God made man and woman only to be married. Two women could have a loving relationship with our marriage. So can two men. But marriage is something special that God created between the two sexes to keep life going on the planet among other reasons. It sounds to me like you guys are best friends,  and it's definitely important to find someone who understands you and accepts you. But you can absolutely have this kind of relationship outside of marriage to. 

If you are truly called to marriage, God will bring into your life a man who is perfect and right for you. Just because you haven't found the right man yet doesn't mean you won't. I had my long list of things I wanted before I married my wife. And she was different than a lot of it. Of course a lot of it was shallow I admit. But the point is that God knew what I needed and gave me the person who would make me holy not necessarily the person I dreamed about my whole life.

So I would recommend a few things. One, keep a good friendship with her and communicate to her as a deep sister in Christ. Some of the saints, like St. Francis of Assisi and St. Clare of Assisi had the kind of friendship you do with your friend, they had a very deep and abiding friendship. But it never went past that and they helped bring each other toward heaven the way God would want. Two, don't base your relationships or marriage on how you feel. Base it on what God would want and the person he truly has for you. Three, if you want some support on this from people who understand and who can relate to you, I would recommend looking up [Courage.com](https://Courage.com) which is an organization of people, Christians, who struggle with same-sex attraction and you can find all the help and support you need there, ask any questions you want, and even confide in people who will never judge you.

I had a user call me because she couldn't read the text on her monitor.

Think of all the potential problems, all the things that can cause you to be unable to read the text on the monitor.  There are so many potential things that could go wrong.  Video card, cable, monitor, computer.

&amp;#x200B;

so

&amp;#x200B;

many

&amp;#x200B;

things.

&amp;#x200B;

So I get there to find she's turned the computer around so that the PSU fan is facing her, then moved the monitor as far back as it's cable would allow (not too far), then she got a second desk and moved as far away from the machine and monitor as the keyboard cable could stretch (they were the curly ones and REALLY could stretch).  She set up the keyboard and stuff on the new desk meters away from the monitor, but she couldn't see what was on the screen.  Hell, I couldn't see what was on the screen either, a large monitor in those days was 14"", these were 13"".

&amp;#x200B;

Turns out that she watched a documentary that mentioned that the monitors emitted  radiation  (they did - X-rays, but far below dangerous levels) and she felt unsafe being near the monitor.

I swear I'm not making this up.

So we got her a thin mesh anti-glare thingy and told her it was a radiation filter.  Problem solved. Mostly.  She moved the monitor so that it was facing the wall on the side of her desk, that way she wouldn't accidentally walk past the unfiltered side.  It must have hurt her neck to sit at the desk staring to the right, but she never raised that with me.

He would take credit for saving the world.

He didn't do that though. Instead he mixed up the rubbing alcohol and bleach cleaning times and put that on other treatments. He  even said ""and  can we do this in injections.'

That doesn't mean Trump isn't stupid and just endangered a bunch of lives. It means he needs to keep his mouth shut and stop talking about science he knows nothing about.  If Trump said the earth orbited the sun you would claim that is wrong.

&gt; Israeli farmers will no longer be allowed to work their fields in an enclave of southern Jordan, ending a more than 25-year arrangement meant to shore up a historic peace agreement, Jordan&amp;#039;s Foreign Ministry announced Thursday.

&gt; The announcement reflects the poor relations between the two countries, which have been underscored by Jordan&amp;#039;s vocal opposition to Israeli plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.Under their landmark 1994 peace deal, Jordan granted Israel a 25-year lease on two small areas along their border, Baqura and Ghamr.

&gt; On Thursday, Jordan joined other Arab countries in condemning Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&amp;#039;s plan to annex large parts of the West Bank, including Israel settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley.

"PsoriaticArthritis","t5_2zyfd","Generally pops are not a problem, the ankles tend to do a lot of that forever, though most people get less and less of that over time in other joints.  (the neck tends to do champagne bubbles which are generally ok as well)

The main things to watch out for are pain, pinching pain or anything nervous system related - all mobility should be done a in pain-free range of motion. That being said, some discomfort is not uncommon, and usually ok along the lines of stretching, or crampy or bunchy feelings.   If ever in doubt, or its feels sketchy, you may have gone too far - and should reduce the intensity and targeted range of motion.  But if it feels interesting or complicated but ok, you're probably ok.  

I recently answered a bit more about these sensations here:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Kinstretch/comments/g8s30i/cracking_popping_and_grinding/

If you can creep up slowly on those pops, and really try to control small amounts of movement there, and delay those sensations as long as possible, it can usually help minimize that feeling and let you acquire more control there.

I'd asked one of the instructors about hyper mobility, not for EDS specifically though - and their suggestion was to continue trying to add more control throughout the range of motion to help manage that type of joint function.  Not sure if that relates well enough to you or not - but I think having more control in joint function, particularly towards the ends of your range of motion, is always a good thing right?

I'd encourage you to continue learning CARs for all joints, but it may be preferred to limit your range of motion as you first acquire control.  Working at 1/2 or 2/3 your range of motion would more easily let you build control there, and slowly expand it outwards.  That would likely be an approach more suited towards your situation than trying to gain control at the very ends of what may be a wider than normal existing range of motion.

It may have been me posting previously, I'm trying to spread the word about how much improving function can benefit joint health, and how it can be done incrementally.  A few minutes a day over time can really add up.  Since you're talking about feet - you may also be interested in some things I've been collecting in /r/FootFunction - same concepts about getting specific function working, but focused on the feet.

Glad to hear you've started some CARs - Everyone I know who commits to a few minutes daily has found them very rewarding.",1588291424

There are a number of reasons why contracts can be invalidated in the US. I don’t see how any of them would apply to that situation, however. Both sides understood the clause (meeting of the minds), they weren’t signed under duress, and all parties were presumably of sound mind.

"spain","t5_2qhd6","Specifically, on this:

&gt; Eating animals is not a need ( no longer, at least since vegans do it and there are no health issues they are not able to overcome) Thus, you could argue that eating them is just another way of entertainment (or pleasure if you prefer). Then, when you eat a slice of ham in your house or you go to a restaurant and order a steak of beef, you are basically exchanging an animal's life for the pleausure you get eating it. This, as far as I know, is the current situation in every single developed country, in which most people have the (economic) choice to go vegan but decide to stay omnivorous.

That's, like, full of assumptions. You mention that ""most people could go vegan"", but that's just false. Most vegan stuff is quite expensive or time consuming, and a vegan diet is harder to keep up with than a normal diet. Most people don't have the time and money to follow it. It has nothing to do with ""entertainment"" (seriously, wtf) or pleasure.

***

The issue with the rest of what you mention is that you are reducing both bullfighting and industrial animal processing to ""animal dies, we eat it"", and that is leaving the main issue with bullfighting here, which is the public show of cruelty. This is not a numbers game, but the issue of having a business around a man torturing an animal (With a dim chance of the animal actually maiming or even killing the man! what a good way to spent an afternoon, right?) for the pleasure of what I can only define as a sadistic crowd.

(And just in case, yeah, bullfighting is one of the few topics I'm 100% against. For me, is not ""La fiesta nacional"", but ""La vergüenza nacional."" One of many, of course).",1588291426

One of the most interesting talking points is about school shootings, *specifically Columbine*, but the guns used in Columbine were acquired illegally by having another person purchase it for them. Unethical actions open the door to unethical means.

FDR was called a communist by all the Republicans... Social security and unemployment and disability insurance... Are all pretty socialist programs.  We would never be able to implement them today without Republicans calling them communist the way they did back then.

"TheGirlSurvivalGuide","t5_2vfzu","I've started questioning this myself during lockdown because I'm not wearing makeup most days despite feeling like I needed it before. On days were I haven't showered and I'm still in the same pajamas I've been wearing all week I do feel like a gross mess lmao. But on the days when I shower and throw on something decent I'm coming round to the idea that my makeup free face is normal and, dare I say it, attractive. Crazy that I'd normalised my makeup routine (while minimal) to be something that was needed for my face to be acceptable in society! 

You know, I've never looked at a woman not wearing makeup and thought of her as any less professional. I think we need to start being nicer to ourselves and remember that we're enough as is. I also think that the more women who embrace their natural hair or skin then the more it will be accepted. I can't say every profession/workplace will share my views though 

I do look after my skin and keep my brows and unruly hairs (random dark chin and upper lip) plucked. I think this is equivalent to a guy having to shave/keep a tidy beard so I'm cool with that.",1588291432

"AOC","t5_2sbqz","I'm okay with free college and trade schools, but the policy would have to be written very carefully to keep costs from ballooning absurd amounts. The extreme costs of tuition right now is largely because of guaranteed government backed student loans, allowing schools to charge essentially whatever they want since they'll get their money either way.

It would devalue education a bit since they'd be easier to get logistically, but things being shitty in the past doesn't mean they need to stay shitty for future generations.

I don't agree that if college and trade school were free that student debt should be forgiven because it's unfair they had to take and pay off loans. The same logic can be used to justify paying anyone who got an education, whether they have a current loan out not. ""It's unfair that I had to pay my student loans and these guys get their loans forgiven, so why can't I get that amount back?""

I don't think the comparison between student loan debt and auto loan debt or credit card debt is poor. Even though it's not a material good, an education almost always has some value in the job market. Even a poor education. Auto loans get you a rapidly depreciating asset, and credit card debt is likely going to be used on consumables that don't last long.",1588291433

Plenty of streamers and pro players jumped on the hype train and said they'd quit Fortnite to become a Valorant streamer when it released, mostly thinking their skill will somehow carry over well from one game to the other when in reality you'll get what happened to TSM_Myth the time he moved to Rainbow Six Siege.

Those streamers' followers jumped on the #RipFortnite bandwagon and started parroting it all over the place. Then other streamers saw that and jumped on it too.

My personal thoughts? Give it a few days, maybe weeks, maybe even a month from the moment Valorant releases. They'll be back.",1588291433

Same thing goes for researchers; there is no such thing as too much tech output, as there's always a next level of repeatable technology to make your fleets stronger.

One thing you didn't mention are fortresses! Fortresses provide soldier jobs, which raise your naval capacity. You can easily get thousands of extra points of naval capacity from soldiers on a big empire, and since fortresses offer a small amount of housing they're great on small planets.

"askMRP","t5_39iug","“*My goals in life: Well, providing my family with financial and social stability...*” 
- My goals in life: Lighting myself on fire to keep others warm. 

“*My past weeks:*

*When her social activities went off the scale, I began to step up as well. At least two hours of lifting, running or other activities daily. Lost more than 20 lbs. Started to be much more active, assertive etc. in my job and in my personal relationships including my marriage. I feel that I'm on a really good way. For like 12 years, I never was in that shape. And there's still room for improvement.”*
- *Read:* “Mommy validated my progress, but it’s still not enough. She says I still have plenty more hoops to jump through. Also, she’s still “running” with Chad.”

“*The present situation:*

*When I found out about that running guy 5 weeks ago (before TRP, Tomassi etc.), I told her that I don't like it. However, I would accept it, if she needs it for her mental state. I know how exhausted she is from her life. I trust her that she stays within boundaries. No physical contact. I told her that she has to be honest to me. If she goes running with him, she has to tell me. If I have the feeling that I can't trust her, my head will drive both of us crazy.*”
- You stated your boundary, but in typical NiceGuyTM fashion, softened your dialect because you don’t know what you want and are uncomfortable with delivering a no b.s., clear and concise, statement about what it is that you want.  Furthermore, you then acquiesced, by stating “I would accept it if she needs it” though. She will not follow a drunken captain. She will not submit to a man who is uncomfortable with authority, and competent enough to bear the responsibility of owning his own shit. She will not respect your boundary if she does not know, with unwavering confidence, that you would actually enforce it. She knows she can cheat and you won’t walk. She knows she can cheat and she still has her pay check. No amount of hamstering will remove what you already know to be true in regards to her indiscretions. You cannot trust her for anything other than AWALT and for her to behave as woman will. Pretending anything otherwise, is a fool’s game only he can lose. 

“*From that day on, she asked me before going running with him. Except the at least three times, she lied to me... I know that. And she knows that I know. I told her that this is not ok. She was mad at me, because she has the impression that I would observe her.*”
- You put your foot down, with a rather butt-hurt version of telling her what you think of her actions. She got mad that her beta was acting incongruently (as an alpha with stating this is not okay). Understand that you are nothing but security to her. The threat of you potentially getting up in a flash of alpha, being “done”, and walking out, is a threat to the beta side of her Hypergamy; her sense security. You are essentially telling a tight/rope walker, once in the middle of crossing the wire, that the “safety net” is being removed from below but to keep trying to cross the wire anyways. She will fight you on this. You are the safety net for when her branch swing fails, protecting her from falling to a state of one of her greatest fears: being alone. 

“*Yesterday, we had another discussion. I told her that she violated a boundary. She can't have the cake and eat it. The secure life with house and kids are not compatible with her flirting lifestyle.*”
- You can’t negotiate genuine desire. 

“*Usually, I am the one who initiates contact or says 'I love you', first. I will stop doing this. This morning, she initiated that. Told me that she loves me. Called me at work. Told me, she loves me (""really, honey!"").*” 
- Read: Skittles Man by Roissy. Also, Don’t listen to what she says, watch what she does.

“*Conclusion:*

*I think, I'm on the right path. I finally starting to take care of myself. I'm determined to become the best version of me that I can be. I realized that I have to be a true alpha male in order to lead my life and our relationship.*”
- The process of becoming a HV man, takes years of consistent effort and work, overcoming of failures, internalizing RP concepts over time. You have your head so far up your ass that you aren’t even willing to enforce a simple, yet crucial boundary in which you have set. Raising value *for you* is one thing. You should do that. But “Raising value” takes a long time. You don’t have time. Your wife is and probably has always been fucking other men. Are you okay with that? If not, Are you going to do something? Hint: and it isn’t “raising your value” aka being passive and not ACTING (walking and/or potentially filing for divorce). You’re getting cucked. It’s up to you. 

“*I don't think that, although she is on kind of a ""eat, pray, love""-trip, she is willing to give up what we have. With our children, this one is far bigger than her and me. I think, we both have the responsibility to get \*our\* shit together. And I also know that this is a process that will take some time. In her head, I'm the beta husband and it will take time to change that image.”*
- Did you take this from marriage counselling? Because this sounds like some marriage counselling bullshit. The only person you should be concerned with owning their shit is yourself. Forget her. She’s doing what she wants and you can’t control her. “Getting our shit together *together*” is all fluff. It’s an instant-dopamine rush to make you both feel better about things in the moment, when in reality actions will not change. Actions are all that matter. You will do the work, she will continue meeting your replacement, and you will continue paying the bills, and staying *together*. Nothing but stability, comfort, and security. Right where she wants you.

“*On the other hand, I don't want to be a jelous guy who is imprisoning her. And I have to take care of half of the household and children work (which is a lot). So, going on a masculine trip and leaving her alone with the daily chores is not an option. It's a thin red line.*”
- Walking on eggshells, placating to her emotions, and lack of frame.

“*My question:*

*I feel that this is a crossroads-situation. My behavior during the next weeks will be decisive for our future. For the sake of our family and children, I want to do everything I can to save this marriage. I love her and I love my children. I want them to be raised by healthy, happy (and married!) parents. I feel that I failed every shit test until now. I have to learn to pass them, set boundaries and become alpha.*”
- You are still very Blue Pill. Your idealization if the nuclear family “surviving it all”, “through thick or thin” is holding you back. Your lack of action and indecisiveness is holding you back. Remove the idea of family. What do you want? You’re obviously here for a reason. This is probably the best place you could be, but you have to figure that out for yourself. In the highly unlikely chance that you stick around, read the sidebar, lift, develop frame and mental point of origin, internalize this content, try, fail, overcome, it will STILL take you years. Now what if I told you, that You will probably never find a better place to change your lot in life? Would you still be willing to stick around, put in the time and learn? Doesn’t matter to me. How bad do you want it? STFU, lift, sidebar. That’s all I can say.",1588291434

For the rest of that, I meant stolen valor as an analogy, not a one-to-one comparison. While yes, there are times it is considered ok to wear a fake uniform, that isn't a part that really transitions well to cultural appropriation because of the one big difference between cultures and military service, that being oppression and racism. Most of the time when cultural appropriation is claimed it is due to inaccurate representation, typically in a stereotypical way. A person might wear something religiously significant to a given culture, for example, despite not being ""worthy"" of wearing it, or wearing it incorrectly. This would of course make a lot of people upset about it. A way to think about that would be how a catholic might be offended by the portrayal of a nun in a pornographic film. And advertising is also a big issue in cultural appropriation. I couldn't care less about a young girl wanting to have a ""Japanese"" tea ceremony, and while I hope that their parent would do everything they could to make it an educational experience and help the child understand it, when a large corporation tries to advertise providing ""Japanese"" tea ceremonies, but only go through the motions without actually trying to understand the meaning behind certain things, I take issue with that.",1588291434

&gt; The costs of maintaining the sanctuary outweigh the profits, and so, to make up for lost money, park officials have been legally selling young elephants to China and numerous other countries.

&gt; Chrispen Chikadaya, a senior inspector with the Zimbabwe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that when he originally examined the elephants in 2018, park officials said that they would be moved out within a month, but they remained there for almost one whole year.

&gt; Lingering rumors of elephants left behind in the boma compound, although denied by park officers, propelled ZNSPCA to initiate a court debate.

Then WHO has made it a point to say there is no proof that exposure and immune response produces long term immunity. Add that the disease is causing long term lung, liver, kidney and heart damage.

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","#### Hello **Highway-Jesus**,

Welcome to r/HomeworkHelp! It seems like you have not attempted to structure your post title to classify your question's level and discipline/topic enclosed with **square brackets** as a title prefix.

**e.g.** **[AS Level Physics: Light]** Learning ASL is hard over distance learning, could someone help translate at least a few of these sentences?

###Positive Examples

|Examples|**square brackets** is being used at prefix (must) + topic (optional) + clear question|
|:-|:-|
|includes syllabus|\**[GCE 'O' Level Calculus: Differentiation\]** How to differentiate e?|
||**\[AP English: Essay Writing\]** Should all adverts be factual?|
|includes grade|**\[Grade 8 Algebra: Complete the square\]** How to factorise ax^(2)\+bx+c?|
||**\[University Chemistry: Titration\]** What is my qs?|

###Bad Examples

|Examples|*It still works, but strongly discouraged*|
|:-|:-|
|Grade/level is not specific enough|**\[High School Math\]** What is my qs?|
|What is your question?|\[Grade 8 Algebra\] **Helpppp!**|
|Do not attempt to circumvent square brackets requirement. Classify your question with square brackets|**\[Q\]** What is my question?|

**There is no fixed list of standardised grades, disciplines or topics.** As long as you have tried your best to structure your post title to keep things organised in the following format: ***[&lt;Level/Syllabus&gt;: &lt;Discipline&gt;and/or&lt;Topic&gt;] Question?***, you are safe!

Please delete this post and I am excited to receive your question again with everything well formulated and in compliance with our subreddit rules, Reddit rules and its T&amp;C.

"SeattleWA","t5_2vbli","&gt;Because the alternative was MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DIE. 

Most of the credible projections for the U.S. were nowhere near that high. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We didn't have time to make a formal exit plan with data driven exit criterion because not acting KILLS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE.

Most states had more than a month to figure out criteria. Many businesses saw it coming a mile a way due to interactions with China. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;What are currently forced business closures would have been market-induced business closures otherwise. 

No, the market clearly wants significantly more business activity than is currently present. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The forced closures enabled rent relief and business loan laws to come in and help, instead of a market-induced free fall.

Rent relief and business loans can be administered independent of a forced lockdown. We've had bailouts and types of assistance in other circumstances before. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;That is a drastic misreading of the linked article. In less developed countries with less stable food supply networks, restrictions have a major impact on those networks. 

Yes, I know. We're putting millions of people at risk - FAR more than will realistically die from COVID - so we can do this. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The truth is, that whatever economic impact you're ascribing to the stay at home orders would have happened or happened to a worse extent without those orders.

That's where you're wrong. Many businesses can function - and were functioning - under social distancing. Our unemployment didn't spike dramatically until these lockdowns were enacted. We also do not have any evidence of COVID infections anywhere in the world that are so detrimental as to cripple and economy like we are doing now by choice.",1588291436

&gt; Even so, it is reasonable to consider a 27-year reporting delay when assessing the believability of any criminal allegation. More significant perhaps, is Reade’s decision to sit down with a newspaper last year and accuse Biden of touching her in a sexual way that made her uncomfortable — but neglect to mention her claim that he forcibly penetrated her with his fingers. 

&gt; As a lawyer and victims’ rights advocate, Reade was better equipped than most to appreciate that dramatic changes in sexual assault allegations severely undercut an accuser’s credibility — especially when the change is from an uncomfortable shoulder touch to vaginal penetration. 

That's not how it happened.  Reade said the inappropriate touching WAS NOT sexual.  She did not say sexual assault did not happen.  She never changed her story on the inappropriate shoulder and neck touching.  She simply opened up about other, more traumatizing events later.

This is absolute bullshit and this guy should be ashamed.  But he is a prosecutor (or was) and prosecutors are a big part of the reason why sexual assault litigation is already so problematic.

His energy is spot on gets 8 hrs a sleep a night (normally only needs 6 or 7 tops)..doesn't rely on caffeine.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got asked to fix something that was working.

I had built a website for another company. They had their own IT people, just nobody capable of building a website (they probably could, just chose not to). Due to how my job worked, we were not allowed to communicate with their team directly, we always had to communicate through our customer service representative (CSR). Our CSRs were wonderful people but shouldn't be left alone in a room with a computer. 

So our CSR gets an email one morning basically saying ""Hey, just a heads up, we had to alter the code a bit to point to an internal server for testing as we didn't want to put anything out in the wild yet."" Cool, no big deal, communication is good. I immediately get a follow-up email from my CSR of ""WHAT DO WE DO?! WE NEED TO HELP THEM. HOW CAN WE FIX THEIR SERVER?!"" I calmly explain that we don't need to do anything, they just said they would do it. Also, it's their server and their IT team, not ours, we can't fuck with it. She calms down. Life returns to normal.

Next day we get an email of ""Hey! Testing went great, we put the website live and you can find it here: www.theirwebsitethisisn'tarealwebsitedon'tclickthis.com. It looks great!"" Again, I get an email from the CSR of ""WHAT HAPPENED? CAN WE FIX IT OR DOES THEIR IT TEAM NEED TO FIX IT? DID WE BREAK IT OR DID THEY?""

Like...fix what? Did you read the email? The website is up. Everything is okay. This isn't an IT problem. It's not even a *problem* period. She ran to my desk in a panic and I had explain to her that the email literally says everything is okay and finished. I showed her the website on my computer. I showed her the website on my phone. ""What do we tell them?""

What do we...what? Are you serious? Congratulations, I guess?

""So everything is okay?""

*****
&gt; The costs of maintaining the sanctuary outweigh the profits, and so, to make up for lost money, park officials have been legally selling young elephants to China and numerous other countries.

&gt; Chrispen Chikadaya, a senior inspector with the Zimbabwe National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that when he originally examined the elephants in 2018, park officials said that they would be moved out within a month, but they remained there for almost one whole year.

&gt; Lingering rumors of elephants left behind in the boma compound, although denied by park officers, propelled ZNSPCA to initiate a court debate.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"CityPorn","t5_2scjs","You have a lot of opinion for someone that hasn’t read anything. If you do the reading and research it is obvious to recognize that America is the main issue. I’m literally not kidding America is really the only reason why the global south is a corrupt hell scape... and guess what economic system that allows it? Capitalism. Think about it if you can’t get your cheap clothes made by child labour in Africa. If you can’t get the minerals used to make the same pointless technology for the iPhone with child labour. If you can’t get cheap exploited labour anymore then America economy crashes. Because if you move production to western countries things become more expensive since things have to be done with standards and regulations and you have to pay workers minimum wage. Mind you when things are expensive most Americans wouldn’t want to buy it. How is that sustainable in a long run it’s just not realistic. And I know that communism is the solution because if you look at history whenever a country is looking for sovereignty America destroys their land. These countries always look for sovereignty through the attempts of socialism or communism. However their country is always destabilized by America. America destabilized these countries with the use of sanctions and government backed coup. Then they blame the effects of the problems they caused on these radical socialism/communism. For instance when the ussr collapsed North Korea access to food from the ussr was gone. This created a famine so America made it worse by sanctioning the country. They couldn’t get things like oil so that they can put it in tractor to make farming easier. This is how evil America is. They genuinely wanted to starve a whole population to death. If you want to see a perfect example of communism look up Thomas Sankara. He liberated his country from the effects of colonialism. Women had more rights under him. Literacy rates improved and people standards of living got better. Then he got assassinated by the west...Then a western backed corrupt dictatorship was installed. See think about the economic of capitalism logically again if these people in the global south ever win their fight for liberation then it’s over for America. The fact that this happens is cause of capitalism. Communism works economically we just haven’t seen it work to its glory because of America constant aggression. If communism was so bad then America would leave these countries alone and let them fail. I mean that would make sense economically because then America can go into the country and fix the mistakes of communism and that would create more jobs for its citizens. But nooooooo America has to bomb and destabilize these countries. We saw that with the Vietnam and Korean War. These people still face trauma because of America. The fact that Vietnam, North Korea, and Cuba are still standing today despite America sanctions shows how through strength.

I can save you trouble of investigation. Here's the solution,  establish a democracy where people own means of production with objective being production for people's needs &amp; social justice. But rulers won't do that so we will have to defeat them if we want to live.",1588291439

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt; To gear for arena you will get entry level gear from BGs.

And then the problem with this is that once you have your full honor set you can no longer advance without a miserable grind of getting curb stomped by players with better gear.

&gt;This is the system PVE has been doing forever now and don't see why having a hearing path like this for PVP wouldn't work

Because dungeon bosses don't change every time you enter an instance, they're always the same. If you have a full heroic set there is no reason other than personal skill that is stopping you from beating a Mythic boss. You cannot compare that to PvP where every game your opponents skill and stats are different. Congrats you grinded bg's for 2 weeks and you have a full honor gear, now go queue into double blood dk's with their BiS conquest gear and see how worth it that grind was.

&gt; hell it worked up until legion shit show IMHO.

No it didn't, people have been complaining about PvE gear in PvP since BC. The 500-1600 bracket in MoP was 50% high rated well geared players selling wins because it was that hard for a fresh character to compete. 

Players join at the tail end of a season when even the worst players have a full set of conq gear and now they're grinding and losing against back peddling noobs because they're dependent on gear.

Legion was objectively the most balanced PvP has ever been and the only problem was people weren't able to pick their stat weights.",1588291440

"DaveChappelle","t5_2s6t8","Maaaaan I'll tell you... I love the sentiment of this post and the enthousiasme with which you 'defend' Dave and Chappelle show (CC)! 

I've been wondering the same ever since it became clear he was 'tight' with Netflix (meaning all his specials since have been on there, knowing his history, this would mean at the very least they accommodate to his wishes financially and probably also creativity) with all this in mind, if they keep up this score of reliability as a business partner to him and steer away from corporate bullshit when dealing with him, I see a future where he could be confortable doing a show there 

and if Netflix knew what's good for them they would jump at the possibility.. maaan.. if only I worked as an advisor at Netflix, I would make it my mission.. 

because I feel, contrary to what others commented on this thread, he does still have skits and sketches he wants to do, and obviously humor and insight to spare... I extrapolate this from a four hour set he did (is on YouTube) where he jokingly laments this very thing. ''if only I still had a sketchcomedy show, pfffffff, if I had a sketchcomedy show I'd make the most hilarious apocalypto sketch...'' 

I can see where others are coming from, where they say (1)a show is hard, he's older now...  but so it stand-up, hard af actually, he's not doing that because it's easy. (2)He likely wants to spend time with his family, which if the case is his right and I applaud that, but time on the road and on tour takes him out of the house for a possibly more extended period of time as well... (3) he's not the same, so a new show might fail or not be relevant as CC was... but that's true of every artistic endeavor. Sure CC set a standard and expectation, but again so is standup. A accomplished and award-winning comedian surely can handle it and even play into/with that idea of ditching Chapelle show the expectations, etc. Also he has the experience of micromanaging two seasons of a show with two people, if we are to believe Netflix's track record they would give him the time and room and even connect him with the right team of he asked making it less hard to succeed.  Regarding his comedy changing, actually I don't believe he's artistically bankrupt, his work is different but that's to be expected, only hacks stay stagnant and avoid risks... Sure tastes change but one thing you can't really argue is him being irrelevant. He always had and has an angle, and in these pc and overall weird times where everyone is on edge, where every topic can be a basis for division and social exclusion. A qualitative self-aware intellectually challenging comedy show would fit right in place. Also given how long it's been since CC, the odds Dave is  busting at the seams to address certain things  must be at an all time high. His societal awareness is already so much more palpable in his standup, i think and am hopeful it's only a matter of time. And if Netflix doesn't fuck it up by crewing him over or trying to play him, he might just win the streaming war for them and maybe even win them some awards.",1588291441

I would take a look at the average view duration on your first one, because I suspect it would be much lower than your normal videos. This means that your subscribers were probably interested in checking out the video, but once they realized it wasnt their cup of tea, they stopped watching and didnt bother to come back for the second one.

That being said, variety of content is important if you want to attract more subscribers, as some people will sub more for your normal content and some people will sub more for your tutorial videos. Some might even sub for both. So, I would post the rest of the series anyways to diversify your subscriber base, but try to mix in some of your normal content to keep your current subscribers engaged.",1588291441

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","&gt; Country I'm in, interns are paid zilch so I'm currently working in a place where there are about 10 interns per paid employee.  

How much is zilch? I'd probably hang in there if it's paying enough to cover your bills. Especially nowadays with coronabeeber or whatever...    

&gt; Interns help each other out a lot and I'm used to figuring stuff out on my own, so I am learning, but I feel used.  

I don't know what it's like in your country, but I've been the only youngest person on a team of already established people, and it absolutely sucked...would have killed to be working with people at a similar experience level.  

This whole ""learn from people more experienced"" sounds nice in theory but typically what really happens is the more experienced people give you like 5 minutes and maybe help you set things up and that's it. It's been way more useful when I start with a team of also-new people.  

&gt; I'm also mostly doing front end stuff which I am sure I like less than back end. I started looking for work but my CV looks like a front end web dev now and I don't want that.  

You say this having done backend before...right? I ask because I'm a backend dev who wished he had stayed in front end, lol. Ah well.  

&gt; I don't know whether I should stay for the 2 months I've got left, so at least that bridge isn't burnt, or leave and take the time to build some github backend projects and hunt for work.  

Let's be honest for a second - in the US you they verify if you worked somewhere before and how long. But they can't verify what you did while you're there. You can put whatever you want on your resume about what you did there while you were there. If you have nothing to do, spend some of your time at work doing more backend coding, same stuff you'd do at home, then if you really don't like front end you can always leave the front end stuff off your resume.",1588291441

Throwaway because this post talks about my family and I don’t want these details on my other account. 

So I divorced my ex 5 years ago. It was a bad marriage and I was unhappy for a long time before that. I have full custody of our kids, one boy (14) and one girl (16). 

After I divorced I made sure to raise my kids right without the bad influence of their dad around. My daughter has always been very sensible and practical, always helpful around the house. But my son is another story. He was his dad’s “favorite” and got away with far too much when he was younger. His dad always enabled his tantrums when he didn’t get the toys or games he wanted. 

Anyways in before his dad and I split I realized I could see more and more of my ex in my son. He could be really lazy, unaccountable, and incredibly dismissive of other people’s kindness. He was also spoiled from years of his father shielding him from all kinds of responsibilities and chores. So a few years ago I decided to instill a chore schedule that seemed unfair at first, but my intention was to teach my son from an early age so he won’t turn out like his dad one day to some poor woman. 

Now he does the dishes every night and will mow the grass and also clean around the house every other day (vacuuming, moping, sweeping). His sister, since she is in high school and has more after school activities, does not have to do dishes or mow the lawn. But she helps me with a lot of administrative tasks like ordering groceries online, keeping track of doctors appointments, and sorting out mail every day. My son does not do these things. 

My son is a much more responsible human after these couple of years. He now knows how to cook and clean and take care of himself. However he is incredibly resentful of the fact that he has to do more “manual labor” than his sister. I tell him it’s because he can’t do the things his sister does and furthermore this is good training for him in the future. I told him his father was a terrible husband because he had very sexist views on parenting and roles and as a result our marriage couldn’t last. I want him to be different and be better and that can’t happen unless he puts in the work first. 

But maybe it’s because he’s getting older but the anger and rebellious streak is much worse and he has made me cry multiple times with cruel backtalk. AITA for trying to teach my son more responsibility? I am trying to raise my kids according to their individual needs but to them it seems like I am being unfair.

&amp;nbsp;

I've always played Six Sams up until this point, but I'm thinking of getting a new deck, but unsure of what my options are.
I was initially holding what gems I have and wait for a possible Stardust Dragon/Assault Mode to get dropped, but it seems like that will have to wait.

&amp;nbsp;

I had tried investing in a Red-Eyes deck sometime ago, but luck wasn't exactly on my side and I had to open a whole box to even get cards like **Black Metal Dragon** and **The Black Stone of Legend**. Seems like a Red-Eyes deck is not even viable to make it to KoG either.

&amp;nbsp;

So my question is, what possible decks would be possible to obtain for me that I can use to get to KoG? I've got 3400 gems at the moment. Could opening up the new box for the D/D cards be a good investment, they seem like they'd be really good? Or would you recommend going for one of the decks that are on the tier list? Or perhaps something else?",1588291444

"stocks","t5_2qjfk","Overrunning the hospitals will kill people that would have otherwise lived, including people that didn't have Coronavirus. Also, the 95% number is a nice number you pulled out of your ass there. 

Of 34,500 death in the US where the CDC was able to pull the demographic information, 20.5% of the deaths were under the age of 65. Also, 7.9% of the total deaths were under 55. And 2.8% were under the age of 45. 

Also, I'm guessing you probably don't know about large jump in Large Vessel Strokes? Doctors noticed this type of stroke double recently. Normally, for this type of stroke, a ""young"" victim is in their 60's. They were having people in their 30's and 40's coming in for mass strokes. These people didn't die, but the clotting issue could explain the jump in heart attacks and pulmonary embolisms that lead to sudden deaths in otherwise healthy coronavirus victims. Plenty of these people don't die. They might be disabled because of it or suffer other long term damage, but you don't see those numbers in the death rates.

Anyway, I think I've said enough in this exchange with you. Medicine and containment isn't ""crazy magic"" and since you have no clue what you're talking about, and just making shit up on the fly, I can't really believe this exchange can continue in any sort of good faith.
